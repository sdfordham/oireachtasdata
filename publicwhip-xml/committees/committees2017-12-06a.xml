    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#O00100"><p>I welcome members and those watching the proceedings on the Oireachtas television channel.  Before we commence, I would like to read a letter I received this morning from the Danish ambassador on the comment made a number of times during meetings of the committee that the policy of the Danish Government is to eradicate Down's syndrome.  The letter, dated 6 December 2017, states:</p><blockquote>Dear Senator Noone,<br /><br />I write to as chairperson on the Joint Committee on Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  It has come to our attention that statements have been made during the meetings about Denmark's policy and practice on abortion, which are not correct.  I would therefore like to draw you and your committee's attention to the following points.<br /><br />The Embassy has been in contact with the Danish health authorities.  Let me summarize our views in the following points.<br /><br /><b>1. The right to abortion in Denmark</b><br /><br />According to S 92 of the Health Act, a woman may have her pregnancy interrupted without permission, if the procedure can be implemented before the end of the 12th pregnancy week. <br /><br />In cases where the woman is beyond the 12th pregnancy week, she may under certain conditions have an abortion, cf. S 94 of the Health Act. <br /><br />In any case it is important that the women who want an abortion be provided the necessary advice and help so that they have a good basis for deciding if they really want to have their pregnancy interrupted.<br /><br /><b>2. Abortion due to the finding of Down&rsquo;s syndrome (trisomy 21) at the fetus</b>.<br /><br />According to S 94, subsection 1, No. 3, of the Health Act it is possible to have an abortion after the 12th week if there is a danger that the child will have a serious physical or mental disorder, due to hereditary systems or damage or disease in the fetal condition including Down's syndrome.<br /><br />The need to obtain permission after the 12th week is based on the fact that a number of studies have shown that Down's syndrome and other malformations can only be determined when the woman is close to her 12th pregnancy week.<br /><br />There are no limits as such in the legislation when an abortion may be authonzed.  However it follows from S 94 (3) of the Health Act that if the fetus is considered to be viable, abortion can only be allowed if there is a significant danger to the child's physical or mental suffering.  In practice, the limit of viability is considered to be about 22 weeks.<br /><br />As there must be special circumstances for having an abortion, if the fetus is viable, the existence of Down's syndrome in the child is not sufficient to get the abortion.</blockquote> <p>Point No. 3 is a table of data which I can make available.  These data can also be found on a website, the link to which we will make available on our website.</p><p>The letter continues:</p><blockquote><b>4</b>. In 2016, there were 4 children born in Denmark with Down's syndrome after prenatal diagnosis and there were 20 children born with Down's syndrome diagnosed after birth.<br /><br /><b>5</b>. In general it should be noted that it is not the policy of the Danish health authorities to eradicate Down's syndrome, but it is their duty to provide the pregnant woman with the best possible basis for her to make her own decision about her pregnancy.<br /><br />Best wishes<br /><br />Carsten Sondergaard,<br /><br />ambassador</blockquote> <p>Following on from the legal advice we heard earlier and previously, we have completed our consultations with experts.  Today we commence the decision-making process on our recommendations for inclusion in our report which we intend to present to the Oireachtas on 20 December, the final day of the three-month deadline imposed on the committee by the Houses of the Oireachtas for the publication of its final report.  It will then be a matter for the Houses to consider the committee's report and decide how best to facilitate a vote of the people.  As I said, today there will be an opportunity for each member to express his or her views which will feed into next week's meeting, in which we hope to focus on the decisions that need to be made.  With the agreement of the committee, I suggest members confine their comments to ten minutes.  While I accept that some will need more time than others, it is important that everybody gets the time he or she needs to make his or her views known.  I will call members in the order in which they indicated, commencing with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#O00200"><p>I congratulate the Chairman on the great job she has done in chairing the committee.  It has not been an easy job.  It is important also to thank all of the experts and others who have presented to the committee.  Their strength and integrity took us all by surprise.  Most of us came here thinking we had heard and knew it all, but we now know a great deal more following the honest testimonies of all of our delegates.  Their testimonies are to be commended, despite the fact that they were met with a certain amount of hostility.</p> <p>  Although I have been a rights activist for women's liberation and equality practically all of my adult life, I have been struck by the fact that when it comes to equality and access to it in this country, we are playing catch-up.  The time has come for us to recognise that the fundamental rights of women over their fertility are necessary to enable them to have rights to everything else.  If one cannot control one's own bodily functions - for women they include reproduction - one is being denied one's basic fundamental human rights.  </p> <p>  Women and men need appropriate sex education from an early age.  We heard from the experts in the Department of Education and Skills that a set of educational tools were provided for children at an early age but that often these tools were trumped by the ethos of the institutions that ran schools.</p><p>That, in this country, means 94% of national schools are run by the Catholic Church and the ideas of the Catholic Church trump the idea of full access to proper health education.  That means that if the Catholic Church does not approve of the pill, of condoms, of coils or of caps, then children will not learn about the use of these things at an early age.  If sex itself is not seen as something to be celebrated, enjoyed and absolutely part of the lives of human beings - and is not acceptable in the Church to be seen as that but rather as just to produce the next generation - then it will be challenging for people to receive a proper sex education in this country.  After that, when women do seek contraception, affordability is often a problem.  More and more workers are part time or in precarious work and most of these are women faced with low pay and issues such as the exorbitant cost of accommodation who, on top of this are then obliged to pay quite a lot of money just for contraception.  They pay &euro;25 a week at a minimum for the pill and when all things are taken into account, such as regular doctors' visits etc., one is probably looking at &euro;150 to &euro;200 every six months on top of everything else they have to meet.  The questions of access to sex education when one is young and contraception when one is sexual active must be considered in the context of this entire discussion about the reproductive rights of women and where that is situated in the Constitution.<br/><br/>Personally, although I do not want to personalise this, when I was a young woman I found myself pregnant when contraception failed me.  I only knew that was the case after I felt sick every morning and missed periods.  When I discovered that I was pregnant and did not in the least bit want to be, the only option for me was to go to England.  This was shortly after the eighth amendment was inserted into the Constitution and I was lucky that I had a lot of friends, and my sisters, who had fought in that referendum and who fully supported the decision that I made and the choice that I took, and therefore, morally, financially and every which way, helped me.<br/><br/>I also know that there have been countless women in this country who have faced crisis pregnancies.  Crisis pregnancy does not mean unplanned; it means unwanted.  These women have not been able or, as I was, as lucky to have that support, to have access to finances, to be able to take a few days off work and to have the back-up of family and friends and partner to do so.  Countless women have gone through that lack of access and that lack of solidarity.  The notion of shame and an inability to discuss it and be open about it has dominated women's lives, throughout the past decades and probably further back.<br/><br/>We should recognise that Ireland has fundamentally changed.  I appeal to members of the committee who have been on the receiving end of total opposition to what we are trying to do here.  It is regrettable that they cannot face up to that.  There is a whole new generation, in particular, young Irish men and women, who simply will not accept the old order.  They are saying, &quot;It is my body.  You are not the boss of me.  I want to control my own body.&quot;  That is what is pushing this initiative, the Citizens' Assembly and this committee forward.  On top of that, they are also influencing the other generation, which did feel the fear and shame that surrounded them all their lives, as well as the lack of access.  This is shown to us by the vibrant demonstrations, and opinion polls and the openness with which we can have this conversation at last and with which we can consider all the issues that surround it.<br/><br/>I thank the Citizens' Assembly for doing a great job.  I opposed the idea of it because many see the apparatus of the Citizens' Assembly and this committee as being a delaying tactic.  In that context, I have just watched a video from the young men and women who are involved in Strike for Repeal in which they asked the committee to please move on and hurry up, as they need their rights and a referendum on repeal of the eighth amendment, which is exactly my sentiment.  Nevertheless, the citizens randomly chosen by RED C did a great job in reflecting this new Ireland, the desire for change and the desire for equality among women.<br/><br/>We have to vote next week on all of these outcomes.  Clearly, as somebody who would advocate for free safe legal abortion in this country, I will be voting for repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  I will be voting to back all of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and probably will put in an amendment to a number of them.  We should also strongly consider making a recommendation to the D&aacute;il or the Oireachtas on the question of criminalisation.  It is bad enough to have to put up with the stigma, the shame and the lack of access, particularly if one is a migrant, is living in direct provision, is poor or, as I described earlier, is living as does much of the population, on low pay.  It is bad enough having to put up with that but it is shocking to be criminalised for the idea that one might go online and try to access an abortion pill or that on one's return from having had a termination in Britain or Holland or somewhere, that one might feel that one must hide it and feel ashamed of it.  If for no other reason, the fact that I have spoken out as a Deputy and a public representative has helped a lot of young women and others to be able to feel they do not have to feel ashamed or stigmatised or quiet about this anymore.  A lot of the staff in the Oireachtas have approached me and thanked me for it because that has also meant that we can discard that.<br/><br/>On the wording of the referendum, I believe in a simple choice being put to the population.  People are not stupid.  They can make up their own minds.  I am sure we will have quite a debate about it.  Quite simply, we have to ask people a yes or no question, namely, whether they want to repeal the eighth amendment or in other terms, whether they want to remove Article 40.3.3&deg; from the Constitution.  Anything else would do a disservice to the women and people of this country, who are intelligent enough to know when the waters are being muddied or anybody is attempting to hoodwink them.<br/><br/>I believe Irish women have waited long enough and this issue has been kicked down the road.  I do not want to see the alphabet soup of X, Y, A, B and C, PP or the late Ms Savita Halappanavar ever happen again and I am absolutely certain I speak for the majority of people in this country when I say that.  I cannot be absolutely certain that we will achieve a repeal of the eighth amendment but we could make a good start here in this committee by making that honest recommendation to the population and by looking seriously next week at how we vote on the outstanding recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.<br/><br/>I would say to everybody out there, and particularly everybody on this committee, let us please catch up with the people of this country, particularly the young, who have voted for equality in marriage, who want to have full bodily autonomy and who want to take a path for freedom and equality for mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann that is long overdue.  I hope we get a good result next week when we vote and then make our report to the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>Finally, we need an early referendum.  It has to be in May.  Young people have been driving the demand for access to abortion and they will be around in May.  They will not necessarily be around in June and July.  They are already signing up to be registered to be able to vote and we have to give them that access.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#P00200"><p>I echo what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said regarding her gratitude to the Chairman and the wealth of experts who have appeared before the committee.</p> <p>  I also acknowledge two Members of my own group, Senators Higgins and Kelleher, who I suppose moved out of the way for me to be able to be here today.  They felt as passionate and have worked for a lot longer on the issue than have I, and I am grateful that I was able to be part of this process.</p> <p>  When I sat down to think about what I would say today, I decided to prepare a summary of the evidence so far and what I have taken from that to illustrate my intentions.  I will read directly from that script so that it is clear.  If I was to speak off the cuff, I would ramble and forget most of it.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly recommendations must set the context of our deliberations in the future.  It is a representative, deliberative body well informed on the issues.  They decided as they did for a reason.  We heard extensive testimony from Ms Justice Laffoy on the make-up, structure and approach taken by the Citizens' Assembly.  We can all agree it was a robustly fair and strong process.</p> <p>  We are, however, the elected body which makes the final decision.  We can accept or reject recommendations but must provide justification for why.</p><p>I came in here with a viewpoint and a position.  I supported the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly in most respects.  I listened to evidence and I challenged some of my views.  To broadly comment on the evidence we have heard, we can say that rigid legislation and excessive detail or lack of flexibility given to doctors is bad practice.  Grounds-based abortion access is bad practice.  It might be politically tempting to legislate only on narrow grounds but it just is not practical. <br/><br/>Our modular approach was important; the constitutional and legislative grounds are separate.  It may have been criticised in some quarters but it was important to vote when we did once all the constitutional evidence was heard. <br/><br/>For the remainder of my contribution, I will split my comments on the recommendations into the separate constitutional and legislative considerations. <br/><br/>In terms of the Constitution, the assembly recommended the full repeal of Article 40.3.3&deg; and its replacement with a constitutional provision authorising the Oireachtas to legislate in this area.  Based on the transcripts provided to us of the assembly proceedings and during our engagement with Ms Justice Laffoy, it was clear that the citizens wished for the entire article to be removed and, for the avoidance of doubt, that a replacement provision be made to ensure that the Oireachtas was able to legislate with legal certainty in this area. <br/><br/>The need for Article 40.3.3&deg; to be repealed or deleted was a consistent theme of the evidence we heard across the constitutional, legal and medical fields with Dr. Rhona Mahony, Professor Arulkumaran, Ms Mary O'Toole, senior counsel, Ms Leah Hoctor, Dr. David Kenny, Professor Veronica O'Keane, Professor Fiona de Londras and Dr. Peter Boylan all agreeing that the article needed to be removed in its entirety.  For me, based on the evidence we heard, the argument for repeal has been made convincingly. <br/><br/>In terms of the replacement constitutional provision and the associated issue of legal certainty, I believe we can accept the clear expressed intentions of the assembly rather than the exact detail of its constitutional recommendations.  We heard consistent evidence that medical practitioners need flexibility and space to manoeuvre in order to provide best-practice abortion services. <br/><br/>Affording flexibility to medical practitioners stands in direct tension with the issue of providing legal certainty.  As a result, the committee must make a judgment between the two and my position would be that ensuring doctors are not operating under the chilling effect of heavy criminalisation is more important than ensuring legislation is impervious to judicial review.  I am also uncomfortable with the idea that abortion legislation would be immune from challenge in the courts, even in the case that the Oireachtas passes legislation that I would personally support.  The separation of powers is a key underpinning of our democracy and we interfere with it at our peril.  As a result, I believe we should take the intention expressed by the assembly and translate it into a constitutional and legislative arrangement that more comfortably fits into the relationship between our Judiciary and Legislature in its current form. <br/><br/>It also is clear, on reading the transcripts, that a main reason the Citizens' Assembly recommended a replacement provision was due to the heavy focus on the paper of Brian Murray, senior counsel, and his description of the potential legal certainty surrounding the right to life of the unborn following repeal.  I do not think we should insert new text into the Constitution based almost solely on one legal paper.  Considering all of the other legal opinions we have heard on this issue, the risk of high legal uncertainty is not a likely scenario. <br/><br/>I believe we should recommend the repeal of the entirety of Article 40.3.3&deg;, as recommended by the assembly, but instead of replacing it, should shift our focus to making the accompanying legislation as legally robust and as constitutionally sound as possible in order to ensure as much legal certainty as possible while still retaining the possibility of judicial review.<br/><br/>In terms of how that fits into the options presented to us by the committee's legal counsel, my position is that we should recommend option 1.  I would choose that over option 3, which is repeal with legislation published in tandem, only because I believe the latter is a political decision rather than a legislative one. <br/><br/>I believe option 2, which is entrenching legislation in the Constitution, is completely unworkable.  As Deputy Browne has said in previous discussions, when entire legal cases in the courts can hinge on the placement of a comma in legislation, the idea of putting complex legislation into the Constitution permanently cannot be considered as a viable option. <br/><br/>Option 4, which is repeal and replacement on specific grounds must be excluded for the same reason.  It is inflexible, too explicit and is problematic for the same reasons as the eighth amendment.  Constitutions are intended to be general and non-specific to allow for the Oireachtas and the Judiciary to legislate and interpret.  This option precludes that.<br/><br/>In the same vein, option 5, which is repeal and replace on broad grounds or a rebalancing of rights, should also be excluded.  The most significant problem with the eighth amendment is that it creates an artificial balance of rights between the unborn and the woman.  Any attempt to rebalance rights between them with constitutional text would suffer from the same problems and would remove the ability of the courts to decide this balance of rights themselves as they do with all other conflicting constitutional rights. <br/><br/>While option 6 is less problematic than some of the other options, it suffers from the possibility of excluding abortion legislation from judicial review which, as I have already articulated, interferes with the balance of powers and would put abortion law into the same category as law passed in a state of war.  This is inappropriate and a bad precedent to set. <br/><br/>Overall, all the options in terms of constitutional change have strengths and weaknesses but I will be supporting option 1, the repeal <i>simplicter </i>with no replacement for Article 40.3.3&deg; in the Constitution and I call on other members to support this option.<br/><br/>Moving to the legislative considerations, we have been given 13 recommendations from the assembly in which termination of pregnancy should be legal.  They are, without restriction as to reason up until 12 weeks, where there is a risk to life or health, physical or mental, where pregnancy is a result of rape, where there is a fatal foetal abnormality and on socioeconomic grounds. <br/><br/>As a starting point, it should be made clear that if this committee strays from those recommendations, whether it is to reject the socioeconomic grounds, move to shorter gestational limits or reject on request altogether, this will not stop abortions on these grounds.  Abortions in these circumstances will still happen because we will continue to export our human rights obligations to the women of this country to our nearest neighbours.  What it will do, if we reject these grounds, to quote Emily Logan in her evidence in this committee, is perpetuate &quot;a two-tier system whereby women who cannot afford to travel are put in a situation where their autonomy is diminished and their ability to make their own decisions about their own health care has been limited by the State.&quot;  I ask all committee members to think long and hard about that when we vote next week.  Moreover, we cannot control the availability of the abortion pill.  All we can control is whether women take it legally and safely or alone without medical support. <br/><br/>On the recommendations themselves, based on the evidence we have heard on these grounds, it is clear that only legislating on narrow grounds does not work.  It is not practical and any attempt to legislate narrowly drastically reduces access and means we cannot provide best-practice care for women. <br/><br/>We have heard continually from medical practitioners that words such as real and substantial risk; serious risk; and severe, lethal and fatal abnormalities are legislative terms.  They are impossible terms to operate under in medical practice.  Decisions relating to terminations must be made privately between women and their doctors and not by legislators. <br/><br/>I believe most of us would agree that terminations of pregnancy resulting from rape are an absolute necessity as a ground for abortion access.  We heard from three experts who appeared before the committee, Mr. Tom O'Malley, Ms Noeline Blackwell and Dr. Maeve Eogan, who all agreed that such a ground is legally and practically unworkable.  As soon as a verification process is introduced for whether rape has taken place, insurmountable barriers are instantly placed for rape victims to access abortion. <br/><br/>The only way to allow for access to abortion in certain exceptional circumstances is to allow for abortion on request, within reasonable gestational limits, because if all women are able to access abortion, this includes women who have experienced rape or a foetal anomaly without the State performing invasive verification or depriving them of their right to privacy.  If members present decide to recommend that abortion should be made legal in certain circumstances or only have a mandate to go so far, the only way to absolutely ensure access in these certain circumstances is to expand on-request access.  If we do not expand abortion access to include all the grounds recommended by the assembly, poor, marginalised and minority women will pay the price.<br/><br/>This is a momentous decision with which we are tasked.  It is an historic moment.  I hope that throughout the voting and obviously moving towards a referendum campaign, we can replicate the solidarity that has come to light in this committee, especially across the women and men.  Obviously I hope we can pass a referendum.  We have set a good basis in this committee and I believe we send a strong message to the D&aacute;il and the people that it is time to take women's health out of the Constitution.</p></speech>

I want to record my shock and sadness at the fact that 125 babies lost their lives because they were diagnosed with this condition.  There is no doubt that babies with Down's syndrome are at increased risk if we repeal the eighth amendment.  I note also that the British Pregnancy Advisory Service's representative forwarded her organisation's guide to termination in the case of foetal abnormality.  This is a document which is designed to explain to women what they can expect during and after an abortion procedure.  I am very concerned that some of the serious side effects of abortions have not been fully discussed at this committee.</p> <p>  For example, the guide states that during an abortion carried out at up to 12 weeks, the following are significant, unavoidable or frequently occurring risks, which the guide states may have serious long-term health effects: psychological problems; continuing pregnancy, in other words, a botched abortion whereby the woman remains pregnant afterwards; perforation of the uterus; haemorrhaging; very heavy bleeding; injuries to bowels, bladder or serious injuries to the cervix; and death in some cases.  The guide also mentions extra procedures that may be needed after the abortion, including a repeat abortion in cases where the first attempt was not successful; blood transfusions; and repair of damage to organs or haemorrhaging.</p> <p>  The role of this committee is to carry out a thorough investigation on abortion, and then to advise on how best to proceed in the best interests of women's health and safety.  What I have read out are side effects of abortions which are listed in the British Pregnancy Advisory Service's literature.  They are very serious side effects, which are described as unavoidable.  They did not get a proper airing when the British Pregnancy Advisory Service representative was before us.  I am not trying to impugn her testimony in any way, but I am very concerned at the risk to women's health from abortions, which has been totally brushed under the carpet.  I have not, and will not, make false claims.  I am simply stating facts to which many of those looking for repeal turn a blind eye, and do everything to avoid talking about.  This is a scandal which we should not stand over.  I joined this committee because I want to see families and babies being given the best support in this country.  During these committee hearings, I have listened in good faith to testimonies that were given by each of the speakers, but I have to say that I am very disappointed with the way the way this issue has been dealt with.</p> <p>  We know that women face unplanned pregnancy in Ireland, but we have not addressed any real way to provide life-saving alternatives to abortion.  This was not done at the Citizens' Assembly and it did not happen at this committee either.  I tried to raise the issue of adoption in the course of discussion, only to have that suggestion shut down.  We all know people who are adopted and of the happiness they have brought to their families.  We should be working in this committee to improve the adoption process in Ireland, and this was completely ignored in favour of focusing entirely on abortion.</p> <p>  I am also concerned about some of the groups invited to this committee, which were described as impartial experts.  When their attendance was announced, I decided to hear them out in good faith, but it became very evident on further inspection that they were only prepared to offer one side of the argument.  To give just one example, it became clear in the course of the hearing that the Centre for Reproductive Rights is running a fundraising campaign abroad to repeal the eighth amendment in Ireland.  It should not have been invited as impartial expert.  After all the talk of inviting pro-life groups, it turned out that only five pro-life groups were invited, compared to 27 or 28 pro-repeal groups.  That is why we are making a decision on abortion without any information on serious consequences of abortion, which are being ignored for political reasons.  It is also why we have not heard about all the lives saved by the eighth amendment.  Liz McDermott was here two weeks ago, but it was not to talk about her personal experience, it was to talk about the lives saved by the eighth amendment.  They have been completely ignored.</p> <p>  Since this committee started, I have become aware of many people who, and organisations which, are able to speak about the life-saving effects of the eighth amendment, but they are not prepared to come before the committee since it already voted not to retain the eighth amendment in full.  I understand this because as they see it, the committee has already made its decision.  If we are not going to retain the eighth amendment in full, then we will have to have a referendum, so in reality the vote we have taken means that there is no going back for this committee.</p> <p>  I feel the vote we took has prevented us from doing our work properly.  It meant that when it became clear that more pro-life speakers were needed, they did not see any point in coming in because the vote had already been taken.  I want to live in a country where women and their babies are protected and cared for.  I want babies with Down's syndrome and other disabilities to receive the same legal protection as everybody else in this room.  Families who find out that babies may not have long to live should be supported and encouraged to spend as long as possible with them, with the highest standard of prenatal hospital care.  </p> <p>  Ireland, with the eighth amendment, provides this kind of protection and care.  Women in this country already receive whatever treatment they need while pregnant.  The difference is that doctors in Ireland do their best to protect and safeguard the unborn baby too.  If we repeal the eighth amendment and introduce abortion, we will be creating an Ireland of second-class citizens, where some babies are given the right to life and some are not.  This will be completely opposite to the modern, inclusive and equal society that we all want to live in.  Discriminating against babies in the womb, and endangering their mothers in an abortion procedure, is not something I can support.</p> <p>  I want to conclude by registering my disappointment at the way this committee has conducted its business on such an issue of vital importance to the country and its people.  Thank you.</p></speech>

I will briefly respond to Deputy Fitzpatrick's point about balance.  I know we have said this before but as I am the next speaker it is important that I say it again.  It is regrettable that people declined our invitation.  We did not have any control over that.  However, if the Deputy is suggesting that the Irish College of General Practitioners, the masters of our maternity hospitals or the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission are advocates of abortion, I completely reject that.  They appeared as representatives of bodies and they give their views.  We need to knock that on the head again because I believe this committee has done its business fairly.  Its membership was drawn on a proportionate basis from representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas, and I think that we have done our job with diligence.  I am pleased that we are coming to this point today.</p><p>I also am pleased that we heard evidence from the Department of Health last week that it is already working on drafting the possible legislation that might accompany a referendum.  We are face a very tight timeframe and it is important that work is ongoing because we need to meet the various deadlines if there is to be a referendum in May of next year.  I urge the Government to set a date as soon as possible.  I believe that we will be able to make our report on the 20 December, as we have been asked to do.</p><p>I will speak first of all about module one and about the Constitution.  I think this is by far the most important element of our work.  The most important thing for us to do is to make a recommendation around a referendum on removing Article 40.3.3 from the Constitution.  I believe that question should be put to the people in a clear way, and that it should simply propose that we repeal Article 40.3.3.  Any replacement wording would perpetuate the ambiguity that has prevailed since 1983, whereby we have had subsequent referendums, court challenges domestically and in the European Union and appeals to the UN Human Rights Committee.  Furthermore, as more than one witness has described, we have had real practical difficulties for the medical profession in making crucial decisions about when it can legally intervene if a pregnant woman's health rapidly deteriorates.  We have had descriptions of how that can happen very quickly, and of the difficulty for doctors to practice medicine in a way that treats their patients appropriately with the current constitutional position.</p><p>For all those reasons I will be voting for repeal <i>simpliciter.</i>My preferred second option would be option three, that is, that legislation would be published in tandem with the proposed wording of a referendum, which would be to repeal Article 40.3.3<sup>0</sup>.</p><p>My preferred second option is option 3, that legislation will be published in tandem with the proposed wording of a referendum which would be to repeal Article 40. 3.3<sup>o</sup>.  I do have serious concerns about replacing it.  We have been told there is no legal certainty under any of the options.  I am not a legal expert but I think that is true.  I would be worried about putting the alternative wording the Citizens' Assembly recommended into the Constitution.  Senator Ruane has outlined the background to that and I will not go into it again.<br/><br/>There is a danger in setting that type of precedent where, as far as we know, it is only emergency legislation which provides that the courts cannot get involved.  My preference is for repeal <i>simpliciter</i>to be put to the people.  That kind of wording can be easily explained and it is important in the context of any constitutional referendum that what we ask people to decide on is clear and does not involve any ambiguity.  I hope that whenever the referendum is to be held, we have a debate that is based on facts and is respectful of different viewpoints, regardless of whether we share them.  The committee and the members of the Citizens' Assembly have had the opportunity to give detailed consideration to factual information and I hope that kind of information will be part of the public discourse in the referendum campaign.  Having campaigned in previous referenda on various issues, I know the discourse can go off on tangents.  I sincerely hope that, in this instance, it will remain focused on the facts.<br/><br/>I also believe that we should make a recommendation on decriminalisation.  I suppose we will have to do some work on how that might be worded.  The committee should consider it even though it was not a recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.<br/><br/>On modules 2 and 3, my position is best summed up in a document, Every Woman, produced by the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, which states:</p><blockquote>... we are proposing a needs-based approach including the following elements:- Constitutional change<br /><br />- Protected period<br /><br />- Protected treatments</blockquote><p>The NWCI is a very representative body, with women's organisations throughout the country affiliated to it.  The document to which I refer also states: </p><blockquote>... NWCI advocates for a complete removal of the Eighth Amendment from the Constitution.  Every pregnancy is different, every decision is personal.  The complexity of healthcare decisions has no place in the Constitution.</blockquote><p>It further states:</p><blockquote>We also advocate for legislation that will allow for the availability of abortion in early pregnancy for all women who need it.  During this 'protected period' the ending of pregnancy is permitted under medical supervision and considered a private matter with patient-doctor confidentiality protected.  This would allow for early abortion care on the basis of need, including in the case of rape or incest, and allow medical professionals to care for women and girls in an appropriate medical setting in Ireland.  Limiting this period to early pregnancy will help to minimise the need for later term abortions.<br /><br />Where a wanted pregnancy turns into a crisis pregnancy at a later stage in pregnancy, we advocate for legislation that would allow for restricted access to abortion where it is considered medically necessary to protect the mental and physical health of the woman, and where there is a nonviable pregnancy.  These 'protected treatments' would allow medical professionals to care for women in sometimes extremely difficult and distressing circumstances and support women, couples and families in making the decision that is right for them and their personal circumstances.</blockquote><p>That puts it very well and the language summarises my approach to the issue.<br/><br/>I support all of the ancillary recommendations.  Deputy Niamh Smyth referred to education and I agree with her.  The recommendation about contraception and costs to the effect that an enhanced contraception service should go hand in hand with a less restrictive abortion regime is really important.  Much of the evidence we heard, particularly from Britain, related to the importance of contraception advice, particularly post-abortion.  This was shown to reduce the number of successive abortions - in other words, women having more than one abortion.  It is important that access to contraception is not financially restricted, that it is affordable and money is not an object and that it goes hand in hand with whatever measures are introduced.<br/><br/>The most important action is to remove Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>from the Constitution.  We will not be doing that but we will make recommendations that will go to the Houses.  I presume that this, in turn, will result a proposal being drafted by the Government - in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General - and that the matter will then be put to the people.  Ultimately, it will be a choice for the people but it is important that we make clear recommendations as to how that should proceed.  It will be a decision for the people by way of referendum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#S00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the experts who came before the committee.  It is important to say that experts in the fields of medicine, legal studies and so on volunteered their time.  Many travelled long distances and their testimony was invaluable and overwhelming.  I will not repeat it but will make a few points on where we go from here and what I think our job was.</p><p>We were here not just to validate the decisions of the Citizens' Assembly but to analyse them and consider how we might possibly take them forward.  I agree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that the first step is to study Article 40.3. 3<sup>o</sup>.  That is far and away the most important step.  In order to broaden the provision for abortion in line with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, we need to repeal the eighth amendment.</p><p>Confusion arose in the course of the assembly - a matter that was aired here by Ms. Justice Laffoy and the other legal representatives  regarding the idea of replacing that provision in the Constitution with something else.  The first point to make is that the intentions of the Citizens' Assembly when it explored that avenue were explored here, and the testimony given - this was made clear by Ms Justice Laffoy and others - was to the effect that the assembly wanted more clarity.  By doing that, the assembly thought it was voting for a situation where the Oireachtas would legislate, it would not be in the Constitution, ironically enough, and that there would be no impediment to the Oireachtas legislating.  There was an idea that something might have to be inserted to specify that.  We have teased the matter out with our legal adviser and my view is that it is not necessary.  To give effect to the intention of the Citizens' Assembly, simple repeal is the best option because the Oireachtas already has the power to bring in whatever legislation it sees fit once the barrier of the eighth amendment is removed.  There would be no comparable area where the courts would be removed from that process, and, in essence, what the Citizens' Assembly recommended would be provided for.  My feeling is that the original decision of the Citizens' Assembly to simply repeal is the best way forward.  I will not repeat the points but that is the only way in which we can give a voice to this.</p><p>The Constitution is not the place to regulate medical practice.  We were given evidence on that.  Real life medical practice requires flexibility.  This is a public health matter.  In no other area of medicine do we intrude in the relationship between doctor and patient.  We allow the doctor make the best decision in consultation with the patient.  That is all that is being advocated here.  Such matters being in the Constitution has led to a situation where women's rights and their constitutional status are significantly lessened.  My first concern is that this should not be in the Constitution at all.  The best way of ensuring that is repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  Legislation may be published in tandem because we know it is being prepared.</p><p>I will make some points about what I would like to see in the legislation but it might be a job beyond us.<br/><br/>I know we discussed it earlier in the committee proceedings but there is a problem with putting something into the Constitution given the restrictions in that regard.  Our legal counsel was very clear that to repeal and replace in the Constitution a full piece of legislation would be unprecedented and totally unworkable.  She also was quite clear that to replace it with specific grounds along the lines of the divorce referendum could give rise to problems.  We will have to have another constitutional referendum now to overcome what was voted in at that time.  Specifying anything in the Constitution becomes problematic in that sense.  Either broad or confined grounds in the Constitution give rise to all sorts of complications.  Given that what was being sought by the citizens was legal certainty to broaden the provision of access to abortion in Ireland from all of the evidence I have heard the best way to do that is repeal <i>simpliciter</i>and because of a procedural mechanism, my belief is that we have to take that vote first.  We could not possibly vote on other options as to what might go into the Constitution first because if one voted on one and then one jumped into having nothing that would be completely wrong.  We need to ask first whether we should have something in the Constitution or not and then take the other votes then after that.</p></speech>

Deputy Daly's point is well made and it is a valid point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#T00300"><p>It is a case of how we take it forward.  Many inaccurate points were made during the course of the discussions as well.  Some of them have been made repeatedly and of late.  We should remind ourselves that in 1983 when the amendment was brought in, abortion was already illegal in Ireland and it was put forward as a mechanism which would stop Irish abortions but all it meant was that Irish abortions happened later, more of them were done through surgical procedures and very vulnerable and often sick women were exported from this country in what has been adjudicated as a violation of their human rights.  Figures have emerged of the number of lives that have been saved on the basis that by restricting people's ability to travel, many people are alive today who would not otherwise be here.  We must be very clear.  Figures bandied around about comparative rates of abortion between Ireland and other jurisdictions cannot be validated because we do not know the accurate statistical figures for Irish abortion rates.  What we do know, and the evidence that was given to the committee is that if one wants to reduce the abortion rates, which I would imagine all of us would like to happen, then restrictive legislation is not the way to do it.  The way to do it is to support women's decision making, give access to sex education and contraception and to allow women to have sufficient economic means to care for a child who might have a disability and that they would have a home to bring a child into.  All of those things are the measures that reduce abortion.  The impression is being given that if we change the eighth amendment, there will be marauding gangs of women taking to the streets to claim their right to a late term abortion and that is really insulting to all citizens.  We should not have had to listen to it but no doubt we will listen to a fair amount of it.</p> <p>  We also need to correct the idea that abortion is dangerous.  Deputy Fitzpatrick reiterated the point.  We were given expert medical evidence from the World Health Organization and medical practitioners that abortion is quite a safe practice.  Is it the case that improper procedures have been conducted in the carrying out of some abortions, which have damaged women?  I would say that is probably true, but we know it is also true that our maternity services have damaged women and babies and our solution to that is not to shut down the maternity hospitals, rather it is to regulate them properly and ensure they carry out best practice.  It is the same in relation to the provision of abortion services.  Introducing issues such as adoption is a red herring.  Adoption is legal in Ireland.  There is no impediment to any woman who wants to put a child up for adoption making that decision.  Unless one is going to coerce people into making a decision, there is nothing else we can do about adoption other than provide for it as we do now.  Some of those issues are a little bit complicated.</p> <p>  Decriminalisation is an absolute must.  It came up at every single session.  One of the speakers explained it really well when he said that there are many people on the committee, all over Ireland and all over the world, who have different views on abortion, when life begins and all the rest of it, but where one will get agreement is on the idea that women and doctors should not be penalised or criminalised for making such a decision.  That is a key decision of this committee which I would put upfront because much of what follows after is covered by the chilling effect of that.  We got a lot of evidence in that regard which I will not repeat.  In that context I will refer to how we deal with module two; I know we will deal with it later.</p> <p>  We were asked to address how we deal with the reasons of the Citizens' Assembly.  We were not asked to approve them.  We were asked how we could give them life, if one likes.  In that sense, looking at it point by point is not necessarily the best way to do that because we have so much evidence that said a reasons-based approach would not work and that a better way to look at all of the reasons of the Citizens' Assembly in their entirety is to say the clear majority in all of the categories was that access to abortion should be available without restriction as to reason for early pregnancy and that should be the starting point.  Given that we know most abortions are carried out in early term, if we started with that point we would meet the needs of the overwhelming majority of women who need to access abortion at present.  We would combine that with decriminalisation, which would make the availability of the abortion pill legal.  It would certainly not be criminal anyway and would allow doctors to prescribe it.  To my mind, that would be a proper solution, along with, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said, the National Women's Council for how one would deal with later stage terminations.  We should reiterate the evidence.  We spent a lot of time talking about the tragic cases of rape and fatal foetal abnormalities but they are a tiny number of the women who are accessing abortion in Ireland at the moment and in order for us to really give life to the decisions of the Citizens' Assembly, we need to start the other way around.  Perhaps that is something we need to consider later.</p> <p>  They are the main points I wish to make.  It has been a very good process.  Nobody will probably have the time to go back and look at the testimony but if people out there have the time they could do a lot worse than listen to some of the people we had before the committee who were tremendous.  We owe them a debt of gratitude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#T00400"><p>I thank the Citizens' Assembly and the experts.  We would do them a disservice to start categorising them.  We had people in who were experts in their field.  They would find it odd if they were categorised in the way that some people at this committee have done, which is unfair.  One of the things I have been asked on several occasions is whether I have changed my mind as a consequence of being a member of the committee.  I have not on the constitutional matter.  I voted not to put the amendment into the Constitution in 1983 and I have retained that position.  This is something that should be legislated for.  It should form no part of the Constitution.  For that reason, I favour repeal and not replace, and I think it should be repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.</p><p>It was a very different Ireland in 1983.  Citizens are way ahead on this particular matter and they are not immune to seeing the number of women who are accessing pills online, not within a medical environment, and the number of women who are travelling.  There is a terrific inconsistency with having in the Constitution the right to travel and information and turning a blind eye to the fact that there is criminality attached to abortion on this side of the Irish Sea.</p><p>The Citizens' Assembly has done its work, and I am really surprised by the point that Deputy Fitzpatrick made about what this two-stage process did not do.  Anyone who followed the Citizens' Assembly saw the balance of the interest groups.  We did not repeat the process because we paid attention to it.  I am surprised that he is making that point because it is simply missing much of the work that was done and the large body of testimony delivered.  <br/><br/>The representatives from Terminations for Medical Reasons made the point that the 13th amendment, which refers to the right to travel and information, saved lives in this country, not the eighth amendment.  It is a shameful thing to hear because health care services in other jurisdictions looked after women in very stressful situations.  Women are not disconnected people.  They are wives, mothers, daughters and sisters.  It is not just women who are interested in this issue.  It is a public interest matter and rightly so.  <br/><br/>Dr. Peter Boylan stated the Citizens' Assembly vote: </p><blockquote>clearly recommends that the Oireachtas deal with the question of termination by legislation rather than through the Constitution.  I entirely concur with this conclusion, but I would add that legislation needs to be supported by regulation with regard to clinics and hospitals, and by the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais.</blockquote><p>That is something to which we could usefully point in terms of some of our recommendations.  <br/><br/>On the criminalisation issue, I note that Dr. Rhona Mahony, among others, made the point that at present, women must have a substantial risk of dying before they qualify for termination of pregnancy.  People asked if it was a 10%, 20% or 50% risk of dying.  I would rather have an obstetrician making a decision on medical grounds than having to put a barrister in a position that he or she should not be in.  Dr Mahony went on to state, &quot;Failure to adhere to this is punishable by a 14-year custodial sentence for both the woman and her doctor.&quot;  That is absolutely wrong.  The whole issue of criminalisation has to be dealt with, and I want to see it in the report.  <br/><br/>Members heard from Professor Veronica O'Keane, who told us that pregnancy is associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and that the risk of depression is higher than at any other point in her life.  When she was asked about the cases that she worries about at night she spoke about people being very vulnerable and being barely able to get home after meeting her, never mind being in a position to travel.  It was quite descriptive and is part of the reason we should not separate physical health from mental health.  The evidence was very convincing.  <br/><br/>I do not like the idea that we are looking at the Citizens' Assembly recommendations as a list from which we decide on how we will deal with this issue, as so doing almost eliminates all the testimony members heard.  The testimony we heard was very useful.  Not a day went by in this committee in which we did not learn something that was of real value and that should be incorporated into our thinking in the future.  <br/><br/>We heard from Tom O'Malley on the legal issues.  He told us that it takes 865 days, or two and a half years, to prosecute rape.  At what level is that determined before people are re-victimised?  That is a critical issue in terms of how this is dealt with.  I believe that a gestation period on request is the way to deal with that and avoiding re-vicitimising those who have been raped or in cases of incest.  <br/><br/>The Citizens' Assembly report was very helpful.  An enormous amount of work went into it.  While it offers guidance, I certainly would not favour what was recommended in terms of how the issue should be handled from a constitutional point of view.  A straightforward yes or no question, ultimately decided upon by the citizens of Ireland, is the correct way to go forward.  Certain things were recommended that we could consider, but it is very difficult to see how they could be legislated for.  We have to make some recommendations and do some work in that area.  <br/><br/>The ancillary recommendations are by no means minor.  The contributors from the Netherlands were fascinating.  The Netherlands has low abortion rates.  The holistic approach, in terms of proper education, proper contraception and the reflective times, was very interesting.  Looking at how things work in other countries was certainly instructive and very useful.  <br/><br/>The political consequences of this debate for ourselves should be put aside.  The most important thing is that we do right by the women of Ireland who require health care when they are pregnant.  One of the things that has stuck with me was the discussion about constitutional law with Mary O'Toole senior counsel, who discussed the eighth amendment.  She reiterated the point that the only time that a woman is considered in terms of rights was when her right to life was at risk.  What husband would want that for his wife?  What child would want that for their mother?  What mother would want that for her daughter?  That is how horrific this is.  We must keep this centre stage.  The right to health is a human right.  Professor Binchy, when I made that point to him, acknowledged that the right to health is a human right.  It cannot be a human right which ceases when a woman is pregnant.  <br/><br/>I have not changed my mind on the constitutional issue but I certainly feel I have had a real education on the range of different things we should be considering.  It has been really useful process from that point of view.  I also thank the committee members.  It has been a good committee to work on and I have been on a few of them.</p></speech>

Even if the condition is considered fatal, there is still a decision made on the basis of impairment.  Often it cannot be said if an impairment is fatal.  Experience shows that assessments on impairment conditions are often false.  Even if it is not false, the assessment perpetuates notions of stereotyping disability as incompatible with a good life.</blockquote><p>Although Ireland has not yet ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, while I know it was discussed in Cabinet on Tuesday, the recognition of the UN committee on abortion for so-called fatal foetal abnormalities constitutes unjust discrimination against people with disabilities and is clearly something that should be taken into account when proposals are being made to enshrine such unjust discrimination into law.  That is worth putting on the record.</p><p> As I have said, the Citizens' Assembly is comprised of 99 citizens, headed by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  It voted overwhelmingly to undermine the rights of the unborn child.  From start to finish, the eighth amendment was subject to a process of interrogation which allowed little, if any, scope for the true assessment of its merits to be heard.  Our committee has replicated the process with an appalling level of bias displayed.  Despite unsustainable objections, this is certainly the case and an increasing number of people see that.  If the assembly has its way, unborn human life will now be subject to whims of democratic consensus on what is, in effect, a totalitarian tyranny of the strong over the weak.  Abortion without any restrictions up to 12 weeks is being proposed, going up to 22 weeks without restriction for socioeconomic reasons.</p><p> There is a sense, however, that the scale of the liberalisation of abortion law being sought by this unrepresentative and unelected body has inadvertently revealed its inherent bias and laid bare its ultimate agenda.  Just how unrepresentative it was can be seen from the fact that there was not one representative from 11 of Ireland's 26 counties, including my own.  Can members imagine an equivalent situation in the United States, where Congress establishes a non-judicial citizens' assembly to deliberate on the removal of a fundamental human right and omits everyone from Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana and several other states in that jurisdiction?  That is just to mention a few.  It would be an absurd parody of democracy, yet it is acceptable here.  The Citizens' Assembly was depressingly choreographed and managed with just enough plausible deniability to make one think that what was occurring was an exercise in deliberative democracy.  This added to the illusory sense of transparency.  Forget, however, that the overwhelming volume of written and online submissions made to the Citizens' Assembly calls for the retention of the eighth amendment.  Such inconvenient details muddy the narrative.</p><p> Speaking of muddying the narrative, thanks to the misinformation efforts of abortion advocates over the past few years, one could easily believe that we have a reputation of being a dangerous place in which to be pregnant.  This is despite the fact that most comprehensive reports over the last number of years have made it clear that we have excellent maternal care even in the face of obvious funding and staffing problems as we see in all our hospitals, including our maternity hospitals.  If there is one thing pro-life people are learning, as this debate gathers pace, it is that efforts to liberalise abortion matter more than a balanced assessment of the facts.  We saw this in 2013 when abortion was introduced in defiance of the medical evidence presented at the time with respect to suicidality.  All signals are clear that this process is not and never was about arriving at balanced legislation which protects mothers and babies.  It is about fine-tuning the debate in such a way as to be able to sell the recommendations to a misinformed public with the minimum of political consequences.  Since 2012, over 3,328 abortion pills have been seized in 235 separate illegal importations.  This committee has heard deeply conflicting evidence about their safety yet we are considering legalising that here in the teeth of conflicting evidence.  To push for abortion, the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly have been reduced to a single word on a jumper: "Repeal".  That is insulting to the tens of thousands of people in Ireland who credit the eighth amendment with saving their lives and those of their children.</p><p> I will raise one more issue with regard to the recommendations to introduce abortion for pregnancies of up to 12 weeks.  A delegation from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS, the biggest abortion provider in the UK, attended last week.  Today, its brochure was circulated to us.  That document is absolutely clear that introducing abortion at the so-called early limit of 12 weeks leads to a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother.  The brochure was just circulated to us today.  This included the possibility of serious long-term health effects, psychological problems, the continuation of pregnancy despite the abortion, which BPAS tells us occurs in one in every 1,500 abortion cases.  None of that has made its way into the debate where abortion is consistently presented as an absolutely safe procedure with a minimum of risk.</p><p> I will oppose the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and will work to ensure that the merits of the eighth amendment are upheld.  Today, we saw a statement from the Danish ambassador to Ireland, who said that in 2016, 133 out of 137 babies found before birth to have Down's syndrome were aborted.  That is 97% of all diagnosed cases.  Carsten S&oslash;ndergaard, the Danish ambassador to Ireland, has written to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution to tell it that Denmark does not have an official policy to eradicate Down's syndrome.  Given the rate of abortion, it might as well have such a policy.  The ambassador told the committee, in the letter, that in 2016, four children were born in Denmark with Down's syndrome after perinatal diagnosis and 20 children were born with Down's syndrome who were diagnosed after birth.  He did not tell the committee that while four were born following diagnosis of Down's syndrome, 133 were aborted.  It is a huge omission.  Last year, 157 women in Denmark became pregnant with a baby with Down's syndrome.  As the ambassador points out, 20 were born because no perinatal diagnosis was received and another four were born despite the perinatal diagnosis.  To put it another way, while 97% of the babies found to have Down's syndrome while still in the womb were aborted, 85% were aborted overall, which is still a staggering total.  In 2015, only one baby found to have Down's syndrome while in the womb was born out of the 144 scanned, so 99.3% were aborted.  We know what opening the floodgates of issues like that leads to.  It is interesting that we are now trying to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on one hand while on the other we are doing everything we can to destroy unborn babies with any semblance of disability.</p><p> I have one comment if the Chairman does not mind.</p></speech>

I do not think the committee was conducted fairly or impartially.  Mention has been made of all the people invited.  The list is there.  The vast majority of 28 or 29 people - one can put whatever flavour one likes on them - advocated for abortion.  The number of pro-life people was limited to five in total.  Some were in the second round when the Chairman found that, after the vote, she wanted to get balance.  As well as that, the Chairman has taken part in a committee of which I am a member, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  The Chairman participated in committee D when I was there in Liverpool some months ago, in a debate about abortion, and again last weekend at a committee.  I think it is wholly inappropriate, while meetings are happening here, for the Chairman to attend that other committee and debate abortion in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

It was very clear to everybody, even before we started, that this was not going to be an easy process.  It is not an easy matter to deal with.  I take this opportunity to commend the clerk, the secretariat and all the witnesses who came before us.  It has been a very worthwhile exercise.  We still have much work to do and this ultimately will be a decision of the Irish people.  It will not come from this committee.  There is a narrative beyond this committee that we are drawing up legislation within this committee but it is not our role to do that.  We are to give the Government a clear indication on what to do with the report of the Citizens' Assembly.</p><p>At the outset of this committee's deliberations, we discussed what form of constitutional change would be optimal as outlined in the Citizens' Assembly report.  One of the options was to insert a wording into the Constitution that would allow the Oireachtas to decide what abortion provision was to be provided.  Along with that was another suggestion that the power of the superior courts to intervene and review any subsequent legislation would be curtailed.  This would give the Oireachtas exclusive power in the area with no checks and balances by the courts.  Many members are on the same page in this regard and I have grave reservations about any such suggestion.</p><p>As a general proposition it would be extremely unusual to give exclusive power to the Oireachtas while at the same time removing the power of the courts to review legislation.  Judicial review in Ireland originated in the 1922 Constitution.  Article 65 stated, &quot;The judicial power of the High Court shall extend to the question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.&quot;  We know that was carried to the current Constitution and the reason for such a provision was to move away from the old British rule of parliamentary sovereignty.  In the UK, courts would not review Acts of Parliament as Parliament was supreme.  The principle of judicial review had also come to be recognised by the United States Supreme Court in the famous case of Marbury <i>v</i>. Madison; judicial review was adopted as a move away from the British system to a more republican mode of parliamentary democracy.  I would be very slow to go back to the days when it was believed Parliament could do no wrong.  It would be a bad day for the State and our citizens if we proceeded down that route.  It is important to highlight that, as it was a recommendation that came forward.  Through our discussions and legal advice, which is often complicated and does not always come down on either side, it is important I explain my reasons for not moving forward with that suggestion.</p><p>In regard to decriminalisation, I agree with the proposal that we recommend abortion be decriminalised.  We heard evidence that decriminalising abortion does not lead to abortion becoming more widely available and criminalising it serves no purpose other than to threaten to criminalise women and doctors in circumstances where very personal decisions are being made.</p><p>In discussions of the case of rape and incest, we had excellent witnesses coming before us.  We heard from Mr. Tom O'Malley about the perils of trying to provide some strict criteria around those particular grounds.  It would simply be impossible to await the outcome of a criminal investigation or prosecution.  With the trauma, it often takes women many years to come forward and say they have been raped.  I do not know if such grounds are workable and we must consider such matters when we make our recommendations.</p><p>With regard to ancillary recommendations, I was very much struck by the witness evidence regarding what we should do with respect to sex education, sexuality, relationships, sexual health, contraception awareness, advice and affordable access to contraceptives.  This committee's substantive views are around the area of abortion.  We all agree preventing crisis pregnancies is vital and it is clear our education system is not doing enough in that regard in educating our young people.  It is not just about biology but it also concerns relationship advice, dealing with emotions and a holistic approach to sex education, relationships, etc.  It is a key part of our work on the ancillary recommendations.  Everything comes back to education, and not just for young people.  We have heard it applies right across the board.  It will be a very important element that we deal with next week.</p><p>On repealing the eighth amendment, people need to know there are safeguards.  If people are voting &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to repealing the eighth amendment, it will not be put to the people on its own.  They need to see safeguards in place.  Publication of legislation in tandem with the referendum process is the way to go.  It will be the body of work that we must do next week.</p></speech>

I will also put some matters on the record as well.</p><p>As a member of this committee representing a party with a vote of conscience on the matter, I speak in a personal capacity.  We have full confidence in the workings of the committee and the adjudication by the Chairman.  We could not express views that it was biased.  Many of the groups brought in were professional bodies and they had an opinion recommending changes to the protection of life during pregnancy legislation and the Constitution.  They expressed professional views and we cannot be held responsible for the views they expressed.  They were invited here because of their professionalism.  They came from some of the colleges and professional bodies that oversee gynaecologists, obstetricians, general practitioners, etc., and they all had views on these matters.</p><p>We have had many discussions on the substantive matter of the eighth amendment and what should be done with it.  We were given much legal advice that has been gone through on a number of occasions.  The issue around the eighth amendment must be the issue of repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  To put this in context, doing anything unless we want to retain the amendment would involve repeal.  Obfuscating on that - looking to repeal and replace or amend - would limit our ability to change and legislate afterwards.  A straight repeal of the eighth amendment is the most practical way to go about advancing this issue.  I say this primarily because of the expert legal advice we have received and the opinions we have heard in public session.</p><p>Others may have varying views.  However, I believe that in every other way it would tie the hands of the Oireachtas and I do not believe I could support going down the road towards entrenching legislation in the Constitution in the event that there is a referendum.  Therefore, from my perspective, repeal <i>simpliciter </i>and legislate thereafter.  The key issue in the context of legislation is to what stage in a pregnancy can a termination be allowed and in what circumstances can it occur.  That is the challenge and there are varying views on it.  I have always said there is a middle ground.  Many would accept providing for termination in cases of incest, rape and fatal foetal abnormality, but legislating for it would be quite complex.  How we would legislate for termination in cases involving rape would be exceptionally difficult.  It would pose huge problems not necessarily for the committee but also for whoever was drafting legislation should the committee recommend repeal of the eighth amendment and legislating to deal with the issue in cases of rape.<br/><br/>When we consider the broader issues, we have to accept that we must have confidence and trust in the women and girls of this country.  As a society, regardless of our views, we cannot continue to herd our problems to England or Holland.  I am not necessarily comfortable with the concept of terminating a pregnancy, but the reality is that 5,000 terminations are carried out every year, with 3,500 to 3,600 being carried out in England and the rest in Ireland through the use of abortive tablets.  That is the reality with which we are dealing.  To continue to deny access to terminations in this country when we know that they are happening abroad is doing the women and girls of Ireland a huge disservice.  We have to be mature enough to accept that it is an issue.  To me, criminalising women is very distasteful and a scar and a blight on how we view women and girls.<br/><br/>I spoke about decriminalisation during the debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013.  Criminalisation is wholly unacceptable because it can and does, as indicated in some of the evidence presented to the committee, discourage women from seeking medical attention or advice.  A young girl could be criminalised and sentenced to 14 years in prison for taking abortion pills.  We have to address the situation where a young girl is pregnant, frightened and alone not knowing where to turn when lying in her bed suffering from cramps after taking tablets and not being able to seek medical attention.  The committee should recommend a change to the criminalisation element of the legislation in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, as constituted, and whatever legislation may be introduced following a repeal of the eight amendment.<br/><br/>How much time do I have left?</p></speech>

They will all have to be decided on at some stage in the near future.  I do not believe that as a committee or individuals we can deny the fact that we have listened to evidence where, for example, in the context of fatal foetal abnormality, it cannot be diagnosed in advance of 22 weeks.  That case has been made to us by people who deal with the issue regularly.  When we consider the entitlements that should be available to women, there should be a scan at 12 weeks and another at 22 weeks to detect anomalies.  If we do not allow for termination beyond 22 weeks in a case of fatal foetal abnormality, when there would be a scan to identify and diagnose it, in the context of what they face, we would do a great disservice to a small cohort of women who receive a tragic diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality.  I know that there are varying views on whether it can be diagnosed, but most of the evidence from the professionals suggests it can.  Others make a legitimate point that it would be a slope towards the termination of pregnancies in cases involving varying forms of disability, but the committee must also confront and address this difficult issue.</p> <p>  In summary, we cannot continue to condemn and criminalise women for making the choice and force them to travel abroad because the option is not available to them here.  Given the very tragic circumstances in some cases of fatal foetal abnormality and the horrendous and arduous journeys women face emotionally, psychologically and physically, we have to look at the issue in a sympathetic and human way.</p> <p>  There is another view which has been expressed at this committee and elsewhere and we owe it to the people to give them an opportunity to adjudicate on the issue.  The committee will not make the decision on it.  It will make some recommendation or express an opinion to the D&aacute;il, but it will be the Government that will bring forward legislation that will reflect the debate at the committee and in the D&aacute;il and it will be the people who will decide.  The issue was first adjudicated on in 1983.  Having regard to the numbers of women who have since had to travel abroad, there has been a change of view in Irish society on the issue.  Primarily, we owe it to the women of the country to allow the people to have their say in an informed, a respectful and an intelligent debate on the substantive constitutional issue and the legislation that will flow from the decision of the people.</p> <p>  On whether we should publish legislation in tandem with it, it is important to note that any legislation that might be published would only be a guide.  We would not be legally or duty bound to implement or pass that legislation.  It should be borne in mind that there will be an election at some stage and that after most elections there is a different make-up in the D&aacute;il.  Every Oireachtas is entitled to change legislation and political parties and members of no political party are entitled to campaign and seek a mandate from the people on any platform.  I am quite sure there will be people who will seek a platform to oppose the result of the referendum in the context of legislation that may flow from it, but on the issue of publishing legislation and saying definitively that it will be passed by the next Oireachtas, we have to be honest with the people and say it can only be seen as a guide.  If the amendment is removed from the Constitution, we must be conscious that it will then be up to the Oireachtas to legislate and that from time to time its political make-up may change and that it may change its opinion and amend the legislation regularly.  It will certainly become a political issue.  Let us be very honest.  Once the amendment is out of the Constitution, the issue will be fully in the political domain.  We must all reflect on that fact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#Y00100"><p>Like everybody else, I compliment the Chairman on the fair and equitable manner in which she has conducted the meetings.  I thank the delegates who came before the committee, each of whom had his or her own particular advice to give.  They allowed themselves to be challenged, which is what the committee is about.  It has been a very successful exercise.  It is not so much that we have learned more but that we introduced checks and balances in the committee's job and what it is about.  As other speakers mentioned, this will ultimately be an issue for the people.  They alone will decide on it.  It is completely outside our remit to recommend how they should decide.  We need to recognise the importance of the investigative job we have been trying to do which has involved introducing checks and balance in the presentation of the various submissions made.  We need to review what we found when we were reassured, or not as the case may be, in the course of our hearings.</p> <p>  I have always held the view that there are two opposing sides in the debate in this country and there have been since 1983.  Each side has called for the holding of a referendum at one time or another in the past ten years.  I have the correspondence to prove it.  It goes without saying a referendum will take place and both sides in the debate have asked for one to be held.  We have discovered a number of issues where matters need to be improved.  A number of voids in the system need to be filled.  For example, it appears that there is an extreme lack of counselling and support services for women with crisis pregnancies.  The lack of advice and support of a medical and psychological nature is obvious to us all.  We have to put ourselves in the shoes of the women in question when we look at the situation that has been presented to us.  We need to ask ourselves whether it is fair that they should be left alone, isolated and treated as if they did not exist.  The fact of the matter is that we have to deal with this issue.</p> <p>  I draw a dramatic contrast with the way in which pregnant women were treated in the past.  Sadly, it is now coming back to haunt us.  We tended to cast out pregnant women and regard them as inferior citizens and human beings.  We regarded them as an embarrassment.  We cast them out and left it to somebody else to look after them.  It was a crying shame that we did what we did to so many women in previous years.  I hope we have learned the lesson, which is not to allow such things to occur again.  There is a need to accommodate.  I am not in favour of abortion, as I have always said during the years, but it now appears that there are reasons particular issues need to be addressed.  These issues have been the subject of our discussions in recent weeks.</p> <p>  Apart from the need to put counselling and ancillary services in place as a matter of urgency, there is also a need to dwell on issues such as rape, incest and crisis pregnancies in which fatal foetal abnormalities are detected.  It is a serious crisis for the woman in question, more so than anybody else.  It is a question of whether she feels competent to address the issue presented to her.  Does she feel mentally and physically strong enough to take responsibility for what is coming her way?  I remind the committee that I am talking about a woman who has medical evidence in front of her that tells her what will happen.  When medical evidence was produced to us by families who had direct experience of being in this situation, the extent to which they wanted to be accommodated was obvious to me.  They did not necessarily want to have an abortion, but they wanted some advice and help.  They wanted to know with whom they could share their problems.  I am thinking particularly of a case in which it might be the only pregnancy or child a woman might have.  It is obvious to me that there is a crying need to ensure whatever can be done by way of backup, support, advice and help should be done at the earliest possible date.  If we do not do this, we are ignoring a serious matter.</p> <p>  I would be one of the first to recognise that we have to observe the law.  We change the law when we have to change it.  That is a matter for the Oireachtas, but in this case, it is a matter, in the first instance, for the people.  Incidentally, it might be possible to amend the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 to a considerable extent to accommodate quite a number of the issues that have been debated here.  There is a lot of work to be done in that regard and it may well come to pass, but if we allow the situation to continue without doing anything about the pressing issues that have been presented to us, despite what we have learned during the course of the committee's hearings and from our own history, as a committee, we will be in default and simply in denial.  We cannot continue down that road.</p> <p>  I want to make a point about equality.  I recognise there is a right to life, an issue which has been raised and one we have to treat seriously.  Regardless of whether it is a devolved right, a primary right or a secondary right, in certain circumstances the life of a mother was at serious risk prior to the 2013 Act and it was a question of having an equal right.  It was proved in a number of tragic cases that, depending on the weaker of the two rights, the mother had no right.  As I mentioned, we need to remember the equality legislation and be absolutely certain.  The general principle of equality is prevalent in our society.  We need to recognise that what we will do in the future must have some regard for and the recognition of the need to have a certain degree of equality.  However, there should be a clear divide.  To my mind, this becomes most obvious in a case in which it is determined at an advanced stage of a pregnancy with no fatal foetal abnormality that a termination is desirable on socioeconomic grounds.  It becomes a little hazy at that stage.</p> <p>  The people have expressed their concern about a possible attempt to deal with children with Down's syndrome in a way that they would not find acceptable.  There is no great demand or support among the people who will make the decision for such an approach.  The reason is simple.  We all know children and adults with Down's syndrome who are generally regarded as friendly and helpful and not seen to intrude on anybody.  They are a threat to no one.  We need to keep that in mind when we are devolving responsibility, in so far as that is what we are doing.  It is the responsibility of the people who will deal with this matter in due course.</p> <p>  I mention the possibility of court challenges, an issue which has been covered by a number of speakers.  Anything can be challenged in the courts.  That is part and parcel of and the basis for our legislation.  If we exclude anything from the right of the courts, the question of the separation of powers will arise.  The two shall stand alone and not cross over each other.  At all times, we have to operate and move in the knowledge that what we do by way of legislation in these Houses is subject to challenge in the courts on some grounds.  I do not believe in the theory that any legislation is beyond challenge, even if we might try to state that is the case.</p> <p>  Much of the issue surrounding decriminalisation has resolved itself.  However, other problems have presented.</p><p>The availability of morning-after and online abortion services has overtaken the legislators and the people in the intervening period between 1983 and now.  It would be wrong to allow a situation to prevail whereby women availing of that treatment would be criminalised.  I do not think we can do that because then we would be condemning them to seek treatment that is illegal, and that might happen under unsupervised conditions.  Again, we are back to the point that the availability of medical and social advice is needed at that time, or may be needed at a particular time.  Yet, we are suggesting that we forget about it and that it does not happen.  We have to accept as a fact that those processes and procedures are available now and that they are taking place now.</p><p> Earlier, I mentioned the availability of counselling.  I believe that the extent to which adequate counselling of a supportive and non-directive nature becomes available is of singular importance when it comes to any legislation in future.  A comparison can be made with places like Sweden and Switzerland, where there is a major difference in the extent to which abortions are performed.  It suggests that the level of counselling in one place or the other is having an impact for one reason or another.</p><p> I intend to finish as I started.  I am not in favour of abortion but I recognise that in our modern society there are reasons, and a need, for some change to accommodate the evolution of our society.  Furthermore, we have an obligation to do whatever we can do to facilitate the people in coming to those conclusions.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses, regardless of whether they had a particular viewpoint or no viewpoint and regardless of whether they were giving factual information to the committee.  All of it was valuable in shaping my opinion and in respect of the outcomes of the committee.</p> <p>  Everyone has given a review of the committee's deliberations.

The whole point of today's meeting was to arrange that and, consequently, next week we could simply vote with little conversation.  I will touch on that a little more.</p> <p>  Before I make some proposals in that regard I wish to make some further points.  One relates to the issue of risk.  Every medical expert we spoke to was firm in the belief that we cannot grade risk.  That is the first think I took out of the committee.  We cannot grade risk in terms of severe, serious or substantial.  Indeed, any attempt to do so simply creates more issues than it resolves.</p> <p>  Another issue I took from the committee relates to fatal foetal abnormalities.  It is an impossible task to try to draw up a list and it would be counterproductive as well.  Any attempt to put a gestational time limit on fatal foetal abnormalities would be problematic as well.  This was something the medical profession did not recommend.  That was the second thing I took from the committee.</p> <p>  Another issue relates to the ground of rape and how difficult it may be to legislate for that.  The contributions to the committee on the matter outlined how other countries have dealt with the matter by legislating for it in four possible ways.  The first was a certification process undertaken by judges.  The second was a certification process by law enforcement officials.  The third was a certification process by the medical profession.  The fourth was to have unrestricted access to termination up to 12 weeks.  These were the four options presented to us in respect of how other countries have dealt with the matter.  If we deal with the issue of decriminalisation, it would instantly remove two of those options, that is to say, a judicial certification process and reporting to law enforcement or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These options would be altogether counterproductive.  That leaves two options for the committee to consider.</p> <p>  Another issue is the question of gestational periods.  Let us consider the Citizens' Assembly recommendations on the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities.  The recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly was that there would be no restriction as to gestational period.  In other areas, the assembly looked at gestational periods and came to a view on it.  The assembly members voted on these grounds and on what would be acceptable.  Once the majority was in favour of accepting a particular ground as a ground for termination, the assembly members were given three options.  The first was a period of up to 12 weeks' gestation only.  The second was up to 22 weeks' gestation only.  The third was no restriction as to gestational period.  A forth options of no preference was offered as well.</p> <p>  We have discussed the matter.  I believe it may be counterproductive to put in primary legislation a gestational period.  It would be difficult to try to legislate for gestational periods.  When we are looking at gestational periods for any ground for termination, those best placed to adjudicate are in the medical profession.  I will propose, on behalf of ourselves, that we consider a fourth option for next week.  My option is for the Oireachtas not to include gestational timeframes in primary legislation and for the matter to be dealt with through secondary legislation in consultation with the medical profession through their representative and regulatory bodies.</p> <p>  I believe there is an onus on politicians to recognise that we do not have the expertise to adjudicate on what appropriate gestational timeframes, if any, should be put in place.  That should be a matter for the medical profession and the women of the country.</p></speech>

I do not believe we should put gestational timeframes into primary legislation.  That is the first proposal I will put forward.  I will put it to the committee as an amendment and I hope it will be included in our votes next week as an option.</p> <p>  The second point relates to module 1.  We have to give some recognition to the process that the Citizens' Assembly undertook.  In dealing with module 1, the assembly had several options available.  The first option on ballot paper 1 was that the eighth amendment would not be retained in full.  The committee has already made a decision on that matter.  Therefore, that proposal or option should not be discussed next week.  Let us suppose we follow the path taken by the Citizens' Assembly.  The next option put to them was ballot paper 2.  I intend to propose a corresponding proposal as the first vote that we take next week in respect of module 1.  That ballot paper had three voting options for members of the assembly.</p><p>The options were first, repeal of Article 40.3.3o; second, replace or amend it; and third, prefer not to state an opinion.  The first vote next week should be on whether we are in favour of repeal of Article 40.3.3o.  If this is agreed by the committee then there will be no need to address the third option, which coincidentally is the option which the Citizens' Assembly settled on in its ballot paper.  If the repeal question is not passed by the committee then the next option will be ballot paper 3, which is the Citizens' Assembly recommendation, on which it eventually settled.  I am proposing that this is the format we take next week.  As I said, the first vote of the committee should be on repeal of Article 40.3.3o.  If this is agreed then in my opinion module 1 will be completed.  If it is not agreed, we should then follow through on all of the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.</p></speech>

I am proposing that this is how the committee would do its business next week.</p> <p>  On module 2, as we are required to give some consideration to the Citizens' Assembly recommendations I propose that we take each of those recommendations separately, voting first on whether we believe fatal foetal abnormality is grounds for termination or not.  If we do believe it is grounds for a termination, we then vote on the options made available to the Citizens' Assembly, namely, 12 weeks, 22 weeks or no time limit.  The proposal which we will be submitting this week for consideration is that termination be a matter for secondary legislation in consultation with the medical profession, rather than primary legislation.  That is a proposal which----- </p></speech>

I also thank my fellow committee members for giving me the space to listen, understand and engage in the work of this committee.  There was good mutual respect among all who engaged in this committee.  I have taken a lot of information on board.  Our Oireachtas colleagues need to understand what was discussed at this committee.  A lot of good information and expert opinion was put before us.  Some people have said this opinion was biased but it was not.  The heads of the Rotunda Hospital and Holles Street hospital came before the committee to present the facts as they are.  I approached the work of this committee in the same way as I would approach the work of all other committees.  I came to listen, learn and understand and to assist the committee in gathering all of the information we require.</p> <p>  I found Deputy Daly's comments about the decriminalisation of abortion interesting.  I was not aware of the 14 year prison sentence in regard to the abortion pill.  Decriminalisation is a huge issue for me.  Deputy Kelleher spoke earlier about young people acquiring abortion pills when they have nobody to turn to.  That is shocking.  I do not think anybody should feel alone and have nobody to turn to such that they have to order abortion pills online and also be fearful that if caught with these pills they face a prison sentence.  We have a duty of care to ensure this issue is addressed.  </p> <p>  In regard to fatal foetal abnormality, this generally arises from a planned pregnancy.  Regardless of whether it is a first, second, third or fourth child, the child is wanted and it is only when the parent or parents find out on review of a scan that all is not going according to plan that they have to make a choice.  We heard from one witness that he was a broken man for nine years in terms of his trips to and from Belfast.  That session had a huge impact on me.  We all found it very moving.  I would not want to find myself in that position and I would not want to be responsible for anybody else being in that position.  This man and his wife were broken and he did not talk to anybody about his experience for a long time.  It was shocking to listen to his story.  There are many men who have been in this position.  </p> <p>  This committee played a huge role in listening but I would have liked if more people had come before us.  That is no reflection on the Chairman, the clerk or anybody else.  I agree with Senator Mullen that the vote was premature.  It is unfortunate that more groups did not appear before the committee.  I had a willingness to listen to all sides.  I do not want to label any group because we heard from experts who were not to be labelled.  It is unfortunate that we did not hear all viewpoints.</p><p>While they might have submitted letters and everything else, it is not possible to beat face-to-face engagement.  It is not possible to beat good robust debates with questioning and everything else because people wanted to tease it out for the general public.</p><p> It was also an incredibly tough committee and I found myself challenged.  I would nearly have sneaked away there without having spoken.  It is very difficult because it was a really emotive debate.  We have a duty of care to the general public because it will go to a referendum.  Three generations have not had an opportunity to vote on it.  I believe in democracy.  It is not me who will decide because I have only one vote at the end of the day.  The wording will be incredibly important.</p><p> Irrespective of one's side, it is all down to a value system.  I have deep core values and I respect everybody with their own value system.  Ireland is not the society it once was and we can respect each other for their value system.  That is why the wording is important, but everybody needs to get out and vote to have their say.  Everybody needs to be informed as to what they are voting on.  The challenge next week is how we lay it before the Oireachtas and how we present it to Government to come back with a wording to us on it.</p><p> I cannot say I enjoyed it.  I was challenged by this committee.  I would like to think that our colleagues working down here - Senators and all - would educate themselves on what was discussed in the last number of weeks.  Irrespective of what comes out of next week's voting system, at the end of the day respect has to be shown to one and all because this debate is only starting and not finishing.  We have to be very sure as to how we, as legislators, present it to the general public.  We owe the people an opportunity to vote on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#BB00200"><p>At the outset, as many other speakers have, I compliment the Chairman on the work she has done and the manner in which she carried out a very difficult task.  I express my thanks to the many expert witnesses who have come in and given us testimony and expert evidence.  A key point that I hope the public understands is that we were not here to rehearse the Citizens' Assembly; we were here to look at its recommendations and move the process on.  Almost all the committee members have approached that in a very honest and principled way.</p> <p>  I am conscious not to rehearse what many people have said.  I want to reflect a little.  One would need to be at least 52 years of age to have voted in 1983 and the bad news is that I am that old.  I remember that referendum and it is important to reflect back on that troubled time.  I was not long back from England and those of us who campaigned against that amendment were completely ostracised.  Those living in a rural area, as I did at that time, found that neighbours stopped talking to us.  People chased and confronted us.  Debate was stifled entirely by an autocratic and frankly quite evil Catholic Church at that time.  I remember my religion teacher saying to me, "We are taking our last stand on this.  We're going to nail this down."  Boy, did they do that.</p> <p>  In the previous year, 1982, there was a lovely girl in my school bus, who was probably not more than 14, and she just disappeared.  There were all sorts of rumours, but we never saw her again.  We gathered she was pregnant; there was some suggestion it could have been incest.  However, we just never saw her again because that was what happened back then.  Not in the 1950s but in the 1980s we made them disappear.  Our society made them disappear.  When I moved to Limerick at the end of 1983, I lived beside the Good Shepherd convent along with a group of students aged 17 and 18.  One can imagine what we might get up to.  Right beside us, women were imprisoned.  They could probably hear us coming in at night in all sorts of states and they were imprisoned - not in the 1950s but in the 1980s.</p> <p>  Unfortunately there are people who still want to take us back to those times.  While not wanting to be party-political about this, we should acknowledge that legislators through the years have consistently let women down.  That is why it is such a privilege to have an opportunity here to do something worthwhile and we must do it.  That does not mean we have to agree on everything and I fully respect people with different opinions.  However, the evidence is clear and it is not evidence from pro-choice cheerleaders.  This came from the head of the Rotunda Hospital and the head of the National Maternity Hospital, people we trust to look after our mothers and babies - I certainly trust them anyway.  I do not think they are part of some conspiracy to foist abortion on the country.  They are honourable people who are saying, "We have a problem here and we're asking for your help.  We're asking you to remove this awful amendment."  It should never have been put into our Constitution.  We need to unite around this if we can.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's position is clear.  We believe in a simple and straight repeal.  I compliment Deputy Kelleher, who summed up the reasons for that extremely well.  I hope we can all agree on that.  More important, if we do our work properly and move forward on the issue, it is really important that when the referendum comes we put our party political badges aside to a degree and unite where we can to make this country a better and safer place for women and to finally put an end to a very dark episode in our country's history.</p> <p>  Just a few months after the 1983 referendum was passed, an unfortunate girl died in a grotto in Granard with her son.  I lived in that part of the world - I used to travel back from college - and all one would hear at the time was "Well, we don't want to talk about that".  We need to put an end to this awful dark and backward attitude of hiding things away and not trusting women.  That is the big issue that divides us.  Most people on this committee are prepared to trust women.  By God, should we not be able to do that?  If we cannot do that, is something not fundamentally wrong?  I am saying simply that we should trust women, trust medical professionals and unite to repeal this awful amendment and let us move forward together.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses who appeared before the committee.</p> <p>  I regret that there was definitely some imbalance in the witness presentation as people from one particular side of the argument, for reasons of their own, chose not to appear before us.  They have their reasons and I respect that.  Ultimately it was their decision; the forum was here for them.  On a personal level I came into this committee quite open-minded.  I did not have a settled position coming in here.  I was open to every input from witnesses on all sides.  I regret that through illness I missed some important sessions.  For instance, I regret that I missed Professor William Binchy's contribution.</p></speech>

I hope it is an informed view and a mature view.  I have no difficulty with what Deputy O'Brien proposed for the procedures for next week.  It makes sense as part of our remit was to drill down into the findings of the Citizens' Assembly.  I see no reason not to follow its procedures.</p><p>I do not anticipate that everyone will agree with what it suggested, far from it, but it makes sense as a procedural way forward.  It gives us a pathway.  I hope that would be acceptable to the members.  In general, I have no particular wisdom to give this assembly except to say that next Wednesday I will first and foremost be informed by my respect for women.  In so far as I have changed, my unerring awareness that women's health and welfare is primary in this debate has grown.  As a man, to a certain extent I feel a fraud in pontificating on what is really a matter for the woman in the first instance.  </p><p> We will not have a final say in anything, as the Cathaoirleach well knows, no more than the Citizens' Assembly had a final say.  We have important input to give and a presentation to make to Government.  Through our deliberations, I hope we will assist the Government in presenting the people with a very clear and coherent choice by way of referendum next year.  First and foremost, we want it to be a referendum which the people will have no difficulty understanding.  That has been an issue in many referenda we have had in this country, on this issue and others.  Let us hope that our presentation will help Government to formulate a coherent wording for any referendum which will go before the people.  Then the people, who are sovereign, will decide.  It is important that the choice they are given makes sense to them.</p><p> That is all I have to say at this stage.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

I also thank all the members of the committee.  It has been a pleasure to work with everyone, despite the varying views we hold.  For me, it has been an absolute privilege to serve on this committee.  I think that I will look back on this in 20 or 30 years time and consider myself very fortunate to have been part of the important work which we have been asked to do.  I certainly share Deputy Rabbitte's view that it has been extremely difficult to do this work.  I am sure that other members will agree that it has been very draining.  Some of the issues which we have had to deal with have been very heavy, very difficult and very emotive.  I certainly found some of the personal testimonies very difficult to listen to and very upsetting.  We have considered a lot of evidence over the three months and we have put in a substantial amount of hours.</p><p>I hope that other Members in both Houses will take the time to read over the evidence put before the committee because I have no doubt that no member of this committee would say that he or she did not learn something new.  Speaking for myself, I have learned quite a lot.  I definitely feel that my position is now an informed one.  I have considered all of the evidence.  I have listened to the overwhelming medical evidence.  It disappoints me to see that certain witnesses are being pinned as being either pro-life or pro-choice.  I do not even agree with those terms.  Some of the witnesses who came before the committee said very clearly that they were not adopting a position but simply presenting the medical facts from the field in which they work.  That information has been extremely helpful to members of the committee, most of whom are not medical professionals and require that guidance and information.</p><p>Speaking on our current system, one of the witnesses, I cannot recall who it was, said that we do have abortion services, they just happen to be in another jurisdiction.  I thought that was very well put.  It would be naive of us to think that women are not having terminations.  Clearly they are.  We have evidence to show that.  We know that we have a law on our Statute Book which says they should be locked up for up to 14 years.  I find it abhorrent that is on the Statute Book in the country I am from and in which I live.  That needs to change.  The idea that a woman anywhere in this country could be taking medication on her own, without any medical assistance, to end a pregnancy and could fear that she could not come forward because she might be prosecuted is morally wrong.  That needs to change.</p><p>In terms of the options open to us, the legal advice to the committee was very clear that the best option in terms of dealing with this issue from a legal perspective is to repeal the eighth amendment <i>simpliciter</i>.  We should not amend it, try to jimmy it around or try to entrench legislation.  We have already created a mess with our current system.  We should repeal <i>simpliciter</i>and allow the Houses to legislate.  That is what we are elected to do.  We are the people's Houses.  We are elected to represent the people of this country.  It is in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad that legislation of this nature should be enacted.  It should not be in the Constitution.  </p><p>Over the course of these proceedings the spotlight has been shone very strongly on all of us as members of this committee.  We are only one part of this process.  One of the most notable outcomes from this committee, and one of the best things it has served to do, is getting the debate started.  It has created space for this debate to happen, not just in the Oireachtas, but on the streets, in our communities and across the country.  Getting the debate started has been one of the greatest achievements of this committee.  </p><p>I have had representations in my own office from both sides.  Regrettably, some of those representations, from both sides, have been vicious, threatening, abusive and very personal.  It is regrettable that any person in this country would feel that he or she would need to resort to those types of tactics to make his or her point or have his or her voice heard.  My door is certainly always open, as is the door of every elected representative.  The campaign has already started but I hope that all sides to the debate can remain respectful of the other positions being taken and that we do not resort to trying to debase one another and to vicious personal attacks on individuals.  That will get us nowhere and will only serve to leave a lasting sour taste in people's mouths following the result. </p><p>As Senator O'Sullivan has said, at the end of the day this committee will not decide.  We will not be drafting the question or deciding what will happen for the people of this country.  The citizens will decide.  What this work will do, however, is inform the D&aacute;il and the Government as to what steps they can take to bring this referendum about and as to what the question might look like.  When the question comes before the Houses it will not seek the endorsement of every Deputy and Senator.  They will not be asked to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.  They will be asked whether they will allow the question go to the people, not whether they support it.  That is a really important distinction to make.  In a democracy and a republic we have to be willing to let people vote and have their say.  As Senator Gavan has pointed out, very few people have had the opportunity to vote on the eighth amendment.  I certainly have not and I am potentially very affected by it, as are many of my peers.  It is really important that people get the opportunity to vote. </p><p>When we finish our report and hand it over to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and then on to Government, the work will continue.  I want to put it on the record that I have been told by certain groups that I was elected to represent the people of my constituency and asked why I was not representing all my constituents' views.  It is very difficult to represent all of the varying views because obviously I have my own opinions and I am only one person.  As I have done previously, I want to put it clearly on the record that I did get representations from all sides in the constituency, and outside it, including from those in favour of repealing the eighth amendment, those in favour of retaining it and those in favour of amending it.  I believe it is fairly obvious to the public and to this committee that there is no consensus and that there are varying views.  </p><p>I also want to put on the record that I am concerned about the very tight timeline proposed by Government for the holding of the referendum.  We have been through a very detailed process of educating ourselves.  We have heard three months of evidence.  The Citizens' Assembly also had considerable time to debate and consider evidence.  I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that the public gets all of the information it needs to make an informed choice come referendum day.  That will be hugely important to the debate.</p></speech>

As I have said before, I believe that the committee failed to check against its own majority bias and that, as a result, a whole swathe of the relevant issues went unscrutinised.  There were problems with the scope of our inquiries and our willingness to look at all the issues and not just some issues.  People have talked about the choice of witnesses, but also among those witnesses sometimes there was the conflation of expert testimony and a whole lot of personal opinion.  As I have often said, the time allocated for questioning was hugely problematic, given the life-or-death nature of the issues.  Although I acknowledge that on a grace-and-favour basis I was sometimes afforded some leeway, I think it was a problem for everyone and completely inappropriate, given the issues at hand.  The extraordinary imbalance in the list of invited guests in favour of abortion was the problem from the start and was pointed out by me and others.  With the greatest of respect to Senator Ned O'Sullivan, to whom I have listened over the years, including in 2013, and whose statement to the effect that while he was, unfortunately, unable to be here, he listened to all the proceedings I fully accept, one thing he could not have heard or been a party to were the closed proceedings.  It was then, at the beginning of this process, that I found it extremely difficult to get the committee to accept that we had been given a wider mandate than the committee was willing to admit, and there was much discussion about that.  The problem arose because the abortion-supporting majority on the committee did not see it as necessary or desirable to hear expert testimony on issues such as whether, as has been claimed, the eighth amendment contributed to Ireland's having a significantly lower than average abortion rate and to the saving of thousands of lives; the experience of families who believe that the lives of some of their loved ones have been saved by the eighth amendment; or the evolution of abortion culture in countries in which abortion has been legalised.  The Chairman did not point out to the committee the dangers of this imbalance or propose measures to remedy the situation.</p><p>Another issue was the human rights case for the eighth amendment.  I pleaded with the committee to have someone from the Attorney General's office before the committee to outline this human rights case and defend the <i>status quo</i>.  It was an obvious request but the committee completely disregarded it.  Of course, it did so democratically using its majority but, in response to what Deputy Rabbitte has said, I appeal to her to continue to seek to hear the voices that were excluded from the committee right from the get-go.  I proposed several names who would have articulated an expert pro-life perspective, but this was rejected, even though the credentials of these people were excellent.  I made it clear at all times that it was not the job of the pro-life minority on the committee to secure a list of experts who would ensure that all issues were examined thoroughly.  That was the responsibility of the Chairman, supported by the secretariat, and I believe that responsibility was not met.  An analysis of the invited speakers and the recommendations they made shows a clear ideological preference for legalised abortion among the vast majority.  When the committee pre-emptively voted to recommend that the eighth amendment be removed or changed without waiting to hear from all invited speakers, much less a balanced ticket of speakers, there was no opposition from the Chairman on the grounds that this was manifestly inappropriate.  The Chairman has repeatedly defended the committee's decision, despite its being an objectively hasty, ill-considered and prejudicial move.  In response to what Deputy Rabbitte said, it was not just that the decision was premature; it was prejudicial.  It caused other people to lose faith in the process.  It was only when Deputy McGrath and I drew public attention to the biased attitudes and processes within the committee which we believed, and still believe, are there, that the Chairman, backed up by the secretariat, made belated attempts to invite a small number, a token number, of pro-life voices.  It should be noted that the number of such people by then proposed was small and tokenistic and would in no way have rectified the imbalance complained of.  It is significant that one of the newly invited speakers had earlier been proposed to the committee but that the Chairman, backed up by the secretariat, did not appear to have investigated that person's credentials before removing them from the list.  A second invited speaker, from the group Both Lives Matter, had previously been refused on the basis that advocacy groups were supposedly not to be invited.  There was therefore a catalogue of failure in trying to bring us the broadest range of credible evidence on this life and death issue.  There was the bizarre spectacle of the Chairman publicly defending the committee and admitting not even what Deputy Rabbitte is, interestingly and remarkably, the only person on the committee to acknowledge, that is, that there is a problem in taking a decision before one has heard all the evidence, something that is very apparent to most reasonable people, while the secretariat in the background was running around trying to get a few extra pro-life speakers.  It seemed like a damage-limitation exercise.</p><p>There has been an effort in the Seanad Chamber and here today and on other days to hold up this committee as a model of impartiality, with Deputy Noone being a scrupulously impartial Chairman.  For the record, the Chairman knows well that it gives me no pleasure to criticise aspects of her chairing, but I would have no integrity if I did not say that I have thought that tweeting on this issue, as has been done, was inappropriate.  I feel that defending the committee's processes, even in recent days on TV with comments to the effect that most of the witnesses were focused on women's health, does a disservice to those of us who oppose abortion but believe in the right of women to health as a constitutional and natural human right.  The Chairman therefore erred in offering so robust a public defence, although I have never believed she ought to have no view on the matters at hand.  I was contacted by a person on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly who said that according to Chatham House rules, he could not disclose what was said at the meeting referred to by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  However, he asked how could the Chairman of this committee be independent because he heard so much from her at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting.  I said in response that I did not know whether the Chairman is supposed to be independent because she certainly had voted on the previous occasion and it was not my awareness that she was supposed to have no view on the matters at hand.  However, I do think there was a lack of facilitation of impartiality by her defending the committee's processes so robustly.  I do not think that was her role.  I revisit this because there has been an attempt to sanitise this committee's very odd choices and processes, not least the decision to recommend against keeping the eighth amendment completely before all the evidence had been heard.</p><p>Another thing I have found surreal is that some of the people presenting as experts before this committee have, frankly, been involved in taking people's lives in other jurisdictions.  When one thinks about it, it is not normal in these Houses to have people before us as experts who have been in the business of taking people's lives.  I know some Members of these Houses may have been in the position of taking people's lives but they generally deny that they were ever involved in such organisations.  That is an aside.</p></speech>

There was a remarkable tendency of people who, the public might think, favour just limited abortion from an expert perspective not to want to limit the scope or the definition of the disabilities involved.  They did not want to see things confined to so-called foetal cases, although we should all reject such disrespectful terminology, and they did not and do not want time limits.  Their spoken or unspoken demand in their supposedly expert testimony has been for abortion on request.  We heard no evidence from physicians who believe that the eighth amendment and current legislative provisions have actually hurt their ability to give optimum care.  The witnesses did not point to a single case in which they had given less than optimum care because of the eighth amendment.  There was no victim of that less-than-optimum care supposedly being provided under the eighth amendment, according to their testimony.  There was no evidence of any initiative under the criminal law to constrain doctors who gave good health care, including in cases in which it was impossible to save the life of the unborn child.  We had all this talk of chilling effects, criminalisation and doctors not being able to give good health care without any single such case.  This is why there was a dishonesty in the invocation of the tragedy of Savita Halappanavar.  What the inquest clearly showed was that the doctors failed to treat that unfortunate person because it was not apparent to them that she was physically ill or that there was that risk at the time.  That is there in black and white in the incest.  That is why it was so wrong to suggest what they suggested, and it really showed that they did not have cases to which they could point to show that the eighth amendment is not helping doctors keep the balance right because there are two patients-----</p></speech>

I appreciate that.</p> <p>  I noted the comment about Denmark.  So much could be said about that.  It is not just the Irish Government; Deputy McGrath at first in his comment was too charitable to the Danish ambassador.  The Danish ambassador did not point out that 133 scanned babies were aborted with Down's syndrome, compared with four who went on to be born.</p><p>I never said it was government policy; I said it was the policy of the great and the good.  However, Denmark has led the way with its scanning of children with Down's syndrome and it is simply disingenuous not to say that it is the preferred policy.  Perhaps we can leave that for another day.</p><p> On the question of criminalisation, it is interesting that the same people who opposed looking at the Citizens' Assembly's report, despite the fact of it being in the mandate that was given to us, nonetheless have wanted to open up the question of decriminalisation even though the Citizens' Assembly chose not to deal with that.  "Hypocritical" might be too strong a word, but certainly "inconsistent" is not.  In my view, there has been a great deal of hypocrisy about criminalisation.  I wish to say on the record, and I probably speak for Deputies Fitzpatrick and Mattie McGrath, although they can speak eloquently for themselves, that I would never want to see women targeted by the criminal law in what are already very difficult situations.  However, the criminal law does not exist just to put people in prison.  It exists to prevent certain behaviours that can hurt people themselves or others.  In fact, to my almost certain knowledge, no woman has been criminalised in this jurisdiction.  In abortion jurisdictions, including Britain, abortion remains a criminal offence.</p><p> Looking at this from the point of view of women's health, to suggest that it would be a good idea to remove the legal prohibition, backed up by a theoretical criminal sanction that does not operate to be targeted at women, would do no service to women's health.  Of course, it would be a rogue's charter for those medics and semi-medics who have no problem carrying out abortions.</p><p> On the subject of the right to health, does the baby not have a right to health too?  Is it not the case that our medical practice, which has always been among the best in the world, shows that the protections which always existed even prior to 2013 to allow doctors to engage in life saving treatment have been used by doctors to protect women, even sometimes involving losing the baby?  Is it not the reality that the threat to a person's life does not have to be imminent?  Is it not the reality that the law is protecting medics in their decisions?  The evidence of that, and they were unable to show to the contrary, is that the law has not come after them and their judgments have not been second-guessed.  We have been fed a great deal of rhetoric about fear of criminalisation but no evidence that it has ever happened.  Is there anybody so blind as those who do not wish to see?  Unfortunately, no committee member ever conceded that the baby's health is something that ought to be protected.</p><p> On the question of trusting women, I like to think that I trust men and women equally in the society in which I live.  The reason we have laws of any type is that we back up trust with precaution.  That is the reason to have laws, when one thinks about it.  Has Deputy Kelleher any interest in exploring whether the eighth amendment saved lives?  The elephant in the room is the apparent massive disparity in our abortion rate and that of Britain.  Senator Gavan constantly tried to say that we do not know what Irish abortion rates are.  However, if we are honest, the most active abortion campaigners have not tried to claim that we have abortion rates that are in reality comparable to Britain's.  Our rate is about one quarter of its rate.  This committee was never interested in saying that we should look at whether laws prohibiting abortion have a protective effect.  Instead it listened to abortion proponents such as the Guttmacher Institute try to tell us in general terms, without looking at Ireland and Britain, that criminalisation of abortion does not reduce rates.  The evidence to the contrary is as plain as the noses on our faces.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017120600002#EE00500"><p>I appreciate that.</p> <p>  Again, very little attention was paid to mental health or to the fact that in Britain the vast majority of abortions take place on the mental health ground.  However, we heard clearly in the committee that there is no evidence that can be adduced that abortion improves women's mental health.  If anything, there may be a low to moderate risk of adverse mental health consequences for women in certain cases.  I have always been careful to neither overstate nor understate that.  How remarkable that the committee did not scratch its head and wonder whether that meant that talk of mental health grounds for abortion might be a denial of women's welfare or that there should be informed consent about possible risks to mental health associated with abortion in certain cases.  That is a massive fact when one considers that most abortions in Britain take place on the mental health ground.  We never talked about informed consent or anything like it.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte raises a human concern in hoping that no woman in a vulnerable situation who had made the mistake of importing an abortion pill would be criminalised in the context of seeking medical help.  Surely it would be possible to enact legislation that no person would be criminalised for seeking medical help consequent on their having undergone a procedure that was itself against the law.  One can protect the unborn fully in the law and one can keep abortion against the law to protect women and children, but one can still ensure there is a legal guarantee that no woman, young or old, seeking medical help would ever be chilled out of doing that because the doctor would have to report in some way.  Again, the committee was not interested in examining this.  That does not point to the need to legalise abortion.  It points to the need to ensure that women get medical help.  They are always the vulnerable ones in the equation.  It is the medics or those who provide abortions whom the law should always target.  One could pass that type of legislation.  It is one of the many things we never discussed because nobody was interested.</p> <p>  Incidentally, on the subject of trusting women, do I trust abusive boyfriends who might pressurise their pregnant girlfriends?  I do not.  That is why it is not just about the trick question of whether one trusts women.  I trust women and men, but I also believe the law has a role in protecting people from things that might hurt themselves and others.</p> <p>  Finally, if anything I have said here, and I do not presume that it is the case, strikes the members of the committee as something they are either hearing for the first time or that this committee never really considered, I ask them sincerely to suspend their judgment on this issue until they have looked at these issues in the round.  It would be too easy for members of the political parties, in particular, to find themselves locked in by a party whip or by their previous comments into supporting something on which, on closer analysis of the issues we did not discuss, they might be open to changing their minds.  I address that to them quite sincerely as somebody who also tries to keep an open mind but has tried always to see that there are two lives to be protected.</p> <p>  Thank you, Chairman, for the leeway.</p></speech>

It had not been my intention to address remarks directly to any person, but since that is happening we all might as well lash into it.</p> <p>  Senator Mullen said that if we were hearing anything he was saying for the first time that perhaps it would give us pause to think.  Of course, we have heard it.  We have heard it comprehensively challenged, contradicted and debunked by the simple facts.  We have not sought evidence from pro-abortion campaigners.  We have heard from the masters of our maternity hospitals, the men and women we trust to look after women, our daughters and friends.  We have heard from the people who are at the coalface of looking after women.  They have told us clearly, in a way one could not misunderstand or misinterpret, that the eighth amendment is an impediment to them doing their job.  Professor Malone, Dr. Peter Boylan and Dr. Rhona Mahony said it.  The evidence is already there.  It does not suit the narrative put forward by Senator Mullen, which is reminiscent perhaps of what people were saying in 1983, but we have moved on.  That is clear.</p> <p>  However, I wish to address some issues that arose during the proceedings of this committee.  It is not long since I was elected and many members of the committee are also not long elected, so I took the liberty of looking back over committee proceedings from previous D&aacute;ileanna.  It is most unusual for people to sit right up beside witnesses in that way.</p><p>In fact, I did not see any examples at all.  The pathetic attempt to intimidate people who give of their own time to come in here to give us evidence and facts was shameful.</p></speech>

Thank you, Chairman.  I also think that what we strove to do at every single committee hearing was to hear evidence and facts.  We have spoken to medical professionals and legal experts.  The facts might contradict the narrative put forward by some people but they are the facts, just as the representatives of the Danish Government have sought to put on record the facts.  Most Irish women have had the personal experience of travelling to England either with a friend or themselves and given an English address.  One could not possibly know how many women travel to England but we know it is in the thousands.  We cannot say that Irish women do not have abortions.  They do but they just do not have them here.  They go abroad for them.  One cannot adduce that we have a very low rate of abortion because the facts do not stack up.</p><p>The most compelling evidence that I heard was that which was given by the masters of the maternity hospitals, in particular Professor Malone, who to paraphrase him, said the eighth amendment prevents him from providing a full range of health care services.  All the evidence we have heard supports the repeal of the eighth amendment and that is Sinn F&eacute;in's position.  We believe that repeal <i>simpliciter</i>is the best option.  It is the simplest option and the one which will create the least amount of uncertainty down the road.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was unable to be present for the entire debate as I had to speak in the Chamber.  Senator Gavan and others mentioned the people who campaigned in 1983.  I mentioned my parents and other very brave people who like them were the subject of quite disgraceful and disgusting intimidation at the time.  They predicted all these issues.  We can say now that they were right when they predicted the complications that would result from inserting an issue relating to women's health care into the Constitution.  Thankfully, we will now have an opportunity to put that right but that will not be for us to decide.  It will be for us to decide as an Oireachtas if the question is asked.  The committee has made a decision with regard to not retaining the eighth amendment in full.  That could mean doing something else with the eighth amendment.  If anyone had a compelling argument to make with regard to retaining it or strengthening it then they could have come in and made it.  We would have heard it.  The simple fact is that any person who has an argument to make in that regard cannot stack it up because if he or she could stack it up he or she would have come in  here.  We gave every single person a very fair hearing.  We heard the evidence and if there is evidence there &ndash; I stress &quot;evidence&quot; not opinion &ndash; then that could have been brought to us.  If there are people outside this room who believe they have evidence for the retention of the eighth amendment &ndash; evidence not opinion &ndash; then all those people could have come before us.  I think they know that their opinion does not stack up and would not stand up to scrutiny.  That is why it was easy to blame the committee and to point fingers at us to say that it is biased, which it is clearly not, because a range of views have been expressed by all the members of the committee.</p><p>We have the <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i>which tells us clearly what we are supposed to do.  We are here to assess and review each of the 13 reasons recommended by the Citizens' Assembly and I think we have done that.  We have heard evidence and it is a fact that not one medical expert who appeared before us endorses the current system.  However one believes it should be changed, it is open to us to have the discussion but we did not hear from any one person who said let us retain the <i>status quo </i>because it is doing a good job.  I am talking about medical and legal experts.  What we heard was evidence from medical experts and legal experts all of whom support a change and repealing the eighth amendment.</p><p>The committee members hold a range of views.  I do not think anyone came with a closed mind.  We came with an open mind to hear the evidence and on the basis of that we took a democratic decision.  One can choose to believe it was pre-empted but it was a democratic decision of the committee that the eighth amendment should not be retained.  I thought that was a positive way for us to start.  The overwhelming evidence we have heard supports the repeal of the eighth amendment.  I have listened with an open mind to all the options discussed but I have not heard any compelling argument in favour of either inserting something else into the Constitution or in any way, shape or form leaving it in the Constitution.  Repeal <i>simpliciter</i>is clearly what the experts advise.  It is up to the committee to make that decision but I found what we heard from Gerry and Claire from Termination for Medical Reasons very emotional.  I have heard some of those stories before and I think it is true to say there was not a dry eye in the House.  People were very emotionally affected by their stories.  Many of us were moved to really believe that a change must happen.  We cannot keep putting families through that time and again.  I will close by saying that I look back on the work my parents and their friends did in 1983 when they campaigned.  I say to them and all the people who were involved in the campaign that they were right.  They foresaw all the difficulties which we as a committee now have an opportunity to put right.  We have the opportunity to say to people that they can now have their say.  They can hear the evidence and they can have their say with regard to the repeal of the eighth amendment.  That is long overdue.  Thank you Chairman for the way you chaired the committee.  I also thank the secretariat and our legal advisers for the manner in which the committee has conducted its proceedings.</p></speech>

Regarding Termination for Medical Reasons, not only was I here for the entire formal presentation but I spoke to the representatives outside before going in and I passed them a note explaining that I had to leave.</p><p>I had to drive to Enniskillen that night and I arrived at midnight.  It is most unfair of Deputy Louise O'Reilly to go second-guessing who attended what session.  If we were to start that, we would be here all night.  I must have been one of the best attenders throughout and the implication that I was not in touch with their particular story is utterly unjust, but also personalised in a way that I have always tried not to be.</p><p> The second issue is the serious allegation of intimidation of witnesses.  First, my preference for sitting here is my own business.  I have been around Leinster House a long time compared with Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  Those who have been around as long as I have would be able to reassure her that I am not the intimidating kind.  It was never proposed by her that there should be any limitation on the seating arrangements, but since I was again judged in such a personal way, and accused in such a personal way - this is the politics of demonisation from the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy -  I can say that was a serious allegation.  One would not deny that.</p></speech>

I consider rape and incest to be in the same category.  The reason I would like to start here is because it is often cited as grounds to allow termination.</p><p>Some people seem to prescribe that in their opinion terminations should be allowed in cases of rape and that indicates to me that it is the act of becoming pregnant that qualifies someone for a termination, not the potential life that is a consequence of that act.  There is no typical victim and there is no typical scenario here.</p><p>In the Irish context, more than four in ten or 42% of women have reported some form of sexual abuse or assault in their lifetime.  The most serious form of abuse, penetrative abuse, was experienced by 10% of all women.  Therefore, we are saying that, because these women had a man, and then a pregnancy, forced upon them, by virtue of the suffering that they endured they are deserving of a termination.  Why must a woman suffer, be violated and terrorised before people feel compassion for her?  If we are going down that route, would people think it suitable that we start inquiring as to the violence of the rape, whether it was committed when she was conscious or unconscious, whether she needed medical intervention for vaginal tears requiring sutures or cervical surgery?  Do those on this committee, those outside this committee in the Upper and Lower Houses, and those outside these walls in the real world think that the punishment that should be meted out to someone for perceived recklessness is parenthood?  Is that any way to be going on?</p><p>Does it give those who want no change comfort to know that no change means they get what they want, and to hell, literally, with everyone else?  I wonder does it make them feel victorious - what a victory they have had until now - over women the power, the control, the pervasive shame, the fear that follows us around into our homes, into our bedrooms and into our hospital theatres?</p><p>By a substantial majority, the assembly voted in favour of legalising termination when a woman's life or health is at risk, when pregnancy follows rape, in cases of foetal abnormality, for socioeconomic reasons or without restriction.  &quot;Our Constitution [by virtue of the thirteenth amendment] enshrines a woman's right to commit an act which is a criminal offence in her own country, as long as it is committed outside the State.  By any yardstick, this is a bizarre situation.&quot;  These are the words uttered by the chair of the obstetrics and gynaecology organisation in Ireland.  What vested interest, other than the health and safety of women and infants, had that man?  What bias, other than one towards safe and compassionate medical treatment, could he be accused of?  Article 40.3.3&deg; gives rise to significant difficulties for doctors practising in Ireland and has caused grave harm to women, including death.  Medical personnel have no difficulties in obeying clear legislation and medical regulation, but they are not trained for the complexities of constitutional interpretation, nor should they reasonably be expected to be.</p><p>The eighth amendment has given rise to legal cases, including the X case, the C case, D <i>v</i>. Ireland, the Miss D case, A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland, Ms Y, Mellet <i>v</i>. Ireland, and Whelan <i>v. </i>Ireland.  These are difficult and painful cases of Irish women and girls who have had to resort to stressful legal processes in the absence of comprehensive legislation on abortion.  If the eighth amendment is not repealed, this list will continue to grow and Ireland will continue to be censured by international bodies, such as the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations.</p><p>In the case of the risk to the life of the mother, it is provided for in all European countries, except Malta.  In the case of risk to the health of the mother, it is provided for in all countries, except Malta and Ireland.  Termination of pregnancy as a consequence of rape is available in all countries, except Malta and Ireland.  Termination in the case of foetal abnormality is available in all countries, except Malta and Ireland.  Termination for medical reasons beyond 12 weeks is available to a varying degree in all countries, except Malta, Ireland and Poland.  This is the truthful expert testimony that we have heard at this committee.</p><p>We also heard evidence that the rate of women accessing the abortion pill from online service providers is increasing.  We were told of the grave concern that doctors have as a consequence of this reality, and the potential harm caused by the use of unregulated medicines by Irish women and girls.  It is a matter of priority for the Oireachtas to address the reality of this situation.</p><p>We have downright Hippocratic - sorry, hypocritical - laws.  Hippocratic is different, if Senator Mullen would not mind butting out.</p></speech>

The majority of Irish people alive today were neither born nor eligible to vote on the eighth amendment in 1983.  Even the Taoiseach was only four and a half when the eighth amendment was signed into law.</p> <p>  The final decision lies with the electorate and we must facilitate democracy by producing a report that honours the expert evidence heard by both the Citizens' Assembly and the members of this committee.</p><p>The electorate is engaged on this issue.  Between ten and 12 members of the electorate per day travel outside this country for terminations.  These are not imaginary people.  They come from counties such as Galway, Tipperary, Kerry and Waterford.  They may be married and in their 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s.  They may have children, partners, mothers, sisters, aunties and friends and they all have votes.  They may not tell anyone of their decision nor ever send an email or write a letter to a local newspaper.  They may never report a journalist to the Press Council or the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, for not discussing abortion in a way they deem suitable.  They may never send a miraculous medal to politicians, beseeching them to repeal the eighth amendment.  That does not mean that those who engage in such activities are more numerous, important to consider or worthy of representation.<br/><br/>I will be supporting the repeal of the amendment <i>simpliciter </i>and encourage other members to do the same.  It cannot contain specific grounds because that would give rise to unpredictable complications, as Deputy Clare Daly earlier said.  We must vote on that first to take the next steps forward.  I trust women and doctors.  It is ironic that the volume of evidence given to the committee by doctors, professors, parents and women leaves no choice but to so do.  To say that introducing access to legal termination would create a society in which the unborn would be treated as second-class citizens is an insult to women and medics and shows a total lack of appreciation for the <i>status quo</i>whereby the women of Ireland are second-class citizens in their own country and among our European counterparts.  Much rhetoric on this issue concerns why women cannot take responsibility for their actions.  What about men?  Why can men not be responsible?  If a man was held responsible for every unprotected or unexpected embrace and had no choice but to sustain a life inside him for nine months and for a lifetime thereafter, we might have different laws, better reproductive health services and a far more considerate and liberal approach from our legislators.  Actions have consequences.  Actions by men have consequences for women and actions by legislators have consequences for everyone.<br/><br/>Pregnancies come to an end every day - some in the happiest way, some in the saddest, some tragically, some surprisingly and some alone in secret.  Senator Gavan referred to the case of Ann Lovett, who died in a grotto in Longford with her infant boy in January 1984, three months after the eighth amendment was signed into law.  It was only in 2014 that a letter written by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh to poet Christopher Daybell was revealed.  It claimed that Lovett's sad death reflected more on her immaturity than on any lack of Christian charity.  How Christian of him.  That poor, frightened, innocent teenager died alone in rural Ireland a few miles from where my father was born in Drinan, County Longford.  What did the eighth amendment do to protect her?  What has it done since for Ms Y, Ms X and all the other misses and near misses we will never hear about?  Why should we ever hear about them?  Why should we hear about their sex, their shame, their sin and their suffering?  Who are we to say that we, as politicians, know best when all the medical and legal experts one could shake a crucifix at have come before us over the past three months, begging us to be compassionate, reasonable and to legislate for repeal?<br/><br/>I have been surprised by the overwhelming interest and support my office has received over recent years, some of which has come from the most unlikely of places.  I hope that politicians of all parties and none will receive the same positive and supportive contact from people in the months ahead because I have no doubt that those who oppose repeal will seek to make their numbers appear larger, louder and more important than the silent majority who quietly exist in our constituencies.</p></speech>

A roadmap was agreed at the beginning which most members bought into and worked on diligently.  We must be very careful not to give the impression that our work here is done.  There is still a large amount to do and as much of it as possible will be transparent and public.  It is important to say that the committee has not finished its work.</p> <p>  I very much appreciate all the positive comments that have been made toward me.  As regards my attendance at a meeting of committee D of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I take my parliamentary duties seriously and was on that committee before it decided to discuss the topic of abortion.  I resisted abortion being discussed at the committee because I thought it was bad timing, to say the least.  I was very happy to have the opportunity to hear from certain witnesses from whom I did not hear at this committee.  I make no apology to anyone for doing my parliamentary duty on behalf of the people of this State.  I travelled to the United Kingdom to hear views I could not hear at this committee.  I was glad to do so and apologise to no one in that regard.</p> <p>  It is important that we do not lose sight of the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, a key part of which was constitutional change, but much effort was also made on the form that legislation should take.  We must be clear on the extent to which we want a lawful regime.  We do not want to hold up a referendum.  It  is very important that we issue a clear instruction to the Oireachtas and report to it on what the heads of the legislation should be.  I am not alone in that belief as most members hold that opinion.  We would not be doing our job as a committee if we did not report in a full way.</p> <p>  I know members are in a hurry because of a vote in the D&aacute;il.  We will come back to the issue at the beginning of the next meeting as regards-----</p></speech>

I remind members and those in the Public Gallery that mobile phones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the motion referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in relation to Ireland's participation in permanent structured co-operation pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Under the terms of the D&aacute;il motion of 6 December 2017, the committee must consider the matter and, having done so, send a message back to the D&aacute;il not later than 7 December 2017.  I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and officials from the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We will hear the opening presentation of the Minister and then take questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017120600002#A00300"><p>The following motion has been placed on the Order Paper and was referred to this committee:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s participation in Permanent Structured Cooperation, pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</blockquote> <p>I welcome the opportunity to address the committee today on the important issue of permanent structured co-operation, commonly referred to as PESCO.  In commending the motion, I will take the opportunity to remind the committee that the Government, on 21 November last, approved the formal notification by Ireland of our intention to participate, subject to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s approval of same.  Following Government approval, the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s intention to participate in PESCO has already been the subject of a Seanad &Eacute;ireann Commencement matter, on Tuesday, 21 November, a D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann Topical Issue debate, also on 21 November, and has been the subject of a number of recent parliamentary questions.  This committee also raised the matter when I attended to discuss other defence-related issues.</p><p>As members of the committee will be aware, threats to international peace and security are complex, multi-dimensional, interrelated and transnational in nature.  The ever-changing complex and intertwined nature of threats to our citizens, individual states and international peace and security cannot be denied.  These challenges are too great for any individual state, acting alone, to deal with.  The best approach for Ireland, in concert with our fellow EU member states, continues to be to ensure that the countries on the borders of the EU and beyond the European neighbourhood are stable, secure and prosperous.</p><p>Our membership of the European Union and the United Nations allows Ireland to deepen and sustain democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights through, among other things, participating in overseas peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions, which in turn will make Ireland more safe and secure.  In that regard, PESCO is a crucial mechanism which provides a treaty-based framework designed to improve the means by which EU member states can participate jointly in projects to develop capabilities that will enhance contributions to crisis management and peacekeeping operations undertaken by the EU under the common security and defence policy, CSDP.</p><p>Participation in any PESCO project is entirely voluntary and it is a matter for each member state to decide for itself whether to participate on a case-by-case basis.  While further work is required before Ireland can decide which PESCO projects we may wish to participate in, I can advise the committee that examples of the types of projects which we are currently considering include: upgrade of maritime surveillance systems; development of unmanned underwater vehicles for protection of harbours and maritime systems; a centre of excellence for EU military training missions; and cyberthreats and incident response information-sharing platform.  Ireland has been centrally involved in the development of the CSDP from the outset and has been one of the leading contributors to CSDP operations.  Ireland supports the role the EU can play in support of international peace and security with the UN at its core.  All CSDP operations to date have either been mandated or supported by the UN and endorsed in UN Security Council resolutions.  PESCO is a further initiative in strengthening the Union&rsquo;s capacity in this regard.  Speaking at the informal meeting of defence Ministers in Estonia last October, the UN under-secretary general for peacekeeping supported the initiative as potentially providing additional capabilities for UN mandated operations.</p><p>PESCO is also a means of enhancing interoperability and, working with EU partners, ensuring that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training.  A key challenge to the European Union&rsquo;s capacity to mount crisis management operations, has been a lack of essential capabilities and the political will from member states to commit the required capabilities for CSDP operations.  PESCO has been designed to address this challenge, enhancing the political commitment of member states to both develop and deliver capabilities in support of CSDP.</p><p>Participation in PESCO, which is provided for in the Treaty on European Union in Articles 42(6) and 46 and Protocol 10, was introduced under the Lisbon treaty.  Let me be absolutely clear, participation in PESCO has no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality or for the triple lock.  The participation criteria expressly stipulate that PESCO will be undertaken in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and the associated protocols and will respect the member states' constitutional provisions.  It is also important to note that participation in each project is on an opt-in basis and is, therefore, entirely voluntary.  PESCO also has absolutely nothing to do with the creation of an EU army.  Nothing in the treaties provides for the creation of an EU army and it expressly states in the Lisbon treaty protocol that an EU army cannot be created.  PESCO is simply about member states making more binding commitments to one other to jointly develop military crisis management capabilities for use in support of CSDP operations.</p><p>As I noted earlier, the participation criteria expressly stipulate that PESCO will be implemented in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and its protocols, respecting the constitutional provisions of the member states.  Three other non-NATO EU member states, namely, Finland, Sweden and Austria, have already committed to join PESCO.</p><p>PESCO was comprehensively debated in the context of the Lisbon treaty, which was approved by the Irish people when they voted on it in October 2009.  PESCO was specifically referenced in the Lisbon treaty protocol to address the concerns of the Irish people and in Ireland's national declaration.  The legislation setting out Ireland's approval process for PESCO was published in advance of that vote and enacted in November 2009.  </p><p> As a strong proponent of the important role the EU can play in support of international peace and security in support of the UN, Ireland wishes to remain engaged in all CSDP processes, as it has done to date.  Fully participating in these developments ensures that we have a voice and that we can influence the evolution of these initiatives, including PESCO.  It is important that Ireland moves forward together and at the same time as our EU partners, including in the security and defence domain, so as to protect our interests within the Union.  PESCO is a key initiative in this regard.  Participation in PESCO will also allow our Defence Forces to gain access to latest thinking and technology on capabilities of interest to them.  This will help enhance their capabilities for peacekeeping operations.  When the Defence Forces deploy overseas, we never do so alone.  We always work in close co-operation with other countries.  PESCO is a means of enhancing interoperability with project partners and ensuring that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training enabling them to be even more effective at peacekeeping, for which they are renowned.  Now more than ever with Brexit and emerging and increasing security challenges in our neighbourhood and beyond, it is important that the Union can demonstrate unity and cohesiveness.  To that end, in seeking the support of our EU colleagues on our priorities, it is important that we act in step with our EU colleagues in shared areas of concern, including on security and defence initiatives such as PESCO.  I commend the motion to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017120600002#B00200"><p>I may have to leave at some point as I must speak elsewhere.  The first point I would make is that we have never really had a national debate on our defence policy.  There is this rush today.  I do not think saying that there was a Commencement debate in the Seanad and a Topical Issues debate in the D&aacute;il is enough.  The Minister of State is now before the committee and we have four hours tomorrow to attend to this matter.  I do not think this represents an adequate debate on a move that will change our defence policy and change so much about that policy.  It is like the old saying "marry in haste, repent at leisure".  I think we can apply that to so many situations and this is one of them.  While many of us would like to see an increase in the defence budget because we know about the problems in our Defence Forces, we would like to see it going to our Defence Forces personnel, particularly to retain those experienced people and the equipment they need.</p> <p>  PESCO means that we will part of a system where there will be a military solution.  What we do consistently say about the Good Friday Agreement, for example?  This committee and the Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement have been meeting delegations from conflict areas consistently.  What we say to them concerns the importance of sitting down, listening, talking, negotiating and compromising but we are now proposing that we commit to this military solution, which could be detrimental.  </p> <p>  Last week, we discussed those two measures from the European Defence Agency programmes.  We agreed that they were relatively benign and the cost was not prohibitive but we all made the point that we are increasingly encroaching on our neutrality and increasingly moving towards militarisation.  This undermines our humanitarian work, our peacekeeping operations and the respect we are held in because of our human rights work and our role in respect of the sustainable development goals.  The Minister of State says this will make us more safe and secure.  We are safe and secure.  We are an island that is traditionally neutral.  We did not have an empire and have not created these problems that have brought threats to other European countries.  The Taoiseach says countries need to co-operate but why must this be done in a military way?  Why are we not just co-operating as we always have done in a non-threatening way?  </p> <p>  I note that Denmark has an opt-out on military CSDP matters.  Where is our role in that?  The Minister of State says there will be no EU army but yet there will be a centre of excellence for EU military training missions.  There seems to be a contradiction here.  I do not think we are in any danger.  I do not see the point of what is being proposed here.  I think it will undermine our traditional neutrality and will create more problems than the Minister of State says it will solve.  </p></speech>

I replied to written Parliamentary Questions on 16 December 2016, 17 May 2017, 12 July 2017, 27 July 2017 and 17 November 2017.  I replied to oral parliamentary questions on 11 July 2017, a Topical Issue debate on 21 November 2017 and a Commencement debate in the Seanad on 21 November 2017.  PESCO has also discussed in the D&aacute;il by the current Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach.  It was addressed in statements on the European Council on 8 March 2017, 21 March 2017, 18 October 2017 and 25 October 2017 and in oral parliamentary questions on 8 November 2017 and 14 November 2017.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee, has discussed PESCO on a number of occasions, as has the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs on 5 July 2017 and 9 November 2017.  The matter was also addressed in statements on the European Council on 25 October 2017, as well as in parliamentary questions to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  If the Deputy looks at the Lisbon treaty, she will see that PESCO is very well documented in it.</p><p>I have no issue with a national debate.  Such a debate is a matter for the Oireachtas and the people.  The Chairman has invited me here to give quarterly updates to the committee and I have committed to that.  I have no problem with it whatsoever.  I have never refused to come to this committee to debate any defence issue.  Never have I failed to come to the D&aacute;il to answer parliamentary questions or reply to a Topical Issue matter.</p><p>The Deputy spoke about our neutrality.  The final wording of the document on PESCO states:</p><blockquote>Participating Member States will meet their binding commitments, confirming that the establishment and implementation of Permanent Structured Cooperation will be undertaken in full compliance with the provisions of the [Treaty on European Union] and the protocols attached thereto and respecting constitutional provisions of the member States</blockquote> <p>This is something we had stitched into the final PESCO documentation four days before it was cleared on 13 November last.  I brought this to the Government on 21 November.  I then sent notification to the Oireachtas that the Government wished to bring this measure through the D&aacute;il before 11 December.  Our neutrality is not undermined in any way in this document.  Legal advice we have received states that we are fully compliant with our policy on neutrality.  I am very proud of the work Irish Defence Forces do at home and abroad.  The Deputy mentioned its humanitarian work.  The Defence Forces carry out a considerable amount of humanitarian work that goes unnoticed.  </p><p>The Deputy spoke about a military solution.  If she visits Mali, she will see the great work that Irish Defence Forces members are doing there to bring stability to that country.  This is the work of which I am proud.  The Deputy mentioned Denmark.  She forgot that Denmark is a member of NATO and has its own opt-out policy.  The threats we face as a country are totally different to those we faced ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  I really believe we must man up to that and be prepared for it.  </p></speech>

He said that this committee always talks about the role of our Defence Forces abroad - one could say nearly all over the world but particularly in the Middle East and in the African continent.  I am very proud of the Defence Forces and the work they do.  We visited Georgia recently and visited an EU monitoring mission along the Georgian-Russian border.  Retired members of the Irish Defence Forces headed up this project.</p><p>I have no problem with supporting permanent structured co-operation, PESCO.  We are part of the EU and I believe we should play our role.  We are living in a different and changing world.  We see horrendous terrorist attacks taking place around Europe and the world.  We discuss them in this committee and offer our condolences to the various countries involved.  If PESCO is a new way of trying to prevent terrorism around Europe it is important that Ireland plays a part in this.  </p><p> Is every country in the EU going to be part of this or is any country opting out?  If there is, the Minister might let us know why that country has opted out.  If he does not know he can have the reason sent to me by letter.  It is just for my own information because I am not aware of the situation.</p><p> PESCO allows us to opt out of any particular project that comes up and that will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Will every case in which the Army participates require a vote in the D&aacute;il or will the projects in which we participate be decided by the Cabinet, the Minister or the military?</p></speech>

The UK will not be participating with PESCO at this time due to Brexit but may participate with PESCO projects in the future, as there are provisions for third-country participation.  Portugal did not sign the notification document on 23 November but is joining following consideration via its own process.  Malta has decided not to join because it does not meet the minimum standards.</p> <p>  Section 3(1) of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides that " Notification by the State under paragraph 1 or 3 of Article 46 of the Treaty on European Union of the State&rsquo;s intention to participate in permanent structured cooperation referred to in paragraph 6 of Article 42 of that treaty shall be subject to the prior approval of the Government and the prior approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann."  At present, that is the process that is currently under way.  While there is no specific requirement to seek these approvals for any PESCO project, we can decide to participate in the interests of proving our capability on CSDP missions and in order that the Defence Forces can better themselves by participating in whatever projects are available.  </p></speech>

There is a lot of confusion about this issue.  It was discussed already today in the D&aacute;il, and it is important that we get some clarification on some of the issues.</p> <p>  What are the benefits of joining PESCO and how will it benefit the Defence Forces in their overseas missions?  </p> <p>  In practical terms, what does joining PESCO mean, and what type of projects will Ireland be participating in?  That is a question that has been asked of me.  </p> <p>  Could the Minister provide reassurances on the legal position?  He mentioned that he had sought legal advice on Ireland's participation within PESCO.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017120600002#C00600"><p>We have sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office.  The legal advice is that this does not go beyond our traditional policy of neutrality in any way.  I read an extract from the final text of the PESCO document for Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, which said that the agreement reflects a country's neutrality and its own traditional policies.</p> <p>  On the question of why we are joining PESCO, Ireland strongly supports the role of the Union in peacekeeping, crisis management operations and initiatives which enhance deployability.  Deployment capability in operations is essential.  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU co-operation in support of international peace and security under the CSDP.  Under PESCO the member states will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  It is very important that we work alongside other member states.  When we go abroad we must ensure that we have the experience of working with other member states.  PESCO will also enable the Defence Forces to develop further their capabilities in support of peacekeeping through participation in joint projects with like-minded partners.  Joint projects should also drive down the costs of developing and procuring capabilities.  Through participation in all aspects of the CSDP, Ireland has been able to influence its overall direction.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what projects Ireland will be participating in.  There are 16 projects available at the moment.  We have highlighted six, which are a centre of excellence for EU training missions, deployable military disaster relief capability packages, underwater systems with harbours and maritime aerial surveillance protection, upgrade of maritime surveillance, cyberthreats and an instant response information sharing platform.  I do not have to go into each of those to demonstrate how important they are.  We face much greater threats now than compared with those faced ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  All of the projects I have mentioned are under consideration at the moment.  </p></speech>

I heard the Minister of State list all the occasions he has answered questions in the last year.  I asked some of those questions.  I asked about Jean-Claude Juncker and he did not mention PESCO in his reply at all.  In most of the questions I asked which were not specifically to do with PESCO but involved increased militarisation and co-operation, there was no mention until very recently of a change in Ireland's attitude.  There was no inkling, until the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, said it, that there was an intention of taking such a massive step and signing up to this permanent structured defence mechanism.</p> <p>  The first Lisbon treaty was rejected by the Irish people for the very reasons that we are discussing now.  The Minister might recall, from the debates around the second Lisbon treaty in 2009, the fear and distrust the Irish people had at that time.</p><p>The Government of the time cobbled together the triple lock to try to get over the line.  We were suspicious of it at the time.  We raised our suspicions that when the time was right, a Government would take slow steps towards the eventual realisation of something akin to an EU army.  I cannot remember the name of the EU leader who was asked whether an EU army would be the end product and responded that if it quacks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p> Due to a lack of time, I have not been able to source some of the quotes I had intended to use.  I will come back to them.  I might be wrong when I say that until quite recently, Jean-Claude Juncker was suggesting there would be an EU army by 2025.  What is being put in place here is all the architecture to allow for such an army to be set up.  If there is to be an EU military headquarters, that suggests there is to be an army.  Over recent decades, efforts have been made to try to call it something else, such as a rapid reaction force or a battle group.  I remember the furore among those who said that calling it a battle group would not help it to be accepted in Ireland, even though that is exactly what it was.</p><p> We can have a debate on these issues, but the problem is that we do not have the luxury of time.  We have not had the full debate.  Most of those of us who have asked questions were involved in the Lisbon treaty debates.  We were continuously suspicious.  Last week, I raised concern about Ireland being gradually submerged into European Defence Agency, EDA, projects.  My party has not voted against these proposals in every single case.  There is logic to co-operation, but there is no logic to being subsumed or tied up in knots.  I will deal with some of the questions I have to hand.  I might come back to the others.</p><p> The briefing document on PESCO lists the commitments.  Under the heading of "costs of participation", it basically says this will not cost us anything.  One of the PESCO commitments involves regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms.  That is a commitment to spend more.  We know that average defence spending in the EU is 1.4%.  I think the figure for Ireland is 0.48%, so an increase will be needed if we are to reach the EU average.  A target of 2% has been set by Donald Trump and the other leaders of NATO states, many of which will dictate the progress that is made when PESCO is up and running properly.  The Government will have to increase expenditure from &euro;600 million to &euro;2.5 billion.  We are signing up to this substantial amount.  It will be monitored by a group set up under the process to which we are signing up, because it is not the case that we can make a commitment and leave it at that.  The commitment also will be benchmarked in other ways, for example, with regard to increased expenditure on defence investment.  As a result of another move made under the EDA, European funding will go into the European defence industry to promote research and development of military weapons or machines that can be used for military purposes.</p><p> The joint use of existing capabilities involves the pooling and sharing of resources.  When a pool is created, people can draw on it.  In light of the chaotic state of our Defence Forces, with their low numbers and antiquated equipment, I do not think many people will be looking for some of our resources.  A database of available and deployable capabilities will be developed.  We do that for the UN, as it rightly states in the briefing document.  When a certain number of members of the Irish Defence Forces are committed to the UN, they are not available for other duties.  If we commit to PESCO operations or EU battle groups, our troops will not be available for UN operations, given that no more than 800 of them at a time can be overseas.  I could be wrong with the number.  It might be lower than that.</p><p> The Minister of State might be correct when he says we can opt in and out of individual operations, but we are talking about the commitments being made in the first instance.  We are not talking about whether to involve ourselves in some of the offensive operations that are included in the list of 15 projects that have already been agreed, according to what I have been told.  I understand that another five projects will be reintroduced on Monday.  Some of those projects are quite offensive and have implications for our neutrality.  I accept that states may or may not opt into them, but I believe that our association with them could endanger Irish troops on UN duty.  We will become part of the pack rather than being set aside differently, as we have been to date as a result of our honourable tradition of working with the UN on peacekeeping duties.</p></speech>

This has been spoken about in the D&aacute;il since 2016.  I recall written parliamentary questions that were tabled to me on 16 December 2016.  Within a month of my appointment as Minister of State in May 2016, I was asked oral parliamentary questions about Ireland's plans in respect of PESCO.  I could not tell the Deputy that we were joining PESCO until we had seen the final document, which was not cleared until 7 or 8 November 2017.  I attended the Council meeting of 13 November at which the final document was agreed.  That document was brought to the Government on 21 November.</p> <p>  The Lisbon treaty is absolutely explicit in its commitments regarding what we can and cannot do.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke about a European army.  A provision in the Lisbon treaty explicitly details that this would be a matter for the people.  If the Deputy wants to change the Lisbon treaty, a referendum will be needed here.  It would not be a matter for me but for the general public, to bring about such a change.  As the Deputy has said, there is logic in co-operation.  It makes sense.  He referred to the European Defence Agency.  It is important that we co-operate with other EU states.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the spending commitments of states under PESCO.  We alone will continue to decide on Ireland's defence investment and on the deployment of our Defence Forces.  The PESCO notification provides that member states will remain sovereign and that commitments will be implemented fully in accordance with treaty protocols and the constitutional provisions of member states.  The treaty mentions spending in that context.</p> <p>  I am absolutely hammered every week about further spending in our Defence Forces.  I am very proud of the spending commitment we were able to make to the Irish Defence Forces during the lean years of the recession from 2011 to 2015 or 2016.  We managed to give equipment and capabilities to the members of the Defence Forces.  I refer, for example, to spending on ships, refurbishment of armoured personnel carriers and investment within the Air Corps.  The spending commitments we have made within our Defence Forces make sense.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the deployment of troops on a mission.</p><p>When we deploy to a mission, whether it is UN mandated, Government approved and D&aacute;il approved, each and every Member of this House has his or her say under our triple lock policy.</p></speech>

There is the content, but before that is the process through which we make this decision.  It is one thing to answer parliamentary questions, but it is only in the last few days that Members have been told that a vote was to take place on joining and participating in PESCO.  Is the Minister of State seriously trying to suggest to me that the public is aware, for example, of the detail of the 20 different commitments? Let us forget about euphemisms like PESCO.  We are getting involved in an advanced military co-operation across Europe.  Is the Minister of State going to tell me, with a straight face, that the public knows about what the D&aacute;il is deciding on this Thursday?  The public does not know.  The public does not know the details of this and does not know the implications.  One of the reasons we protested so strongly is because civil society groups, NGOs with an interest in this area and possibly representatives of the Defence Forces should be in here giving testimony to the committee as to what all of this means.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say one thing and us to say another; we need civil society actors and other stakeholders giving testimony to the committee.  This is not going to happen.  We are not taking a formal decision and there is not an adequate public debate.  It is not satisfactory for the Government to tell Members, just at the beginning of this week, that there is to be a vote on this issue.  The matter was not even discussed at the business management meeting that is supposed to order the business of the D&aacute;il last week.  How can the Minister of State seriously say that this is acceptable?  Why was this matter not signalled at the business management committee?</p> <p>  I have other questions about the substance of the-----</p></speech>

I believe the Minister of State deliberately buried the matter under the unfolding Brexit drama, albeit a very important drama.  The PESCO topic has been tactically and deliberately buried under the Brexit drama.</p><p>I now turn to the substance of the motion.  The Lisbon treaty reference is a red herring.  Most of the time during the debate on the Lisbon treaty, over a whole range of things, the Government's line at the time was to say Europe has been good to us so do not vote against Europe.  Those of us who opposed the treaty constantly pointed to the military and defence elements of the treaty and those in favour of signing up to it denied the potential implications.  In so far as there was a significant vote against that treaty it was due to concerns around this matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe knows very well that people in Ireland have a big allegiance to the idea of military neutrality and are deeply concerned about any move away from it.  This motion is not a satisfactory justification for moving ahead with this.</p><p>With regard to the substance of the motion, the Minister of State needs to explain commitment No. 1 in the PESCO commitment which reads: &quot;Regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms, in order to reach agreed objectives.&quot;  What does that mean?  It means that agreed objectives are 2% of GDP.  According to the last question the Minister of State replied to on this, I believe we are currently spending .5% of GDP.  To meet those targets we would have to quadruple current defence expenditure.  Please do not tell me this is to pay soldiers better wages.  We do not have to sign up to a binding commitment to do that.  We should pay better wages to soldiers who are on family income supplement, but that is not what this is about.  This motion is about binding commitments to progressively increase defence spending exponentially.  Is it not the case that the people who stand to benefit, and indeed who have actively lobbied for this, are those in the arms industry?  The NGO website <i>vredesactie.be</i>,<i></i>submitted freedom of information requests to the European Commission.  It discovered that between 2013 and 2016 there were 36 separate meetings between the heads of the arms industry and the Commission, all in the context of PESCO.  We have had all this lobbying by the arms industry - whose lobbying budget jumped from &euro;2.6 million to &euro;5.8 million in the same years - while we are to sign up to a treaty with binding commitments to increase arms expenditure and to increase the proportion of that expenditure for weapons and not on soldiers or their wages.  These are binding commitments and we are tied in to them.  That is what it says in the motion.  The motion makes several references to member states entering into commitments and there are constant mentions of binding commitments.  This has huge potential implications.</p><p>The Minister of State suggests that Ireland's participation in PESCO does not have implications for our neutrality, when it is clear that the architects of this proposal believe it to be part of developing the apparatus of, and a stepping stone towards, an EU army.  In 2015 Jean-Claude Juncker straightforwardly said that the EU needed an army.  I do not have all of the quotes in front of me but they say the same thing.  The Franco-Prussian axis, sorry the Franco-German axis wants an army.</p></speech>

The Minister of State can tell us it does not have implications but if the people who are driving this believe it is moving towards an army then that is what it is moving towards.  Even the term "battle groups" implies battles yet we speak about peace making and all the rest of it.  President Macron speaks of getting feet on the ground in Libya, where military action by the French and others has been a total disaster.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke of some PESCO commitments such as maritime surveillance, as though they were benign commitments, and that there would be the triple lock and so on.  Currently, maritime surveillance means a wall such as Donald Trump has not even managed to construct.  Donald Trump promised he was going to construct a horrendous, racist wall to keep Mexicans out of the United States when in fact it is the European Union that has built a wall.  This wall has resulted in 35,000 to 40,000 migrants drowning in the Mediterranean Sea because the EU does not want to let them in.  The EU then wants to boost surveillance budgets to prevent the migrants getting in.  This is what the EU is doing.  It has built the wall that Trump wants to build, and the EU is repelling these desperate people who are fleeing.  They are drowning in the Mediterranean Sea.  Many of them are fleeing precisely the situations such as those created in Libya by the French.  Why the hell would Ireland participate in this? </p></speech>

I totally disagree with him.  There will be no European army and this is in the protocols of Lisbon Treaty.  At the European Council meeting in June it was agreed to launch PESCO by the end of the year.</p><p>That was an unfinished document.  I was not going to bring an unfinished document before the House.  This has been in the public domain since my appointment in May or June 2016, when I first answered oral questions on PESCO.  Not one Member of the House came to me to say they had concerns about PESCO and ask me about it or said they wanted this or that included or excluded.  I was not going to bring an unfinished document to the D&aacute;il this year.  I was going to wait until I had the final document which we cleared at our Council meeting on 12 November.  I brought it to Government on Tuesday, 21 November and then notified the Oireachtas that I wanted to bring it before the House before 11 December.</p><p> Ireland had part of the final document, and its wording included: "Participating Member States will meet their binding commitments, confirming that the establishment and implementation of Permanent Structured Cooperation will be undertaken in full compliance with the provisions of the [Treaty of the European Union] TEU and the protocols attached thereto and respecting constitutional provisions of the member States".  That states very clearly how we got into it. </p><p> The Deputy spoke about the 2% expenditure.  That is the collective EU target.  Each member state, as within the protocols, decides what it wants to spend.  The White Paper on Defence commits us to an increase in spending, year on year.  I am criticised for not investing enough money in the Defence Forces, yet today Deputies are saying we spend too much money on them Do they want our personnel to go abroad with outdated equipment?</p></speech>

We have to update our equipment whenever necessary.</p> <p>  The maritime surveillance is a very similar project.  We participate in the European Defence Agency, EDA.  I spoke last week about EDA projects and the committee and the D&aacute;il cleared them.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that we are participating in Operation Sophia.

That allows us, as I understand, to join whenever we want.  I have been looking to find where it says we must join by a certain date or we will be locked out but I found nothing.  One of the real concerns today is that this is being rushed.  The public has no knowledge of what is going on.  This is not an insignificant issue in respect of our strategy as a country or our relationship with the European Union, and we are rushing it through with one committee meeting now and a D&aacute;il vote tomorrow.  I would like to invite the head of the armed forces here to hear his views on what benefits this would bring.  I would like to invite the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, PANA, to explain its concerns.  If, as the Minister of State says, this has been in train since June I do not agree that he had to wait until he had the final document.  We should have discussed this in detail in committee so that the advantages and disadvantages could be set out.  It is disgraceful that is not happening.  </p> <p>  This is very serious because our armed forces have brought so much to the European Union.  They have been a shining light of participation in international affairs and that has been good for the country.  The strength of their contribution is added to by the fact that we have been taking a neutral position.  However, we are exceeding our neutrality with this decision.  The Minister of State is shaking his head, and maybe we are not doing so fully but it is a step towards integration and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett says, the wording of the documents could not be clearer in that they refer to raising expenditure, binding commitments, co-ordinating with NATO, affecting the political framework in looking to streamline political decision making and the delivery of a ull-spectrum force package.  It is a strong step towards enhanced security co-operation and joint mission, as well as investment in armaments and research and development.  All the documents say that but when we put the questions here the Minister of State says it is all concerned with peacekeeping and the United Nations.  It is not, it is a case of complementing NATO and building a European armaments industry to compete with the Americans.</p> <p>  I am not too sure that will bring security to the world, in fact I am convinced it will not.  What would bring security to the world are some of the skills our Army has built up over the years in different approaches to peacekeeping, not relying on drone and satellite technology, which we funded last week, to zap people from distance, or having a wealthy developed bloc imposing military control through investment in technology and armaments.  That is what I see when I read all this.</p> <p>  It is strategically a mistake.  At our entry into the European Union we were under pressure to abandon our neutrality and join NATO.  However, at the last minute we did not have to do that and we were still able to join.  We have benefited from that and so has Europe.  </p> <p>  I was involved briefly in the Chad mission, which was an example of how our armed forces do a fantastic job in overseas missions.  There were difficulties in respect of interoperability, we had to get helicopters from the Ukraine but they did a brilliant job.  When I went to the headquarters of the mission, where 32 countries were involved, they all said it was great the Irish were leading the mission because we did not bring what the French bring.  I mean no disrespect to the French but they bring a colonialist militarist tradition and the effect of how it is seen and typically operates is unavoidable.  We do not come from that tradition and Europe benefits from us, as it does from the involvement of Denmark.  I do not see the Danish military services collapsing or not being properly funded.  We could have taken the same route as Denmark and really provided for our military while maintaining independence because that gives more security to everyone, by having voices outside this strongly enhanced co-operation, which calls for ramping up spending and capability and integrating into NATO.  This is the wrong strategic call and we are making it in the week before Christmas with minimal debate and no public discussion.  That is a terrible mistake.</p></speech>

This document was finalised in the first week in November.  On 13 November we had a Council meeting.  I brought it to Government on Tuesday, 21 November and now we are bringing it to the D&aacute;il.  The Deputy asked why we have to decide to join up by Friday.  The PESCO notification was published in mid-November, as I have highlighted, and remains open to member states to join until PESCO is formally launched scheduled to take place as part of the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, will attend on Monday, 11 December.  Notifying our intention to join PESCO before this launch means that Ireland can strongly influence the PESCO agenda and join on its own initiative.</p><p>At the moment we know that we are signing up to the minimum commitments, and if we do not sign up, we will not be able to participate in projects that will enhance the abilities of the Defence Forces to contribute to international peacekeeping missions.</p></speech>

If we defer our decision on joining, we are outside of PESCO and cannot influence its development.  We have secured language in the final document, which I have highlighted, that we were able to influence within the closing days of the document being finalised.  The notification restates the EU's commitment to multilateralism within the UN at its core. </p> <p>  There is no issue arising from this document of Ireland questioning its neutrality.  I have received legal advice on it.  It is provided for within the Lisbon treaty.  I will read the provision again: "Participating Member States will meet their binding commitments, confirming that the establishment and implementation of Permanent Structured Cooperation will be undertaken in full compliance with the provisions of the TEU [Treaty of the European Union] and the protocols attached thereto and respecting constitutional provisions of the member States".  That is a provision that we got stitched into the document before it was finalised.  It is one of the reasons that I feel comfortable with participating in PESCO.  A Deputy spoke about complementing NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  That is absolutely, totally untrue.</p> <p>  A member said that our peacekeepers have been a shining light on Ireland.  I fully agree.  I am delighted that Deputy Ryan had the opportunity to go to Chad, to see at first hand the contribution that a small country like Ireland can make to the world's most troubled spots.  He spoke about interoperability.  Part and parcel of joining up to PESCO is interoperability, which means working with like-minded states and being able to relate to them, instead of just landing on the ground, participating in a mission, and not having the experience of working with like-minded states.  It is so important that we participate in this and work with like-minded states, and that there are projects that will improve our capability as peacekeepers.  As was said, Ireland is one of the largest contributors within the EU member states under CSDP, Common Security and Defence Policy, missions. </p></speech>

I do not share many of the concerns raised at the meeting, but I respect the right of members to raise those concerns.  I want to begin by reiterating my support and that of my party for Ireland joining PESCO.  I absolutely reject suggestions that other member states are driving Ireland's defence policy.  We develop and drive our own defence policy, and we decide what we participate in and how.  That has not changed and is not going to change.  I certainly would not support such a change.</p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett made reference to the term &quot;battle groups&quot;.  The term is regrettable, however, as politicians and educated people, and people who are <i>au fait </i>with defence matters, we need to look at what that actually means.  They are training exercises, and the ones that we participate in have been mandated by the UN.  They go through this House and get its approval.  There is no difficulty there.</p><p>On many occasions during the year and a half I have held my brief, I have seen many Deputies across the House laud our Defence Forces and personnel for the fantastic work they do in international peacekeeping and peace keeping missions.  I have made the point several times that it is not a holiday we send our troops on.  They are very serious and dangerous missions.  It is not acceptable to me that one hand we praise our Defence Forces for their fantastic work, and on the other hand we do not want them to be trained as well as they can be.  We cannot operate on an insular basis.  Due to the small size of our country and our economy, we cannot do all of the defence research and development required to make sure that we have the most up-to-date training, information and capabilities.  That is why it is beneficial to us to co-operate and work with other like-minded member states.</p><p>As I have said, we do this because there are economies of scale.  Other countries have expertise in areas where we are not as advanced.  Likewise, we have a lot to offer.  We have fantastically trained people who can offer skills in certain areas to help other member states, so it is a two-way street.</p><p>In matters relating to PESCO, Ireland will have the choice to opt in.  It is on a project-by-project basis.  We are not signing up to a whole host of projects.  Rather, we are signing up to the idea that we will co-operate with other member states to the benefit of our own State.  We are also recognising that we operate in an international community.  We do not operate in a bubble.  It is not just Ireland and nobody else.  We are part of the European Union and part of the world.  There are commitments, obligations and responsibilities that come with being a member of the European Union.  That includes working towards managing crises and dealing with the ever-evolving threat of terrorism, in the form of the very sophisticated groups from whom we are trying to protect our own citizens.  </p><p>Clearly Ireland does not have the capacity to do all of the research and develop all of the technologies that our Defence Forces need to use when they operate overseas.  We know this.  We know that we are not immune to cyber-threats and cyber-attacks.  We have evidence of that in this State.  It is only a matter of time before we will have difficulties in our own jurisdiction, and we will look to other member states to help us.</p><p>I take on board the concerns being raised, but I absolutely reject the idea that this is somehow the beginning of a European army.  Again, we have the Lisbon treaty, constitutional protections and the triple-lock.  Where is the hole?  Where is the gap that means we are joining a European army?  I have seen no evidence to date that this in some way leads to that.  As for the idea that this is rushed, I personally have been aware of it for a number of months.  I feel that I have been given the opportunity to discuss this issue and read into it.  It is my brief.  It is my job to know what is happening in this, and it is the responsibility of every Deputy in the House to brief themselves.  The information is readily available.</p><p>The reason that we should not delay is that there was a clear window for signing up, and if Ireland does not sign up during that window, that has an effect.  It looks as though we are not being professional, that we are not working to the same timeline as other member states, or that we somehow have reservations about the project, which I do not think we should.  It is not a case where Ireland can wait and see.  This is not rushed because as far as I can see, the benefits to our Defence Forces and our country are very clear.  It will greatly benefit all of our serving members and the State. </p></speech>

I would like to thank her and her party for their support in this.  She is right in what she states about defence policy.  Defence policy is not about me.  Defence policy concerns the Oireachtas, and it is the democratic right of each and every Member of this House to influence it.</p> <p>  I share the Deputy's concern with the term "battle groups".  I inquired on numerous occasions about why they are called that.  It gives the wrong message.  I have had the privilege of seeing the Irish Defence Forces participating in the battle group in Sweden.  I saw the training exercises they actively participate in.  Of course we have to go through triple lock of the UN, the Government and the Oireachtas to get permission for the Irish Defence Forces to participate in the battle group.  We participate in serious and dangerous missions.  The first priority for me, and every person that has the privilege of holding the position that I hold, is the safety of our troops and our personnel, at home or abroad.</p><p>The number one priority for me and every person who has had the privilege of holding the position I hold is the safety of our troops and personnel, be they at home or abroad.  It is so important that we have the training mechanisms required for them, be they projects within the European Defence Agency or PESCO or battlegroup exercises.  It is so important for the members of the Defence Forces that they be able to participate in these exercises which help to train and equip them to participate in whatever serious and dangerous exercises in which they will be involved.  People might ask what they do.  They do some very serious work.  It is only when one is on the ground that one sees and realises the work members of the Defence Forces do on a daily basis.  </p><p> Deputy Lisa Chambers is right.  We are in a very different environment from five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  We need the help and assistance of other member states.  I was recently in Vancouver to attend the UN peacekeepers conference.  The under secretary for the United Nations repeated what he had stated in Estonia last October, that he supported the PESCO initiative as potentially providing additional capabilities for UN mandated missions.  He said PESCO was also a means of enhancing interoperability and working with EU partners, ensuring UN troops were equipped with the latest and best equipment and, more importantly, and would be trained to carry out whatever missions in which we expected them to participte.</p></speech>

Our peacekeeping troops are different from those of other countries.  There is a great respect for them and nobody would deny them the equipment, capabilities and training they needed to do the work involved which they have been doing extremely well.  However, there is still disquiet about the rush to join PESCO.  Regardless of what the Minister of State says, it is a rush.  There is a lack of public awareness.  The public should have been given an opportunity to examine the matter.  If the committee is discussing a topic, we try to bring in the different groups to hear a wide range of views.  We will not get a chance to hear other views on this matter.  We are only hearing the views of the Minister of State and the Department.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has mentioned four or five examples of the type of projects we are considering.  Did he say they were part of a list of 16?  It might be useful look at what the other possibilities are.  Our identity in terms of our neutrality, human rights and humanitarian aid will be undermined by this arrangement.  The Minister of State and his colleagues and officials are all convinced that this will not happen.  Time will tell.  We are risking an awful lot by rushing into joining PESCO without a national debate.</p></speech>

Perhaps we might receive a straight "Yes" or "No" answer.  Is there any reason we could not join PESCO later?  I know that the Minister of State wants us to join it and has said we will have more influence.  That is his political perspective.  On the formal process of joining PESCO, is it not the case that we could join next year?</p></speech>

There seems to be slippage between the terms "project" and "binding commitment".  On what binding commitments mean, the Minister of State says we can opt out of whatever "projects" we want.  I am not asking about projects but about the binding commitments to which we will sign up when we join PESCO.  Is it not the case that we will be bound to increasing defence budgets in real terms?  We will be bound to carrying out a regular review of these commitments.  I am reading from the 20 points in the actual PESCO agreement which was agreed to at the Council.  I am not paraphrasing.  "Successive medium-term increases in defence investment expenditure [...] Developing interoperability [...]  aligned with NATO standards".  That is what we are signing up to in the agreement.  We have no idea - the public has even less idea - what all of that means.</p> <p>  The Minister of State keeps referring to the Lisbon treaty which does not require us in any way to provide for enhanced co-operation.  What was signed up to in Lisbon was that there would be what was called enhanced co-operation.  There are other parts of the foreign and security policy, or defence policy - I cannot remember the exact titles - which spell out what the policies are.  When the people signed up to the Lisbon treaty, they did not sign up for permanent structured co-operation, a more advanced form of military co-operation.  We are not required to sign up to it.  The treaty simply provides for it, yet we are now making a leap.  Most people will have thought that others in Europe may do so and that we would not.  Now we are.  When the people voted on the Lisbon treaty, most believed we would never do this.</p></speech>

I can give the Deputy a copy.  To say this was not in the ether or that we were holding onto it and not letting anyone know about it is not correct.  Deputy Lisa Chambers was right when she stated she was aware of it and had been questioned on it.  It is not something we have been cooking up in small private smoke-filled rooms.  Before I leave I will give the Deputy a copy of the article published on 9 November.  It spells out clearly the way in which we had to come to a Government decision and a D&aacute;il decision to ratify our participation in PESCO.</p> <p>  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett spoke about defence spending.  It is provided in the protocols to the Lisbon treaty that as a Parliament we will decide how much we will spend on defence.  It passes through the D&aacute;il every year in the budget.  Deputies can object, express support or do whatever they want when it comes to defence spending.  The Deputy spoke about NATO standards.  Of course-----</p></speech>

If we are sending troops abroad, of course, they will have to be fully trained and equipped.  There have to be standards when sending troops going abroad to participate in peacekeeping missions.</p><p> There is one important point within this document above all others.  I spoke about the 20 points that Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised, but he keeps leaving out the point I have highlighted to him during the past hour and a half.  Participating member states will meet their binding commitments, confirming that the establishment and implementation of permanent structured co-operation will be undertaken in full compliance with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union and the protocols attached thereto and will respect the constitutional provisions of member states.

If he wishes to go down that path, I can quote from replies given by him and the Taoiseach.  They had the opportunity to say that Ireland would indicate that we would join PESCO.  The article in July referred to facing a big decision.  Usually, when the term &quot;big decision&quot; is used, the matter comes before the D&aacute;il and there is discussion on it, even if the specific details are not available.  We were all aware that this might come down the track at some stage.  The Minister of State indicated in 2008 and 2009 that the intention of the establishment parties was to subsume ourselves into common defence and security.</p><p>In response to a question from Deputy Howlin on 7 November, the Taoiseach said:</p><blockquote>Ireland will not join a European army, nor will we contribute to a common European defence budget. However, we want to be part of a common security and defence policy because we believe it is in our interests as a nation and in the interests of Europe.</blockquote> <p>That is in line with what the Minister of State has said.  That was on a Tuesday.  However, the Taoiseach did not go on to say that the Government would take the decision to join the following Monday, when the D&aacute;il was not sitting.  The excerpt quoted by the Minister of State was from the Thursday.  It said that the Government hopes to engage Ireland in a new EU military framework.  That was the first major indication Ireland was going to sign up.  Most EU countries were not expecting Ireland to sign up at this stage.  They expected that we would consider it in future.  It was a shock to most of them that the decision was made the day afterwards, although the article appeared on 9 November.  Four days later, two different articles appeared on the same day.  One suggested that we &quot;may&quot; join and that other said that we &quot;would&quot; join.</p><p>I have asked numerous questions on this.  On each occasion, the Minister of State has used the same terminology, saying that we were not joining an EU army because that does not exist or some such formula of words.  That was the opportunity for the Minister of State to say the Government was doing this, that and the other, but that did not happen.</p><p>We need to get back to some specific questions, but that is a problem.  We cannot get to the specific questions because we do not have time.  Earlier, the Minister of State mentioned that Malta cannot join because it does not have the minimal standards.  What are these minimal standards?  How close were we to these minimal standards?  What are the basic requirements?  Further to what I have read out as well as what others have said, to what exactly are we committing?  The Minister of State should not go down the road of saying that we are opting in and opting out and that we can do so.  The briefing documents states specifically that we are committing to this.  The Minister of State has tried to put across that there is no cost to the Exchequer.  He is happy to quote from the <i>Irish Times</i>.  A headline from that paper stated &quot;Greater military co-operation under Pesco presents range of costs&quot;.  Of course there are costs.  There are costs for us to carry out due diligence.  That is aside from my opposition to this because I believe it undermines our neutrality.  We also have a duty to the public to know exactly to what additional expenditure the Government is committing.</p><p>The Minister of State answered Deputy Boyd Barrett by referring to the Deputy's claims that soldiers are not paid well enough.  I have no problem with a commitment, if we are a neutral country and if we can afford it, to spending to ensure that soldiers are properly defended and have proper lodgings.  We should ensure they are not on the family income supplement.  We need to ensure that the trucks, cars, weapons, ships and aeroplanes they have are fit for purpose.  I have never had a problem with that.  I have a problem where that will be dictated by others.</p><p>Will the Minister of State explain the co-ordinated annual review on defence in respect of PESCO?  CARD is important in terms of sovereignty.  This is similar to what happened during the banking crisis.  We are exposing our budgetary system to external scrutiny.  This is referenced in the article I have before me.  The Minister of State may wish to check out who these characters are.  They are from the Dublin European Institute.  I presume those involved are not friends of mine.  Anyway, they said the Irish defence budget and planning will be subject to world-class review and scrutiny with tough questions asked requiring serious answers on how well our defence resources are being targeted at real-world security threats.</p><p>Earlier, the Minister of State answered by saying that we will have the opportunity to scrutinise defence budgets.  Anyone who has sat in this committee for the Estimates knows there is usually an hour or so to wade through the full extent of it.  We never undertake proper scrutiny of that spending.  We never discuss whether it can be spent more efficiently or whether money should have been diverted towards looking after and paying for personal protection equipment in the Air Corps and so on.  That does not come up, yet we are to have a different body that will have more time and greater ability and space to do exactly what we are meant to do.  Moreover, we do not have a say in it.</p><p>A range of other questions arise.  Will we be thrown out of PESCO if we do not achieve the targets set?  Is there a way for us to get out of this if we simply stop spending and contributing?  Is there a penalty clause?  Would that represent an additional cost if we do not achieve the targets?  Can we in any way opt out of PESCO at a future date?  I am not referring to the operations or the missions.  Can we opt out of the commitment we have given to increasing our financial contribution?</p><p>I hope I am not misquoting the Minister of State, but he said a decision to change the Lisbon treaty is for the people.  In fact, it is not.  At the end of the day it may be, but in fact it is for the Government.  The only way of changing a European treaty is for the Government to argue and put the case to all the other EU states that there needs to be a new treaty.  In turn, that new treaty has to be adopted by the other countries and the Irish people, when it is put to us.  That was our concern.  It is no longer for the Irish people alone to change the Lisbon treaty or any of the European treaties because it is a collective decision.  That was the concern.  A range of other issues arise but I will let others in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017120600002#J01000"><p>The first time I became aware of this was after the meeting between the Taoiseach and the French President, Mr. Macron.  It was mentioned in the reporting after the meeting that this issue had been raised but that the French President recognised domestic Irish political difficulties in the D&aacute;il.  When it was finally raised by the Minister of State, we started asking questions about whether it was really happening.  The Minister of State constantly says it will operate within the Treaty on European Union.</p><p>Of course it will.  Anything the EU does will be within the Treaty on European Union.<br/><br/>Further to what Deputy Lisa Chambers said, I have no problem with increasing our spending in the military area.  Our soldiers are treated very poorly under our current system, with many claiming family income supplement.  There are many issues relating to our need to improve our armed forces.  We need to ensure they arrive at peacekeeping missions with the right equipment and best resources.<br/><br/>I am concerned that this is going much further than that and is more significant.  The key document setting out the aims and ambitions is consistent and unambiguous in stating that it is &quot;an ambitious, binding and inclusive EU legal framework for investments in security defence&quot;, that it will be &quot;regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms in order to reach agreed objectives&quot; and that it &quot;should enable tangible progress on the level of investment expenditure on defence equipment&quot;.  It refers to an increase in defence investment expenditure to 20% on, I presume, armaments and 2% on research and development.  When it repeatedly refers to ambitious, binding commitments and to being progressive and ramping up, it is not hedging it's position.  It is absolutely clear that countries are in and they will ramp up together through increased expenditure.  That is what it states.<br/><br/>We do not need to hear about the Treaty on European Union again.  I understand the point the Minister of State made.  What is the legal form of that document, which was issued when the first 23 countries joined and which sets out the <i>modus operandi</i>of this institution?  What do those binding commitments that we are making mean legally?  I understand they are within the treaty provisions, but the word &quot;binding&quot; is used.<br/><br/>The annexe refers to the Council, in overviewing some of its expenditure, making decisions by unanimity.  I ask the Minister of State to explain that.  He has said that the D&aacute;il will not overview project investment decisions.  However, when it comes to policy decisions to oversee all those 20 binding commitments, what is the level of transparency for the D&aacute;il?  Do we have a veto?  On joining, is it majority voting or is it unanimity, which would give us a final say on holding back on some of the things we might not like?</p></speech>

As I have said previously, we are not legally compelled to adhere to any of the commitments within the document.  The targets are collective and not specific to any individual member state.  We can opt in or opt out on whatever basis we wish to participate in any of the projects.  We are not compelled legally or any other way to participate in any of the projects that I have spoken about.  It is a matter for each of the member states to opt in and opt out as they see fit.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I indicated to my European colleagues at the Council meeting that it was my intention to join PESCO.  Portugal has a process it has to go through.  I respect that democratic process.  I brought this to Cabinet, which approved the memo.  I am here at the committee this evening and the motion will be debated in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  I hope the D&aacute;il will approve our participation in PESCO, but that decision will be made in the Chamber.  I will bring the motion to the D&aacute;il tomorrow and my recommendation will be that people would vote to participate in PESCO.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about spending.  For whatever projects we participate in, the funding will come from our own departmental and Defence Forces budgets.  As with the EDA projects in which we participate, which I brought to this committee and to the D&aacute;il last week, that comes within our own budget.  The Members of the D&aacute;il approve our departmental budget annually as part of the budget process that we only completed recently.</p> <p>  While PESCO is entirely voluntary, I, as Minister of State, see the merits of in joining and participating in some of the projects that will be beneficial to members of our Defence Forces when they go on CSDP and UN missions.  Deputy Lisa Chambers was right in pointing out the huge benefits for members of our Defence Forces in participating in PESCO.</p></speech>

Both options are open, but each involves costs.  In the article, he allowed for the potential for gain.  The principle of PESCO is to strengthen Europe's military capabilities in specific collaborative defence projects.  That is what raises alarms.  Irrespective of what the Minister of State says, it is alarming that it can undermine our traditional neutrality because it is a military union.  I apologise that I must go back to the Chamber to speak.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State explain why this was the case?  It is very suspicious.  To underline this point, others at that meeting had asked about PESCO but there had been no comment from the Government to suggest this was coming.  There was no comment last Thursday when the business for this week was being discussed.  All of a sudden on Tuesday we were told that there would be a vote on Thursday.

I am on the committee and was at the meeting.  It is up to each Department to inform the Government Chief Whip when it would like motions to be taken.  This was not on the list of indicative business which the Government Chief Whip had.  Why this happened is a matter between the Minister of State and the Government Chief Whip.</p> <p>  I will try to go slowly this time.  I asked what the minimum standards required are.  At the outset the Minister of State said that Malta did not achieve the minimum standards.  Does that mean that it asked or that is was excluded or what happened?  That is one question which was not answered.  Can we opt out of PESCO?  The Minister of State has said that it is totally voluntary.  It may be totally voluntary to join, but once we have joined can we opt out?  Are penalties imposed if we do so?  The Minister of State has said that there could be expense involved but that we are not fully committed to it.  If there is expense involved, is a financial resolution required to allow this motion to pass?  Any measure which has funding implications is supposed to have a financial resolution associated with it.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State again confirm what is expected of Ireland in terms of the basic commitments for joining PESCO?  I am not referring to the operations or the missions.  I read out details of some such missions and others have been alluded to.  What exactly are the commitments?  Are they as stated in the briefing document which we received in terms of increasing our military capacity and military spend, co-operating with the EU European Defence Agency and so on?

That is why, for instance, we did not vote against the European Defence Agency motions last week.  I can see the practical benefits of co-operation.  Will it be a requirement to make troops available for deployment as part of PESCO missions, some of which we have listed?  Those missions could include peacemaking, post-conflict stabilisation, disarmament operations or support for third countries in combatting terrorism.  Those are some of the mission specifications which were outlined in the Lisbon treaty.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State expect that this move by the European Union states will increase the militarisation of Europe by increasing the spend on military equipment?  I do not necessarily mean only Ireland's spend, but that of EU states in general.  I understand the logic of having similar equipment.  The intention or expectation is that there will be an increase in military spend.  For instance, there is defence fund of &euro;5 billion to buy newer, more modern weapons.  I do not know whether that means more lethal or just more effective.</p></speech>

I will take some of my statement as read but I will highlight a few points.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to bring forward this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 38 this morning.  The total additional funding I am seeking for 2017 is &euro;195 million.  Of this, &euro;40 million is for a winter programme and &euro;155 million is towards overspends in non-performance related areas of the HSE.  While the amount sought is significant in monetary terms, it is important to point out that it represents less than 1.4% of overall health expenditure this year and is indicative of the particular challenges to be balanced in health and the priority the Government attaches to addressing areas of particular concern.</p> <p>  It is fair to say that the improving economy has made extra spending on health and other priority areas of public expenditure possible.  We need to keep our economy strong so that we can continue to develop our health infrastructure and the provision of our health services into the future.  The mid-year expenditure report highlighted the issue of health funding as a major policy challenge, not just in this country but internationally.  Despite welcome increases in recent years, a financial challenge remains as we deal with a larger and older population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs of payments under the State Claims Agency are also rising, increasing the cost of health above that necessary to meet the health demands of our changing population.</p> <p>  This year, the anticipated level of overspend by the HSE is linked to the impact of the 2017 pay agreements for which the health service was not funded, State Claims Agency settlements being above budget, a shortfall in income in the acute hospital sector and expenditure in a number of service areas.  The HSE, through its performance and evaluation framework, has undertaken to reduce the level of the final potential overrun in the performance areas.  I am aware of both the limited Exchequer funds available and the need to ensure that poor financial performance is not rewarded.  In this Supplementary Estimate, we are addressing the funding requirement arising from decisions made subsequent to the national service plan, particularly central wage agreements and shortfalls arising from items outside of the management's control of the health service, such as income shortfalls and the overrun in settlements by the State Claims Agency.  It is important to say that these items are outside the immediate and direct control of my Department and the HSE and are as a result of central decisions made by Government since last year's budget or by the actions of third parties.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that this year's economic performance has provided us with the scope to increase budgets again, providing &euro;40 million for the early commencement of a range of measures to address winter pressures.  This will provide additional acute hospital capacity, long-stay and home support for older people and measures in primary care.  The 2018 budget will allow for further developments in these areas, as well as in areas like new drugs, the national cancer strategy, the national maternity strategy and the continued development of the National Ambulance Service.  I also welcome the fact that, in general, where service improvements were approved and implemented in 2017, the funding is in place for 2018 for their continuation.  This is important.  We cannot have stop-start measures in the health service.  When we fund something in one year, we want to be able to continue that and, indeed, grow it where possible in the next.</p> <p>  I will now set out briefly the items that make up this year's Supplementary Estimate.  The sum of &euro;50 million relates to the State Claims Agency.  I have already outlined the rationale behind that sum.  A total of &euro;75 million of the Supplementary Estimate relates to central pay decisions taken after the 2017 budget was finalised.  This funding primarily relates to the acceleration of the Lansdowne Road agreement and the reinstatement of the non-consultant hospital doctor living out allowance.  Members will be well aware of the decision to bring forward earlier payments under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Obviously, that has had a knock-on effect in the context of a health service that employs over 100,000 people.  A total of &euro;30 million of the Supplementary Estimate relates to a shortfall in income generated in acute hospitals.  The core purpose of the public health system is to provide services for public patients.  Nonetheless, as we have discussed on many occasions, historically and currently a proportion of activity in public hospitals involves the provision of care to private patients.  It is only right and proper that insurance companies make a contribution to the cost of using our public facilities.  In his 2010 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General identified that for 50% of private patients, no private inpatient charge applied as patients were either accommodated in a designated public bed or a non-designated bed.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was implemented to address this issue.  It is Government policy that the users of private services in public hospitals should pay for the cost of providing them.  It is also important to say that a working group comprising representatives of my Department and the HSE is looking at all of these issues in terms of the public and private sectors and how they interact.  Committee members will also be aware that in the context of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, I have set up the de Butl&eacute;ir group to look at the question of decoupling private from public in the health service.  I have made my own position on that issue very clear.  I would like to see them decoupled but it is important that we consider any unintended consequences through the aforementioned group.</p> <p>  Finally, &euro;40 million of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;195 million relates to measures to improve scheduled and unscheduled care.  Members will be aware that this money will allow for the early commencement of a range of measures aimed at alleviating pressure in our acute hospital system.  It is made up of &euro;30 million for winter and unscheduled care measures and &euro;10 million for further work through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and the HSE's waiting list initiatives.  There are lots of figures out there relating to waiting lists.  Sometimes it is quite hard to digest the very significant range of figures out there and to what each list refers.  In that context, Trinity College in Dublin is doing work on how best to record and report waiting list figures so that we can have accurate data comparable with that of other countries.  It is important to say that the numbers on inpatient and day case waiting lists, that is, the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure has fallen for three months in a row and I expect that trend to continue into 2018.</p> <p>  In view of the fact that the items giving rise to these increased costs are, in the main, outside the immediate and direct control of the HSE or are in an area in which we would like to make further improvements in terms of scheduled and unscheduled care, this request for a Supplementary Estimate is fair and reasonable.  This additional funding combined with the 2018 budget provision is a practical example of how we are now reinvesting in our health service.  I seek the committee's approval for this Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

The Minister went through the various reasons for needing a Supplementary Estimate.  He referenced issues that are outside the control of the HSE, that is, costs that arise from third-party decisions, including pay awards.  He also referred to decisions that were made subsequent to the national service plan, particularly central wage agreements and shortfalls arising from items outside the control of management such as income shortfalls and overruns.  I can understand how overruns cause difficulties and there is legislation coming down the track to address the issue of periodic payments.  That should address some of these matters.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on the shortfall arising from wage agreements.</p><p>Will this assist in funding section 38 bodies which are in as much difficulty as the HSE is because of central wage agreements?  Are they expected to fund that out of cuts in services or will this Supplementary Estimate be available to those entities and organisations that find compliance with the wage agreement impossible and have to cut back services?</p><p> The provision for capital expenditure this year was &euro;454 million.  How much of that is for the children's hospital?  I do not need a detailed breakdown but how much has been incurred to date or will be by the end of the year for the children's hospital?</p></speech>

While I am digging that out, I will address section 38 and 39 bodies.  Section 38 bodies are covered.  If one works for a section 38 body, one's status is similar to that of a public servant.  Section 39 bodies, as the Deputy and I know, are in quite a different situation.  We have a number of section 39 organisations which provide services that our citizens benefit from.  The people working in them do not have the same status of being a public servant.  Their employment situation is legally different and I think that is fair.  I am conscious that a number of these organisations have outlined to me, and I am sure to Deputy Kelleher and many Members of the Oireachtas, their concerns that they had paycuts during the difficult years and that they may not be in a position to be competitive in recruiting staff to provide services.  No service should be cut because we provide grants and service level agreements for specific services to be provided.  The Taoiseach outlined in exchange with Deputy Kelleher's leader in the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago that he asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I to engage in this and see if a way forward can be found.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate that I am bringing today does not relate to section 39 bodies but we are examining the issue.  It is important to say that section 39 bodies are different.  They are grant aided.  The HSE has service level agreements in place with voluntary providers in exchange for a level of service but employees of section 39 organisations are not public servants and therefore are not encompassed by public service stability agreements.  This means that they were not subjected in a legal sense to the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation which imposed pay reductions.  I understand, and have heard from many of them, that for a variety of reasons, pay was cut in those organisations.  I am committed to working with Government colleagues to try to find a process or way forward for what is a complex issue but it is not part of this Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  I will send the Deputy a note on specific expenditure for the children's hospital project.</p></speech>

In light of Sl&aacute;intecare and the decoupling of private and public health care, we will see this happening continuously.  It did not come in as a Supplementary Estimate but will be in the original figures next year.  It is interesting that it is &euro;30 million.  I understand where all the money is going and commend the Minister on the 1.4% increase, which is not a huge amount of the budget but is still a vast amount of money.  There is a &euro;30 million shortfall in income from acute hospitals and &euro;50 million for State agencies.  We think of the money that we need.  I understand there is a certain amount of money there for the starting of the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report but this is something that we know will reorientate the health service.  A concern many people involved in the public sector and the provision of health care have is that the budget always seems to increase.  If there is an increase in demand, one can understand how a budget would have to increase but we should really look at efficiencies that can offer more for less.</p> <p>  I commend the Minister on the money that he and his Department have diverted to try to address the fall-off in the HPV vaccine.  We often see the Minister at this committee and I feel like he is almost a member of it at this stage.  He took this on fearlessly and took the advice of experts since he is not coming from a medical background.  It is a lesson to all Ministers that if experts come to one with expert advice, it should be taken on board.  We have seen a reversal in the downward trajectory of the HPV vaccine uptake.  It has gone from 50% to 61% which, as far as I know, is a first globally.  The Minister, his Department, the Irish Cancer Society and the rest of us that put our heads up when it was an unpopular thing to do and stood up for the health of the people of Ireland will hopefully go down as one of the Minister's greatest achievements.  I am sure he has plenty to come.  While we have this momentum, we should look at funding to address male vaccination.  I know we had projected it to happen in the future but now that we are on a roll, it would be my view that we should take advantage of it and that people should realise that in 30 years' time, the Minister and I will be walking down the street among women who would have been dead but for the Minister's intervention and bravery.</p> <p>  I have previously raised the Trinity College Dublin work that the Minister mentioned with regard to the waiting lists.  The number of people waiting on lists is a concern but a certain amount of rationalisation has to be done.  I have had many instances with my own children where the consultant does not want to see them for two years because he or she is waiting to see how whatever is wrong with them develops.  I was not aware that they then entered the waiting lists.  They are waiting but it does not relate to a supply of care, rather a period that has to pass before they can be assessed correctly.  I look forward to Trinity College Dublin's work on this.  When we talk about the alignment of the community health organisations and other groups, we need to know what we are counting to have an impact.</p> <p>  Will the Minister update us on what has happened with scoliosis patients in Ireland to date and what we are hoping to achieve next year?  I am sure everybody is concerned.  We are all conscious of media reports and the suffering of children waiting for scoliosis treatment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017120600002#C00600"><p>I thank Deputy O'Connell for her comments.  I fully agree with her on the value for money issue.  When I became Minister for Health, I found it somewhat astonishing that we do not have a structured programme to ensure that every euro counts in the health service.  Just like the Deputy in her own business and anybody in family life seeks to make sure that they get good value for money, there are a number of initiatives throughout the HSE but we need a more concerted and structured approach.  I hope we can act on that with regard to future service plans.  We cannot just increase the budget for health every year.  We have to see what we are getting in return for that budget.  I acknowledge that some progress has been made in recent years.  We saw, for example, the activity-based funding for our health service based on how many procedures were conducted by a facility.  There has been a commencement of linking provider payment with clinical objectives.  The Ministers, Deputies Regina Doherty and Richard Bruton, and I have addressed Healthy Ireland and paying money for school meals.  We make sure that we only fund school meals that tie in with our Healthy Ireland agenda.  We have much more to do and I would like to see a structured value for money drive in place.  Often, these things are needed in times of recession but the time to do it is actually now when the economy is growing and we are reinvesting.  We should not be complacent.  I do not think there is a citizen who does not believe that we can get better value-for-money for the health service and I hope to be able to move on that shortly.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Connell for her kind comments on the HPV vaccine.</p><p>I thank her and other members of the committee for their leadership.  Her professional background as a pharmacist meant she was not afraid to call out the nonsense, myths and scaremongering that was going on.  I have been attacked and vilified by many a keyboard warrior for my position on the HPV vaccine, as have many other people in this room and in the Houses of the Oireachtas generally, but the HPV vaccine campaign has been a very good example of collective clinical and political leadership.  The HPV Vaccination Alliance, all of its constituent NGOs, many of which Deputy O'Connell listed, have been incredible in coming together, calling out the myths, demanding that people put the facts out there and not just accepting myths as fact, which is often a risk in political debate these days.  It was never about lecturing or preaching to parents; it was about asking parents seeking to make the decision - and any decision for one's child is a very important decision one must make as a parent - to get the facts and telling them where they can get the facts.  I refer to the new website, <i>hpv.ie</i>, which provides all the information for parents along with the basic advice that if one wants medical advice, one should go to a medical professional, be it a pharmacist, doctor or other appropriate individual.  This concerted and co-ordinated effort has seen Ireland reverse what has been a global trend that when uptake of a vaccine decreases, it continues to do so.  This year, thankfully, the number of girls who have been vaccinated on foot of decisions they and their parents made will be up by well over 10%.  I instinctively agree with Deputy O'Connell's desire to see the vaccine extended to boys but, as always, I must continue to follow the medical evidence in this regard.  HIQA is carrying out a health technology assessment at present, the results of which are due next year.  If there is a positive recommendation there, we will absolutely act on it.  We should not be in any way complacent about this because while we have seen an increase in uptake of the vaccine, we cannot let our foot off the pedal on this one.  We must continue to be very vigilant and to provide factual medical information to our citizens and not to pat ourselves on the back for too long on this one because there is still a long way to go.  Nonetheless, Deputy O'Connell is right: there are women, young girls, who got the vaccine this year who will be alive in the future as a result of the increased uptake.  We need to see this trend continue, and I thank Deputy O'Connell for her work in this regard.<br/><br/>I appreciate the opportunity to provide some clarity on the issue of scoliosis because we have discussed it in this committee on many occasions.  When the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme was broadcast earlier this year, 312 children were waiting for spinal fusion or spinal procedures.  As we all know, people are placed on waiting lists all the time.  Waiting lists are not static; they grow as more children need procedures.  As of 1 December, that number has decreased to 156 patients, so we have halved the number of people on the list overall.  This is due to an incredible effort on the part of the most dedicated clinicians.  I know there was a legitimate debate about consultants and public and private care previously in this committee, but this group of clinicians has gone above and beyond the call of duty with might and main and worked additional hours with nursing colleagues, management of the children's hospital and the CEO of the Children's Hospital Group, Eilish Hardiman.  Huge work has been done.<br/><br/>Regarding the four-month target specifically, just over 60 children will be waiting over four months by the end of the year.  Obviously, we must work into our calculations the fact that time moves on.  It is still intended to meet the four-month target, but it is fair to say that some parents will have been offered treatment that for very good reasons they will not have been able to accept.  Taking one's child abroad, for example, is not an easy decision; it does not always work for families.  The assurance I am giving people today is that, whatever the number, children left waiting over the four-month period by the end of this year will have a date for early 2018 by the end of the year.  I also wish to debunk a myth I have heard and read today about the &quot;abandonment&quot; of the four-month target.  I will be very clear about this.  The HSE and I have brought together a scoliosis co-design group.  We have asked patient advocate groups and clinicians, the people actually carrying out the surgeries, to come into a room with a group chaired independently by Brian O'Mahony in order to come up with a sustainable plan for scoliosis.  They are due to make recommendations which, I think, will be published in January.  I will follow them to the letter.  We will do absolutely everything that that group commits us to doing.  The point about the four-month target is important because I have sat in rooms with clinicians, the people carrying out the scoliosis procedures, as recently as two weeks ago and they have told me that for some children the four-month target will not be appropriate, that some children will need the surgery much sooner and that other children, for a variety of other reasons, including growth spurts, may need in their medical interest to have the surgery done at another time.  We must be clinician-led in this.  I wish to be very clear: the scoliosis co-design group is a group of patient advocates and doctors who carry out scoliosis procedures.  They will come up with recommendations.  We will hire additional consultants, we will have the theatre in Crumlin open full-time and we will in 2018 have what we have never had before in this country: a sustainable scoliosis service.  We will be able to end the process of having to outsource procedures abroad during the course of 2018 as well, and we are making huge progress on this.  I am very eager that we do not have a little progress made in 2017 only for the problem to reoccur because this problem has been ongoing for years.  We will put in place a sustainable service.  I thank the clinicians for their leadership in working with the patient advocate groups.  The idea of an abandonment of the four-month target is not accurate at all.  Whatever target will be set will be set on the basis of the clinical advice of the scoliosis co-design group, and this is an appropriate way to act.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Connell is entirely correct to raise the important matter of waiting lists.  We need to be very careful when we set policy in the interest of our citizens that we know the scale of the challenge, and there is absolutely a major waiting list challenge in this country.  However, people on the M50 in the morning are not concerned about how many cars are on the M50 but about how long they will have to remain on the M50.  Therefore, we must ask what are we measuring and what is a sign of success?  That more and more people are using the health service and undergoing procedures in the health service, including procedures which were not available in some cases a number of years ago, particularly in the area of ophthalmology, is in and of itself not a problem; the problem is when people wait too long.  When the RT&Eacute; programme, which highlighted a number of very important issues, was broadcast, I said I would be fully transparent and that we would publish every list, including lists that have never before been published under any previous Minister for Health and put them all out there.  The problem now is that some people are misrepresenting the reality.  There are many different lists.  There is the active list.  This details the number of people who are actually waiting on a given day for a hospital operation or procedure.  The numbers on this list have fallen for three months in a row.  How many people are waiting for an outpatient appointment, an appointment with one's consultant?  These are very important metrics.  These are the people who are actually waiting today.  How many people are waiting for a scope today?  That is very important.  However, there are three other lists.  There is a list called two come in, TCI.  In this case one has received one's appointment date and the appointment will take place within the next six weeks.  In other cases, people's appointments have been suspended and they are on a suspended list.  Perhaps they have seen a doctor, who told them they are not medically fit for a certain procedure on a given day.  No Minister for Health can tell that doctor to go ahead and carry out that procedure.  Is that patient waiting, or is he or she not medically available for a procedure he or she has been offered?  Then there are planned procedures, which are the cases Deputy O'Connell raised, and which are perhaps the most important when it comes to people misrepresenting the lists.  People use the service regularly.  They need regular check-ups, perhaps regular procedures, and they might see a doctor today and the doctor might tell them to come back to him or her in three months time.  They get an appointment date for three or six months time and they have that appointment in three or six months time.  Are they waiting?  According to some of the figures one sees in the media, they are, but according to that patient, I reckon, if one spoke to them or their family, they are not waiting in that sense.  Rather, they will be seen at the time at which the clinician wants to see them.<br/><br/>Trinity, independent of me - the NTPF had asked it to do this - is looking at how other countries report and record waiting lists in order that we can have accuracy in this regard.  Please do not get me wrong - we have huge challenges in this area.  However, we need to know exactly where the challenge is and not try to fix a different challenge that may not actually exist in such an acute fashion.  I hope Trinity will examine other countries and see how best we should record accurate waiting lists.  This is the other thing.  We hear people say there are X number hundred thousand people on waiting lists but they are not all individual people.  Anyone might be on a list two or three times for two or three different procedures.  We therefore need to be very clear what we are measuring because I can receive from the taxpayer a significant fund of money and I need to be able to direct that into the appropriate place.  Getting the list accurate, recording the figures appropriately and showing our citizens what is going well and what is not going well and how we will fix it is very important.  I hope the Trinity group will be in a position to provide us at least with some interim guidance very early in 2018 in order that we can have an informed debate about where the challenges are and what we will do to fix them.</p></speech>

It encompasses many of the sensitive areas to which we have brought attention in the course of this year and for a number of years.  It is to be hoped that the detail provided and the specific target areas will result in a clearly identifiable result at the end of the spring.  We can talk about these matters <i>ad infinitum</i>, but putting in place the measures to deal with the issues as they present themselves is very important.  It is also a litmus test of the health services.  This challenge of waiting lists and access to accident and emergency services and elective procedures and so on has become an annual challenge.</p><p>If we do not get to a position where we can identify precisely a smooth flowing and seamless delivery of services, questions will always be asked.  What the Minister has pointed out is very important.  Who is on the waiting list?  Have they been approved for a procedure or are they awaiting diagnosis?  Is a delay required?  Unless and until these people are diagnosed and have a specific requirement, there is no use counting them anywhere.  I remember dealing with a patient years ago who was allegedly on a waiting list but he would never be put on a waiting list because he was not medically fit to go through with the procedure.  That was not said.</p><p> There are a number of matters about which I have become a little worried over the years.  It is well known that there are professionals in the system who can identify at an early date areas likely to cause problems.  In other words, they will be overly stressed or overloaded etc.  The people in those areas must be more active and let the Minister know about it at an earlier date.  It should not fall to any investigative body, including RT&Eacute; or the Committee of Public Accounts, which deals with issues retrospectively.  It should be known and identified within the system and measures should be put in place to deal with the matter.  This is instead of it dragging the system down, along with the reputation of many people within the system who work extremely hard in a very demanding and challenging area.</p><p> The number of claims has caught my eye in recent times.  Reference has been made to the claims agency and provision is being made in the area.  It is &euro;50 million.  How many of those claims would be preventable?  I know accidents happen but if accidents repeatedly happen in the same institutions, I would ask questions.  Why would they happen repeatedly in the same institutions?  For example, is there evidence indicating that in particular hospitals there seems to be continued risk of claims arising?  Quite a number of claims in the media in the past few years have been in respect of maternity hospitals.  I know accidents will happen but if due process was followed and all precautions were taken, there should not be a liability on the system.  With the best will in the world, one cannot eliminate accidents and they will happen.  There is a necessity to look again at the degree to which we see the same institutions named or involved with claims.</p><p> There is also the cost of claims.  We hear about the award, with the included legal fees.  Are we spending money wisely and could preventative measures be taken?  In order to provide a good service, we need to address such matters at an early date.  To what extent are measures or steps being taken within the health services to address those areas, with particular reference to the unfortunate hospitals that seem to be named repeatedly in respect of claims?  I am not in any way attributing blame but if they appear again and again, there are issues.  Is there a problem in the system or is the fact that it is a high-risk area the explanation?  We need to know.</p><p> There is a figure of &euro;30 million for acute general hospitals and it is good to have identified that specific area.  I repeatedly made the point over the past year that in order to solve something, one must identify the precise area that requires attention, which is causing a problem or slowing the system.  It is not rocket science and it is very simple but one needs to have the inside track and be able to identify precisely where the slow-down or shortfall is taking place.  It is a question of identifying where the system is being snagged so the issues can be addressed.  If issues must be addressed, that must be done.  There is no point in saying we cannot do X, Y or Z because it would cause upset.  Upset is caused to people who are victims of snags in the system as well.  In the past couple of days I received a reply to a parliamentary question to the effect that a patient will be waiting another 12 to 15 months for an orthopaedic procedure.  Having identified the issue and with diagnostics undergone, why is it taking 12 to 15 months for this to happen?  There must be some movement along the lines.  What if every procedure took 12 to 15 months?  Perhaps a patient has a more acute need than another at a particular time, which is correct.</p><p> The patient suffers the pain.  I am sure everybody here has come across cases where people have suffered intense pain for two or three years, and that is unacceptable.  We must put ourselves in the shoes of patients.  Having been worried and concerned about a condition and having received a diagnosis, he or she is then told to wait.  It can seem like an awfully long time for somebody in severe pain.  I will not repeat what I said at a previous meeting, which identified the extent to which patients are being recirculated through the system.  That should not be happen.  Patients are not getting treatment but are going to the accident and emergency departments.  When they are discharged, they come back through the system, perhaps twice, or three, four, five or six times.  There needs to be an examination to identify the areas with respect to which that is most prevalent.  We are moving in the right direction but we spoke of the shortfall of income in acute general hospitals.</p><p> It is important to note that when patients are admitted to hospital, they have the option to be treated as private or public.  This is moot.  What are the implications in the event of a patient being admitted to a public hospital and having an option of going private or public?  I would claim to know the answer but I would like to hear it more graphically described.  It is very important.  I am slowing as I come to the end.</p><p> I have referred to scheduled and unscheduled processes already and I will not go through it again only to say the unscheduled ultimately become scheduled.  What was not urgent yesterday could well be urgent tomorrow.  We need to be sure about such matters.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is the only way to my mind that lists can be cleared if there is a major backlog.  I cannot see how it could be done otherwise.  It is as simple as that.  If a backlog has been developed for a particular reason and we have not identified the reasons for it in the first place, we must put in place emergency measures to clear it.  It would not work any other way.  There is no use in having one reason or another for not doing it and we must do it.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that this year the anticipated level of overspend by the HSE is linked to the impact of 2017 pay agreements, which the health service has no funding for.  I understand that.  Deputy Durkan referred to the State Claims Agency requiring an extra &euro;50 million so I know the Minister will address that.  Expenditure in a number of service areas is over budget so will the Minister address what service areas they are?</p> <p>  Where is the funding for the cross-border directive procedures coming from?</p><p>Does it come from the Health Service Executive, HSE, or is it a separate fund?  Will it be an increasing charge on the State such as the reduction in the payments coming from insurance companies, which I presume will intensify as time goes on because they will be advising patients on their rights as public patients as opposed to private patients?</p><p> The Minister referred in his statement to the provision of additional hospital capacity.  He might outline the additional hospital capacity to which he is referring, which I presume is bed numbers.  He referred also to measures in primary care.  What are those measures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017120600002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputy Durkan.  On the issue of patient safety raised by Deputy Durkan and the Chairman in regard to the State Claims Agency, it is probably somewhat unusual to see the State Claims Agency as a part of the health Vote because it is an agency under the Department of Finance.  I do not believe it happens for other Departments but the logic behind it is that by keeping it on the health Vote, it forces the system to continue to learn and be acutely aware of the impact of claims in regard to the overall resources available to our health service.  It very much keeps it front and centre, and there is a logic in regard to that.</p> <p>  I am pleased to point out to the Deputy that we are making huge improvements in terms of our structures for patient safety.  To give a couple of examples, when I became Minister, I had the pleasure of being able to open a new national patient safety office within my Department last December, which is almost a year old now.  The idea is that we would have a dedicated unit within the Department of Health to drive patient safety initiatives.  In terms of what they look like, I will bring forward legislation to Cabinet this month on the licensing of our hospitals.  The best way this Oireachtas can absolutely ensure patient safety is to provide a licensing system.  In other words, if a public or private hospital or a health service wants to operate in this country, they have to be licensed by a regulator, presumably the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQAs, of this world.  That gives the State a level, so to speak, that perhaps it has not had to date, which I believe will bring into sharp focus the issue of patient safety.  I expect to make progress on that legislation this month, which will be important.</p> <p>  We also brought forward last month open disclosure provisions.  Since I have become Minister, I have met many people who have had a bad experience in the health service.  Thankfully, most people have a good experience but when I meet those who have had a bad experience, one of the comments they make to me time and again is that they just wanted to find out what happened, to be sure that it would never happen again and that people had learned lessons from it.  They just want somebody to hold up their hands and say what went wrong, why it happened and what they are going to do to make sure it never happens again.  Many of those people have found themselves with no other way of getting those answers other than going to court.  Apart from the time burden of that, which is huge, it puts a huge emotional burden, strain and stress on those people in that they have to go through a very adversarial system just to find answers.  The idea of the open disclosure provisions, which in fairness this committee considered at great length and for which I am grateful to the members, is to provide a safe space within the health service for clinicians or others to converse directly with people using the health service.  That has been sought for a very long time and it is very welcome.  Also, on the Mediation Act, the idea that we will not have an adversarial system in terms of them versus us or that the corporate entity protects itself at all costs is important.</p> <p>  On the idea of periodic payments referenced by Deputy Kelleher, people do not want to go to court for massive sums of money.  They wish these things had never happened to them or their child.  However, where they need support to address the issue is to help them care for their loved one who may now find themselves needing care for the rest of their life and they want periodic payments.  They want to know that they will have those supports for the rest of their life.</p> <p>  I am glad Deputy Durkan raised the issue of the maternity hospitals.  We had the first ever national maternity strategy published in 2016 under my predecessor, now the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  I find it incredible that before 2016 we never had a national maternity strategy.  Thankfully, we have had cancer strategies and the likes for years and they are making great progress but we never had a maternity strategy.  We now have a women and infants programme in the HSE to implement that strategy, which is mirroring the implementation structure of the cancer strategy.  All our maternity hospitals now publish monthly incident reports.  We can see monthly statements from each of our maternity hospitals so there is much greater visibility, which is very important also.</p> <p>  On the issue of waiting lists, the Deputy is correct.  He will be familiar with the fact that I am using the audit function of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to ask it to audit our hospitals to see if they are adhering correctly to the waiting list management protocol.  That protocol is clear that chronological scheduling is the most usual and fair way we treat people, but in terms of clinical priority, people who have been classified as urgent need to be seen above and beyond that chronological scheduling.  I am disappointed that audits published to date have not shown that always to be the case.  We have just gone through a comprehensive training process where the NTPF has trained hospital staff and administrators in terms of the classification.</p> <p>  The other point I want to make is on the idea of pooling lists.  We have got to move beyond the idea that if I need a hip operation and I am to be seen by consultant X but consultant X cannot see me for 12 or 15 months, I have to wait until he or she can see me when consultant Y in the same hospital group might have capacity.  There are parts of the public health service, and the Chairman and I have discussed this, that have capacity.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, group is a very good example in that it has pooled its lists.  If someone is waiting for a scope in Beaumont Hospital but there is a long waiting list in that hospital, we can offer that person one in Cavan much more quickly.  In the Ireland East group, if someone is waiting for a procedure in a busy Dublin hospital but we have theatre capacity in Navan, would they go there for the procedure?  That must become the norm.  I am pleased that it is beginning to creep into elements of the health service but it is not where it needs to be.  That is a priority for me for 2018.</p> <p>  On the issue of public-private, I agree with the Deputy, and we have had many exchanges on that.  The issue needs to be decoupled.  Ireland is an outlier in that regard.  We run the public health service for the benefit of public patients.  They pay for it through their taxes and they expect to be able to access health services in a timely manner.  That is not always the case in our country and, as a result, almost half the number of people in this country take out health insurance, not necessarily because they can afford it or want it but because they are worried that they will not get timely access.  I want to see that lessen but it is important that as long as insurance companies are generating income from citizens in this country and insurance companies are utilising public facilities, there is a contribution from the insurance industry.  We need to work our way through that issue.</p> <p>  I am glad to hear what the Deputy said regarding the NTPF.  I agree there is no time for an ideological debate on that.  We have got to use every tool at our disposal and contrary to mythical opinion, the NTPF also insources.  It does not just outsource.  In 2017, one third of its budget will have been spent on insourcing in the public health service, but I will give the Deputy an example of the difference that using the NTPF and investing in waiting lists can make.  We have seen a situation whereby the number of people who were waiting more than 15 months for a cataract procedure was 1,694 in April and it is now 421.  We will clear that list of people waiting more than 15 months.  We talk about waiting lists in a global sense but there are particular procedures that make up a huge bulk of our lists, including ophthalmology, with cataracts being a big part of that, orthopaedics and urology.  We have prioritised the area of cataracts and we are making real progress.  That list has fallen from 1,694 to 421, and we will clear that.  We must continue to home in on the specialties where there is a particular difficulty and life-altering impacts on our citizens.</p> <p>  On the issue of the cross-border directive, that is funded through the HSE.  I will get the Deputy a note specifically on how much we have spent in recent years.  I am informed it is approximately &euro;14 million this year but if he would like to see a contrast with previous years, we can arrange that.  This is an interesting one because in the past the HSE has been criticised for not making citizens aware of their rights in this regard.  Sometimes we are criticised for making people aware of their right to go abroad for treatment, but the reality is that whatever country someone lives in, if they are a European citizen they have access to health services in other European countries.  The cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme are two such examples.</p> <p>  Regarding other areas of overrun, it is fair to say they are scattered across a number of elements of the health service but the acute sector, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the largest proportion of it.  I would make two points on that.  First, when we were having this discussion last year, by the time that level of overrun crystallised in April, we would have expected it to be much larger than it ended up being.  The HSE has shown, therefore, that it can redeem itself in some of these performance areas without impacting patient services.</p> <p>  Second, as a percentage of the HSE budget, which Deputy O'Connell alluded to, the Supplementary Estimate we are seeking is approximately 1.4%.  I am confident, therefore, that the HSE has within its ability the opportunity to live within its budget.</p><p>I think it has to, but it has to do it in a way that does not alter patient services and that is where there should always be a healthy tension between this House and the HSE.  You asked me a question about private insurance, Chairman.  Have I answered that?</p></speech>

In relation to primary care, we will look at it in two ways this year.  I am hopeful that through the waiting list initiatives for 2018 we should pick a number of pilot projects to carry out procedures in primary care that we currently do in the acute hospital sector.  The one that comes to my mind and the one I wish to prioritise is the primary care eye review.  To go back to our conversation about cataracts, the ophthalmologists are very confident that they can do a lot more in primary care and free up the space in acute hospitals.  The clinical lead in that regard, Billy Power, has done really good work with the clinical community.  We can see some additional work done there through the waiting list funding available to me in 2018.  I am holding back within the Department a budget of &euro;25 million for new primary care initiatives during 2018 and I will detail them as part of the service plan.</p></speech>

Is there any restriction on the number of orthopaedic procedures hospitals can carry out in a year?  Once the target of X number of hip or knee replacements is reached, are hospitals limited in terms of carrying out additional procedures?</p></speech>

We have shown a real willingness through the NTPF to provide additional resources to public hospitals that have put up their hand and said they could do more, particularly in the orthopaedic area for hip and knee replacements, ophthalmology and scoliosis.  I expect they will be a priority for 2018.  The public hospitals that believe they can do more but feel they have been curtailed in the past by resources should engage through their hospital group with the NTPF.</p></speech>

I generally have a last point.  I know it is endemic in this place, but however.  Given that legal costs are extraordinarily high in this country, there is a case for offers to be made without prejudice to patients who feel they did not receive adequate treatment.  Full disclosure might be a help.  That would be preferable to dragging cases through the courts and then having to determine cases when other costs are added on.</p> <p>  Quite a number of the cases that come to court in the maternity area seem to refer to deprivation of oxygen and consequent brain damage during birth.  I have read about such issues and how they recur, but there are preventative measures as well.  There are ways and means of ensuring that does not happen or at least does not happen on the scale it has happened in the past or in the same hospitals on the scale that it has happened in the past.</p></speech>

The budget and costs of the State Claims Agency have a serious impact on the budget of the health service.  If there are learnings the committee believes we should be considering in the context of that and the changes we are making through legislation on periodic payments and open disclosure, I would be very interested to engage in such a process and perhaps it would be worthwhile engaging with the State Claims Agency.</p></speech>

That is fine.  I am not questioning it but I thought that was the way it would be done.  We will not inflict that suffering.  I will make some general comments then rather than going through each subhead.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to a couple of issues.  I do not wish to have a full-scale debate.  We will resume hostilities in the new year.  I met some scoliosis advocacy groups yesterday.  The target is a four-month wait for children with scoliosis.  The difficulty is that the gatekeeper is the outpatient appointment and that is the point where there are huge delays.  People are waiting an inordinate period for the initial assessment to allow them to move to the next stage, which is inpatient treatment.  That is where the waiting list develops.  We welcome the fact that waiting lists are reducing for inpatients but the reason for that is there is a slow flow of children moving from the outpatient list to the inpatient list for elective surgery.  Does the Minister understand what I am saying?</p></speech>

The Minister said there were 312 on the scoliosis waiting list at the start of the year but that is now down to about 159.  However, a backlog is already developing again on the outpatient list.  They will move to the inpatient list eventually.  We must acknowledge the situation.  I like to think I am reasonably fair but we must accept that the outpatient system is unable to assess patients in a timely manner.  When individuals are assessed they are eventually put on the inpatient waiting list, surgery is scheduled and they might be treated on time.  However, the issue is that they are not seen on time and that is of critical importance.  Approximately 80,000 people are scheduled for inpatient care but 600,000 plus are on outpatient waiting lists of one form or another.  That is a major issue of concern.  The gatekeeper is not allowing patients to flow smoothly through to the inpatient scheduled elective surgery area.  I was going to raise these issues under the various subheads but I will get them all out of the way now.</p> <p>  On the broader issue of health service funding, I acknowledge that this is a very small Supplementary Estimate.  I accused previous Ministers of presenting wholly unsustainable budgets at the start of the year knowing full well there would be &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million plus rammed through at the end of the year in a Supplementary Estimate.  At least we are getting to a more orderly management of the budget.  Some of the need for additional funding has come from third parties.</p> <p>  That is my point on scoliosis and waiting lists in general.  The Minister cannot say all the progress is due to the policies.  It is equally due to the fact that we are failing at the front-of-house stage.  In terms of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the purchase of treatments, I cannot comment on this year but it was brought to my attention in previous years that orthopaedic teams in hospitals were unable to carry out procedures because they had run out of implants.  If that is the case, is it possible for the NTPF to purchase the implants for hip or knee replacements?  It is a shame to have highly specialised teams unable to carry out procedures due to a lack of implants.</p> <p>  I have one other point.  I do not wish to delay the Minister because I am aware he has enough on his plate today.  He referred to the cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme.  The failure of Government policy is evident in what is going through the printing presses of the Oireachtas in the sense that every Deputy, mainly Government ones but Opposition Deputies as well, is highlighting the cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme.  People should know their entitlements and rights as EU citizens and Irish citizens.  A number of years ago we had some consultants who refused to advertise the National Treatment Purchase Fund in their clinics.</p><p>While the scheme is good, it is an indication of failure that we now have a situation where bus loads of people leave west Cork and travel to Belfast for cataract operations.  Deputies now feel compelled to take their constituents to Belfast for procedures because they have waited extraordinary long periods for them here.  On numerous occasions in the D&aacute;il I have mentioned the case of a 90 year old man who lives in my constituency.  He has waited years for a cataract operation and he has been told that he must wait another three or four years.  The Minister can analyse all of the success he likes.  Everybody likes to put a gloss on things and I will not take away from any of his achievements.  The idea that the waiting list system has improved dramatically is not the case.  The problem is at the front of house.  That we have yet to assess and address the issue of outpatients having to wait between one and three years for appointments when we know that they should receive treatment is the new scandal.</p><p> I thank the Minister for the delivery of the HPV vaccination programme.  The committee had tried to make traction in terms of the matter but his intervention was positive and very timely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-06a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017120600002#H00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comment.  I thank him and all politicians who are health spokespeople in this House for their leadership, which made a real difference.</p> <p>  In terms of scoliosis, I acknowledge that Deputy Kelleher has highlighted the issue of outpatients for some time.  He is entirely correct that there is an issue with the outpatient waiting list.  I should have said earlier that the scoliosis co-design team is considering a sustainable solution and will incorporate the issue of outpatients as well.</p> <p>  I disagree with the Deputy about one area.  There has been no slowing down in outpatient appointments to accommodate more inpatient activity this year.  I must say out of respect for the significant investment that has been made but, more importantly, the clinicians whom I have met that the volume of inpatient procedures they have carried out is dramatically up on last year.  What we were trying to do this year was always somewhat different from what should be a sustainable service.  It was more about throwing everything that we could to solve a significant backlog that had built up over many years and get the lists down to a much more appropriate place.  What 2018 must be about, and I am happy to be held to account on this, is a sustainable service in Ireland that does not involve telling children and their parents that they need to go to Germany or France and instead involves us saying that effectively we here in the Republic of Ireland can provide enough orthopaedic procedures to look after all of our children who need various spinal procedures.  We will get there during 2018.  When I came to office, a brand new theatre in Crumlin was closed but that has been reopened.  We have hired additional nurses.  We will hire an additional consultant again and that process will start very shortly.  By the end of this year every child waiting over four months will have either been treated or will have a date for treatment early in 2018.  I want to clarify a point about the four month target today because I do not want it to be misrepresented, not by the Deputy but in any way.  We must allow the clinicians rather than HSE managers or me to set an appropriate target.  They have said to me that they want to see some children much more quickly than four months while they feel that for others it is better for various reasons to wait a little bit longer.  We must empower the clinicians rather than impose an arbitrary deadline.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher is correct about the issue of orthopaedics and implants.  To the very best of my knowledge, the NTPF has already resourced public hospitals to carry out more procedures.  Sometimes the only thing that the public hospital might have been missing was the implants.  They may have had the theatre time and the consultants.  I am pretty certain that such work is being done and, yes, it can be done.</p> <p>  On the cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme, I agree with the Deputy that we do not want anybody to leave this jurisdiction to get health care, but under the European Union they can do so.  We know that we are in a changing dynamic in terms of the North and the UK and the scheme at the moment.</p> <p>  Sometimes we can all highlight bad cases.  It is absolutely appropriate that we highlight them.  It is absolutely appropriate that the health service and I would be held account for them.  It is also absolutely true that there are far too many bad cases.  People on waiting lists who might be watching these proceedings or following the debate would be excused for presuming that everybody in this country must wait an extraordinarily long time.  The NTPF's statistics, and not mine, show that over 50% of us will have an operation, procedure or inpatient day case in six months or less and over one third of us will have it in three months or less.  The same statistics apply to outpatients.  Over 50% of them will be treated in six months or less and over one third in three months or less.  We need a rational debate where we say some elements are going well but some are going extremely badly and what are we doing to do about the situation.  The Deputy gave cataract procedures as an example.  I agree that people are waiting far too long for the procedure.  Many more people waited far too long earlier this year and the number of people waiting far too long has significantly reduced.  I want to see the long waits eradicated.  I am sure we will have a chance to return to the topic again.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, a referral is made and no information is given to the patient or the referring doctor about how long the patient must wait for.  An appointment could turn up in six, nine, 12 or 18 months.  If a patient knows he or she must wait 18 months, he or she may make alternative arrangements.  If a patient knows he or she must wait three weeks, then the anxiety, tension and uncertainty that surrounds referrals disappears.  A definite date allows patients to make choices.</p></speech>

Part of my absolute priority in terms of waiting lists is to make sure that we have the maximum amount of information available to patients, their doctors and the public at large in order that we can make improvements where we need to while also knowing the scale of the challenge.  Part of this is electronic records which enable GPs to hear back seamlessly.  I will come back to the Chairman on the matter in the context of our plans for 2018.  He is right that we will have to do this work differently or we will end up with massive headline numbers without a proper understanding ourselves as to where the challenges lie.  As Minister for Health, I want to know where the challenges are in order that we can fix them rather than having a situation whereby people who are not waiting, in effect, in that they have a date three or six months hence because their doctor does not want to see them before then for medical reasons, is counted as waiting.  I do not think they think they are waiting and neither do I think they are waiting.</p></speech>
