We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to this committee.  I welcome everyone back and trust everyone is alive and well and ready for more work.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Josepha Madigan.  I understand she will be stepping down from this committee to take up her new post as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  It is up to the Oireachtas to announce her replacement so we will deal with that when it arises.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda are the minutes for the meetings on 11, 12 and 13 July 2017.  These were the last meetings we had before the summer break.  Are these minutes agreed?  Agreed.  The next item concerns matters arising from those minutes.  Is there anything in particular arising?  I do not think so.  The one thing I noticed was that we agreed on the last day, when looking at the accounts presented for an organisation called An Ch&eacute;im, to hold over its 2016 accounts until the next meeting.  We will have to deal with An Ch&eacute;im when we come to the list of financial statements.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  We have a long list of up to 60 items since our last meeting two months ago and this volume of correspondence shows how busy the Committee of Public Accounts is.  We will move through it as efficiently and promptly as we can while still giving everything proper consideration.  Category A correspondence concerns today's public meeting - there is none for today as we have no witnesses in public session.  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers along with follow-up correspondence and items that we requested.  All these items are for publication.  The first item in the schedule is No. 705B, dated 14 July 2017, from Claire Byrne, CEO of St. Raphael's Garda Credit Union, in relation to media coverage concerning comments made about the credit union during the committee's examination of the Garda college.  The correspondence states that the credit union confirmed to GIAS that it is happy to co-operate fully with the investigation, subject to the receipt of the appropriate lawful authority to release the information requested.  There are some items here relating to our work before the summer.  They might sound a bit dated but we have to deal with them in public.  This item is noted.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 706B, correspondence 1-2, dated 14 July 2017, from Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority.  This is in response to a request from the committee for information on Dundalk Institute of Technology's long-term contract with a sole supplier for recruiting international students, essentially from Asia and China.  The letter sets out the rationale for these arrangements, principally based on the fact that it is a unique service.  The HEA also states that it is surveying higher educational institutions in order to gather an understanding of the issues surrounding international student recruitment.  It is not particularly unique; I do not see how these services are as unique as we have been told they are and I imagine that there are a number of agencies providing similar services.  I propose, however, that we note this item for the moment and ask the HEA to keep us informed of the review it is carrying out.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 707B, received from the Higher Education Authority and dated 14 July 2017.  This concerns further information requested by the committee on contracts, following the meeting with third level institutions and the HEA on 22 June.  The committee's request was very extensive, namely, a review of all contracts for the last ten years.  The HEA has replied that the colleges contacted have stated that this requires a significant volume of work because many of the records involved are archived and some are manual.  The letter states that the HEA proposes to request that the institutions report on the engagement and associated costs of all external consultancy firms and consultants appointed to carry out investigations and inquiries into internal matters going back ten years, as well as on the engagement and associated costs of legal firms and the nature of such services going back ten years.  The HEA expects that it will facilitate detailed reporting by each institution on expenditure of specific interest to the committee in terms of internal investigations and legal advice.  I propose that we reply to the HEA advising that the committee agrees with its proposal and that the information will be reviewed when received.  What we are essentially talking about here is where investigations are carried out and outside consultants and legal firms are brought in.  The HEA is going to obtain this information and put it out on a formal basis so that we get a report in the future.  Is that okay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017092100002#B00200"><p>The HEA says that it will incorporate this into its annual report.  Will it furnish us with the full information in a separate report beforehand?  That is what we sought.  Things can get lost when they get incorporated into annual reports.  We will have a lot to evaluate there when that comes before us.  What we sought was a very specific piece of work about consultancy firms carrying out investigations and I do not really see why it would be difficult to get that information.  I do not accept that it is as difficult to obtain as the HEA says it is here, but notwithstanding that, I would prefer it if we were to get that information separately.  The HEA can by all means incorporate it into its annual report, but I would rather it gave it to us as a separate report.  Could that be requested?</p></speech>

Let us have the information we sought and if, arising from our discussions here, they change their practice and follow what has been suggested, then that is great, but give us the information we asked for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017092100002#B00700"><p>We need a report on the prior years and then current years will be covered from here on in.  We will ask for a specific report on previous years.  No. 708B, correspondence 1-4, dated 14 July 2017, is also from the HEA and concerns further information on the combined liabilities of universities and the most commonly procured consultancy firms; the salaries of the presidents of all the third level institutions; and a review of HEA procurement across the third level sector.  The review is something that members may be interested in considering further and I suggest that we note it for now.  It gives details on all the items we asked for, including the salaries of the heads of all the third level institutions, which are provided on a separate list.  Finally, it includes a very comprehensive report produced by Deloitte, reference number 708/3B, and produced on 4 May 2017.  This report is very extensive.  Nothing in it strikes me, but I think that we have to write to HEA to request a timeline of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.  It is fine to get the report but we want to make sure that some action is taken.  It is reasonable to suggest we do not just put the report on the shelf but ask the HEA to come back to us on this at some point before the end of the year.  We will give it a few months for that.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 710B, correspondence dated 17 July 2017, from Ed Silvey, director of credit institution and supervision and acting registrar for credits unions in the Central Bank.  The letter concerns St. Raphael's Garda Credit Union and states that, due to confidentiality requirements, it is not possible to provide the information requested by the committee regarding any investigation that may have been carried out into the Garda credit union.  However, sets out, in general terms, what the credit union's expectations are and we can note this.  It is standard practice for the Central Bank not to get into specific confidential items and I think we can understand that.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 711B, is an extensive letter from the HSE, dated 11 July 2017, concerning further information requested at our meeting on 15 June.  The correspondence includes information notes as requested by the committee.  Members may wish to study these and return to this.  We will be specifically engaging with the HSE in the coming week as a section 38 and section 39 organisation.  We had a list of approximately 15 questions, which have all been answered in this documentation to varying degrees.  I suggest that members of the committee study them and if anybody wishes to come back on anything, please do.  There is a lot of good information here, which we note.  I will not read out the 15 questions again.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 712B, dated 14 July 2017, and received from Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of the Health.  This provides information requested by the committee on 15 June regarding contingent liabilities; a reconciliation of outturn figures; and an explanation for the exclusion of home helps from staffing numbers.  Again, I suggest members study this and use it as they see fit.</p><p>If anyone wants to come back to it again, we can do so.  We note that.</p><p> No. 714B is from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills enclosing the 2014 KPMG report regarding allegations against Cork Institute of Technology, as requested by the committee.  The report has been redacted very heavily primarily because not to do so would identify individuals concerned.  We note this and I am sure it is a matter that will be considered in our work programme for the coming year.  It is extensive but there are a lot of redactions.</p></speech>

Perhaps the PLA needs to consult the institute's legal adviser to agree an improved version.  There will inevitably have to be some redaction if there are names mentioned.</p></speech>

We do not want to be caught up in a prolonged exchange between our legal people and their legal people.  Whatever about redacting on the basis of protecting an individual's identity, they have also redacted to take from our view the names of servers, providers and larger corporate entities.  That is the bit that intrigues me.  I do not see the rationale for doing that.  I agree we cannot proceed with this redacted version.  We should perhaps do two things.  We should proceed as the Chairman suggests in terms of the legal advisers making contact and also write directly and say to them that we want an unredacted version of the report.  They might surprise us.</p></speech>

We will follow up both.  I assure the Deputy the item will not slip off the agenda.</p> <p>  No. 715 is correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills dated 19 July in response to a request from the committee regarding the building of a boat on school premises in Carraroe, County Galway.  The Department requested the chairman of the board of management of the school to arrange for each of the issues raised in correspondence to be investigated.  The chairman responded to the Department on 4 July with a comprehensive report.  A four-page extract of the report is enclosed for the information of the committee.  The Department has also arranged for the financial services support unit to undertake a financial audit of the school's accounts and has said it will keep the committee updated.  I propose we note this correspondence.  As it follows from an anonymous source to start with, we cannot attribute it specifically to any person.  It is noted and published.</p> <p>  The next item is dated 24 July from the Secretary General of the Department of Finance following a request for information from the committee at our meeting on 6 July.  We asked ten specific questions.  He provides the information so we note and publish it.  Members are free to follow it up in any way they like and come back to it again at a further date if they want.</p> <p>  No. 719B dated 26 July is from the office of the president of NUI Galway following a request from the committee for further details on the sale of intellectual property.  We will note it and people can take it on board.</p> <p>  No. 720B is correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills following a request from the committee regarding the transfer of properties from the Sisters of Charity, in particular properties being transferred as a contribution towards the costs incurred by the State with regard to institutional child abuse.  The letter sets out the status of properties being transferred as requested.  Deputy Connolly has an interest in this.</p></speech>

Maidir leis an ceann eile &oacute;n ollscoil i nGaillimh, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis an uachtar&aacute;n nua.  Beidh an post &aacute; th&oacute;g&aacute;il suas aige i m&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir an bhliain seo chugainn.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil cuimhne ag an gCathaoirleach ar an uachtar&aacute;n a bh&iacute; anseo agus ar na deacrachta&iacute; maidir le Gaeilge.  T&aacute; ard&uacute; meanman orm go bhfuil duine faighte acu a bhfuil s&aacute;rchumas Gaeilge aige agus is as an t&iacute;r &eacute;.  Ba mhaith liom &eacute; sin a r&aacute; i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire.</p> <p>  Maidir leis an rud seo &oacute;n Department of Education and Skills, I welcome that we are beginning to get some clarification on this.  We now have a document from the Department that sets out properties without a single date as to when this process started.  I would like a comment from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are doing our best to bring accountability.  We know about the Ryan report and the deal that was entered into following that.  Properties were to be transferred.  My attention was drawn to this because of the Lenaboy site in Taylor's Hill in Galway, which is the last building on that list.  That building has been empty at least since 2009.  When this item came before us, it was confirmed that the decision was made to hand it over in 2009.  I and other Deputies raised questions about other properties.  I will be general and specific.  Precisely when was the decision made to hand over all these properties?  Where are the dates?  They should be included in the document from the Department of Education and Skills.  We should not have to drag this out given the painful history, which I will not go into here, of the children who suffered in these institutions.   When was the decision made to hand over all these properties?  Why is there such a delay?  What is going on?</p> <p>  I will finish with the specific building in Lenaboy.  It has been empty since 2009.  At the most recent meeting of the council there was a positive news story, which I welcome, that this building was donated to the council.  There is no donation involved.  It is a welcome news story but it was part of a negotiated settlement.  The questions are why it sat vacant and why it has deteriorated.  Why are we reduced to getting a positive spin on a story that it was handed over with a substantial cash contribution, which it would appear is now going towards addressing the deterioration of the building?  I think the sum to be handed over is &euro;750,000.  If this is just one building where it has deteriorated, I do not think this is the way to deal with it.  There should be absolute facts which tell us this is part of this agreement, it was to be handed over on this date, this is the delay and this is the total package.  There should not be the spin of a donation in 2017 of a building that has remained derelict since 2009.  My question is specific and general and applies to all the other buildings on this list.</p></speech>

My understanding is these properties are being transferred in lieu of cash.  There was a settlement of cash and properties.  If we have a difficulty, as an Teachta Connolly has said, where some of these properties have deteriorated such that their values have changed, does that come into it and does it mean the State could end up being short-changed again?</p><p>We are all aware of what the report contained and we have given our own views on whether the State was short-changed in any way in the context of the deal that was done.  Are we going to be further short-changed?  As a result of numerous delays, the properties are falling into a poor state and are not being maintained.  When they are eventually transferred over, money has to be spent to bring them up to standard so there is no value at all to the State.  It might even do the religious orders a favour to take them off their hands in some cases.  There are serious issues in that regard and I would like to get the Comptroller and Auditor General's view on the matter.  It is my understanding that this was part of the orders' way to pay the compensation.  I imagine that a value was attached to these properties at the time.  If the value is different now, where does that leave the arrangement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017092100002#D00200"><p>First, it is important to remember that there were two elements to the agreement.  One was a negotiated process which occurred around 2002-2003 and which involved a deal or a contract with legal obligations on both sides.   As I understand it, the agreement in 2009 was a moral or voluntary agreement whereby the congregations agreed to provide further recompense.  There is a difference between properties in respect of which a handshake occurred and an agreement was made and those in respect of which, essentially, the congregations can live up to the obligations they made or, in law, from which they could walk away.  It is important that the time factor is taken into account in all of this.  Certainly, the fact that an agreement made in 2009 to transfer properties and some of them are still not settled is a concern.</p> <p>  On the issue of value, and the point at which value is struck, my general understanding is that the value that is credited to the congregations is the value at the date of the agreement.  Any movement in values of property, either up or down afterwards, is the State's risk in the exchange.  It could be argued that properties valued in 2009 at, let us say, &euro;100 million might now, in aggregate, current market terms, be valued at &euro;150 million or &euro;200 million.  There may be those kinds of movements.  In the context of our presentation of it, we have always treated it as the value on the date the agreement was made.  Whether properties went up or down in value thereafter is a separate issue.</p></speech>

At this stage, we might write to the Secretary General requesting a detailed, comprehensive report on the two separate agreements because the public is confused as to which is the original.  We will need the dates of the original agreements and the valuation dates - let it be the date the Comptroller and Auditor General suggested - because I am sure it might have varied from religious order to religious order.  In addition, we will want to see the dates on which the transactions were finally completed and where there are some outstanding, and the specific legal reason that is preventing completion.  It may have to do with title and trusts and some of the religious institutions saying that they have to go to the Pope to get some of this signed off.  I have heard that we are down to that type of argument.  Let us crystalise this and get to the end of it.  We will ask for that information.</p></speech>

I forget the exact words but the impression was given that it was handed over.  It is now 2017.  It is a very simple question; was it agreed in 2009?  What has caused the delay?  The position is similar with every single premises that is listed.  We know where matters stand because the Comptroller and Auditor General gave us a very good report and clarified from day one the nature of the two different agreements.  Whether it is a moral or a legal issue, the orders agreed - that is what we were told - to hand over these properties.  What is causing the delay?</p></speech>

Having seen previous reports, I am aware that it has regularly been the case that the use of properties has been taken over by the State during the period in which matters relating to land registry were in the process of being completed.  I am not referring to this case.  In other instances, however, the State has used properties during the period in question despite the fact that issues relating to land registry or title deeds might not have been disposed of.  The State is in possession and has use of certain of these properties.  We need to get those things separated.  We get the point.</p></speech>

We need to do something about that, but the terrible thing regarding this situation is that it is a small number of people who were short-changed and left high and dry by an agency funded by the HSE and the State.  Wherever the legal responsibility does or does not reside, I am of the view that the Minister, as a matter of honour, needs to intervene.  That is why the committee wrote to him.</p><p>When the committee writes to him again, in addition to questioning his definition of the word "shortly", we should also state that the reason for writing is that the committee appears to be the only forum left for getting some satisfaction for the employees.  While the sum of money involved is modest, it would mean a great deal to the individuals in question.</p></speech>

The note states that a final report will be submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality and suggests it would be appropriate for the committee to make inquiries with the Department.  The secretariat has written to the Department and its response will be brought before the committee in due course.  The secretariat has also followed up with the acting Garda Commissioner following the promise he made at the meeting of 13 July last to report to the committee.  We are awaiting a response.

On that occasion, we were informed there would be no problem providing the committee with the report.  To be clear, we are seeking the data, facts, figures and rationale used when making a decision as to which Garda stations should be reopened.  We are entitled to that information and there is no reason for the Garda to fudge or delay on the matter.  What criteria were applied and how was the decision arrived at to recommend the reopening of Stepaside Garda station as against other Garda stations?  I do not understand the reason the Garda could indicate there would be no problem with the committee having that information, yet we received correspondence in August indicating we could not have it.  Given the committee's experience of dealing with the Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it would not be good if the Garda were to continue with the policy of evasion or ducking and diving as regards its interactions with the committee.  Clearly, some criteria were applied to arrive at these decisions and we want to see what they were.  I do not accept the Garda fobbing the committee off to the Department of Justice and Equality.  Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in is now the acting Accounting Officer and he is accountable to the committee.  We must write to him reminding him of the commitment he gave the committee in July.  We should state clearly that we want to know what criteria were applied, how they were applied and what methodology was used in making the decision to reopen certain Garda stations, including Stepaside Garda station.</p></speech>

Its letter answers a question it was not asked and refers to reports we did not seek.  We did not ask for a copy of the interim or final reports.  These will go before the Cabinet, which will have sight of them and adjudicate on whatever information is provided.  The statement that a final report will be presented to the Minister is a sleight of hand.  The committee did not seek the final report and we must be very strong in asking for the information we seek.</p> <p>  There appears to be frequent attempts to be fly and clever by providing responses that cover the Garda but do not provide the information being sought.  When the former assistant commissioner, who is now the acting Commissioner, appeared before the committee he had no difficulty stating the Garda would pass on the information we sought.  However, the Garda subsequently decided it would not provide this information, which raises questions as to the reasons it is not being provided.  The committee has sought this information and needs to be given it.</p> <p>  While the final report, which makes recommendations on what stations should be reopened, is obviously a matter for the Cabinet, a value for money issue arises because the reason given for closing some Garda stations in the first place was that they were not needed and closing them would save money.  Reopening some of them will give rise to costs.  The committee wants to find out what methodology was used to make these decisions and we are entitled to that information.  The response from the Garda is disingenuous.</p></speech>

If not, a political decision was made to open a particular Garda station.  If there was such a rationale, even for Stepaside Garda station, let us see what it was.</p> <p>  We were informed by the Garda that the increase in Garda numbers will create a problem in respect of accommodating new members of the force.  Some form of work planning framework must be in place to determine what accommodation will be needed in circumstances in which the workforce is expanding.  Some of the new staff will be civilians.  We could end up in a position where, having sold properties, the Garda will subsequently have to buy similar properties.  It is not only an issue of what happened in the past.  It is about future-proofing to prevent a waste of public money.</p></speech>

We all smell a rat.  According to the transcript of the relevant meeting, the then assistant commissioner and now acting Commissioner stated he would provide the committee with the information we sought.  He was speaking <i>ad libitum</i>when he indicated there would be no problem providing the information.  As acting Commissioner, he is now the most senior garda in the country.</p><p>As we all know, criteria must be applied in making such decisions.  The letter or piece of paper containing two paragraphs that we received is utterly disingenuous.  It is a borderline political response because it answers questions that were not asked and avoids the issue on which we all want answers, namely, the criteria that must have been applied when the decision was taken to reopen certain Garda stations.  If criteria were not applied, a political decision was taken for the benefit of a certain individual who sits at the Cabinet table.  The committee must see the criteria.  The Department of Justice and Equality must have decided to present this statement to the committee, through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as a holding line because it does not want to provide the information requested until it is able to back it up and put it through the Cabinet or one of its sub-committees.  I suggest the committee write to the acting Garda Commissioner demanding that he honour the undertaking he gave in response to the committee's request for information.  We should indicate we want this information by this day next week and that if it is not provided, we will find that he is not co-operating with the committee.</p></speech>

Next Monday, I will attend a policing meeting with the local chief superintendent and superintendent as well as political and community representatives at which we will discuss a programme for policing in County Meath.  Developments such as the matter we are discussing have a detrimental effect on such meetings.  The broader ramification of this discussion is that it undermines our efforts when we attend public meetings to discuss policing.  Garda stations in Oldcastle and Athboy in north County Meath and others in south County Meath have been closed or are only partially open.  When nonsense such as this comes before us, it undermines the essence of what is being discussed.</p> <p>  Previous speakers raised the methodology used in making the decision to reopen certain Garda stations, specifically Stepaside Garda station.  I wonder if the photograph of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, standing at a traffic light with a local councillor, holding a poster and giving a thumbs-up sign will be redacted when the methodology used in making the decision is published.  I am sure as hell there is not a whole lot else to step over it.</p></speech>

This is a patent exercise in evasion which is very disappointing after everything that transpired.  He made a very clear commitment to me and the committee that there was no problem and went so far as to say, when I asked him, that it would be reasonable to expect it in a day or two.  What happened between then and now?  It is not good enough for him as acting commissioner to imagine he is going to play a game of cat and mouse with us.  We must make it very clear to him, as the Accounting Officer with a direct line of accountability to this committee, that this is not on.  Surely he should have realised that at this stage given everything that has happened.  Not alone do I want a letter written to the acting commissioner, I want him to present himself here to make an account of himself, provide us with a rationale and set out clearly the analysis, data and methodology by which decisions were taken to reopen some Garda stations while leaving others closed, in particular the Stepaside Garda station.  As a committee, we are entitled to that information.</p></speech>

We now look at the letter we received in August which says a final report will be submitted to the Minister shortly.  A month after he tells us he has a report done, he is writing to us to say a final report will be submitted shortly.  He goes on to say it will be presented to the Government.  If it goes into the Cabinet, we are not going to get the Cabinet papers.  We will be told that once we follow it up at that level.</p></speech>

A commitment was given and the letter we have received from them says it was in the context of a request from the Minister in the context of the programme for Government.  He knew that when he agreed to give it to us.  Telling us that now, which is two months later, is of no relevance.  He knew that when he answered the question.

We have followed it up with the acting commissioner, but I had intended we would write to him again to remind him of the commitment and, if we had that complete, that he would be invited.  Rather than to get straight into the Garda, given that we can come to it in the work programme, we will give the Garda representatives the week to supply it.  We will tell them that if we do not receive it, they will be invited in.  We will just give them one week.</p></speech>

I want him to come here and set it out.  If the methodology is robust and this is how they went about their work, that is great.  However, we have to have surveillance of that and he needs to understand from day one and page one of taking on his duties that he is not going to mislead or fob off this committee.  We have been through that experience with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was not a good experience for anyone concerned.  It is not an experience we will repeat.  As a member of the committee, my preference is simply to cut to the chase and invite the acting commissioner in to make good a commitment he made to the committee last July.  We can have an exchange which will be a fairly short one if matters are transparent and clear.  We are entitled to surveillance of that and should not be going with a cap-in-hand attitude to the Garda.  We need to be firmer than that.</p></speech>

The note we have before us obviously did not come from the acting commissioner because Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was Commissioner on 4 August when we received it.  I am told the note we have received has come from the office of Joe Nugent, the chief administrative officer.  We are now in the situation that the deputy commissioner, who is now the acting commissioner, gave a formal commitment in public to the Committee of Public Accounts, but we now have the office of the chief administrative officer writing to us to say something completely different.  As far as I am concerned, I am now seeing a direct conflict between what I will call the civilian side of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in how it is dealing with the committee and how the acting commissioner, who was the deputy commissioner-----</p></speech>

What may potentially happen now that this has been raised, and I am sure there are lots of eyes on this issue as we are talking, is that something may be pulled together from the Department of Justice and Equality with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, go into Cabinet next Tuesday and become Cabinet documents from which we are potentially locked out.  We need to avoid that.  If we are going to bring in the acting commissioner next week, which I support, it will be a very short meeting if he can supply the criteria beforehand.

On 17 July, Joe Nugent was in contact with John O'Callaghan of the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the release of the O'Driscoll report.  That is the name on the report.

This was on 17 July.  The deputy commissioner had been here four days earlier saying he would give us the report.</p><p>We find that immediately after the public commitment the Garda administration are in contact with the Department of Justice and Equality concerning the release of it.  On 22 July, ten days later, our secretariat contacted the office wondering if there was any update.  On 4 August the secretariat received a short note back from the office of Joe Nugent, which read: "Apologies for the delay.  Please see the attached statement regarding the station re-opening."

We are aware of all of these accounts.  Some of them have very minor sums and some are dormant.  They could be tidied up.

I am not saying that there is anything wrong with the amount of accounts, but if some are dormant and tidying up is required then well and good.  We will write back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for details, to ask it to review the accounts and decide if they are all necessary and, if not, to close them down.  We are not going to examine the 130 bank accounts.  However, it seems like a large number of accounts on the face of it.  That is all I would say.  We will ask for clarification, and if it can be rationalised that is all well and good.</p> <p>  No. 751B dated end of August comes from the Department of Health, enclosing copy of correspondence sent to an individual who raised a number of matters relating to the e-health strategy, principally with the committee, on 13 July 2017.

The letter continued: &quot;I wish to advise that I will receive the Deloitte report today.&quot;  The letter was dated 15 September and it continued: </p><blockquote>I will need time to consider the report and I also intend seeking the consent of the Commission of Enquiry to share the report with the Committee.  As soon as I have considered the report and provided the Commission of Enquiry consents to my sharing of it, I will submit the report to the Committee together with any observations I may have.</blockquote><p>Here we go again.  We got an absolute commitment previously from Tony O'Brien that we would get this report.  We only became aware of it when it was mentioned in the High Court that the report existed and the cost to the charity, the funds it had lost out on, and the compensation payment in relation to dealing with that abuse case in the south east.  We have been told time and again that we will get the report, that it is not finalised, that it is going between the various parties, that Deloitte is nearly finished, that the HSE is awaiting observations, and that we would get it as soon as possible.  Now we have been told by Tony O'Brien that he will consider the matter.  Here we go again.  We have been promised the report in public and there is one thing that the Committee of Public Accounts will do.  If we get a public commitment from a public official, it will be honoured or he or she will come here to explain why he or she has not honoured a public commitment.  This committee will not have commitments given in public and the person walking out of the door thinking he or she can walk away from such commitments.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

It did not result from proactive work by the Health Service Executive.  It is the result of very painful experiences by two whistleblowers, one of whom came before us in private session.  I do not think there was a single member of the Committee of Public Accounts that did not shed a tear on the day, not for the whistleblower who deserved tears, but for her description of what Grace had gone through and what the health board had done, in the whistleblower's opinion.  This report came about through the whistleblower's creativity and that of her partner who found a way to bring the matter before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I must say the Chairman's predecessor, Deputy McGuinness, played a blinder in working with them as did the committee members at the time.</p> <p>  All of that pain and extreme effort to get before the Committee of Public Accounts involved creativity in ensuring consideration of the value for money of the tendering for the reports that the Health Service Executive commissioned and then left sitting on a desk, and in terms of that body being deprived of money and, in effect, being punished.  Our attention was drawn to minutes where it was recorded that the voluntary body should be reminded where its money came from.  The Chairman may recall all of that. </p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien receives a huge salary, had access to a newspaper on a Sunday to say that politicians were reluctant to make difficult decisions and has very strong opinions.  He has absolutely failed to provide us with a report that was produced by an independent accountancy firm on a simple matter to clarify what reduction in funding, if any, was made to a voluntary body that had gone out on a limb to support the two whistleblowers in their very difficult time.  The whistleblowers suffered that difficulty over the period from 2009 to 2017, and they continue to do so.  What in God's name did Grace and the other people placed inappropriately in foster accommodation suffer?  The Committee of Public Accounts analyses value for money but the necessary Deloitte report has not been furnished to us.  The report has nothing to do with a commission of inquiry.  It is a factual report on whether the body did or did not receive money or if funding was reduced or increased.</p> <p>  We have talked about the Garda and I fully agree with accountability.  Today's item is one on which we should stand together.  Mr. O'Brien should be brought back before the committee.  The report must be furnished to us immediately so we can peruse it and discuss it with Mr. O'Brien.  That is the least we owe to Grace, and it is the least we owe to the whistleblowers upon whom we are utterly reliant.  </p> <p>  Last Monday, I attended a Public Accounts Committees Network conference with the Clerk to the Committee, Mr. Lenihan, in Cardiff, Wales.  The one thing that came across at the conference was our utter reliance on whistleblowers.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is doing a brilliant job, as are his counterparts in Northern Ireland and England, but at the end of the day we rely utterly on whistleblowers.  If this is the way we treat them, then God help us as a democracy.</p></speech>

He then came back and revised his commitment.  He claimed that he had not been provided with the report, it had to be given to the people who would be named in it, and there were a whole lot of different things that he had not anticipated.  We had him back when the inquiry was announced and told him we could differentiate between what work the inquiry would do and what work the Committee of Public Accounts would do.  At no point did he say to us that the work of the inquiry would act as an impediment to us receiving the report.  That is a new development today.  It is a little bit like the last item we dealt with in terms of the Garda.  The approach seems to be whether we can find a way of not doing this.</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE are possibly the two biggest and most powerful organisations in the State.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for our safety and the HSE is responsible for our health.  We were given commitments by both senior officials who attended meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts before the summer break that they would provide information.  Over the course of the summer they have attempted to weasel out of their public commitments.  The national Parliament and the Committee of Public Accounts would not be doing their job if they allowed this to happen.  I suggest that both officials be brought in, in respect of their previous commitments that they gave in public, and that we deal with them.  We must make people realise that when they attend here, it is serious business.  They cannot come in, give evidence and think they are gone for 12 months.  We must put down a marker now.  I propose that we seek the report.  It is a financial matter concerning &euro;600,000.</p></speech>

We will stress this issue is strictly a financial issue and is 100% within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Other organisations of the State may choose to do so and while they do so, the Committee of Public Accounts does not stand down from its obligations to look after public funds.  This involves &euro;600,000 or thereabouts that goes from the HSE, which is taxpayers' money, to the organisation that was wrongfully deprived of that sum over a period so that it could provide the services Grace should have got over all of those years.</p></speech>

We need to learn some lessons on that as it possibly closes things down inappropriately.  For example, someone who has submitted a freedom of information request before an inquiry has been set up cannot be refused that reply on the basis that an inquiry has been set up if the FOI predates the inquiry.  There are elements of that which are important to us in learning lessons on future inquiries that might be set up.</p></speech>

However, while it is all well and good talking in this way, we need legal advice.  To me it is not a question of whether we should receive it; it is a question of our time.  I do not believe our time is best spent investigating something that has already been investigated by an authority with the appropriate level of expertise, which we do not have, and that matter will be put in the public domain.  I am not sure what is being served by us getting documentation.  The committee should be given clarity as to what we are entitled to receive and what is barred as a result of the Farrelly commission of investigation and go from there.</p></speech>

It is nothing to do with her.  I am just talking about process and our time.  In my opinion we have spent an awful lot of time on matters that are outside our purview or on the edge of our purview.  We have also spent an awful lot of time investigating matters where we do not have expertise and where others who do are investigating those matters.  There is a line that we obviously like to press up against, but on occasion we dip over it.  When it comes to an inquiry of such gravity, based on my assumption of what advices would be provided, I am not sure what purpose would be served by pursuing that and particularly corresponding with a commission like that, other than to make a headline.

It has nothing to do with a commission.  It is to do with value for money and money specifically.  I am going back; the Chairman has taken up the proposal.  I think we should just do it and get on with the business.  Mr. O'Brien has to give us the report.  We have requested the acting Commissioner to give us a report.

Therefore, we are inviting both people.  We will have the report by tomorrow from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one way or another they are invited for next Thursday, time to be agreed between the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and their office.  We will write to Mr. Tony O'Brien requesting a copy of this report by tomorrow evening and for him to be present next Thursday.  Both meetings could be very short.  If they are co-operating and following through on the public commitments, they will be very short meetings.  If they are not short, it is their call.  Given the previous evidence given by the two persons involved, we want them to explain why we have not received the information they promised in public that we would receive.</p></speech>

If the report is not here by tomorrow evening, they are to be here in person next Thursday.  The time is to be arranged because representatives from HIQA will be coming in and we might have to move the schedules an hour either way.  It is a bit early.  We cannot just sign off that.  That is the report on the Grace case.</p><p>We come to correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  No. 500C was held over from the previous meeting.  It is correspondence dated 15 May 2017 from an individual regarding evidence relating to an ongoing dispute between North Meath Community Development Association and the HSE.  The matter has been before the committee on several occasions and at the meeting on 25 May 2017, the committee came to the view that the matter was outside its remit but agreed to review the correspondence that had been sent to the Department of the Taoiseach in 2016.  The secretariat has reviewed this correspondence.  When the previous correspondence raised the matter with the Department of the Taoiseach in January 2016, it did not request any specific action.  Since then the matter was reviewed by the Department of Health, which concluded it was not appropriate to intervene in an HSE operational matter.  In March 2017 we wrote to this body, enclosing correspondence from the committee from the Minister for Health, to convey the position of the committee that this is ultimately a contractual matter and that the committee cannot provide further assistance on the matter.  We should acknowledge efforts by the HSE to protect taxpayers' money in dealing with such contracts.  I propose that we write a further letter to reiterate that the matter is outside the remit of the committee and the committee's consideration of this matter is now closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item is 698C, dated 12 July from Deputy Catherine Murphy requesting the committee to include an upgrade on the <i>www.jobsireland.ie</i>website undertaken by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the top six the committee may choose to examine in our work programme.  Can we hold that over until we discuss our work programme, which is the next item on the agenda?</p></speech>

We note that.  No. 700 is correspondence dated 13 July from Professor Des Fitzgerald, president of the University of Limerick in reply to the correspondence making the bullying complaint and stating he will investigate the matter.  We note that.</p> <p>  No. 702 is correspondence dated 13 July from Mr. Jerry Grant, managing director of Irish Water regarding procurement issues raised by the committee.  The letter states that an internal review is being carried out.  No. 717, which was received separately, is a follow-up letter to the one dated 24 July, also from Irish Water.  In it the managing director states that Irish Water adhered to all EU rules on procurement.  He went on to state that in this case a second preferred bidder for water cleaning chemicals has been appointed to address the competition issues.  Is it agreed to note and publish that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 703 is correspondence from an individual dated 14 July requesting the committee to investigate a charity involved in the welfare of horses in County Wicklow.</p><p>I propose that we write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to seek a detailed response.  As the charity in question is substantially funded by taxpayers' money, we want to see the governance arrangements that have been put in place by the Department in respect of the allocation of public funds to it.  When we get a reply from the Department, we will deal with the matter.</p><p> No. 704 is anonymous correspondence dated 16 July requesting the committee to make inquiries with the Garda Commissioner regarding the prosecution of child pornography cases.  As this matter may be more appropriate for consideration by the justice committee, I propose that we forward it to that committee.  Having looked at the matter, I cannot see how it falls under our remit.  We will send it straight to the justice committee.</p><p> No. 709 is correspondence from a company, Flow East, regarding a meeting of the finance committee with NAMA.  The secretary has sent a copy of the transcript of the meeting to the company, as requested.  That has been done and we will note that.</p><p> Correspondence, dated 14 July, has been received from Professor Des Fitzgerald, who is the president of the University of Limerick, inviting members of this committee to visit the university.  I think it would be very interesting to follow up this offer, but I cannot see how our work programme will allow it for now.  I propose that we invite to Professor Fitzgerald to thank him for extending this offer at this time.</p></speech>

It is a good invitation.</p> <p>  No. 716C, dated 12 July, is from an individual who is inquiring about the status of previous inquiries of the committee regarding public funds provided to SIPTU.  The correspondent was previously advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was investigating the matter.  The secretariat has requested an update from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation in recent days, which we await.  We will note that correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 721, dated 25 July, is from an investigations officer in the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner notifying the clerk that she is investigating a complaint submitted by an individual who had previously corresponded with the Committee of Public Accounts and whose identity was made known to an external organisation as part of the committee follow-up.  We will note that.</p> <p>  No. 722C, dated 13 July, is from the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, requesting the committee to be mindful that issues examined by the committee are within its remit.  Would any member like to comment?  I propose that we should write to the justice committee stating that while we take into account the points raised, as this committee fulfils its remit there may be a certain overlap with other committees.  I suggest we should say that while we try to avoid unnecessary duplication, as the Oireachtas should, there will be issues that are under our remit and under the remit of other committees.  We will try to make sure there is no unnecessary duplication or doubling-up of the work.  I think we will reply in that context.</p> <p>  Correspondence, dated 20 July, has been received from the secretary general of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  It is a pre-budget submission.  We will note it.</p> <p>  Nos. 424C(i) to (iii) are copies of correspondence to the Taoiseach dated 25 and 27 July from an individual alleging fraud.  We are asked to do nothing.  We will just note it.</p> <p>  No. 725C is correspondence dated 27 July from Deputy Marc MacSharry requesting the committee to examine the outsourcing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of speed detection cameras to the GoSafe consortium.

At the same time, we have to look at the overall cost.  The comparison between the income from fines and the outlay seems to be very significant.  There seems to be no targeting where they are supposed to catch so many people.  It does not seem to be related to performance in any way.  I think &euro;1.2 million a month is significant.  If we could look into this, it might be worthwhile.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily about the cost of the provision of the service.  We do not know how much it used to cost the State service provider - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - to provide this service prior to the award of the contract.  More importantly, we know from custom, practice and experience that we will not get a copy of a contract.  We will have nothing to investigate in the future other than what the gentleman to my right has said.  While I understand where the Deputy is coming from, I am not sure it is something we can get our teeth into in a meaningful way.  As a member of the justice committee - I will be a former member of it soon - I suggest it would be more appropriate for us to look not necessarily at the financial or contractual side of this matter, but at the effectiveness of this system in reducing motoring offences.  That is a matter for the justice committee rather than this committee.  I agree that the financial side of these operations would be a matter for this committee.  We are not really in a position to answer some of the pertinent questions I have asked about the overall cost of this.  More importantly, perhaps, we need to understand that it will cost us a little bit of money to ensure road users adhere to the rules of the road.  It is never going to break even.</p></speech>

We saw that with the breathalyser numbers.  People were pressurised to produce results.  I would also like to focus on the logic of this.  The idea underpinning the spending of this money is that it is preventative.  Its success is not measured in massive returns to the coffers of the State.  It is probably a healthy thing if the amount we are spending is more than the yield, with the caveat that it needs to be an accurate depiction of what is happening on the roads.  It would make sense in those circumstances.  If there was a suggestion of something improper in the awarding of the contract, I could see that we could investigate it, but other than that-----</p></speech>

I think the Road Safety Authority reports to the transport committee.  It is a matter for both.  I had a very good look at some numbers a few years ago.  They did not correlate to the areas where one sees signs showing how many people were killed on the roads there.  Higher levels of fines tend to be imposed on those driving on segregated roads with high volumes of traffic.  That is very much-----</p></speech>

How can one say a life was saved as a consequence of a change in behaviour that resulted from one of these installations being on a road?  I agree that I do not think we will be able to delve into areas other than the contractual element.  It is as much to do with transport as it is to do with justice.</p></speech>

If the cost per life saved is &euro;1 million, and that is agreeable, so be it.  It is difficult to put a price on it.  In the case of the cancer drug nivolumab, the cost per life saved is &euro;50,000, unless one goes on the Joe Duffy show to harass politicians for six months and get it approved.  If it is more than that, then that is fine.  Maybe we should write to the justice committee or the transport committee, or both.  I presume there is a metric within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which runs speed checks, to see what the costs are there.  We could find out how many are being done.  Of course we hope the figures will be accurate.  We need to be able to compare the position here with international best practice.  If we find that the amount of money being spent here is in line with how much these things tend to cost, there will be no problem at all.  How does one strike a figure of &euro;1.2 million a month?  What is it based on?  That is all.  It is fine.  Maybe we could drop a note to the justice and transport committees to ask them to look at this to ascertain whether it represents value for money, whether they are happy with the cost per life saved and that kind of thing.</p></speech>

Having carried out the 2016 audit, I am aware that the contract has been renewed.  I will have a look at the procurement and if there is any issue, I will report it.  Operationally, my understanding is that they are required to mount the checks but there is no target for them to catch.  The locations where they stand are predetermined by agreement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there has been some rejigging of that to take account of shifts in where the problems are occurring.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can turn up in many more places with much less predictability.  One sees the camera signal indicating an area where one may encounter something but that tends not to be the case with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are operational decisions and I will not be investigating them but I will report back if there is any concern around procurement.</p></speech>

We are continually told teachers are employed by the boards of management, ergo they are not State employees and if there is a problem in a school the board of management must sort it out, but they get State pensions.  There are similar issues with people on F&Aacute;S schemes and other things, who are fully funded by the Departments but told they are not State employees whenever there is an issue.  They are paid by a sponsoring committee, although they do not get State pensions.  People have their salaries permanently paid by the State but some qualify for a pension while others do not.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 735 from myself, enclosing correspondence relating to the national paediatric hospital development board.  The matter raised will be of real concern to many members and we should write to the board for a response to the issues and for an update on the board's work, including the financial position.  We were going to follow this up by bringing them in before the summer but we held off.  They seem to be moving ahead but a key element of the decision to locate to St. James's was that it was to be located at a university hospital, at a site with a maternity hospital.  The plan was for the Coombe hospital to move ultimately to that site but, from what I am hearing, I cannot see it happening in 30 years' time.  There does not seem to be the money to pay for the move of Holles Street to St. Vincent's, which will take a decade even if it does happen.  Moving the Coombe will have to happen after that.</p><p>One of the pillars on which the decision was made was co-location with a maternity hospital, which is decades away.  I just raise that point, although it probably does not come within our remit.  We always said we wanted an update on its plans from the national paediatric hospital board but we held off earlier so we will follow through on that.  When we get a response, we will decide how to deal with it then.</p><p> The next item, No. 736, correspondence dated 11 August, is from an individual regarding an appeal on a planning application.  I propose that we write to the person and state that this matter does not fall within the remit of the committee.</p><p> No. 737 is correspondence from the Department of Education and Skills relating to information requested by the committee regarding the sale of lands at Clonkeen College, County Dublin.  In its response to the Department, the Congregation of Christian Brothers confirmed that the lands in question have been sold, that it has signed and exchanged legally-binding contracts with the purchaser and that the transaction cannot be reversed.  The correspondence further states that the decision by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, a private entity, to dispose of land owned by the congregation is a matter for the brothers and the Department is not privy to the detail of the contractual arrangements or to deliberations on why the lands in question were selected for disposal.  The correspondence includes information regarding funding allocated to the college for the development of school facilities and states that the Department is not aware of any instances of sale of school lands for development purposes.  I propose to publish this reply and to send a copy of the letter to the individual who raised the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 742, dated 18 August, is correspondence from the HSE enclosing an information note as requested by the committee regarding the older persons' services from the social care division of Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, Clonmel.  This can be forwarded to Deputy Mattie McGrath who wrote to the committee about the matter.</p></speech>

The Deputy is on top of the job, which is good.</p> <p>  No. 745 is correspondence from an individual raising questions about payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the European fund for his herd of cattle.  The secretariat has reviewed the letter the Department sent to the previous committee on this matter, which includes a history of compensation payments to the individual.

Obviously, we should write to the Minister.  Ironically, the Minister has spoken in the D&aacute;il on this issue on past occasions over many years and expressed opinions on the fact that this gentleman needs solace and justice.  There is no doubt in my mind, and I am sure others familiar with the case share these sentiments, that this chap has been treated extremely badly in respect of what happened to him.  He has had no recourse.  He was dismissed from the Prison Service after basically stopping an escapee from leaving the prison.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was in the locality of Portlaoise recently and listed a number of those in the Prison Service who had done the State some service.  Amazingly enough, Sean O'Brien's name was left out of the list which is, frankly, unbelievable.  It is a fact that this gentleman stopped a prison escape.</p> <p>  It is not in the remit of this committee but, as we are all Members of the Parliament and as this is a case of natural justice, we must get it into the right forum.  We must write to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the justice committee and ask them to investigate this, or try to get to a position where we can give Sean justice.  He absolutely deserves it.</p></speech>

Members have seen the letter.  We will note it.</p> <p>  Next is No. 750, correspondence dated 8 September on behalf of Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The joint committee has decided to refer aspects of the Moran report for this committee's consideration, particularly certain audit, accounting and funding issues pertaining to the Olympic Council of Ireland.  The Olympic Council of Ireland is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and, therefore, is not within the remit of this committee.  However, the Irish Sports Council which provides the funding is.  In the first instance, I propose to circulate the report to members and if they wish to raise specific issues to be brought to the attention of the Irish Sports Council, we will write to it.  This issue has been dealt with by an Oireachtas committee.  Obviously, there are financial matters in the report and the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport has referred it to us as part of its work.  That committee has carried out its work on it.  I do not know if we should jump into the topic.  That committee has been dealing with it.  We will circulate the report to members before we take any further action.  We will hold over this item of correspondence to a future meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 751 is correspondence from the Department of Health responding to a request for a note on issues raised with the committee by an individual regarding several areas of the health system.  The Department has communicated directly with the individual and a copy of the correspondence is enclosed.  We note that.</p> <p>  No. 752 is correspondence, dated 31 August, from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, responding to issues raised by Monaghan County Council with the committee regarding EirGrid.  We will note the correspondence and forward it to Monaghan County Council.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 753 relates to an interim report on Stepaside Garda station.  This is from Deputy Cullinane and we dealt with it during our earlier conversation.</p> <p>  No. 754 is from an anonymous correspondent regarding Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council.  There are a number of accusations, most of them in general terms.  I propose that we note the correspondence.  We are not getting into that.</p> <p>  We are nearly finished.  No. 757, dated 27 July, is correspondence from Deputy Marc MacSharry requesting the committee to examine the costs incurred to date by the liquidators of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017092100002#M01900"><p>I wish to put a few matters on the record in this regard.  The liquidation began on 7 February 2013.</p><p>At the time, control and oversight over remuneration for liquidators was governed by the Companies Act 1963, which also provided for scrutiny by a committee of inspection in the High Court.  No committee of inspection has been established in respect of the IBRC or provided for in the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013.  Ordinarily these committees of inspection are made up of shareholders and creditors and their function is to assist the liquidator with approval fees and legal actions and to attend meetings on an ongoing basis to review the progress of the liquidation.  The role of the committee was further enhanced in the Companies Act 2014 and as a result most liquidators seek to ensure that a committee is appointed.  Special liquidators for the IBRC have not done so.  If there is a dispute with the liquidator on remuneration, for example, or on fees or things of that nature, an application can be made to the court to determine the matter.  Two examples of that happening were the case concerning ESG Reinsurance Limited before Mr. Justice Kelly and the case concerning Mouldpro International Limited in 2012 before Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan, as a result of which the liquidator's fees were reduced.  </p><p> Sections 646 and 647 of the Companies Act 2014 provide that the basis of a liquidator's remuneration is to be agreed with the committee of inspection to which I referred earlier.  Another section provides for challenges to liquidators' remuneration and provides for arbitration and so on in that regard.  Again, this is missing in the case of the IBRC liquidation.  Control and oversight and a mechanism to effectively challenge the cost of the special liquidators are also missing in this case.  Consultation meetings behind closed doors on the issue of fees with officials from the Department of Finance are, to my mind, not sufficient.  </p><p> Fees to the end of December 2016 were in the region of &euro;225 million.  While if the fees are broken down to hourly rates, they are based on reduced rates negotiated by NAMA for general professional fees - though NAMA has no function or role in this at all - the number of hours and the grades associated with the work being carried out are unknown.  Based on parliamentary questions I have tabled, it would be my humble conclusion that there is really no oversight.  The liquidators may well be paying themselves rock bottom in terms of actual fees per hour, but the number of hours and the amount of work being carried out would certainly be the greatest in Irish commercial history for a liquidation.  I would say that it would compare unfavourably with some big international liquidations.  In terms of the level of scrutiny, we do not have a committee of inspection or a route to challenge.  I do not know why those elements were omitted or whether the Bill to establish the liquidation in 2013 just remained silent on them and the IBRC chose not to have a committee of inspection.  </p><p> In the replies to the first round of parliamentary questions I circulated - and I sent more around this morning in which I sought further clarification on the first set of answers - it was stated that in 2016 there were eight meetings between the Department of Finance and the liquidators.  In 2017, with costs rising, there were only three and a fourth is planned towards the end of this month.  I specifically asked for a breakdown of the minutes of the meetings.  Commercial sensitivity was given as the reason they could not be provided, yet in a standard liquidation those minutes would be available to a committee of inspection, to shareholders and to creditors.  That is us, the people, albeit through the Minister, who owned the company.  The replies also would not provide details of the grades of the people who are operating.  Again, commercial sensitivity was cited.  That too would be information which would be available to the company owners - in effect the people through the Minister.  </p><p> It is very worrying that one of the parliamentary question replies said the Minister and the Comptroller and Auditor General have no role in this.  I asked if any external parties or external State agencies were asked to assist the Department of Finance in the oversight of this matter, in challenging fees or in anything along those lines.  The replies were silent on that issue, so we can assume that there is not any external help.  We are told that the Comptroller and Auditor General has no role, the Department has no role and the Minister depends on quarterly reports on these issues issued and published by the IBRC.</p></speech>

The target here - not that there is a target - is not KPMG.  It is paying itself and doing its work as it is allowed to do.  Effectively, however, it has been let off.  It is paying itself from recoveries, work-outs and various things.  Those fees are effectively box-ticking exercises for the Department of Finance.  I worry that there is no mechanism to challenge these fees and that the level of oversight which would be available in a standard liquidation of, let us say Marc MacSharry Limited, through a committee of inspection and other means, does not apply in this case, yet it is ultimately the taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  So far, to the end of 2016, the fees total &euro;225 million including VAT.  It would be reasonable to assume that they will head towards &euro;300 million by the end of 2017.  If one applies a per annum rate into the future, it is reasonable to assume, if there are five to ten years left to run in this, that the fees would be heading very close to &euro;1 billion, notwithstanding the 175 legal cases, two of which are the large and high profile Quinn cases.  If any of those cases were to be lost we would looking at many hundreds of millions of euro or - pick a number - who knows?  </p> <p>  Auto-pilot is a phrase that comes to mind in the context of how this is happening.  Applying the basic accountancy duty of care to clients, I do not think that the taxpayer can be confident that this is being run correctly and with the level of oversight that is required.  I know the practice is not to bring the Minister in except in extraordinary circumstances.  I know we had him in on NAMA.  I feel this is one of those occasions on which the Minister ought to be invited, along with the Secretary General and the liquidators themselves.  We should certainly hear Mr. McCarthy's views as well.  </p> <p>  This has been going on under the covers.  Perhaps everything is done correctly and fantastically well for the least money possible, but perhaps not.  In any event, given the amounts of money involved so far, the likely amounts going forward and the length of time involved, it would be reckless and foolish in the extreme if we did not involve ourselves in some way.  If that requires legislation or an amendment to the 2013 Act then this committee should recommend that, following the questioning of the people I have outlined. </p></speech>

I would have thought that there would have been additional scrutiny or an impeccable oversight arrangement, given that these are distressed assets which are essentially owned by the Irish people.  Prior to the liquidation, the Department of Finance was highly critical of some very large transactions.  This is one area on which it is really important that we follow up.  I thank Deputy MacSharry.  It is very useful that he has set a framework for what we should do.  It is the Minister who has the responsibility.

I think there is a clause - section 7(4) - which provides that the terms and conditions of appointment of a special liquidator shall be as fixed by the Minister.  I think that is it.  That is the limit of the oversight.</p></speech>

On the level of scrutiny and challenge that must be in play on an ongoing basis, it is clear from the answers that I got, and Mr. McCarthy will see the ones because the meeting had started when I circulated the other ones, that the Department of Finance is going through the motions.  I should have mentioned it earlier but at one stage there were two rebates of &euro;5 million and &euro;3 million.  If that was a negotiated write-down on a &euro;225 million gross fee, it is 3%.  It does not sound great to me for that amount of money.  We also do not know the grades and number of hours per grade that were billed.  We have the hourly rates.  They were refused to me in the first round of questions and provided in the second, basically because the then Deputy, Lucinda Creighton, had been given that information before.  However, initially they were not being given it to me.  If it goes where I think it is going, and I might be reaching in saying this, we need a committee of inspection.  I do not know if it is a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General but we do need an oversight body that will take a lot more of a hands-on approach.  As I said, maybe the outcome will be that we are getting the best deal there ever was.  However, with a clock ticking towards a billion or an unknown number and an unknown period of time, a quarterly report provided by IBRC, as authors paying themselves without significant challenge and knowledge on the part of the Department of Finance which is representing the people, is not sufficient.</p></speech>

KPMG is certainly capable of this kind of work - of course it is - but this was not a full public tender.  The Department basically interviewed the four big firms and chose KPMG.  I am not saying there is a major issue with that.  I presume there is only a certain number of companies in the world that can handle stuff that big.  However, this has implications for taxpayers' money and the Department of Finance officials are the go-to people.  That Department, from the 15 or so questions I have asked, is not in control nor is it taking the level of supervisory and hands-on role that it ought to given the moneys involved.  Whether there is a surplus, a deficit or whatever, there are implications for the taxpayer and we need to get on it.</p></speech>

Alternatively, it might specifically state that there will not be a committee of inspection.  I need to check it.  I do not know.</p></speech>

A significant issue was disclosed in the statement on internal control, namely, a review of procurement of outsourced work in its final real year of operation in 2015.  It was found that the mandate for the outsourced work was not clear and that the board of An Ch&eacute;im was not kept fully informed in regard to it.  The work was carried out without the involvement of HEAnet, which was taking over the functions, so, effectively, the systems were developed without consultation with the people who were going to be operating them.  In addition, payments of &euro;941,000 were made to the service provider during the year without an appropriate competitive tender process.</p></speech>

Many accounts have been received in the past two months so I will move as quickly as I can.  Clear audit opinions have been received in respect of the 2016 accounts from Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, the National Oil Reserve Agency Limited, Enterprise Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the National Council for Special Education, Industrial Development Agency Ireland, SOLAS, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Western Development Commission, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Commission for Communications Regulation, the Health and Safety Authority, the Pensions Authority, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  Attention is drawn in the report on the RSA to non-competitive procurement of goods and services to the value of approximately &euro;1 million.</p></speech>

This was an organisation that was barely able to operate at board level for a long period because it did not have the numbers on the board.  Specifically, there are positions on that board which, for obvious reasons, are designated specialist positions relating to areas such as engineering, finance, etc., and many have been left vacant.  A couple of the positions have been filled in the past few weeks or months.  We need to correlate whether the procurement issues or any other issues relate to the fact that, effectively, we have a board that is barely functioning, despite it having a very good chairperson.  We also need to discover whether this is having consequences.  I use this as an example because, while it is not the only example, it is a particularly sensitive one in light of the organisation involved.  Could we write to the RSA and ask it to explain whether the lack of board members in 2016 had any impact on its performance and the way it conducted its business?</p></speech>

That annual account dealt with the administration account, the national debt account, the State Claims Agency account, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, the Post Office Savings Bank Fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund is to be dissolved after resolution of residual assets of &euro;439,000 and the Dormant Accounts Fund will be included in the report on the accounts.  That will come up as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to be published next Friday, so it will be back as part of the work programme in that context.  There are clear audit opinions for the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Credit Union Restructuring Board and the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund.</p> <p>  I believe the following body is listed in the work programme for other reasons.  On Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, attention is drawn in the statement on internal financial control to non-competitive procurement of &euro;5.2 million and weaknesses in the agency's oversight and monitoring of grants to outside agencies.  I propose that we need to bring in Tusla, as was mentioned in our work programme.</p> <p>  The position of the St. James's Hospital board is clear, as is that of the Dublin Dental Hospital board.  I want to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to do something for the committee.  With regard to the St. James's Hospital board and the Dublin Dental Hospital board, and as we saw with the HSE, the accounts are prepared in accordance with accounting standards approved by the Minister.  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General give us the schedule of the accounts he audits where such accounts are prepared in accordance with the standards and are also approved by the Minister in a way that may be different?  We had the HSE before us previously.  There are aspects of its accounts that would be in any other company's accounts but, because the Minister who sets up the accounts says that it does not include, say, its outstanding liabilities for clinical negligence in its accounts, that is not there.  There are a whole lot of exceptions to proper, normal international accounting standards where the Minister can simply say, "You leave that out".</p></speech>

The final one is InterTradeIreland - clear audit opinion.  These are noted.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  Last year,  we completed all of the chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report as well as three special reports on NAMA, Templemore - the interim report -  and third level.  During the summer we lined up a number of meetings for the first few weeks.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report will be out next Friday so we will not have it by next Thursday.  At our meeting on 5 October, we will have the opportunity to discuss this report and identify our priorities and, depending on what is in the report, decide which organisations we need to bring in first.  Whomever we decide to bring in will need a bit of time in advance.  In that context, I suggest a few meetings in the next month so as to show them the road.  HIQA will be coming before us and IDA Ireland is up the following week.  We are making provision for Mr. Tony O'Brien and for the acting Garda Commissioner to appear next Thursday if we have not received the report by tomorrow.  We will have to squeeze that time in.</p> <p>   I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to name the biggest outfit he audits that has not appeared before us in quite a while.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland is a big outfit, and there is not a constituency in Ireland that does not have a view on something to do with transport.  A lot of people, then, will want to talk to its representatives.  Tusla keeps cropping up.  It cropped up again today and I think we need to talk to it.  With regard to the HSE, we held off dealing with section 38 and 39 organisations last year but I think we need to go back to them now.  We do not need to spend the year dealing with them but we have not dealt with that matter in a while.  I propose that we talk to representatives from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the 9 November and deal with local government on the 16 November.  That will take us up to the 26 November.  So we will meet representatives from HIQA, IDA Ireland, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Tusla and the HSE - on section 38 and section 39 organisations - in the period up to the end of November.</p></speech>

That is a very important piece of work that we have to do.  However, I wish to again raise the issue of nursing homes and the charges relating thereto.  I raised this matter months ago and I am raising it again.  I am very concerned at the manner and behaviour of elements in this sector.  There is a role for us in terms of scrutiny.  I accept that some of the nursing homes are private entities and I know that this is a mixed sector.  I would, however, like the committee to find a way to address the issues of proper regulation, accountability and transparency in that sector.</p><p>I am not making a concrete proposal on it but it is by way of reminding the Chairman that-----</p></speech>

On this special occasion, I also extend a heartfelt welcome to our MLAs, MEPs and MPs who join us for this special meeting of three Oireachtas committees, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The purpose of the meeting is to engage in an exchange of views with Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's co-ordinator on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt, I welcome you to the Houses of the Oireachtas and invite you to take your seat in the Chamber.  You honour us with your visit to our Parliament today.  We are pleased to welcome you for this important discussion. </p> <p>  By way of background, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, sitting together in committee on 11 May last, met Mr. Michel Barnier, chief negotiator of the task force for the preparation and conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom.  The meeting provided an opportunity for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to outline directly to Mr. Barnier their concerns for Ireland in relation to the negotiation process and its outcome.  Ireland's priorities include Northern Ireland, the Border and the Good Friday Agreement; the economic impact of Brexit, which has already manifested itself in the agrifood sector; the Single Market; and free movement, in particular of people in the common travel area.  As a result, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and European Union are being followed very closely in Ireland.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as the European Parliament's co-ordinator, has a key role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament. </p> <p>  The unique position of and special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland were referenced in the European Parliament's resolution of 5 April on the exit negotiations.  This early recognition of the challenges facing Ireland is welcome and reassuring but we need to maintain this focus.  While the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU has clear implications for Ireland, it also draws our attention again to the debate about the future of Europe and any changes that may emerge from the process now under way.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as you will hear, this is an issue of crucial importance to all of us, as parliamentarians representing our citizens who share a deep concern about where this bumpy road will lead us, as citizens of Ireland and Europe.  We are very interested in hearing your views on the process, the potential outcomes of the negotiations and the implications for the European Union.  I have great pleasure in asking you to address this unique meeting of the joint committees.</p></speech>

It is an honour for me to be here today and address you in this historic D&aacute;il Chamber.  I thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to address you here today because I am aware that it is not every day that a Member of the European Parliament responsible for such an important matter can address a meeting of joint committees of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I first want to deliver a message of solidarity with Ireland, its citizens and people.  We will never allow Ireland to suffer as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union.  That is a commitment given by the European Parliament and European Union as a whole.  I will come back to this later in my contribution. </p> <p>  Next year, it will be exactly 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Yesterday was the first time I visited Belfast.  It was a strange experience because for the past 20 years, we in the rest of Europe have not heard anything about Belfast on our television screens.  It is good to remember that because it is 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is not a practical arrangement on passports, borders, customs or tariffs - it is not about these matters - but an agreement about peace and the reconciliation of divided communities.  It is about rebuilding confidence and trust.</p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is also a successful innovation of citizenship itself.  Personally, I find the following sentence to be the most important sentence in the Agreement.  It is "the birthright of all the people in Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may choose".  In my opinion, these four simple words, "as they may choose", go against the outdated version of some states that do not like ambiguity, contingency or multiplicity.  They give to the people and individual citizens, rather than states, the power to choose their own destiny.  They are four simple words which have brought peace and stability to Northern Ireland based on openness and a common understanding that identities are multi-layered and complex and should bring people together rather than divide them.  In my opinion, these four simple words not only define Northern Ireland but Ireland as a whole. </p> <p>  I know that some British politicians, not to name Boris Johnson, criticise their country men and women for wanting to keep their European identity.  He even accused them of split allegiance.  This is a binary, old-fashioned and reductionist understanding of identity.  We need to be smarter and more open and inventive than that.  It is not one's origin or the fact that, by accident, one was born in this or that village, city or country that makes one a good citizen.  It is the fact that one embraces the values of one's community and cherishes the fundamental rights and freedoms of the society in which one lives.</p><p>These are values, rights and freedoms that are common in our European Union in all nations and in every one of our member states so I think it is nonsense to talk about a split allegiance.  It is perfectly possible, I think, but I have not practised it, to feel English, British and European at the same time and it is perfectly normal to be a Dubliner, Irish and European at the same time without being schizophrenic.  There is no question of split allegiance.  It is this vision that needs to be defended by our European Union just as the Union needs to defend, I think, and this is my second point, that there is no return to the past to a time of hard borders on our Continent, and certainly not to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  Members will know that is a point we made very clear in the European Parliament's resolutions we adopted on 5 April 2017.  </p><p> I am mistaken when I state that the Irish Border is in no way a natural one.  It is not a river or a mountain ridge.  It meanders for 310 miles through meadows, forests and farmlands.  It cannot be securely poised and is, therefore, an illogical divide.  The Border should at least remain invisible just as it is today.  It is a little bit visible because one can see a marking in yellow when one enters the Irish Republic.  The colour of the marking changes from white to yellow.  That is the big lesson that I learned yesterday. </p><p> I spent yesterday afternoon visiting the Border in County Monaghan where I met people who live and work there.  At one point, I stood astride the Border, with one foot in Northern Ireland and my other foot in the Republic.  I found it completely impossible to see where one jurisdiction ended and the other started.  Certainly, the cows could not see it.  The cows from the North ate grass in the South, they were milked in the North by a farmer from the South and their milk was bottled in the South.  I am a Belgian so surrealism comes naturally to me.  To re-instate a border would be more than surreal, it would be totally absurd, even for me.</p><p> There are borders and then there are borders.  Borders can be lines on maps, physical barriers or, worst of all, can run through people's hearts and minds.  These are the worst kind of borders because they breed division, discrimination and hostility.  I remind everyone, if I may, that the history of Europe is in many ways a history of borders.  Over the centuries our Continent has seen borders shift, disappear and re-appear.  As a liberal, my natural inclination is to be against borders.  It seems to me that borders are best when they are just lines on maps.  In many ways, the European Union is all about reducing borders to lines on maps and this is certainly the case, I think, for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  The Border between both jurisdictions created chaos, hate and violence.  To reduce it to a line on a map was a crucial achievement 20 years ago in which the European Union, the UK and Ireland played a decisive role.  I saw the results for myself yesterday.  Whether one is speaking about the economy, commerce, agriculture, health or other social services, the Border is featuring less and less as a factor in the economic and social life of the region, and that is precisely its greatest achievement.  It is a border that does not divide people but enables them to live together in peace.  It is a border that is not divisive, that does not run through people's hearts but instead does the opposite and creates a common purpose.  </p><p> Dear colleagues - if I may use those words as a parliamentarian - you know better than I that Ireland underwent a dramatic transformation over the past three decades economically and but also socially.  The Republic was a country defined by Catholicism and nationalism.  In 1973, the birth year of the current Prime Minister, only 7% of Irish were born abroad and today this number is 17%, which makes Ireland very diverse when compared with European standards.  The Irish economy has successfully integrated migrants from all over the world, from Poland to Nigeria.  Ireland is also the home of international IT giants.  All of this is an example, I think, of constructive and fair globalisation.  To summarise it, Ireland is no longer a nation of immigration but a country of destination.</p><p> Ireland has gained a lot of self-confidence over the past decades, and rightly so.  We, as a European Union, also share that.  Let us never forget that Europe is far more than co-operation between the two old enemies of France and Germany.  Today, Europe goes beyond a Franco-German relationship.  We need all hands on deck.  All 27 member states are needed to make Europe work because we belong to the same European civilisation.  Europe would not be half of what it is today without dynamic countries like Ireland, countries that have dealt with complex border and identity issues, and countries that were able to re-invent themselves with a respect for tradition, so Ireland is crucial to the Union.</p><p> The Irish Border and all things related are a priority in the negotiations.  In the new resolution that the European Parliament will adopt in early October we will state that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit and that Ireland or any other member state will not be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.  The interests of Ireland are part and parcel of the interests of the EU 27.  The Irish position is the European position and the European position is the Irish position. </p><p> In this joint position, let me also make one last thing very clear.  The re-emergence of the Border question between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic has not been caused by the Irish Republic or the rest of the European Union.  The issue is the inevitable consequence of the choice by Britain to leave the European Union so the resolution of this issue is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom.  It is for them to come up with a workable solution, one which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, preserves the common travel area, avoids a hardening of the Border and last, but not least, does not compromise Irish membership and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  In my opinion, this can only be a unique solution.  Most of the people I met yesterday, on both sides of the Border, believe that this unique solution requires that one way or another Northern Ireland should remain part of the customs union and the Single Market.  I know the UK Government, in its paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland, has rejected this idea.  That is fair enough, but the UK must come forward with another proposal that avoids any disruption.  Simply saying that the problem will be solved by using new technology is, in my opinion, not convincing.</p><p> I am pleased to say that the Irish MEPs, some of whom are here today and seated in the corner, are working very hard to defend all of this, a position I can assure the members that is shared right across the whole European Parliament.  We know the Irish people have made the choice to be a core member state of the EU and, because of this, we will never let them down.  The EU also needs their help to reform Europe because that is something we also urgently need to do.  I think that Brexit is an ideal moment to reflect on the future of the Union we belong to.  There are enough challenges ahead, challenges that transcend national borders such as climate change, international terrorism and remaining economic difficulties. These are all issues that individual countries cannot tackle on their own.  Currently, they have also recognised that Europe is too weak to take on these challenges.  In order for us to beat, for example, international terrorism, we need European capabilities.  To overcome the economic crisis, we need a banking union to clean up our banks and a fiscal union to protect our single currency, the euro.</p><p>To fight the protectionism of President Trump and Brexit, we must have a Europe that is vocal and strong on the world stage.<br/><br/>To conclude, I believe that Brexit has opened the eyes of many people.  Do not misunderstand me - people are still very critical of the European Union, and for good reason.  However, nobody wants to leave and destroy Europe.  On the contrary, it is fair to say there is a renewed belief in Europe, not in this Europe but in a different, reformed Europe.  In any case, people have started voting pro-European again.  They did it in Austria, the Netherlands, and France and soon, hopefully, they will do so in Germany.  However, these are not votes for a <i>status quo</i>.  This is a way of people saying, &quot;Look, we are giving you one last chance to make Europe work and to make it better and fit for the future&quot;, or, in the words of Seamus Heaney, we &quot;Believe that further shore/Is reachable from here&quot;.</p></speech>

The last time we met he welcomed a delegation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to the European Parliament, so I am delighted to be able to join the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in returning the hospitality to him today.</p><p>To be blunt, this is a horrible problem.  It is a mess, and there is nothing nice about it.  People do not realise how detrimental an effect this will have on their lives and those of their children.  The UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the implications for Ireland and the implications for the European Union are all profound.  Quite frankly, I was saddened by the decision.  However, it was clear and we must respect it.  We all must work on the challenges the decision presents.  Members of this House have been doing that across a number of committees and the European Parliament has also been doing it.  We see the hard, thoughtful and diligent work the European Parliament's committees have been doing in considering Brexit and the Irish MEPs have been playing a strong role in that.  I acknowledge their work and thank them for it.</p><p>My committee has met a number of stakeholders and Government Ministers and is following the negotiations carefully through the documentation that is published.  I have been heartened by the supportive comments and the positions taken by the European Parliament, many governments and the European Commission.  However, the chips are down now.  Reality is starting to bite.  There are substantial and significant choices to be made by the negotiators and those they represent.  Ultimately, Mr. Barnier and his team, Mr. Verhofstadt and the other Members of the European Parliament represent the citizens of Europe, including the citizens of Ireland, who will feel the impact in their daily lives.  It is up to all of us to work together on practical solutions to minimise the impact as much as possible on the daily lives of citizens, on the quality of what they eat, the amount they must pay for it, how secure their savings and pensions are, whether they can go to shops or to mass up or down the road without going through border checks, how easily they can study abroad, what prices farmers get for their beef, lamb and milk, what price the consumer must pay for it and whether they can make friends with whoever they wish and set up a home together wherever they wish, be it in London, Brussels, Dublin or Belfast.  All of these matters could be impacted upon by Brexit.  All of them could be changed into something that resembles the parts of the past that we thought we had left far behind us.</p><p>We must work together and remain involved in and practical about the negotiations.  We are not alone in this.  There are two sides to a negotiation.  I had hoped to see more practical and pragmatic suggestions from the British side by now, but perhaps they will come forward.  They might even come forward in the Prime Minister's speech.  I certainly hope so.</p><p>On the European side, the transparent way in which negotiation documents have been shared with citizens is good and must continue.  National parliaments must continue to be involved in debates and discussions.  I would be interested in any recommendations or ideas Mr. Verhofstadt has to strengthen the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments in considering Brexit.  For example, is there any intention to hold interparliamentary meetings involving national parliaments and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group?  There would be huge value and benefit in that.  Mr. Verhofstadt travelled to the Border yesterday and I am delighted that he enjoyed meeting the cows there.  I hope this visit will have given him a valuable insight into why we value the current Border arrangements so much and why they should be preserved.</p><p>The biggest challenge will be goods.  There was an interesting letter in yesterday's edition of the <i>Financial Times</i>from a Belgian customs official.  It suggested that border goods should be applied for at the Irish Sea and that the customs union rules could be applied by the European Union customs officials operating in ports in Northern Ireland.  That was imaginative.  Are such suggestions helpful?  Of course, it would be best if the UK would decide to stay in the customs union, but that decision is out of our hands.  It is one for the United Kingdom.</p><p>The economic impact on Ireland is significant.  Each time an Oireachtas committee examines a new issue, a new box of challenges is opened - how aeroplanes will land, how goods will get to the market from Irish ports through Wales and England to eventually reach Belgium and so forth.  There are endless challenges.  I remain concerned about Brexit for Irish citizens but, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I am also concerned about the impact on the rest of the European Union.  Even if Brexit were not on the horizon, it would be important to consider the future of Europe and where we should be going.  My committee has started a public consultation process in Ireland and a series of engagements with stakeholders to examine what type of Europe we want in the future.</p></speech>

That really struck me.  We need a Europe with ambitions that are tempered by the fire of reality in all member states.  It is a principle that most people on the street will not explain, but I instinctively support it.  We must recognise that.  Mr. Verhofstadt has a strong vision for the future of Europe, so I would appreciate knowing more on how he sees us bridging the gap between the ideals and the need to deliver for our citizens.  Again, I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for attending this meeting.</p></speech>

I am sure we will find his address and interaction with us today very useful and beneficial.  As he will have seen and heard during his visits to Belfast, Monaghan and Dublin, Brexit impacts on every policy area across this island and will have a knock-on effect on the lives of citizens across the European Union and beyond.</p><p>Ireland, as Mr. Verhofstadt knows, stands to be significantly and disproportionately affected.  I speak for the members of our committee when I tell him that we, as public representatives, are greatly concerned at the negative domestic impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I know from listening to what he has said in recent months that he is very aware of and interested in our concerns, a fact demonstrated by his visit, North and South, yesterday and today.</p><p> As our committee looks outward in its work, I will focus my remarks on how Brexit impacts on the external environment, however as a Deputy for two Border counties, one of which Mr. Verhofstadt visited yesterday, it would be remiss of me not to remind him of the great damage the resurrection of a border would have on the communities I represent here in the national Parliament.  I welcome his comments made yesterday and hope he can expand on them later.</p><p> Much of the progress made in the improved Irish-British relations over the past 25 years was due in no small part to our common EU membership.  I recall, from my own time as a Minister being told that Irish and British officials were meeting approximately 26 times per day in Brussels.  The loss of this high level of ongoing and important interactions with our nearest neighbour and close ally is deeply regrettable.  Its loss will be keenly felt.  We will be doing our utmost to compensate as best we can for that loss of engagement.</p><p> As Mr. Verhofstadt knows, Ireland is militarily neutral but that does mean that we in Ireland stand aside when it comes to promoting peace and development through the UN, the European Union and our own bilateral actions - far from it.  We have a long, proud and strong record in peace support and humanitarian operations via our Defence Forces.  At present, 600 members of the Defence Forces are serving on UN-mandated missions across the globe.  Given our policy remit for both foreign affairs and defence, our committee knows and recognises the global challenges and security threats we face, both within the EU and in the EU's neighbourhood.  For those reasons we recognise a good and strong relationship with the Britain on foreign policy, security and defence is essential and is in all our interests.  For those reasons, we welcome last week's publication by the British Government of a paper on foreign policy, defence and development, and we are pleased to see the British Government outline its willingness and desire to continue to have a close partnership with the EU on foreign, defence, security and development issues.  We note that Britain proposes the exchange of foreign and security policy experts, military personnel and the exchange of classified information to support external actions.  Ongoing co-operation is much needed and is common sense in these very fraught times for Europe and neighbouring areas as well.</p><p> I wish to refer specifically to development co-operation and the impact Brexit may have on the world's poorest people whose voices are often unheard in these debates.  While Brexit may be happening far from the poorest countries in the world, they also stand to be adversely affected.  It is unknown what will become of the significant aid contributions Britain makes both to the European Development Fund - at present it contributes 15% of the fund, amounting to &euro;4.48 billion, and 13% of the total of the aid portion of the EU's general budget for 2016, or &euro;1.23 billion.  Loss of that substantial British funding would have huge ramifications for the many programmes in the poorest regions of the world which depend so heavily on it.  The committee hopes a solution will be found that will allow and encourage Britain to continue to contribute.  I believe there are precedents for that with Switzerland and Norway participating in EU-managed trust funds.</p><p> Brexit will result in the loss of an important, influential and respected voice on the shaping of EU development policy from around the EU table.  Our committee will encourage the Government to step up and play its part in filling those gaps as much as possible.  There is also the significant concern that developing countries could lose their duty free, quota free access to British markets, as is currently provided for under EU agreements.</p><p> More generally, we are concerned about the Paris Accord and climate action.  All those issues must be taken into account in the complex negotiations that lie ahead.  I have no doubt the European Parliament will ensure those concerns are brought to the fore in his engagements with the Council and the Commission.  As Mr. Verhofstadt said, our island has been transformed since 1998.  We cannot countenance any agreement that would set us back or hinder the necessary progress for the further development of all of this island.  To echo Mr. Verhofstadt, it would be absolutely absurd to put obstacles in the way of the 30,000 people who cross the Border on a daily basis going about their business.</p></speech>

Today is world International Day of Peace, as designated by the United Nations and that should not be lost on our defining moment in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent establishment of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in 2007 to monitor and oversee the ongoing implementation of that historic peace agreement.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt to Leinster House.  The attendance of the many dignitaries, ambassadors, officials, MPs, MEPs and MLAs, sends out a clear signal of the need for solutions to Brexit and peace and if those solutions can be found on this island our many problems in the EU may also be resolved.  I commend the membership of the committee, its officials and witnesses on their ongoing work on Brexit and exploring solutions while extremely cognisant of building on our fragile peace and progressing the many legacy issues.</p> <p>  For many of us there can be various defining moments in our history but for me the main aim of the Treaty of Rome, the forerunner to the EEC or EU, was to ensure that peace not war would unite us in prosperity.  I am 59 years of age and was born ten years before the further outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 that broke many families and fractured communities and their prosperity in Northern Ireland, the Border region and beyond.  I also remember life pre-EEC and post-EEC membership and the transformation that this great island achieved as a result of EU investment in trade and infrastructure, much of which is ongoing.  For all of us in this Chamber and beyond the strides that this country has made have been significantly enhanced with peace, which has encouraged communities North and South to face each other with a common purpose, respect and recognition that there is strength in unity and friendship is what is important.</p> <p>  Politicians will not be forgiven by this generation and future ones if they fail to progress and enhance this fragile peace.  Let there be no mistake, Brexit has the potential to derail so many of the gains of this island and we must not allow that to happen.  Some key findings of the report from our committee have found that the all-Ireland economy must not be affected or allowed to regress.  A tailored solution taking into account its very unique circumstances is required.  We are concerned about the commitment to continue both the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which provided &euro;3.5 billion in the past 20 years.  It is important that such a commitment would immediately be set out clearly so that people can plan and communities can continue to prosper from the PEACE moneys.</p> <p>  The committee calls on the Government and the EU to undertake a detailed study on the potential implications of Brexit on reconciliation.  Allied to that is the psychological impact identified by the committee that Brexit will further affect many families in the North and along the Border corridor.  Whether one has been a victim, a combatant or an innocent bystander the emotional scars of murder, death and explosions remain deep rooted and continue to need healing.</p> <p>  Brexit presents many challenges but there are also opportunities.  The committee believes the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can step up and take on additional responsibilities, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council, whose remit needs to be reviewed and enhanced.  Like Mr. Verhofstadt, the committee has visited many groups in Northern Ireland who feel they have no voice in the current political stalemate and it is the committee's responsibility to bring those anxieties to his attention.</p><p>These need to be represented in the all-Ireland debate.  Indeed, the absence of unionism and a unionist voice at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is regrettable.</p><p> Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, widely recognised as the cornerstone of peace.  That anniversary takes place at a time of uncertainty in North-South and British-Irish relations.  Perhaps it is an opportune time for the EU and the European Parliament to reinvigorate its investment in making our peace process a world model and exemplar that will show war-torn regions around the world how a lasting peace can be achieved.  I should add that many representatives of such regions have visited us to look at what we are doing.  Politics is about the art of the possible and we owe it to our children and our children&rsquo;s children to live in peace, prosperity and harmony on this island.</p><p> Both Mr. Verhofstadt and Mr. Barnier continue to use the term "unique solution" in their deliberations.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt suggest what his thoughts are on that solution and what he feels it could look like?</p><p> With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I have been asked by my colleagues from the British Parliament on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee, who are here with us today, to ask Mr. Verhofstadt if he will produce a report on his fact-finding visit after he returns to Brussels.  Will he share his experience of the last 48 hours with Mr. Barnier?  How concerned does he believe the European Parliament is about the impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement?</p></speech>

I welcome our Members of the European Parliament and all the invited guests.  I thank our committee chairs and committee members for organising what has already been described as a unique but very important meeting and gathering.</p> <p>  It is extremely important to thank Mr. Verhofstadt for his willingness to come to Ireland but also, and most importantly, for his willingness to deepen his understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and, of course, the Border issues.  It is very clear from his statement that he has a very real understanding of how fragile the peace process is.  I thank him for his work to date as the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit.  As the European Parliament plays such an important role in the Brexit negotiations, it is important to thank him for his supportive statements to date on the peace process and on the Border and for his words of solidarity with the Irish people today.</p> <p>  While Brexit may not be the first priority for all member states, it is, of course, a very real and imminent concern for many Irish citizens, for Irish businesses large and small, and for our industries, in particular the agrifood sector which is already feeling the effect of Brexit.  I know that Members here, throughout this debate, will be very keen to hear Mr. Verhofstadt's views and an update on how negotiations are progressing, but also to hear his further views on the future of Europe.  The future of Europe is not Brexit.  It is a Europe without the UK and we need to ensure it is a Union that protects, empowers and defends its citizens.  It is even more important that this conversation is one that all citizens should be involved in.</p> <p>  I look forward to a very positive engagement with Members and our three committees as, I am sure, does Mr. Verfhofstadt.  I thank him again for his support and for his recognition of our unique situation.</p></speech>

We will now move to a session of questions and answers.  In accordance with the yesterday's recommendation of the Business Committee I will take blocks of three questions, each lasting approximately two minutes, starting with the party leaders.  I will start with Deputy Martin.  We will take three questions then return to Mr. Verhofstadt.</p></speech>

I also thank him for his strong support for Ireland, for the manner in which he has facilitated the ALDE group in supporting the Irish cause in respect of Brexit, and for his determination that Ireland would not suffer.  In the limited time that is available I will put two key points to Mr. Verhofstadt, if I may.  He rightly drew attention to the citizenship dimension of the Good Friday Agreement and the idea of multiple identities - of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.  It is extremely important that in the ultimate resolution of this, the idea of Irish citizenship as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is protected in the context of the resolution between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In a post-Brexit scenario, Northern Ireland will have the largest concentration of European Union citizens outside of the union's borders.  It is essential that mechanisms are found which will ensure those citizens are in a position to continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of European citizenship.</p> <p>  Second, notwithstanding the British position at the moment in terms of the customs union, which is ultimately the key issue in terms of the Border question, we have been putting forward the idea that a special economic zone needs to be considered.  There are many examples of economic zones across the world.  Economic zones in themselves do not challenge or undermine the unique constitutional framework of east-west, North-South and the Northern Ireland settlement.  In other words, it is possible within the existing constitutional framework to devise an economic zone for the North and the Border counties which would maintain freedom of trade - goods, services and people - North and South.  We need to move on from the language of a "frictionless border" or "no border" and start working on concrete ideas and solutions that could ultimately bring a resolution to the issue.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid bu&iacute;och de faoi choinne a chuairt.  I offer Mr. Verhofstadt a hundred thousand welcomes and thank him for his visit to our island.  I welcome the content of his speech very much.  In his remarks today, Mr. Verhofstadt acknowledged that people are very critical of the European Union.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's position.  We want to see a more democratic, demilitarised, peaceful European Union which embraces economic and social justice, international solidarity and an end to poverty.  Notwithstanding that, we campaigned in the North for a Remain vote, because it is our view that to have one part of the island outside the European Union and another part inside is just folly.  It is a really significant fact which has been ignored by some, but people in the North supported that position.  They voted to remain within the EU and we believe that vote should be upheld and actively defended.  The various policy positions which the British Government has unveiled, including leaving the customs union, will all cost jobs, undermine the economy and subvert sectors in both parts of the island.</p> <p>  I particularly want to welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's remarks on the Good Friday Agreement.  I know that he values the peace process and I understand he met some of our colleagues: Martina Anderson MEP, our group leader in the European Parliament, our national spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy David Cullinane, and our Members of the European Parliament.  His description of the Border and of partition is very much appreciated, as are his warnings of the dire consequences if it is reinforced.</p> <p>  To move on to my questions, will Mr. Verhofstadt give us an assessment of the possibility of agreement, given that there has only been limited information available thus far and that there does not appear to have been any real progress from the British side?  I welcome his suggestion that the North remain within the customs union and the Single Market.  That is effectively the designated status for the North which we have campaigned for and which the D&aacute;il, the majority of MLAs and the European Parliament support.  The threat and the danger to the Good Friday Agreement could be averted if the agreement was incorporated in full as a protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  I commend that position to Mr. Verhofstadt and ask him to give his support to that proposition.</p></speech>

His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments in relation to enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed.</p><p>I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland.  He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter.<br/><br/>My first question is very simple.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principle of parity of esteem and human rights protection is upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU?  If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights?<br/><br/>My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in <i>The Observer</i>on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position in relation to citizens' rights.  He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement.  This is another simple question.  How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years?  I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Guy Verhofstadt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017092100002#F00300"><p>It is a question of how many minutes I will be given to respond to all the remarks that have been made.  I thank the honourable Members and the Chairs of the committees.  Maybe I can pick three elements from the various interventions that have been made.  Reference was made to the state of the negotiations and I was asked whether we will use our veto.  One needs to have something to veto before one can use one's veto.  For the moment, there is nothing to veto because - let us be honest - no real progress has been made in the negotiations.  We have had three rounds of negotiations.  The first round involved the formal start of negotiations, the second round involved the presentation and the third round involved the clarification.  I think it is time for the negotiation in the fourth and fifth rounds.  That is what we are hoping for now.  Maybe the intervention of the British Prime Minister will lead to a breakthrough in the coming days.  Based on the state of play now, those of us on the European Parliament side do not see sufficient progress to call for the so-called "second stage" of the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  The sequencing is important because Article 50 of the treaty says that there needs to be an agreement on withdrawal in the first instance before a new relationship can start to be established between the EU and the withdrawing country.  Let us be very blunt about it - the first three rounds were very slow.  We hope the fourth and fifth rounds in October can speed up the negotiations.  It is time for the uncertainty to stop, in the interests of everybody, particularly businesses and citizens.  This uncertainty is having a negative impact on the hearts and minds of citizens and on daily economic life.  The only way to stop it is to go forward in the negotiations.</p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to the Good Friday Agreement.  The European Parliament has made it very clear from day one - it pushed this in the guidelines of the European Council - that the wording of the Good Friday Agreement should be included in all its parts.  This has been a request from the European Parliament.  Keeping the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is a key element for us.  We cannot risk the possibility of Brexit creating a return to the Troubles that we saw in the past.  That is a key element for this whole negotiation.  I found that this point - the risk to the Good Friday Agreement posed by the Brexit discussion - was not touched on sufficiently during the whole debate before the referendum in Britain.  I accept that this is in the past now.  Ireland can count on the European Parliament to defend the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  We will never allow whatever solution is reached to put that in danger.  As the EU played an important role in the Good Friday Agreement, it is keen to defend its own work and its own achievements.</p> <p>  The third issue is the solution for Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier, I have heard many solutions for Northern Ireland already.  It has been suggested that an economic zone could be created, or that the Single Market and the customs union could continue to be extended to Northern Ireland.  All of these solutions are possible.  As the European Parliament will express in its next resolution, however, the position paper that the British Government has put on the table is not possible because it says that there should be a return to a border and that it will be made invisible.  I have always thought that if a border is not visible, it is no border.  If a border is visible, it is a border.  It is not only with a number of technical features that the problem can be solved.  We are in favour of any solution that avoids in any way a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  That is going to be our goal.  As I indicated in my intervention yesterday, the main proposal for avoiding a hard border that I have heard involves Northern Ireland continuing to participate in the Single Market and the customs union.</p></speech>

I have no doubt about the stupidity and, frankly, obnoxiousness of the Tory position when it comes to the negotiations about Britain's exit from the EU.  I am thinking particularly of its anti-immigrant policies.  Given that the EU insisted on the cruel punishment of our citizens for the banking collapse, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says that the EU will not allow Ireland to be punished for Britain's decision to leave the EU?  For example, the EU insisted on the imposition of dreadful austerity on our citizens for things that were not their responsibility.  Given that the EU insists on borders of steel, barbed wire and police camps enforced by Frontex in order to keep out tens of thousands of desperate refugees who are fleeing warzones like Syria, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says noble things about the EU not believing in borders and wanting to reduce borders to lines on maps?  If the EU is willing to do this to desperate and vulnerable people, some of whom are drowning in the Mediterranean as a result, how can we take seriously Mr. Verhofstadt's pledge to try not to impose borders here?  What Britain decides to do is one thing, but I would like to hear an absolute guarantee that the EU will not insist on some sort of border in order to protect its Single Market.  If we were to get such a commitment from Mr. Verhofstadt, we could deal with Britain and the problems it is imposing.</p><p>Can he give us that guarantee?  Can we give credibility to his assertions about not believing in borders, given his insistence on imposing them in a very cruel way in other parts of the European Union?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work that has been done by our officials, Departments and various bodies to prepare for the unknown while working in a vacuum.  At the founding of the EU its principles were peace, harmony and economic and social development for everybody but those principles are being undermined by the way Europe responded to the migrant crisis and by the economic crash, which showed a widening division between rich and poor.  Is this an opportunity for the EU to redefine its vision and to become more committed to the values on which it was set up?  There is an issue around development aid and we are seeing an increasing securitisation agenda.  There is a fear that this will divert badly needed funding and there will now be a further shortfall from Britain.</p> <p>  My second question relates to Ireland as we will be particularly affected in many areas because of Brexit and its potential economic consequences.  How can Europe support Irish jobs and businesses in that area?  A terrible gamble is being taken with the Good Friday Agreement.  Flawed as it is, it has ensured peace for a generation who have not experienced the violence their parents and grandparents experienced.  As well as economic consequences, there are consequences relating to identity and culture.</p></speech>

He visited the Border yesterday and I hope all the cows will be as quiet as those he met in Monaghan.  He said we needed to sort out and clean up our banking but we left it a bit late in the day for that.  We did not get a lot of assistance when we had the crash and we had to sign up to some very stiff penalties.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt said other countries had recently had votes which were more conciliatory towards the EU, and that is good.  I interpreted him as saying there was one last chance to be more democratic, but democracy in Brussels has been lost.  I welcome our MEPs here today, but there have been many regulations and restrictions as to what we can and cannot do and that is why Brexit happened.  They need to look at that, and comments from some very senior people after Brexit were not very helpful.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt might elaborate on what he meant by a frictionless border.  There is a massive border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is much bigger than ours with three checkpoints and which was built with EU funding.  Mr. Verhofstadt says it will not happen here and that Great Britain will have to look after the Border, but that is not good enough for us.  We need concrete and tangible measures.  It is difficult but we need to know the bottom line and the impact it will have on the Single Market, among other issues.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Clare Bailey, from the Assembly in the North.  We are very close to our English and Scottish colleagues and our colleagues in the European Parliament, Philippe Lamberts and others, with whom we work very closely on the European Green Party position.  I am very heartened by what Mr. Verhofstadt said because it marks a change from what Mr. Barnier said when he was here a few months ago, to the effect that a border is a border.  He said there would be free movement of people but not of trade or goods, but Mr. Verhofstadt has said the solution has to be one where an effective customs union or the Single Market is upheld.  Will that be the red line?  Will the Parliament, which has the ultimate veto on any agreement, accept it?  We are now into the second phase of the negotiations because the first phase was primarily about people.  It seems Mr. Verhofstadt said that he will protect this island in the area of customs, goods and services.  He concentrated on four words, which were, "as they may choose", and in respect of the Good Friday Agreement there are another four key words, "in all its parts".  How will the European Parliament choose when it comes to preserving the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts?  Mr. Verhofstadt's language today could not have given a clearer signal that we were going to preserve an island for the trade in goods and services and not just people.  I welcome his clarity on this as it is the right position.  Mr. Verhofstadt should be strong on it or the negotiations will take place and, at the very end, the British will say they did not know that was his position.  I agree with the position he has set out today.</p></speech>

It is not for us to say it has to be this or that system as that is for the negotiations to provide, but we have to give the green light, or the red light if we do not agree.  "No hard border" is not a rhetorical element of our position but a firm position of the European Parliament and we will never accept an outcome of negotiations which does exactly the opposite.  There are possibilities to achieve it and in the negotiations we will have to try to find viable solutions.  I have indicated a few possibilities in this area.</p> <p>  There was a remark on my commitment to the external borders of the European Union.  When there are problems with the external borders of the European Union, they are mainly because of a lack of European Union.  They are problems caused by policies of nation states and not by a so-called European policy.  There is a lack of European policy on migration, asylum and border management.  Excuse me if a use a non-parliamentary term, but it is crazy.</p></speech>

It is nonsense to do that.  In that respect the position of the European Parliament is that we support a European border management in a decent, human way.  This is absolutely needed.  Do Members know the budget of the European Border and Coastguard Agency, which used to be known as Frontex?  It is &euro;250 million.  Homeland security in the United States is &euro;62 billion.  We think we can solve problems at a European level without giving the means and the possibility to do so.  People say the Union does not tackle the challenges of today and does not have good results, but to have good results one needs good policies, for which one needs the financial means.  In terms of a European asylum system to replace Dublin - excuse me for criticising Dublin but I refer to its place in asylum policy, in the form of the Dublin Regulation - we need ways of having legal migration because this is the only way to tackle illegal migration.  We push asylum seekers into the arms of criminal organisations because the only way to ask for asylum is to set foot on European soil.</p><p>I remember the first time I attended the European Council as Belgian Prime Minister.  It was in 1999 in the north of Finland, in Tampere, where it is always dark.  We decided that we should have a common European asylum and migration policy.  So many years later, we are still not there.  That is the problem of Europe.  It is not only a question of announcing things but also of making them really happen.</p><p> The third question was on the specificities and interests of Ireland.  The strategy we and the EU negotiator are following is that all the interests of Ireland are taken on board in the negotiation mandate of the European Union.  That is the way to work on this.  That is the way to ensure that those interests are taken on board in the final agreement.  It is also the best way to keep the unity of the EU 27 because - let us be very realistic - there are going to be attempts to undermine it, which cannot happen.  The only way to prevent it is to fully take on board the interests of Ireland - the Irish Republic - in the negotiation mandate, and that is what we in the European Parliament will try to secure.</p></speech>

He should also be complimented on his passion and commitment to the European concept, something which has become vague in some quarters and countries and the results of which we have seen.  He has the commitment and determination to follow through on what he has said, which is hugely important for this country and for the island of Ireland.</p><p>The <i>status quo</i>must be maintained.  Any diminution of what we have enjoyed for the past 20 years in respect of Northern Ireland or of what we have achieved during our years of membership of the European Union must be prevented.  We must improve, grow and develop these conditions as time goes by.  We must guard against any movement whatsoever to diminish the role of the European Union in our affairs or our role in European affairs.  We must be very careful not to go down that road.</p><p>Mr. Verhofstadt has been very constant and consistent in his views since we met him in Brussels on a number of occasions.  Does he remain satisfied that the European project will continue for all other EU countries?  Will disruptive words such as occur from time to time be curtailed and will all members of the EU be conscious of the need to work together for the Union?  Each member state must take ownership.  None of us is on the outside looking in.  We are all part of Europe and must maintain that position.  Can Mr. Verhofstadt be sure that we will be able to maintain that position throughout Europe in the future?</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.  I would like to ask him about the customs union.  I met recently with members of the British Government in London.  They are resolute that they are leaving the customs union and were pretty clear that they are open to regulatory divergence, including in food, animal welfare and so on.  As we all know, they insist both are possible without any borders.</p> <p>  There has been a bovine theme this morning so I will give an example in keeping with it.  Brazil produces high-quality, grass-fed beef at just above half the price that British and Irish farmers can afford.  If the UK, outside the customs union, were to reach a zero-tariff agreement with Brazil on beef, large containers of high-quality Brazilian beef would land in Belfast.  Smugglers would convey that beef into the Republic.  Some of those smugglers have links to paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, the beef would continue on to the rest of Europe.  Northern Ireland would thus be used as a back door for cheap, high-quality, tariff-free, illegal beef to come into Europe.  Inevitably, the EU would have to respond and, inevitably, we would see a hard border.  We would have a nationalist community in Northern Ireland pulled out of Europe against its will, seeing a fence built around it, at the same time as profits from smuggling would start funnelling into paramilitary organisations there.  Brazilian cows could contribute to the material destabilisation of the peace process.</p> <p>  I sense some softening of a position in the UK on the customs union.  The British are saying they will leave the customs union but might be able to talk about a customs union.  What is the European Parliament's position on trying to find the space where people can save face politically but, by changing the word "the" to "a", where the UK can stay in the customs union in all but name, thus avoiding a hard border around the Six Counties?</p></speech>

I hope he will report back to the European Commission on these welcome engagements.  On behalf of my colleagues who are MPs and MEPs, I ask if he intends to produce a formal report not just for the Commission but also for the steering group of the European Parliament that is dealing with Brexit.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt said he accepts Ireland's unique circumstances.  That is something we saw in the European Commission's paper as well and I welcome it.  We want to hear what, in the final analysis, the term "unique" will mean for Ireland.  I welcome that Mr. Verhofstadt says that the North of Ireland must remain in the customs union.  As we know, the British Government is against this.  That needs to be a very clear, firm view not just of the European Parliament but also of the Commission.  It has to be an absolute red line issue.  If the North is taken out of the European Union against its will and if it is also taken out of the customs union and Single Market against its will, there will be an EU frontier on the island of Ireland.  There will be a border.  We do not want a hard border, a soft border or any type of border.  It has to be a very clear, firm position of the European Commission that the North should remain in the customs union.</p> <p>  We also want it set as a protocol that the Good Friday Agreement, as was said, be attached to the withdrawal agreement.  That gives full legal protections to the agreement.  We cannot cherry-pick the Good Friday Agreement.  It must be protected in its entirety.  Citizens in the North have to have access to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>  In respect of reforming the European Union, democracy is the key issue.  Reform means different things to different people.  My view of reform of the European Union might be different from that of Mr. Verhofstadt.  If we are to learn anything from Brexit, it is that we need more democracy in Europe.  I hope that will be at the heart of any debate on the future of Europe.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for attending.  I am delighted to hear him talk about the new-found solidarity of a post-Brexit EU in which Irish citizens will not have to pick up the cost of reckless banking across Europe in the future.  I will move on from that matter, however.</p> <p>  There is a notion that the UK is responsible for the Border and that it is, therefore, its problem.  Let us be totally honest; it is not.  As the Deputy across the Chamber just pointed out with his Brazilian beef example, the problem is Europe's and not the UK's.  The British will have no interest whatsoever in putting a border in place.  Their sole concern is migration.  They can control migration on the boats and aircraft travelling from Northern Ireland.  One has to have one's passport to get a flight to Britain as matters stand.  How do we protect the Single Market when confronted with a Britain that could not care less about a border in Northern Ireland?  How do we defend the rights of some 1.5 million Irish citizens or potential Irish citizens who are, by reason of geography, living on the wrong part of this island?</p><p>How do we guarantee them access to such programmes as ERASMUS+?  How do we guarantee them free travel throughout the European Union?  How do we guarantee them access to all the benefits that are bestowed on every citizen of Europe?  A citizen of Ireland is by default a citizen of Europe.  How do we guarantee these things?  Finally, how do we bring the European Union closer to the citizen on the ground?  Citizens in this country have taken one hell of a beating over the past eight to ten years with austerity.</p></speech>

With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will start with the last point on citizenship because we have talked a lot about borders and economic interests but perhaps not enough about citizenship.  The position of the Parliament, which will be reiterated in the new resolution, is that we need to protect fully the EU citizenship that several hundred thousands of Northern Irish citizens who have Irish passports have.  We must take this seriously.  It concerns all the elements linked to EU citizenship.  EU citizenship is not something from which one can pick and choose - consular aid, yes, but voting rights, no.  It is a concept that is linked to EU citizenship and the position of the European Parliament is that we must protect it.  In the Brexit steering group, one of the priorities is to look into this and be sure that we on the European side defend this concept during the negotiations.  It cannot be the case that we say these people are EU citizens but that EU citizenship does not mean anything.  That is not possible.  It must mean what it is: all the rights that are in fact linked to that concept.</p> <p>  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will respond to another question that has been put forward: what is happening now in this discussion about citizens' rights in general?  This also concerns Irish citizens living in Britain.  Our concept, our proposal, from the European side and the European Parliament side is that we simply continue collectively the rights that the more than 3 million EU citizens living in the UK have currently.  We are very critical - and we will reiterate this in the next resolution - of the UK side's proposal to introduce a new concept of settled status in British immigration legislation that will require each one of these millions of citizens to make an individual request to continue to have his or her rights.  Individual means individual, so if there are four family members, four requests need to be initiated.  There will be a number of conditions and a need to prove a number of things.  This will create an enormous administrative burden on these millions of European citizens, including many Irish citizens in Britain.  The same goes for UK citizens living on the Continent but I do not think this is such a big problem because all the remaining EU member states recognise that the best way forward is simply to continue the rights those citizens have now.  I am saying this because this is a key issue that must be solved, it is to be hoped as quickly as possible, to end the uncertainty for these millions of people who are today already subject to a number of practices by which they are losing a number of their rights.  This is not to mention that some of them received a letter - apparently it was a mistake - stating they had simply to leave the country as quickly as possible.  This is completely against the EU treaties because, until withdrawal, the UK continues to be a member of the European Union, needs to apply fully EU law and does not have the right to send such letters.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the customs union and the example of beef was given.  Other examples are possible.  The problem for the European Union is not that the British side may say tomorrow they want to continue in the customs union.  Nobody in the European Union will say that is not possible.  However, to be in the customs union also means that the competence to make trade agreements continues to be exercised by the European Union.  That is the consequence of a customs union.  In a customs union a country does not negotiate tariffs and trade agreements individually; it is the European Union that does that based on the treaties.  One cannot say one wants to be in the customs union but will manage trade oneself.  That is not the European Union.  I think everyone will accept, certainly now that it has already been proposed by some in Britain, that the UK should stay for a transitional period in the customs union, but it cannot pick and choose and say it wants to be in this but not that.  One cannot say, "I want to be in the customs union and the Single Market but I do not want to pay, I do not want the oversight of the European Court of Justice, I do not want migrants coming from eastern Europe and I do not want it to be the European Union that negotiates trade deals in the future."  That is not possible.  Membership comes with positive things but also with obligations.  One cannot create a system in which not being a member of the European Union is more favourable than being a member.  One would then destroy the European project.  I am very open to and positive about what Deputy Donnelly said in his question but, as I said, it is not a question of taking the benefits and putting the burden on the remaining 27 member states.  That will not happen and will not be allowed to happen.  That is not objective, not serious and certainly not the kind of European Union we all want.</p></speech>

He may recall that he met the European affairs committee in Brussels last February.  At that time there was much uncertainty about the place, but I think we appreciated then and we appreciate now the sympathy and understanding he has shown for Ireland's position.  As he knows, Ireland has major concerns regarding the Good Friday Agreement, the common travel area and the possible implementation of a hard border.</p> <p>  Because I only have one minute, I will go straight to my questions.  Regarding the Brexit negotiations, does Mr. Verhofstadt think it will be very important for the British Prime Minister to give some significant indication tomorrow of the UK's position on the EU budget contribution into the future?  I think Mr. Verhofstadt said solutions to the Irish question are solely a matter for the UK.  Does he not think the Commission and the Parliament could also have some draft proposals on solving our particular problem?  Regarding the future of Europe, the Commission has put forward five scenarios.  I think the President of the Commission put forward a sixth scenario in all but name during the week.  Ireland has concerns about proposals for corporate tax harmonisation and a deepening common defence policy.  We are losing a friend as we lose the UK from the European Union.  Can Mr. Verhofstadt assure us, now that the Franco-German axis is fully restored, that the interests of small nation states will not be forgotten about as we plan the future of Europe?</p></speech>

Things have changed quite dramatically in the meantime.  C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to Mr. Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator.  I was impressed by his visit to Belfast and the Border areas, including Monaghan, to see the invisible Border between the North and South.  He described it very well.</p> <p>  Post-Brexit, we will need more support from the European Parliament and the European Commission to strengthen our regional airports and ports.  I will refer in particular to Ireland West Airport Knock, which needs a derogation and additional Government support, which are matters for the Commission.  I would like Mr. Verhofstadt to bring that point back to the Commission.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt's points about a customs union, or a single market, between North and South were good.  A single market is essential.</p> <p>  I appeal for the power-sharing Executive to be re-established in Northern Ireland.  Why would someone allow Brexit MEPs to be Ministers in Northern Ireland?  It is unthinkable.</p></speech>

If history has taught people in Ireland anything over the centuries, it is that Ireland disproportionately suffers from belligerent British foreign policy.  I welcomed Mr. Verhofstadt's statement that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit.  Those were fine and well-meaning words, but we need practical measures to ensure that it does not happen.</p> <p>  There has been much discussion of the Border and the Good Friday Agreement, and rightly so, but I do not want Europe, Mr. Verhofstadt, his team or the European Parliament to lose sight of the fact that there is &euro;60 billion worth of trade between Ireland and Britain every year, underpinning hundreds of thousands of jobs.  The Border is crucial, as are business and people's livelihoods.  What are the practical measures?  Our party has proposed a European reform fund to support exposed areas and sectors at a European level.  Our agrifood industry has lost nearly &euro;800 million from the value of its exports, but it is just one of many.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt understands the situation and I welcome his visit today as well as his visit to the Border, but let us not lose sight of the hundreds of thousands of jobs in Ireland underpinned by, and dependent on, the &euro;60 billion in trade with our nearest neighbour.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tUasal Verhofstadt.  He and I met yesterday in my home city of Belfast.  In this Oireachtas, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those of us in the North who are Irish do not derive our Irishness from the Good Friday Agreement.  It, of course, runs much deeper than that.  When the agreement was lodged with the EU and the UN, however, it affirmed our legal rights in the eyes of the world as Irish and, therefore, EU citizens.  It says that on the front of our passports to remind us.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt has referenced comprehensively something that we discussed yesterday, namely, the importance of the psychology of citizenship and our place within the world.  While our Irish citizenship in the North should never be partial, conditional or second class, nor should our EU citizenship.  Mr. Verhofstadt was clear in his remarks regarding a future for EU citizens living in the North, but perhaps he might expand on what that will mean for the EU citizen who is a farmer in Fermanagh, a worker in Strabane or an entrepreneur in Newry.  If such people are to access their rights and entitlements as full EU citizens, what will that look like?</p></speech>

Those of us on the island of Ireland see that, once again, the British have shot themselves in our foot.  We feel bad about that.</p> <p>  I am Vice Chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Most of the parliamentarians from Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales and other jurisdictions are concerned about this situation and would like to see a change.  Mr. Verhofstadt answered Deputy Donnelly regarding the lengthy transition period.  I view the statement made by Mr. Jeremy Corbyn as indicating a change in the political climate in the UK, which could lead to a second referendum.  We would welcome that, but will Mr. Verhofstadt share his opinion on the matter?</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's views on safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement.  The EU has been a significant stakeholder in the agreement, if not the most significant, and has underpinned it.</p> <p>  Turning to a concern for the island of Ireland, would it be possible to have a final deal without Ireland's agreement?</p></speech>

I am not referring to citizens' rights, which have been discussed at length.  Human rights equivalence is a pillar of the agreement.  I would appreciate Mr. Verhofstadt's thoughts on how it can be enforced as a key aspect in the negotiations and kept from being lost.</p> <p>  In terms of peace building and the Good Friday Agreement, it is important for Europe to understand Ireland's role and global contribution as a neutral nation.</p> <p>  My specific question is on the second stage of negotiations.  Mr. Verhofstadt has been clear, in that the European Parliament will have a say over whether we enter those negotiations.  A new trade negotiating mandate will need to be given by the Council to the Commission.  In his role in the European Parliament, will Mr. Verhofstadt seek for environmental, equality and employment standards to be central in any negotiating mandate so as to ensure that there is no race to the bottom, which would damage Ireland deeply?  Given that Mr. Verhofstadt's country of Belgium has referred investor courts to the European Court of Justice to test their compatibility with European law, can we expect that any trade negotiating mandate given to the Commission by the Council and supported by the Council will not include such mechanisms?</p></speech>

Presumably, that includes the European Parliament's British Members as well.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Verhofstadt agree that the problem with the state of the negotiations arises from the divisions within the British Cabinet?  Until Mr. Johnson, who Mr. Verhofstadt mentioned, is removed, banished or whatever and the British Cabinet reaches a single position, progress will be slow.  Perhaps a little time has to be allowed for that.  Does Mr. Verhofstadt agree that, as negotiations proceed, the British Cabinet will have to become more realistic?  If, like all of us, it wants to ensure the continuation of the invisible Border, it will have to be.</p></speech>

Much of what has been said today concerns what scenario we are to face, in that, it is in the future and the negotiation must conclude - if it is to conclude - successfully.  However, the reality for many people in this State is that the decision of the British people to leave the EU has been having a dramatic economic impact for some considerable time already.</p> <p>  In solidarity with hard-pressed sectors of our economy, will the EU respond with assistance and supports for struggling Irish enterprises?  As has been mentioned, these enterprises are found especially in the agrifood industry.  Mr. Verhofstadt may have met some of them yesterday.  Coming from County Monaghan, where Mr. Verhofstadt was yesterday, and representing Cavan and Monaghan as I do in this Chamber, I am conscious of the reality of daily life for many people.  There is a sizable fear that, whatever is decided, sectors will be significantly reduced and jobs lost without solid economic supports.</p></speech>

I noted with interest his comment that the EU would never allow Ireland to suffer from the UK's decision to leave Europe.</p><p>We greatly welcome that.  We are presuming Mr. Verhofstadt speaks on behalf of the EU negotiating team and that is what we are pinning our hopes on.  However, he stated that the solution in respect of Brexit has to come from the UK.  Unfortunately, those two positions are not compatible and they have not been compatible for the past 15 months.  There is nothing the UK Government has done that gives any bit of solace to us that the solution will come from the UK.  Along with all of my colleagues, I believe that if Mr. Verhofstadt can take one message from his visit here today, it is that we are depending on the EU to ensure that Ireland, as the country most exposed to this decision, does not suffer.  If we are depending on the UK to come up with a solution, as Mr. Verhofstadt said, that simply will not happen.  We have to proceed on the basis that it is the EU's responsibility to protect us, and that is what we need it to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Guy Verhofstadt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017092100002#L00200"><p>On the questions on external security, as I have already indicated in the first resolution, we in the European Parliament think that for the future relationship, the best way is to use an association agreement, as was seen in the Lisbon Treaty.  That gives the possibility not only to talk about trade but also to talk about the other issues we have to tackle in the future and the other parts of that relationship.  It can be on culture, on education or on research, and it can be on internal and external security matters.  I think it is in the interests of everybody, including the Union, that we do that.  Therefore, it will not only be about trade and economics; it will be a broader decision, in that sense.  I underline what has been said, namely, that the British side has proposed a number of ideas.</p> <p>  Second, many speakers said that it is all very well what I am saying but asked how, in practice and on practical matters, it will work.  I can tell them that, yesterday, I spoke with many representatives of sectors, especially about the practical consequences of Brexit and how to deal with these.  I did not only talk about borders and avoiding a hard border.  We spoke a lot about the general position of the Irish economy and of the Republic of Ireland, and the threats because of Brexit, because it is a main trading partner of Britain.  We spoke of how to secure this trading position and also the trading position of Ireland towards the rest of the European Union because the normal streams of goods towards the European continent are under threat if we have no good solutions in these Brexit negotiations.  I spoke about very concrete solutions for that with the different representatives of the sectors in order to understand their fears, their problems and how they see they could be solved in the future.  I have taken on board a number of very practical suggestions on how that could be done within an agreement with the UK while defending the economic and trade position of Ireland after the withdrawal.</p> <p>  I have noted also the suggestion that has been made by some speakers to put the Good Friday Agreement as an annex of the withdrawal agreement.  It is also a suggestion that has been made in the European Parliament and we are discussing that at the moment in the Brexit steering group.</p> <p>  On the divisions and the development of opinions in Britain, it is true that these are not for the moment helping the negotiations move forward.  However, let us hope that these divisions of opinion will be overcome in the coming days and weeks in order that this fourth negotiation round can be a step forward towards the future.</p> <p>  Another element, having noted the negative impact of Brexit, is whether the Union will take its responsibility.  Naturally, the Union will take its responsibility.  We have the instruments for that and the funds for that, and it will certainly be done.  However, let us first negotiate a good withdrawal agreement and a good association agreement on future relationships to minimise the impact, and then see what will be the nature of that impact.</p> <p>  On a last point, when I said in my introduction that it is for the UK to take responsibility and to come forward, this is not for lack of ideas because I have given ideas in my introduction and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has made a proposal here about an economic zone.  I have spoken about what some have said to me, which is that the best way to solve it is to extend the Single Market and the customs union to Northern Ireland.  All this is on the table.  However, the reason I am saying this is that it is true that the decision to go out of the European Union has not been taken by Ireland, by the Irish Government or by the European Union.  It is a consequence of a British decision so there is also, in that sense, a responsibility on their side to come forward with proposals that can work - not proposals which create a hard border, but proposals which avoid that.  That is the reason I am recalling that all the time.  There is, on their side, responsibility to accept a solution that is workable and, at the same time, that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.</p> <p>  We have to see it a little bit as an element of the negotiation.  It is not that they have taken a decision to go out and, so, we have all the problems on our back and have to find solutions for all the problems.  No.  There is a responsibility also on their side.  For example, financially, one cannot go out of the European Union and say that the whole financial burden is for the remaining 27.  Commitments made by 28 member states cannot be later on paid by the remaining 27.  In one or another way, it is like a divorce.  I have to tell the House I have no practical experience of divorces personally but I know that, in a divorce, you cannot go out and leave your partner alone in the house and say, "Now, all the financial things are for you.  Bye-bye."  That is not the way it works.  Commitments have been made and if commitments have been made, then it is also normal that payments will be required based on these commitments.</p></speech>

It is clear that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area, are fully recognised.  This meeting also provided an opportunity to underline the importance for Ireland of its continued membership of the EU and its commitment to Europe.

The meeting provided an opportunity for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to outline directly to Mr. Barnier their concerns for Ireland in relation to the negotiation process and its outcome.  Ireland's priorities include Northern Ireland, the Border and the Good Friday Agreement; the economic impact of Brexit, which has already manifested itself in the agrifood sector; the Single Market; and free movement, in particular of people in the common travel area.  As a result, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and European Union are being followed very closely in Ireland.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as the European Parliament's co-ordinator, has a key role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament. </p> <p>  The unique position of and special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland were referenced in the European Parliament's resolution of 5 April on the exit negotiations.  This early recognition of the challenges facing Ireland is welcome and reassuring but we need to maintain this focus.  While the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU has clear implications for Ireland, it also draws our attention again to the debate about the future of Europe and any changes that may emerge from the process now under way.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as you will hear, this is an issue of crucial importance to all of us, as parliamentarians representing our citizens who share a deep concern about where this bumpy road will lead us, as citizens of Ireland and Europe.  We are very interested in hearing your views on the process, the potential outcomes of the negotiations and the implications for the European Union.  I have great pleasure in asking you to address this unique meeting of the joint committees.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Guy Verhofstadt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017092100002#A00400"><p>Thank you very much a Cheann Comhairle, a Chathaoirligh and chairs and members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the joint committee in relation to the negotiations under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.  It is an honour for me to be here today and address you in this historic D&aacute;il Chamber.  I thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to address you here today because I am aware that it is not every day that a Member of the European Parliament responsible for such an important matter can address a meeting of joint committees of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I first want to deliver a message of solidarity with Ireland, its citizens and people.  We will never allow Ireland to suffer as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union.  That is a commitment given by the European Parliament and European Union as a whole.  I will come back to this later in my contribution. </p> <p>  Next year, it will be exactly 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Yesterday was the first time I visited Belfast.  It was a strange experience because for the past 20 years, we in the rest of Europe have not heard anything about Belfast on our television screens.  It is good to remember that because it is 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is not a practical arrangement on passports, borders, customs or tariffs - it is not about these matters - but an agreement about peace and the reconciliation of divided communities.  It is about rebuilding confidence and trust.</p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is also a successful innovation of citizenship itself.  Personally, I find the following sentence to be the most important sentence in the Agreement.  It is "the birthright of all the people in Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may choose".  In my opinion, these four simple words, "as they may choose", go against the outdated version of some states that do not like ambiguity, contingency or multiplicity.  They give to the people and individual citizens, rather than states, the power to choose their own destiny.  They are four simple words which have brought peace and stability to Northern Ireland based on openness and a common understanding that identities are multi-layered and complex and should bring people together rather than divide them.  In my opinion, these four simple words not only define Northern Ireland but Ireland as a whole. </p> <p>  I know that some British politicians, not to name Boris Johnson, criticise their country men and women for wanting to keep their European identity.  He even accused them of split allegiance.  This is a binary, old-fashioned and reductionist understanding of identity.  We need to be smarter and more open and inventive than that.  It is not one's origin or the fact that, by accident, one was born in this or that village, city or country that makes one a good citizen.  It is the fact that one embraces the values of one's community and cherishes the fundamental rights and freedoms of the society in which one lives.</p><p>These are values, rights and freedoms that are common in our European Union in all nations and in every one of our member states so I think it is nonsense to talk about a split allegiance.  It is perfectly possible, I think, but I have not practised it, to feel English, British and European at the same time and it is perfectly normal to be a Dubliner, Irish and European at the same time without being schizophrenic.  There is no question of split allegiance.  It is this vision that needs to be defended by our European Union just as the Union needs to defend, I think, and this is my second point, that there is no return to the past to a time of hard borders on our Continent, and certainly not to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  Members will know that is a point we made very clear in the European Parliament's resolutions we adopted on 5 April 2017.  </p><p> I am mistaken when I state that the Irish Border is in no way a natural one.  It is not a river or a mountain ridge.  It meanders for 310 miles through meadows, forests and farmlands.  It cannot be securely poised and is, therefore, an illogical divide.  The Border should at least remain invisible just as it is today.  It is a little bit visible because one can see a marking in yellow when one enters the Irish Republic.  The colour of the marking changes from white to yellow.  That is the big lesson that I learned yesterday. </p><p> I spent yesterday afternoon visiting the Border in County Monaghan where I met people who live and work there.  At one point, I stood astride the Border, with one foot in Northern Ireland and my other foot in the Republic.  I found it completely impossible to see where one jurisdiction ended and the other started.  Certainly, the cows could not see it.  The cows from the North ate grass in the South, they were milked in the North by a farmer from the South and their milk was bottled in the South.  I am a Belgian so surrealism comes naturally to me.  To re-instate a border would be more than surreal, it would be totally absurd, even for me.</p><p> There are borders and then there are borders.  Borders can be lines on maps, physical barriers or, worst of all, can run through people's hearts and minds.  These are the worst kind of borders because they breed division, discrimination and hostility.  I remind everyone, if I may, that the history of Europe is in many ways a history of borders.  Over the centuries our Continent has seen borders shift, disappear and re-appear.  As a liberal, my natural inclination is to be against borders.  It seems to me that borders are best when they are just lines on maps.  In many ways, the European Union is all about reducing borders to lines on maps and this is certainly the case, I think, for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  The Border between both jurisdictions created chaos, hate and violence.  To reduce it to a line on a map was a crucial achievement 20 years ago in which the European Union, the UK and Ireland played a decisive role.  I saw the results for myself yesterday.  Whether one is speaking about the economy, commerce, agriculture, health or other social services, the Border is featuring less and less as a factor in the economic and social life of the region, and that is precisely its greatest achievement.  It is a border that does not divide people but enables them to live together in peace.  It is a border that is not divisive, that does not run through people's hearts but instead does the opposite and creates a common purpose.  </p><p> Dear colleagues - if I may use those words as a parliamentarian - you know better than I that Ireland underwent a dramatic transformation over the past three decades economically and but also socially.  The Republic was a country defined by Catholicism and nationalism.  In 1973, the birth year of the current Prime Minister, only 7% of Irish were born abroad and today this number is 17%, which makes Ireland very diverse when compared with European standards.  The Irish economy has successfully integrated migrants from all over the world, from Poland to Nigeria.  Ireland is also the home of international IT giants.  All of this is an example, I think, of constructive and fair globalisation.  To summarise it, Ireland is no longer a nation of immigration but a country of destination.</p><p> Ireland has gained a lot of self-confidence over the past decades, and rightly so.  We, as a European Union, also share that.  Let us never forget that Europe is far more than co-operation between the two old enemies of France and Germany.  Today, Europe goes beyond a Franco-German relationship.  We need all hands on deck.  All 27 member states are needed to make Europe work because we belong to the same European civilisation.  Europe would not be half of what it is today without dynamic countries like Ireland, countries that have dealt with complex border and identity issues, and countries that were able to re-invent themselves with a respect for tradition, so Ireland is crucial to the Union.</p><p> The Irish Border and all things related are a priority in the negotiations.  In the new resolution that the European Parliament will adopt in early October we will state that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit and that Ireland or any other member state will not be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.  The interests of Ireland are part and parcel of the interests of the EU 27.  The Irish position is the European position and the European position is the Irish position. </p><p> In this joint position, let me also make one last thing very clear.  The re-emergence of the Border question between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic has not been caused by the Irish Republic or the rest of the European Union.  The issue is the inevitable consequence of the choice by Britain to leave the European Union so the resolution of this issue is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom.  It is for them to come up with a workable solution, one which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, preserves the common travel area, avoids a hardening of the Border and last, but not least, does not compromise Irish membership and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  In my opinion, this can only be a unique solution.  Most of the people I met yesterday, on both sides of the Border, believe that this unique solution requires that one way or another Northern Ireland should remain part of the customs union and the Single Market.  I know the UK Government, in its paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland, has rejected this idea.  That is fair enough, but the UK must come forward with another proposal that avoids any disruption.  Simply saying that the problem will be solved by using new technology is, in my opinion, not convincing.</p><p> I am pleased to say that the Irish MEPs, some of whom are here today and seated in the corner, are working very hard to defend all of this, a position I can assure the members that is shared right across the whole European Parliament.  We know the Irish people have made the choice to be a core member state of the EU and, because of this, we will never let them down.  The EU also needs their help to reform Europe because that is something we also urgently need to do.  I think that Brexit is an ideal moment to reflect on the future of the Union we belong to.  There are enough challenges ahead, challenges that transcend national borders such as climate change, international terrorism and remaining economic difficulties. These are all issues that individual countries cannot tackle on their own.  Currently, they have also recognised that Europe is too weak to take on these challenges.  In order for us to beat, for example, international terrorism, we need European capabilities.  To overcome the economic crisis, we need a banking union to clean up our banks and a fiscal union to protect our single currency, the euro.</p><p>To fight the protectionism of President Trump and Brexit, we must have a Europe that is vocal and strong on the world stage.<br/><br/>To conclude, I believe that Brexit has opened the eyes of many people.  Do not misunderstand me - people are still very critical of the European Union, and for good reason.  However, nobody wants to leave and destroy Europe.  On the contrary, it is fair to say there is a renewed belief in Europe, not in this Europe but in a different, reformed Europe.  In any case, people have started voting pro-European again.  They did it in Austria, the Netherlands, and France and soon, hopefully, they will do so in Germany.  However, these are not votes for a <i>status quo</i>.  This is a way of people saying, &quot;Look, we are giving you one last chance to make Europe work and to make it better and fit for the future&quot;, or, in the words of Seamus Heaney, we &quot;Believe that further shore/Is reachable from here&quot;.</p></speech>

You never fail to interest your audience.  You gave an interesting, profound and stimulating contribution.  I call the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.586" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017092100002#C00300"><p>It is a pleasure to see Mr. Verhofstadt again and to welcome him to Dublin and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The last time we met he welcomed a delegation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to the European Parliament, so I am delighted to be able to join the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in returning the hospitality to him today.</p><p>To be blunt, this is a horrible problem.  It is a mess, and there is nothing nice about it.  People do not realise how detrimental an effect this will have on their lives and those of their children.  The UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the implications for Ireland and the implications for the European Union are all profound.  Quite frankly, I was saddened by the decision.  However, it was clear and we must respect it.  We all must work on the challenges the decision presents.  Members of this House have been doing that across a number of committees and the European Parliament has also been doing it.  We see the hard, thoughtful and diligent work the European Parliament's committees have been doing in considering Brexit and the Irish MEPs have been playing a strong role in that.  I acknowledge their work and thank them for it.</p><p>My committee has met a number of stakeholders and Government Ministers and is following the negotiations carefully through the documentation that is published.  I have been heartened by the supportive comments and the positions taken by the European Parliament, many governments and the European Commission.  However, the chips are down now.  Reality is starting to bite.  There are substantial and significant choices to be made by the negotiators and those they represent.  Ultimately, Mr. Barnier and his team, Mr. Verhofstadt and the other Members of the European Parliament represent the citizens of Europe, including the citizens of Ireland, who will feel the impact in their daily lives.  It is up to all of us to work together on practical solutions to minimise the impact as much as possible on the daily lives of citizens, on the quality of what they eat, the amount they must pay for it, how secure their savings and pensions are, whether they can go to shops or to mass up or down the road without going through border checks, how easily they can study abroad, what prices farmers get for their beef, lamb and milk, what price the consumer must pay for it and whether they can make friends with whoever they wish and set up a home together wherever they wish, be it in London, Brussels, Dublin or Belfast.  All of these matters could be impacted upon by Brexit.  All of them could be changed into something that resembles the parts of the past that we thought we had left far behind us.</p><p>We must work together and remain involved in and practical about the negotiations.  We are not alone in this.  There are two sides to a negotiation.  I had hoped to see more practical and pragmatic suggestions from the British side by now, but perhaps they will come forward.  They might even come forward in the Prime Minister's speech.  I certainly hope so.</p><p>On the European side, the transparent way in which negotiation documents have been shared with citizens is good and must continue.  National parliaments must continue to be involved in debates and discussions.  I would be interested in any recommendations or ideas Mr. Verhofstadt has to strengthen the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments in considering Brexit.  For example, is there any intention to hold interparliamentary meetings involving national parliaments and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group?  There would be huge value and benefit in that.  Mr. Verhofstadt travelled to the Border yesterday and I am delighted that he enjoyed meeting the cows there.  I hope this visit will have given him a valuable insight into why we value the current Border arrangements so much and why they should be preserved.</p><p>The biggest challenge will be goods.  There was an interesting letter in yesterday's edition of the <i>Financial Times</i>from a Belgian customs official.  It suggested that border goods should be applied for at the Irish Sea and that the customs union rules could be applied by the European Union customs officials operating in ports in Northern Ireland.  That was imaginative.  Are such suggestions helpful?  Of course, it would be best if the UK would decide to stay in the customs union, but that decision is out of our hands.  It is one for the United Kingdom.</p><p>The economic impact on Ireland is significant.  Each time an Oireachtas committee examines a new issue, a new box of challenges is opened - how aeroplanes will land, how goods will get to the market from Irish ports through Wales and England to eventually reach Belgium and so forth.  There are endless challenges.  I remain concerned about Brexit for Irish citizens but, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I am also concerned about the impact on the rest of the European Union.  Even if Brexit were not on the horizon, it would be important to consider the future of Europe and where we should be going.  My committee has started a public consultation process in Ireland and a series of engagements with stakeholders to examine what type of Europe we want in the future.</p></speech>

That really struck me.  We need a Europe with ambitions that are tempered by the fire of reality in all member states.  It is a principle that most people on the street will not explain, but I instinctively support it.  We must recognise that.  Mr. Verhofstadt has a strong vision for the future of Europe, so I would appreciate knowing more on how he sees us bridging the gap between the ideals and the need to deliver for our citizens.  Again, I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for attending this meeting.</p></speech>

I am sure we will find his address and interaction with us today very useful and beneficial.  As he will have seen and heard during his visits to Belfast, Monaghan and Dublin, Brexit impacts on every policy area across this island and will have a knock-on effect on the lives of citizens across the European Union and beyond.</p><p>Ireland, as Mr. Verhofstadt knows, stands to be significantly and disproportionately affected.  I speak for the members of our committee when I tell him that we, as public representatives, are greatly concerned at the negative domestic impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I know from listening to what he has said in recent months that he is very aware of and interested in our concerns, a fact demonstrated by his visit, North and South, yesterday and today.</p><p> As our committee looks outward in its work, I will focus my remarks on how Brexit impacts on the external environment, however as a Deputy for two Border counties, one of which Mr. Verhofstadt visited yesterday, it would be remiss of me not to remind him of the great damage the resurrection of a border would have on the communities I represent here in the national Parliament.  I welcome his comments made yesterday and hope he can expand on them later.</p><p> Much of the progress made in the improved Irish-British relations over the past 25 years was due in no small part to our common EU membership.  I recall, from my own time as a Minister being told that Irish and British officials were meeting approximately 26 times per day in Brussels.  The loss of this high level of ongoing and important interactions with our nearest neighbour and close ally is deeply regrettable.  Its loss will be keenly felt.  We will be doing our utmost to compensate as best we can for that loss of engagement.</p><p> As Mr. Verhofstadt knows, Ireland is militarily neutral but that does mean that we in Ireland stand aside when it comes to promoting peace and development through the UN, the European Union and our own bilateral actions - far from it.  We have a long, proud and strong record in peace support and humanitarian operations via our Defence Forces.  At present, 600 members of the Defence Forces are serving on UN-mandated missions across the globe.  Given our policy remit for both foreign affairs and defence, our committee knows and recognises the global challenges and security threats we face, both within the EU and in the EU's neighbourhood.  For those reasons we recognise a good and strong relationship with the Britain on foreign policy, security and defence is essential and is in all our interests.  For those reasons, we welcome last week's publication by the British Government of a paper on foreign policy, defence and development, and we are pleased to see the British Government outline its willingness and desire to continue to have a close partnership with the EU on foreign, defence, security and development issues.  We note that Britain proposes the exchange of foreign and security policy experts, military personnel and the exchange of classified information to support external actions.  Ongoing co-operation is much needed and is common sense in these very fraught times for Europe and neighbouring areas as well.</p><p> I wish to refer specifically to development co-operation and the impact Brexit may have on the world's poorest people whose voices are often unheard in these debates.  While Brexit may be happening far from the poorest countries in the world, they also stand to be adversely affected.  It is unknown what will become of the significant aid contributions Britain makes both to the European Development Fund - at present it contributes 15% of the fund, amounting to &euro;4.48 billion, and 13% of the total of the aid portion of the EU's general budget for 2016, or &euro;1.23 billion.  Loss of that substantial British funding would have huge ramifications for the many programmes in the poorest regions of the world which depend so heavily on it.  The committee hopes a solution will be found that will allow and encourage Britain to continue to contribute.  I believe there are precedents for that with Switzerland and Norway participating in EU-managed trust funds.</p><p> Brexit will result in the loss of an important, influential and respected voice on the shaping of EU development policy from around the EU table.  Our committee will encourage the Government to step up and play its part in filling those gaps as much as possible.  There is also the significant concern that developing countries could lose their duty free, quota free access to British markets, as is currently provided for under EU agreements.</p><p> More generally, we are concerned about the Paris Accord and climate action.  All those issues must be taken into account in the complex negotiations that lie ahead.  I have no doubt the European Parliament will ensure those concerns are brought to the fore in his engagements with the Council and the Commission.  As Mr. Verhofstadt said, our island has been transformed since 1998.  We cannot countenance any agreement that would set us back or hinder the necessary progress for the further development of all of this island.  To echo Mr. Verhofstadt, it would be absolutely absurd to put obstacles in the way of the 30,000 people who cross the Border on a daily basis going about their business.</p></speech>

Today is world International Day of Peace, as designated by the United Nations and that should not be lost on our defining moment in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent establishment of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in 2007 to monitor and oversee the ongoing implementation of that historic peace agreement.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt to Leinster House.  The attendance of the many dignitaries, ambassadors, officials, MPs, MEPs and MLAs, sends out a clear signal of the need for solutions to Brexit and peace and if those solutions can be found on this island our many problems in the EU may also be resolved.  I commend the membership of the committee, its officials and witnesses on their ongoing work on Brexit and exploring solutions while extremely cognisant of building on our fragile peace and progressing the many legacy issues.</p> <p>  For many of us there can be various defining moments in our history but for me the main aim of the Treaty of Rome, the forerunner to the EEC or EU, was to ensure that peace not war would unite us in prosperity.  I am 59 years of age and was born ten years before the further outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 that broke many families and fractured communities and their prosperity in Northern Ireland, the Border region and beyond.  I also remember life pre-EEC and post-EEC membership and the transformation that this great island achieved as a result of EU investment in trade and infrastructure, much of which is ongoing.  For all of us in this Chamber and beyond the strides that this country has made have been significantly enhanced with peace, which has encouraged communities North and South to face each other with a common purpose, respect and recognition that there is strength in unity and friendship is what is important.</p> <p>  Politicians will not be forgiven by this generation and future ones if they fail to progress and enhance this fragile peace.  Let there be no mistake, Brexit has the potential to derail so many of the gains of this island and we must not allow that to happen.  Some key findings of the report from our committee have found that the all-Ireland economy must not be affected or allowed to regress.  A tailored solution taking into account its very unique circumstances is required.  We are concerned about the commitment to continue both the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which provided &euro;3.5 billion in the past 20 years.  It is important that such a commitment would immediately be set out clearly so that people can plan and communities can continue to prosper from the PEACE moneys.</p> <p>  The committee calls on the Government and the EU to undertake a detailed study on the potential implications of Brexit on reconciliation.  Allied to that is the psychological impact identified by the committee that Brexit will further affect many families in the North and along the Border corridor.  Whether one has been a victim, a combatant or an innocent bystander the emotional scars of murder, death and explosions remain deep rooted and continue to need healing.</p> <p>  Brexit presents many challenges but there are also opportunities.  The committee believes the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can step up and take on additional responsibilities, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council, whose remit needs to be reviewed and enhanced.  Like Mr. Verhofstadt, the committee has visited many groups in Northern Ireland who feel they have no voice in the current political stalemate and it is the committee's responsibility to bring those anxieties to his attention.</p><p>These need to be represented in the all-Ireland debate.  Indeed, the absence of unionism and a unionist voice at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is regrettable.</p><p> Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, widely recognised as the cornerstone of peace.  That anniversary takes place at a time of uncertainty in North-South and British-Irish relations.  Perhaps it is an opportune time for the EU and the European Parliament to reinvigorate its investment in making our peace process a world model and exemplar that will show war-torn regions around the world how a lasting peace can be achieved.  I should add that many representatives of such regions have visited us to look at what we are doing.  Politics is about the art of the possible and we owe it to our children and our children&rsquo;s children to live in peace, prosperity and harmony on this island.</p><p> Both Mr. Verhofstadt and Mr. Barnier continue to use the term "unique solution" in their deliberations.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt suggest what his thoughts are on that solution and what he feels it could look like?</p><p> With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I have been asked by my colleagues from the British Parliament on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee, who are here with us today, to ask Mr. Verhofstadt if he will produce a report on his fact-finding visit after he returns to Brussels.  Will he share his experience of the last 48 hours with Mr. Barnier?  How concerned does he believe the European Parliament is about the impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement?</p></speech>

I welcome our Members of the European Parliament and all the invited guests.  I thank our committee chairs and committee members for organising what has already been described as a unique but very important meeting and gathering.</p> <p>  It is extremely important to thank Mr. Verhofstadt for his willingness to come to Ireland but also, and most importantly, for his willingness to deepen his understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and, of course, the Border issues.  It is very clear from his statement that he has a very real understanding of how fragile the peace process is.  I thank him for his work to date as the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit.  As the European Parliament plays such an important role in the Brexit negotiations, it is important to thank him for his supportive statements to date on the peace process and on the Border and for his words of solidarity with the Irish people today.</p> <p>  While Brexit may not be the first priority for all member states, it is, of course, a very real and imminent concern for many Irish citizens, for Irish businesses large and small, and for our industries, in particular the agrifood sector which is already feeling the effect of Brexit.  I know that Members here, throughout this debate, will be very keen to hear Mr. Verhofstadt's views and an update on how negotiations are progressing, but also to hear his further views on the future of Europe.  The future of Europe is not Brexit.  It is a Europe without the UK and we need to ensure it is a Union that protects, empowers and defends its citizens.  It is even more important that this conversation is one that all citizens should be involved in.</p> <p>  I look forward to a very positive engagement with Members and our three committees as, I am sure, does Mr. Verfhofstadt.  I thank him again for his support and for his recognition of our unique situation.</p></speech>

We will now move to a session of questions and answers.  In accordance with the yesterday's recommendation of the Business Committee I will take blocks of three questions, each lasting approximately two minutes, starting with the party leaders.  I will start with Deputy Martin.  We will take three questions then return to Mr. Verhofstadt.</p></speech>

I also thank him for his strong support for Ireland, for the manner in which he has facilitated the ALDE group in supporting the Irish cause in respect of Brexit, and for his determination that Ireland would not suffer.  In the limited time that is available I will put two key points to Mr. Verhofstadt, if I may.  He rightly drew attention to the citizenship dimension of the Good Friday Agreement and the idea of multiple identities - of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.  It is extremely important that in the ultimate resolution of this, the idea of Irish citizenship as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is protected in the context of the resolution between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In a post-Brexit scenario, Northern Ireland will have the largest concentration of European Union citizens outside of the union's borders.  It is essential that mechanisms are found which will ensure those citizens are in a position to continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of European citizenship.</p> <p>  Second, notwithstanding the British position at the moment in terms of the customs union, which is ultimately the key issue in terms of the Border question, we have been putting forward the idea that a special economic zone needs to be considered.  There are many examples of economic zones across the world.  Economic zones in themselves do not challenge or undermine the unique constitutional framework of east-west, North-South and the Northern Ireland settlement.  In other words, it is possible within the existing constitutional framework to devise an economic zone for the North and the Border counties which would maintain freedom of trade - goods, services and people - North and South.  We need to move on from the language of a "frictionless border" or "no border" and start working on concrete ideas and solutions that could ultimately bring a resolution to the issue.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid bu&iacute;och de faoi choinne a chuairt.  I offer Mr. Verhofstadt a hundred thousand welcomes and thank him for his visit to our island.  I welcome the content of his speech very much.  In his remarks today, Mr. Verhofstadt acknowledged that people are very critical of the European Union.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's position.  We want to see a more democratic, demilitarised, peaceful European Union which embraces economic and social justice, international solidarity and an end to poverty.  Notwithstanding that, we campaigned in the North for a Remain vote, because it is our view that to have one part of the island outside the European Union and another part inside is just folly.  It is a really significant fact which has been ignored by some, but people in the North supported that position.  They voted to remain within the EU and we believe that vote should be upheld and actively defended.  The various policy positions which the British Government has unveiled, including leaving the customs union, will all cost jobs, undermine the economy and subvert sectors in both parts of the island.</p> <p>  I particularly want to welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's remarks on the Good Friday Agreement.  I know that he values the peace process and I understand he met some of our colleagues: Martina Anderson MEP, our group leader in the European Parliament, our national spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy David Cullinane, and our Members of the European Parliament.  His description of the Border and of partition is very much appreciated, as are his warnings of the dire consequences if it is reinforced.</p> <p>  To move on to my questions, will Mr. Verhofstadt give us an assessment of the possibility of agreement, given that there has only been limited information available thus far and that there does not appear to have been any real progress from the British side?  I welcome his suggestion that the North remain within the customs union and the Single Market.  That is effectively the designated status for the North which we have campaigned for and which the D&aacute;il, the majority of MLAs and the European Parliament support.  The threat and the danger to the Good Friday Agreement could be averted if the agreement was incorporated in full as a protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  I commend that position to Mr. Verhofstadt and ask him to give his support to that proposition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017092100002#E00700"><p>I welcome the visit of Mr. Verhofstadt.  His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments in relation to enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed.</p><p>I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland.  He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter.<br/><br/>My first question is very simple.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principle of parity of esteem and human rights protection is upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU?  If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights?<br/><br/>My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in <i>The Observer</i>on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position in relation to citizens' rights.  He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement.  This is another simple question.  How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years?  I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.</p></speech>

I thank the honourable Members and the Chairs of the committees.  Maybe I can pick three elements from the various interventions that have been made.  Reference was made to the state of the negotiations and I was asked whether we will use our veto.  One needs to have something to veto before one can use one's veto.  For the moment, there is nothing to veto because - let us be honest - no real progress has been made in the negotiations.  We have had three rounds of negotiations.  The first round involved the formal start of negotiations, the second round involved the presentation and the third round involved the clarification.  I think it is time for the negotiation in the fourth and fifth rounds.  That is what we are hoping for now.  Maybe the intervention of the British Prime Minister will lead to a breakthrough in the coming days.  Based on the state of play now, those of us on the European Parliament side do not see sufficient progress to call for the so-called "second stage" of the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  The sequencing is important because Article 50 of the treaty says that there needs to be an agreement on withdrawal in the first instance before a new relationship can start to be established between the EU and the withdrawing country.  Let us be very blunt about it - the first three rounds were very slow.  We hope the fourth and fifth rounds in October can speed up the negotiations.  It is time for the uncertainty to stop, in the interests of everybody, particularly businesses and citizens.  This uncertainty is having a negative impact on the hearts and minds of citizens and on daily economic life.  The only way to stop it is to go forward in the negotiations.</p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to the Good Friday Agreement.  The European Parliament has made it very clear from day one - it pushed this in the guidelines of the European Council - that the wording of the Good Friday Agreement should be included in all its parts.  This has been a request from the European Parliament.  Keeping the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is a key element for us.  We cannot risk the possibility of Brexit creating a return to the Troubles that we saw in the past.  That is a key element for this whole negotiation.  I found that this point - the risk to the Good Friday Agreement posed by the Brexit discussion - was not touched on sufficiently during the whole debate before the referendum in Britain.  I accept that this is in the past now.  Ireland can count on the European Parliament to defend the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  We will never allow whatever solution is reached to put that in danger.  As the EU played an important role in the Good Friday Agreement, it is keen to defend its own work and its own achievements.</p> <p>  The third issue is the solution for Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier, I have heard many solutions for Northern Ireland already.  It has been suggested that an economic zone could be created, or that the Single Market and the customs union could continue to be extended to Northern Ireland.  All of these solutions are possible.  As the European Parliament will express in its next resolution, however, the position paper that the British Government has put on the table is not possible because it says that there should be a return to a border and that it will be made invisible.  I have always thought that if a border is not visible, it is no border.  If a border is visible, it is a border.  It is not only with a number of technical features that the problem can be solved.  We are in favour of any solution that avoids in any way a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  That is going to be our goal.  As I indicated in my intervention yesterday, the main proposal for avoiding a hard border that I have heard involves Northern Ireland continuing to participate in the Single Market and the customs union.</p></speech>

I have no doubt about the stupidity and, frankly, obnoxiousness of the Tory position when it comes to the negotiations about Britain's exit from the EU.  I am thinking particularly of its anti-immigrant policies.  Given that the EU insisted on the cruel punishment of our citizens for the banking collapse, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says that the EU will not allow Ireland to be punished for Britain's decision to leave the EU?  For example, the EU insisted on the imposition of dreadful austerity on our citizens for things that were not their responsibility.  Given that the EU insists on borders of steel, barbed wire and police camps enforced by Frontex in order to keep out tens of thousands of desperate refugees who are fleeing warzones like Syria, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says noble things about the EU not believing in borders and wanting to reduce borders to lines on maps?  If the EU is willing to do this to desperate and vulnerable people, some of whom are drowning in the Mediterranean as a result, how can we take seriously Mr. Verhofstadt's pledge to try not to impose borders here?  What Britain decides to do is one thing, but I would like to hear an absolute guarantee that the EU will not insist on some sort of border in order to protect its Single Market.  If we were to get such a commitment from Mr. Verhofstadt, we could deal with Britain and the problems it is imposing.</p><p>Can he give us that guarantee?  Can we give credibility to his assertions about not believing in borders, given his insistence on imposing them in a very cruel way in other parts of the European Union?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work that has been done by our officials, Departments and various bodies to prepare for the unknown while working in a vacuum.  At the founding of the EU its principles were peace, harmony and economic and social development for everybody but those principles are being undermined by the way Europe responded to the migrant crisis and by the economic crash, which showed a widening division between rich and poor.  Is this an opportunity for the EU to redefine its vision and to become more committed to the values on which it was set up?  There is an issue around development aid and we are seeing an increasing securitisation agenda.  There is a fear that this will divert badly needed funding and there will now be a further shortfall from Britain.</p> <p>  My second question relates to Ireland as we will be particularly affected in many areas because of Brexit and its potential economic consequences.  How can Europe support Irish jobs and businesses in that area?  A terrible gamble is being taken with the Good Friday Agreement.  Flawed as it is, it has ensured peace for a generation who have not experienced the violence their parents and grandparents experienced.  As well as economic consequences, there are consequences relating to identity and culture.</p></speech>

He visited the Border yesterday and I hope all the cows will be as quiet as those he met in Monaghan.  He said we needed to sort out and clean up our banking but we left it a bit late in the day for that.  We did not get a lot of assistance when we had the crash and we had to sign up to some very stiff penalties.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt said other countries had recently had votes which were more conciliatory towards the EU, and that is good.  I interpreted him as saying there was one last chance to be more democratic, but democracy in Brussels has been lost.  I welcome our MEPs here today, but there have been many regulations and restrictions as to what we can and cannot do and that is why Brexit happened.  They need to look at that, and comments from some very senior people after Brexit were not very helpful.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt might elaborate on what he meant by a frictionless border.  There is a massive border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is much bigger than ours with three checkpoints and which was built with EU funding.  Mr. Verhofstadt says it will not happen here and that Great Britain will have to look after the Border, but that is not good enough for us.  We need concrete and tangible measures.  It is difficult but we need to know the bottom line and the impact it will have on the Single Market, among other issues.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Clare Bailey, from the Assembly in the North.  We are very close to our English and Scottish colleagues and our colleagues in the European Parliament, Philippe Lamberts and others, with whom we work very closely on the European Green Party position.  I am very heartened by what Mr. Verhofstadt said because it marks a change from what Mr. Barnier said when he was here a few months ago, to the effect that a border is a border.  He said there would be free movement of people but not of trade or goods, but Mr. Verhofstadt has said the solution has to be one where an effective customs union or the Single Market is upheld.  Will that be the red line?  Will the Parliament, which has the ultimate veto on any agreement, accept it?  We are now into the second phase of the negotiations because the first phase was primarily about people.  It seems Mr. Verhofstadt said that he will protect this island in the area of customs, goods and services.  He concentrated on four words, which were, "as they may choose", and in respect of the Good Friday Agreement there are another four key words, "in all its parts".  How will the European Parliament choose when it comes to preserving the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts?  Mr. Verhofstadt's language today could not have given a clearer signal that we were going to preserve an island for the trade in goods and services and not just people.  I welcome his clarity on this as it is the right position.  Mr. Verhofstadt should be strong on it or the negotiations will take place and, at the very end, the British will say they did not know that was his position.  I agree with the position he has set out today.</p></speech>

It is not for us to say it has to be this or that system as that is for the negotiations to provide, but we have to give the green light, or the red light if we do not agree.  "No hard border" is not a rhetorical element of our position but a firm position of the European Parliament and we will never accept an outcome of negotiations which does exactly the opposite.  There are possibilities to achieve it and in the negotiations we will have to try to find viable solutions.  I have indicated a few possibilities in this area.</p> <p>  There was a remark on my commitment to the external borders of the European Union.  When there are problems with the external borders of the European Union, they are mainly because of a lack of European Union.  They are problems caused by policies of nation states and not by a so-called European policy.  There is a lack of European policy on migration, asylum and border management.  Excuse me if a use a non-parliamentary term, but it is crazy.</p></speech>

It is nonsense to do that.  In that respect the position of the European Parliament is that we support a European border management in a decent, human way.  This is absolutely needed.  Do Members know the budget of the European Border and Coastguard Agency, which used to be known as Frontex?  It is &euro;250 million.  Homeland security in the United States is &euro;62 billion.  We think we can solve problems at a European level without giving the means and the possibility to do so.  People say the Union does not tackle the challenges of today and does not have good results, but to have good results one needs good policies, for which one needs the financial means.  In terms of a European asylum system to replace Dublin - excuse me for criticising Dublin but I refer to its place in asylum policy, in the form of the Dublin Regulation - we need ways of having legal migration because this is the only way to tackle illegal migration.  We push asylum seekers into the arms of criminal organisations because the only way to ask for asylum is to set foot on European soil.</p><p>I remember the first time I attended the European Council as Belgian Prime Minister.  It was in 1999 in the north of Finland, in Tampere, where it is always dark.  We decided that we should have a common European asylum and migration policy.  So many years later, we are still not there.  That is the problem of Europe.  It is not only a question of announcing things but also of making them really happen.</p><p> The third question was on the specificities and interests of Ireland.  The strategy we and the EU negotiator are following is that all the interests of Ireland are taken on board in the negotiation mandate of the European Union.  That is the way to work on this.  That is the way to ensure that those interests are taken on board in the final agreement.  It is also the best way to keep the unity of the EU 27 because - let us be very realistic - there are going to be attempts to undermine it, which cannot happen.  The only way to prevent it is to fully take on board the interests of Ireland - the Irish Republic - in the negotiation mandate, and that is what we in the European Parliament will try to secure.</p></speech>

He should also be complimented on his passion and commitment to the European concept, something which has become vague in some quarters and countries and the results of which we have seen.  He has the commitment and determination to follow through on what he has said, which is hugely important for this country and for the island of Ireland.</p><p>The <i>status quo</i>must be maintained.  Any diminution of what we have enjoyed for the past 20 years in respect of Northern Ireland or of what we have achieved during our years of membership of the European Union must be prevented.  We must improve, grow and develop these conditions as time goes by.  We must guard against any movement whatsoever to diminish the role of the European Union in our affairs or our role in European affairs.  We must be very careful not to go down that road.</p><p>Mr. Verhofstadt has been very constant and consistent in his views since we met him in Brussels on a number of occasions.  Does he remain satisfied that the European project will continue for all other EU countries?  Will disruptive words such as occur from time to time be curtailed and will all members of the EU be conscious of the need to work together for the Union?  Each member state must take ownership.  None of us is on the outside looking in.  We are all part of Europe and must maintain that position.  Can Mr. Verhofstadt be sure that we will be able to maintain that position throughout Europe in the future?</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.  I would like to ask him about the customs union.  I met recently with members of the British Government in London.  They are resolute that they are leaving the customs union and were pretty clear that they are open to regulatory divergence, including in food, animal welfare and so on.  As we all know, they insist both are possible without any borders.</p> <p>  There has been a bovine theme this morning so I will give an example in keeping with it.  Brazil produces high-quality, grass-fed beef at just above half the price that British and Irish farmers can afford.  If the UK, outside the customs union, were to reach a zero-tariff agreement with Brazil on beef, large containers of high-quality Brazilian beef would land in Belfast.  Smugglers would convey that beef into the Republic.  Some of those smugglers have links to paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, the beef would continue on to the rest of Europe.  Northern Ireland would thus be used as a back door for cheap, high-quality, tariff-free, illegal beef to come into Europe.  Inevitably, the EU would have to respond and, inevitably, we would see a hard border.  We would have a nationalist community in Northern Ireland pulled out of Europe against its will, seeing a fence built around it, at the same time as profits from smuggling would start funnelling into paramilitary organisations there.  Brazilian cows could contribute to the material destabilisation of the peace process.</p> <p>  I sense some softening of a position in the UK on the customs union.  The British are saying they will leave the customs union but might be able to talk about a customs union.  What is the European Parliament's position on trying to find the space where people can save face politically but, by changing the word "the" to "a", where the UK can stay in the customs union in all but name, thus avoiding a hard border around the Six Counties?</p></speech>

I hope he will report back to the European Commission on these welcome engagements.  On behalf of my colleagues who are MPs and MEPs, I ask if he intends to produce a formal report not just for the Commission but also for the steering group of the European Parliament that is dealing with Brexit.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt said he accepts Ireland's unique circumstances.  That is something we saw in the European Commission's paper as well and I welcome it.  We want to hear what, in the final analysis, the term "unique" will mean for Ireland.  I welcome that Mr. Verhofstadt says that the North of Ireland must remain in the customs union.  As we know, the British Government is against this.  That needs to be a very clear, firm view not just of the European Parliament but also of the Commission.  It has to be an absolute red line issue.  If the North is taken out of the European Union against its will and if it is also taken out of the customs union and Single Market against its will, there will be an EU frontier on the island of Ireland.  There will be a border.  We do not want a hard border, a soft border or any type of border.  It has to be a very clear, firm position of the European Commission that the North should remain in the customs union.</p> <p>  We also want it set as a protocol that the Good Friday Agreement, as was said, be attached to the withdrawal agreement.  That gives full legal protections to the agreement.  We cannot cherry-pick the Good Friday Agreement.  It must be protected in its entirety.  Citizens in the North have to have access to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>  In respect of reforming the European Union, democracy is the key issue.  Reform means different things to different people.  My view of reform of the European Union might be different from that of Mr. Verhofstadt.  If we are to learn anything from Brexit, it is that we need more democracy in Europe.  I hope that will be at the heart of any debate on the future of Europe.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for attending.  I am delighted to hear him talk about the new-found solidarity of a post-Brexit EU in which Irish citizens will not have to pick up the cost of reckless banking across Europe in the future.  I will move on from that matter, however.</p> <p>  There is a notion that the UK is responsible for the Border and that it is, therefore, its problem.  Let us be totally honest; it is not.  As the Deputy across the Chamber just pointed out with his Brazilian beef example, the problem is Europe's and not the UK's.  The British will have no interest whatsoever in putting a border in place.  Their sole concern is migration.  They can control migration on the boats and aircraft travelling from Northern Ireland.  One has to have one's passport to get a flight to Britain as matters stand.  How do we protect the Single Market when confronted with a Britain that could not care less about a border in Northern Ireland?  How do we defend the rights of some 1.5 million Irish citizens or potential Irish citizens who are, by reason of geography, living on the wrong part of this island?</p><p>How do we guarantee them access to such programmes as ERASMUS+?  How do we guarantee them free travel throughout the European Union?  How do we guarantee them access to all the benefits that are bestowed on every citizen of Europe?  A citizen of Ireland is by default a citizen of Europe.  How do we guarantee these things?  Finally, how do we bring the European Union closer to the citizen on the ground?  Citizens in this country have taken one hell of a beating over the past eight to ten years with austerity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.627" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Guy Verhofstadt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017092100002#J00200"><p>Again, I will respond to three of four of the points that have been made.  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will start with the last point on citizenship because we have talked a lot about borders and economic interests but perhaps not enough about citizenship.  The position of the Parliament, which will be reiterated in the new resolution, is that we need to protect fully the EU citizenship that several hundred thousands of Northern Irish citizens who have Irish passports have.  We must take this seriously.  It concerns all the elements linked to EU citizenship.  EU citizenship is not something from which one can pick and choose - consular aid, yes, but voting rights, no.  It is a concept that is linked to EU citizenship and the position of the European Parliament is that we must protect it.  In the Brexit steering group, one of the priorities is to look into this and be sure that we on the European side defend this concept during the negotiations.  It cannot be the case that we say these people are EU citizens but that EU citizenship does not mean anything.  That is not possible.  It must mean what it is: all the rights that are in fact linked to that concept.</p> <p>  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will respond to another question that has been put forward: what is happening now in this discussion about citizens' rights in general?  This also concerns Irish citizens living in Britain.  Our concept, our proposal, from the European side and the European Parliament side is that we simply continue collectively the rights that the more than 3 million EU citizens living in the UK have currently.  We are very critical - and we will reiterate this in the next resolution - of the UK side's proposal to introduce a new concept of settled status in British immigration legislation that will require each one of these millions of citizens to make an individual request to continue to have his or her rights.  Individual means individual, so if there are four family members, four requests need to be initiated.  There will be a number of conditions and a need to prove a number of things.  This will create an enormous administrative burden on these millions of European citizens, including many Irish citizens in Britain.  The same goes for UK citizens living on the Continent but I do not think this is such a big problem because all the remaining EU member states recognise that the best way forward is simply to continue the rights those citizens have now.  I am saying this because this is a key issue that must be solved, it is to be hoped as quickly as possible, to end the uncertainty for these millions of people who are today already subject to a number of practices by which they are losing a number of their rights.  This is not to mention that some of them received a letter - apparently it was a mistake - stating they had simply to leave the country as quickly as possible.  This is completely against the EU treaties because, until withdrawal, the UK continues to be a member of the European Union, needs to apply fully EU law and does not have the right to send such letters.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the customs union and the example of beef was given.  Other examples are possible.  The problem for the European Union is not that the British side may say tomorrow they want to continue in the customs union.  Nobody in the European Union will say that is not possible.  However, to be in the customs union also means that the competence to make trade agreements continues to be exercised by the European Union.  That is the consequence of a customs union.  In a customs union a country does not negotiate tariffs and trade agreements individually; it is the European Union that does that based on the treaties.  One cannot say one wants to be in the customs union but will manage trade oneself.  That is not the European Union.  I think everyone will accept, certainly now that it has already been proposed by some in Britain, that the UK should stay for a transitional period in the customs union, but it cannot pick and choose and say it wants to be in this but not that.  One cannot say, "I want to be in the customs union and the Single Market but I do not want to pay, I do not want the oversight of the European Court of Justice, I do not want migrants coming from eastern Europe and I do not want it to be the European Union that negotiates trade deals in the future."  That is not possible.  Membership comes with positive things but also with obligations.  One cannot create a system in which not being a member of the European Union is more favourable than being a member.  One would then destroy the European project.  I am very open to and positive about what Deputy Donnelly said in his question but, as I said, it is not a question of taking the benefits and putting the burden on the remaining 27 member states.  That will not happen and will not be allowed to happen.  That is not objective, not serious and certainly not the kind of European Union we all want.</p></speech>

He may recall that he met the European affairs committee in Brussels last February.  At that time there was much uncertainty about the place, but I think we appreciated then and we appreciate now the sympathy and understanding he has shown for Ireland's position.  As he knows, Ireland has major concerns regarding the Good Friday Agreement, the common travel area and the possible implementation of a hard border.</p> <p>  Because I only have one minute, I will go straight to my questions.  Regarding the Brexit negotiations, does Mr. Verhofstadt think it will be very important for the British Prime Minister to give some significant indication tomorrow of the UK's position on the EU budget contribution into the future?  I think Mr. Verhofstadt said solutions to the Irish question are solely a matter for the UK.  Does he not think the Commission and the Parliament could also have some draft proposals on solving our particular problem?  Regarding the future of Europe, the Commission has put forward five scenarios.  I think the President of the Commission put forward a sixth scenario in all but name during the week.  Ireland has concerns about proposals for corporate tax harmonisation and a deepening common defence policy.  We are losing a friend as we lose the UK from the European Union.  Can Mr. Verhofstadt assure us, now that the Franco-German axis is fully restored, that the interests of small nation states will not be forgotten about as we plan the future of Europe?</p></speech>

Things have changed quite dramatically in the meantime.  C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to Mr. Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator.  I was impressed by his visit to Belfast and the Border areas, including Monaghan, to see the invisible Border between the North and South.  He described it very well.</p> <p>  Post-Brexit, we will need more support from the European Parliament and the European Commission to strengthen our regional airports and ports.  I will refer in particular to Ireland West Airport Knock, which needs a derogation and additional Government support, which are matters for the Commission.  I would like Mr. Verhofstadt to bring that point back to the Commission.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt's points about a customs union, or a single market, between North and South were good.  A single market is essential.</p> <p>  I appeal for the power-sharing Executive to be re-established in Northern Ireland.  Why would someone allow Brexit MEPs to be Ministers in Northern Ireland?  It is unthinkable.</p></speech>

If history has taught people in Ireland anything over the centuries, it is that Ireland disproportionately suffers from belligerent British foreign policy.  I welcomed Mr. Verhofstadt's statement that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit.  Those were fine and well-meaning words, but we need practical measures to ensure that it does not happen.</p> <p>  There has been much discussion of the Border and the Good Friday Agreement, and rightly so, but I do not want Europe, Mr. Verhofstadt, his team or the European Parliament to lose sight of the fact that there is &euro;60 billion worth of trade between Ireland and Britain every year, underpinning hundreds of thousands of jobs.  The Border is crucial, as are business and people's livelihoods.  What are the practical measures?  Our party has proposed a European reform fund to support exposed areas and sectors at a European level.  Our agrifood industry has lost nearly &euro;800 million from the value of its exports, but it is just one of many.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt understands the situation and I welcome his visit today as well as his visit to the Border, but let us not lose sight of the hundreds of thousands of jobs in Ireland underpinned by, and dependent on, the &euro;60 billion in trade with our nearest neighbour.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tUasal Verhofstadt.  He and I met yesterday in my home city of Belfast.  In this Oireachtas, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those of us in the North who are Irish do not derive our Irishness from the Good Friday Agreement.  It, of course, runs much deeper than that.  When the agreement was lodged with the EU and the UN, however, it affirmed our legal rights in the eyes of the world as Irish and, therefore, EU citizens.  It says that on the front of our passports to remind us.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt has referenced comprehensively something that we discussed yesterday, namely, the importance of the psychology of citizenship and our place within the world.  While our Irish citizenship in the North should never be partial, conditional or second class, nor should our EU citizenship.  Mr. Verhofstadt was clear in his remarks regarding a future for EU citizens living in the North, but perhaps he might expand on what that will mean for the EU citizen who is a farmer in Fermanagh, a worker in Strabane or an entrepreneur in Newry.  If such people are to access their rights and entitlements as full EU citizens, what will that look like?</p></speech>

Those of us on the island of Ireland see that, once again, the British have shot themselves in our foot.  We feel bad about that.</p> <p>  I am Vice Chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Most of the parliamentarians from Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales and other jurisdictions are concerned about this situation and would like to see a change.  Mr. Verhofstadt answered Deputy Donnelly regarding the lengthy transition period.  I view the statement made by Mr. Jeremy Corbyn as indicating a change in the political climate in the UK, which could lead to a second referendum.  We would welcome that, but will Mr. Verhofstadt share his opinion on the matter?</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's views on safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement.  The EU has been a significant stakeholder in the agreement, if not the most significant, and has underpinned it.</p> <p>  Turning to a concern for the island of Ireland, would it be possible to have a final deal without Ireland's agreement?</p></speech>

I am not referring to citizens' rights, which have been discussed at length.  Human rights equivalence is a pillar of the agreement.  I would appreciate Mr. Verhofstadt's thoughts on how it can be enforced as a key aspect in the negotiations and kept from being lost.</p> <p>  In terms of peace building and the Good Friday Agreement, it is important for Europe to understand Ireland's role and global contribution as a neutral nation.</p> <p>  My specific question is on the second stage of negotiations.  Mr. Verhofstadt has been clear, in that the European Parliament will have a say over whether we enter those negotiations.  A new trade negotiating mandate will need to be given by the Council to the Commission.  In his role in the European Parliament, will Mr. Verhofstadt seek for environmental, equality and employment standards to be central in any negotiating mandate so as to ensure that there is no race to the bottom, which would damage Ireland deeply?  Given that Mr. Verhofstadt's country of Belgium has referred investor courts to the European Court of Justice to test their compatibility with European law, can we expect that any trade negotiating mandate given to the Commission by the Council and supported by the Council will not include such mechanisms?</p></speech>

Presumably, that includes the European Parliament's British Members as well.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Verhofstadt agree that the problem with the state of the negotiations arises from the divisions within the British Cabinet?  Until Mr. Johnson, who Mr. Verhofstadt mentioned, is removed, banished or whatever and the British Cabinet reaches a single position, progress will be slow.  Perhaps a little time has to be allowed for that.  Does Mr. Verhofstadt agree that, as negotiations proceed, the British Cabinet will have to become more realistic?  If, like all of us, it wants to ensure the continuation of the invisible Border, it will have to be.</p></speech>

Much of what has been said today concerns what scenario we are to face, in that, it is in the future and the negotiation must conclude - if it is to conclude - successfully.  However, the reality for many people in this State is that the decision of the British people to leave the EU has been having a dramatic economic impact for some considerable time already.</p> <p>  In solidarity with hard-pressed sectors of our economy, will the EU respond with assistance and supports for struggling Irish enterprises?  As has been mentioned, these enterprises are found especially in the agrifood industry.  Mr. Verhofstadt may have met some of them yesterday.  Coming from County Monaghan, where Mr. Verhofstadt was yesterday, and representing Cavan and Monaghan as I do in this Chamber, I am conscious of the reality of daily life for many people.  There is a sizable fear that, whatever is decided, sectors will be significantly reduced and jobs lost without solid economic supports.</p></speech>

I noted with interest his comment that the EU would never allow Ireland to suffer from the UK's decision to leave Europe.</p><p>We greatly welcome that.  We are presuming Mr. Verhofstadt speaks on behalf of the EU negotiating team and that is what we are pinning our hopes on.  However, he stated that the solution in respect of Brexit has to come from the UK.  Unfortunately, those two positions are not compatible and they have not been compatible for the past 15 months.  There is nothing the UK Government has done that gives any bit of solace to us that the solution will come from the UK.  Along with all of my colleagues, I believe that if Mr. Verhofstadt can take one message from his visit here today, it is that we are depending on the EU to ensure that Ireland, as the country most exposed to this decision, does not suffer.  If we are depending on the UK to come up with a solution, as Mr. Verhofstadt said, that simply will not happen.  We have to proceed on the basis that it is the EU's responsibility to protect us, and that is what we need it to do.</p></speech>

That gives the possibility not only to talk about trade but also to talk about the other issues we have to tackle in the future and the other parts of that relationship.  It can be on culture, on education or on research, and it can be on internal and external security matters.  I think it is in the interests of everybody, including the Union, that we do that.  Therefore, it will not only be about trade and economics; it will be a broader decision, in that sense.  I underline what has been said, namely, that the British side has proposed a number of ideas.</p> <p>  Second, many speakers said that it is all very well what I am saying but asked how, in practice and on practical matters, it will work.  I can tell them that, yesterday, I spoke with many representatives of sectors, especially about the practical consequences of Brexit and how to deal with these.  I did not only talk about borders and avoiding a hard border.  We spoke a lot about the general position of the Irish economy and of the Republic of Ireland, and the threats because of Brexit, because it is a main trading partner of Britain.  We spoke of how to secure this trading position and also the trading position of Ireland towards the rest of the European Union because the normal streams of goods towards the European continent are under threat if we have no good solutions in these Brexit negotiations.  I spoke about very concrete solutions for that with the different representatives of the sectors in order to understand their fears, their problems and how they see they could be solved in the future.  I have taken on board a number of very practical suggestions on how that could be done within an agreement with the UK while defending the economic and trade position of Ireland after the withdrawal.</p> <p>  I have noted also the suggestion that has been made by some speakers to put the Good Friday Agreement as an annex of the withdrawal agreement.  It is also a suggestion that has been made in the European Parliament and we are discussing that at the moment in the Brexit steering group.</p> <p>  On the divisions and the development of opinions in Britain, it is true that these are not for the moment helping the negotiations move forward.  However, let us hope that these divisions of opinion will be overcome in the coming days and weeks in order that this fourth negotiation round can be a step forward towards the future.</p> <p>  Another element, having noted the negative impact of Brexit, is whether the Union will take its responsibility.  Naturally, the Union will take its responsibility.  We have the instruments for that and the funds for that, and it will certainly be done.  However, let us first negotiate a good withdrawal agreement and a good association agreement on future relationships to minimise the impact, and then see what will be the nature of that impact.</p> <p>  On a last point, when I said in my introduction that it is for the UK to take responsibility and to come forward, this is not for lack of ideas because I have given ideas in my introduction and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has made a proposal here about an economic zone.  I have spoken about what some have said to me, which is that the best way to solve it is to extend the Single Market and the customs union to Northern Ireland.  All this is on the table.  However, the reason I am saying this is that it is true that the decision to go out of the European Union has not been taken by Ireland, by the Irish Government or by the European Union.  It is a consequence of a British decision so there is also, in that sense, a responsibility on their side to come forward with proposals that can work - not proposals which create a hard border, but proposals which avoid that.  That is the reason I am recalling that all the time.  There is, on their side, responsibility to accept a solution that is workable and, at the same time, that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.</p> <p>  We have to see it a little bit as an element of the negotiation.  It is not that they have taken a decision to go out and, so, we have all the problems on our back and have to find solutions for all the problems.  No.  There is a responsibility also on their side.  For example, financially, one cannot go out of the European Union and say that the whole financial burden is for the remaining 27.  Commitments made by 28 member states cannot be later on paid by the remaining 27.  In one or another way, it is like a divorce.  I have to tell the House I have no practical experience of divorces personally but I know that, in a divorce, you cannot go out and leave your partner alone in the house and say, "Now, all the financial things are for you.  Bye-bye."  That is not the way it works.  Commitments have been made and if commitments have been made, then it is also normal that payments will be required based on these commitments.</p></speech>

Today's meeting has provided another opportunity to highlight Ireland's priorities in the Brexit negotiations and the need for flexible and imaginative solutions in regard to the special position of Ireland.  The guiding principles published on 7 September by the EU in regard to the talks on Ireland and Northern Ireland are positive and encouraging.  It is clear that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area, are fully recognised.  This meeting also provided an opportunity to underline the importance for Ireland of its continued membership of the EU and its commitment to Europe.  Given his role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament, we look forward to continued engagement with Mr. Verhofstadt as the negotiations continue.  We wish him and the European Parliament steering group well in the work ahead.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p></speech>

On this special occasion, I also extend a heartfelt welcome to our MLAs, MEPs and MPs who join us for this special meeting of three Oireachtas committees, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The purpose of the meeting is to engage in an exchange of views with Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's co-ordinator on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt, I welcome you to the Houses of the Oireachtas and invite you to take your seat in the Chamber.  You honour us with your visit to our Parliament today.  We are pleased to welcome you for this important discussion. </p> <p>  By way of background, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, sitting together in committee on 11 May last, met Mr. Michel Barnier, chief negotiator of the task force for the preparation and conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom.  The meeting provided an opportunity for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to outline directly to Mr. Barnier their concerns for Ireland in relation to the negotiation process and its outcome.  Ireland's priorities include Northern Ireland, the Border and the Good Friday Agreement; the economic impact of Brexit, which has already manifested itself in the agrifood sector; the Single Market; and free movement, in particular of people in the common travel area.  As a result, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and European Union are being followed very closely in Ireland.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as the European Parliament's co-ordinator, has a key role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament. </p> <p>  The unique position of and special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland were referenced in the European Parliament's resolution of 5 April on the exit negotiations.  This early recognition of the challenges facing Ireland is welcome and reassuring but we need to maintain this focus.  While the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU has clear implications for Ireland, it also draws our attention again to the debate about the future of Europe and any changes that may emerge from the process now under way.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as you will hear, this is an issue of crucial importance to all of us, as parliamentarians representing our citizens who share a deep concern about where this bumpy road will lead us, as citizens of Ireland and Europe.  We are very interested in hearing your views on the process, the potential outcomes of the negotiations and the implications for the European Union.  I have great pleasure in asking you to address this unique meeting of the joint committees.</p></speech>

It is an honour for me to be here today and address you in this historic D&aacute;il Chamber.  I thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to address you here today because I am aware that it is not every day that a Member of the European Parliament responsible for such an important matter can address a meeting of joint committees of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I first want to deliver a message of solidarity with Ireland, its citizens and people.  We will never allow Ireland to suffer as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union.  That is a commitment given by the European Parliament and European Union as a whole.  I will come back to this later in my contribution. </p> <p>  Next year, it will be exactly 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Yesterday was the first time I visited Belfast.  It was a strange experience because for the past 20 years, we in the rest of Europe have not heard anything about Belfast on our television screens.  It is good to remember that because it is 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is not a practical arrangement on passports, borders, customs or tariffs - it is not about these matters - but an agreement about peace and the reconciliation of divided communities.  It is about rebuilding confidence and trust.</p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is also a successful innovation of citizenship itself.  Personally, I find the following sentence to be the most important sentence in the Agreement.  It is "the birthright of all the people in Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may choose".  In my opinion, these four simple words, "as they may choose", go against the outdated version of some states that do not like ambiguity, contingency or multiplicity.  They give to the people and individual citizens, rather than states, the power to choose their own destiny.  They are four simple words which have brought peace and stability to Northern Ireland based on openness and a common understanding that identities are multi-layered and complex and should bring people together rather than divide them.  In my opinion, these four simple words not only define Northern Ireland but Ireland as a whole. </p> <p>  I know that some British politicians, not to name Boris Johnson, criticise their country men and women for wanting to keep their European identity.  He even accused them of split allegiance.  This is a binary, old-fashioned and reductionist understanding of identity.  We need to be smarter and more open and inventive than that.  It is not one's origin or the fact that, by accident, one was born in this or that village, city or country that makes one a good citizen.  It is the fact that one embraces the values of one's community and cherishes the fundamental rights and freedoms of the society in which one lives.</p><p>These are values, rights and freedoms that are common in our European Union in all nations and in every one of our member states so I think it is nonsense to talk about a split allegiance.  It is perfectly possible, I think, but I have not practised it, to feel English, British and European at the same time and it is perfectly normal to be a Dubliner, Irish and European at the same time without being schizophrenic.  There is no question of split allegiance.  It is this vision that needs to be defended by our European Union just as the Union needs to defend, I think, and this is my second point, that there is no return to the past to a time of hard borders on our Continent, and certainly not to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  Members will know that is a point we made very clear in the European Parliament's resolutions we adopted on 5 April 2017.  </p><p> I am mistaken when I state that the Irish Border is in no way a natural one.  It is not a river or a mountain ridge.  It meanders for 310 miles through meadows, forests and farmlands.  It cannot be securely poised and is, therefore, an illogical divide.  The Border should at least remain invisible just as it is today.  It is a little bit visible because one can see a marking in yellow when one enters the Irish Republic.  The colour of the marking changes from white to yellow.  That is the big lesson that I learned yesterday. </p><p> I spent yesterday afternoon visiting the Border in County Monaghan where I met people who live and work there.  At one point, I stood astride the Border, with one foot in Northern Ireland and my other foot in the Republic.  I found it completely impossible to see where one jurisdiction ended and the other started.  Certainly, the cows could not see it.  The cows from the North ate grass in the South, they were milked in the North by a farmer from the South and their milk was bottled in the South.  I am a Belgian so surrealism comes naturally to me.  To re-instate a border would be more than surreal, it would be totally absurd, even for me.</p><p> There are borders and then there are borders.  Borders can be lines on maps, physical barriers or, worst of all, can run through people's hearts and minds.  These are the worst kind of borders because they breed division, discrimination and hostility.  I remind everyone, if I may, that the history of Europe is in many ways a history of borders.  Over the centuries our Continent has seen borders shift, disappear and re-appear.  As a liberal, my natural inclination is to be against borders.  It seems to me that borders are best when they are just lines on maps.  In many ways, the European Union is all about reducing borders to lines on maps and this is certainly the case, I think, for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  The Border between both jurisdictions created chaos, hate and violence.  To reduce it to a line on a map was a crucial achievement 20 years ago in which the European Union, the UK and Ireland played a decisive role.  I saw the results for myself yesterday.  Whether one is speaking about the economy, commerce, agriculture, health or other social services, the Border is featuring less and less as a factor in the economic and social life of the region, and that is precisely its greatest achievement.  It is a border that does not divide people but enables them to live together in peace.  It is a border that is not divisive, that does not run through people's hearts but instead does the opposite and creates a common purpose.  </p><p> Dear colleagues - if I may use those words as a parliamentarian - you know better than I that Ireland underwent a dramatic transformation over the past three decades economically and but also socially.  The Republic was a country defined by Catholicism and nationalism.  In 1973, the birth year of the current Prime Minister, only 7% of Irish were born abroad and today this number is 17%, which makes Ireland very diverse when compared with European standards.  The Irish economy has successfully integrated migrants from all over the world, from Poland to Nigeria.  Ireland is also the home of international IT giants.  All of this is an example, I think, of constructive and fair globalisation.  To summarise it, Ireland is no longer a nation of immigration but a country of destination.</p><p> Ireland has gained a lot of self-confidence over the past decades, and rightly so.  We, as a European Union, also share that.  Let us never forget that Europe is far more than co-operation between the two old enemies of France and Germany.  Today, Europe goes beyond a Franco-German relationship.  We need all hands on deck.  All 27 member states are needed to make Europe work because we belong to the same European civilisation.  Europe would not be half of what it is today without dynamic countries like Ireland, countries that have dealt with complex border and identity issues, and countries that were able to re-invent themselves with a respect for tradition, so Ireland is crucial to the Union.</p><p> The Irish Border and all things related are a priority in the negotiations.  In the new resolution that the European Parliament will adopt in early October we will state that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit and that Ireland or any other member state will not be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.  The interests of Ireland are part and parcel of the interests of the EU 27.  The Irish position is the European position and the European position is the Irish position. </p><p> In this joint position, let me also make one last thing very clear.  The re-emergence of the Border question between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic has not been caused by the Irish Republic or the rest of the European Union.  The issue is the inevitable consequence of the choice by Britain to leave the European Union so the resolution of this issue is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom.  It is for them to come up with a workable solution, one which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, preserves the common travel area, avoids a hardening of the Border and last, but not least, does not compromise Irish membership and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  In my opinion, this can only be a unique solution.  Most of the people I met yesterday, on both sides of the Border, believe that this unique solution requires that one way or another Northern Ireland should remain part of the customs union and the Single Market.  I know the UK Government, in its paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland, has rejected this idea.  That is fair enough, but the UK must come forward with another proposal that avoids any disruption.  Simply saying that the problem will be solved by using new technology is, in my opinion, not convincing.</p><p> I am pleased to say that the Irish MEPs, some of whom are here today and seated in the corner, are working very hard to defend all of this, a position I can assure the members that is shared right across the whole European Parliament.  We know the Irish people have made the choice to be a core member state of the EU and, because of this, we will never let them down.  The EU also needs their help to reform Europe because that is something we also urgently need to do.  I think that Brexit is an ideal moment to reflect on the future of the Union we belong to.  There are enough challenges ahead, challenges that transcend national borders such as climate change, international terrorism and remaining economic difficulties. These are all issues that individual countries cannot tackle on their own.  Currently, they have also recognised that Europe is too weak to take on these challenges.  In order for us to beat, for example, international terrorism, we need European capabilities.  To overcome the economic crisis, we need a banking union to clean up our banks and a fiscal union to protect our single currency, the euro.</p><p>To fight the protectionism of President Trump and Brexit, we must have a Europe that is vocal and strong on the world stage.<br/><br/>To conclude, I believe that Brexit has opened the eyes of many people.  Do not misunderstand me - people are still very critical of the European Union, and for good reason.  However, nobody wants to leave and destroy Europe.  On the contrary, it is fair to say there is a renewed belief in Europe, not in this Europe but in a different, reformed Europe.  In any case, people have started voting pro-European again.  They did it in Austria, the Netherlands, and France and soon, hopefully, they will do so in Germany.  However, these are not votes for a <i>status quo</i>.  This is a way of people saying, &quot;Look, we are giving you one last chance to make Europe work and to make it better and fit for the future&quot;, or, in the words of Seamus Heaney, we &quot;Believe that further shore/Is reachable from here&quot;.</p></speech>

You never fail to interest your audience.  You gave an interesting, profound and stimulating contribution.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017092100002#C00300"><p>It is a pleasure to see Mr. Verhofstadt again and to welcome him to Dublin and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The last time we met he welcomed a delegation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to the European Parliament, so I am delighted to be able to join the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in returning the hospitality to him today.</p><p>To be blunt, this is a horrible problem.  It is a mess, and there is nothing nice about it.  People do not realise how detrimental an effect this will have on their lives and those of their children.  The UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the implications for Ireland and the implications for the European Union are all profound.  Quite frankly, I was saddened by the decision.  However, it was clear and we must respect it.  We all must work on the challenges the decision presents.  Members of this House have been doing that across a number of committees and the European Parliament has also been doing it.  We see the hard, thoughtful and diligent work the European Parliament's committees have been doing in considering Brexit and the Irish MEPs have been playing a strong role in that.  I acknowledge their work and thank them for it.</p><p>My committee has met a number of stakeholders and Government Ministers and is following the negotiations carefully through the documentation that is published.  I have been heartened by the supportive comments and the positions taken by the European Parliament, many governments and the European Commission.  However, the chips are down now.  Reality is starting to bite.  There are substantial and significant choices to be made by the negotiators and those they represent.  Ultimately, Mr. Barnier and his team, Mr. Verhofstadt and the other Members of the European Parliament represent the citizens of Europe, including the citizens of Ireland, who will feel the impact in their daily lives.  It is up to all of us to work together on practical solutions to minimise the impact as much as possible on the daily lives of citizens, on the quality of what they eat, the amount they must pay for it, how secure their savings and pensions are, whether they can go to shops or to mass up or down the road without going through border checks, how easily they can study abroad, what prices farmers get for their beef, lamb and milk, what price the consumer must pay for it and whether they can make friends with whoever they wish and set up a home together wherever they wish, be it in London, Brussels, Dublin or Belfast.  All of these matters could be impacted upon by Brexit.  All of them could be changed into something that resembles the parts of the past that we thought we had left far behind us.</p><p>We must work together and remain involved in and practical about the negotiations.  We are not alone in this.  There are two sides to a negotiation.  I had hoped to see more practical and pragmatic suggestions from the British side by now, but perhaps they will come forward.  They might even come forward in the Prime Minister's speech.  I certainly hope so.</p><p>On the European side, the transparent way in which negotiation documents have been shared with citizens is good and must continue.  National parliaments must continue to be involved in debates and discussions.  I would be interested in any recommendations or ideas Mr. Verhofstadt has to strengthen the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments in considering Brexit.  For example, is there any intention to hold interparliamentary meetings involving national parliaments and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group?  There would be huge value and benefit in that.  Mr. Verhofstadt travelled to the Border yesterday and I am delighted that he enjoyed meeting the cows there.  I hope this visit will have given him a valuable insight into why we value the current Border arrangements so much and why they should be preserved.</p><p>The biggest challenge will be goods.  There was an interesting letter in yesterday's edition of the <i>Financial Times</i>from a Belgian customs official.  It suggested that border goods should be applied for at the Irish Sea and that the customs union rules could be applied by the European Union customs officials operating in ports in Northern Ireland.  That was imaginative.  Are such suggestions helpful?  Of course, it would be best if the UK would decide to stay in the customs union, but that decision is out of our hands.  It is one for the United Kingdom.</p><p>The economic impact on Ireland is significant.  Each time an Oireachtas committee examines a new issue, a new box of challenges is opened - how aeroplanes will land, how goods will get to the market from Irish ports through Wales and England to eventually reach Belgium and so forth.  There are endless challenges.  I remain concerned about Brexit for Irish citizens but, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I am also concerned about the impact on the rest of the European Union.  Even if Brexit were not on the horizon, it would be important to consider the future of Europe and where we should be going.  My committee has started a public consultation process in Ireland and a series of engagements with stakeholders to examine what type of Europe we want in the future.</p></speech>

That really struck me.  We need a Europe with ambitions that are tempered by the fire of reality in all member states.  It is a principle that most people on the street will not explain, but I instinctively support it.  We must recognise that.  Mr. Verhofstadt has a strong vision for the future of Europe, so I would appreciate knowing more on how he sees us bridging the gap between the ideals and the need to deliver for our citizens.

I am sure we will find his address and interaction with us today very useful and beneficial.  As he will have seen and heard during his visits to Belfast, Monaghan and Dublin, Brexit impacts on every policy area across this island and will have a knock-on effect on the lives of citizens across the European Union and beyond.</p><p>Ireland, as Mr. Verhofstadt knows, stands to be significantly and disproportionately affected.  I speak for the members of our committee when I tell him that we, as public representatives, are greatly concerned at the negative domestic impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I know from listening to what he has said in recent months that he is very aware of and interested in our concerns, a fact demonstrated by his visit, North and South, yesterday and today.</p><p> As our committee looks outward in its work, I will focus my remarks on how Brexit impacts on the external environment, however as a Deputy for two Border counties, one of which Mr. Verhofstadt visited yesterday, it would be remiss of me not to remind him of the great damage the resurrection of a border would have on the communities I represent here in the national Parliament.  I welcome his comments made yesterday and hope he can expand on them later.</p><p> Much of the progress made in the improved Irish-British relations over the past 25 years was due in no small part to our common EU membership.  I recall, from my own time as a Minister being told that Irish and British officials were meeting approximately 26 times per day in Brussels.  The loss of this high level of ongoing and important interactions with our nearest neighbour and close ally is deeply regrettable.  Its loss will be keenly felt.  We will be doing our utmost to compensate as best we can for that loss of engagement.</p><p> As Mr. Verhofstadt knows, Ireland is militarily neutral but that does mean that we in Ireland stand aside when it comes to promoting peace and development through the UN, the European Union and our own bilateral actions - far from it.  We have a long, proud and strong record in peace support and humanitarian operations via our Defence Forces.  At present, 600 members of the Defence Forces are serving on UN-mandated missions across the globe.  Given our policy remit for both foreign affairs and defence, our committee knows and recognises the global challenges and security threats we face, both within the EU and in the EU's neighbourhood.  For those reasons we recognise a good and strong relationship with the Britain on foreign policy, security and defence is essential and is in all our interests.  For those reasons, we welcome last week's publication by the British Government of a paper on foreign policy, defence and development, and we are pleased to see the British Government outline its willingness and desire to continue to have a close partnership with the EU on foreign, defence, security and development issues.  We note that Britain proposes the exchange of foreign and security policy experts, military personnel and the exchange of classified information to support external actions.  Ongoing co-operation is much needed and is common sense in these very fraught times for Europe and neighbouring areas as well.</p><p> I wish to refer specifically to development co-operation and the impact Brexit may have on the world's poorest people whose voices are often unheard in these debates.  While Brexit may be happening far from the poorest countries in the world, they also stand to be adversely affected.  It is unknown what will become of the significant aid contributions Britain makes both to the European Development Fund - at present it contributes 15% of the fund, amounting to &euro;4.48 billion, and 13% of the total of the aid portion of the EU's general budget for 2016, or &euro;1.23 billion.  Loss of that substantial British funding would have huge ramifications for the many programmes in the poorest regions of the world which depend so heavily on it.  The committee hopes a solution will be found that will allow and encourage Britain to continue to contribute.  I believe there are precedents for that with Switzerland and Norway participating in EU-managed trust funds.</p><p> Brexit will result in the loss of an important, influential and respected voice on the shaping of EU development policy from around the EU table.  Our committee will encourage the Government to step up and play its part in filling those gaps as much as possible.  There is also the significant concern that developing countries could lose their duty free, quota free access to British markets, as is currently provided for under EU agreements.</p><p> More generally, we are concerned about the Paris Accord and climate action.  All those issues must be taken into account in the complex negotiations that lie ahead.  I have no doubt the European Parliament will ensure those concerns are brought to the fore in his engagements with the Council and the Commission.  As Mr. Verhofstadt said, our island has been transformed since 1998.  We cannot countenance any agreement that would set us back or hinder the necessary progress for the further development of all of this island.  To echo Mr. Verhofstadt, it would be absolutely absurd to put obstacles in the way of the 30,000 people who cross the Border on a daily basis going about their business.</p></speech>

Today is world International Day of Peace, as designated by the United Nations and that should not be lost on our defining moment in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent establishment of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in 2007 to monitor and oversee the ongoing implementation of that historic peace agreement.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt to Leinster House.  The attendance of the many dignitaries, ambassadors, officials, MPs, MEPs and MLAs, sends out a clear signal of the need for solutions to Brexit and peace and if those solutions can be found on this island our many problems in the EU may also be resolved.  I commend the membership of the committee, its officials and witnesses on their ongoing work on Brexit and exploring solutions while extremely cognisant of building on our fragile peace and progressing the many legacy issues.</p> <p>  For many of us there can be various defining moments in our history but for me the main aim of the Treaty of Rome, the forerunner to the EEC or EU, was to ensure that peace not war would unite us in prosperity.  I am 59 years of age and was born ten years before the further outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 that broke many families and fractured communities and their prosperity in Northern Ireland, the Border region and beyond.  I also remember life pre-EEC and post-EEC membership and the transformation that this great island achieved as a result of EU investment in trade and infrastructure, much of which is ongoing.  For all of us in this Chamber and beyond the strides that this country has made have been significantly enhanced with peace, which has encouraged communities North and South to face each other with a common purpose, respect and recognition that there is strength in unity and friendship is what is important.</p> <p>  Politicians will not be forgiven by this generation and future ones if they fail to progress and enhance this fragile peace.  Let there be no mistake, Brexit has the potential to derail so many of the gains of this island and we must not allow that to happen.  Some key findings of the report from our committee have found that the all-Ireland economy must not be affected or allowed to regress.  A tailored solution taking into account its very unique circumstances is required.  We are concerned about the commitment to continue both the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which provided &euro;3.5 billion in the past 20 years.  It is important that such a commitment would immediately be set out clearly so that people can plan and communities can continue to prosper from the PEACE moneys.</p> <p>  The committee calls on the Government and the EU to undertake a detailed study on the potential implications of Brexit on reconciliation.  Allied to that is the psychological impact identified by the committee that Brexit will further affect many families in the North and along the Border corridor.  Whether one has been a victim, a combatant or an innocent bystander the emotional scars of murder, death and explosions remain deep rooted and continue to need healing.</p> <p>  Brexit presents many challenges but there are also opportunities.  The committee believes the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can step up and take on additional responsibilities, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council, whose remit needs to be reviewed and enhanced.  Like Mr. Verhofstadt, the committee has visited many groups in Northern Ireland who feel they have no voice in the current political stalemate and it is the committee's responsibility to bring those anxieties to his attention.</p><p>These need to be represented in the all-Ireland debate.  Indeed, the absence of unionism and a unionist voice at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is regrettable.</p><p> Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, widely recognised as the cornerstone of peace.  That anniversary takes place at a time of uncertainty in North-South and British-Irish relations.  Perhaps it is an opportune time for the EU and the European Parliament to reinvigorate its investment in making our peace process a world model and exemplar that will show war-torn regions around the world how a lasting peace can be achieved.  I should add that many representatives of such regions have visited us to look at what we are doing.  Politics is about the art of the possible and we owe it to our children and our children&rsquo;s children to live in peace, prosperity and harmony on this island.</p><p> Both Mr. Verhofstadt and Mr. Barnier continue to use the term "unique solution" in their deliberations.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt suggest what his thoughts are on that solution and what he feels it could look like?</p><p> With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I have been asked by my colleagues from the British Parliament on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee, who are here with us today, to ask Mr. Verhofstadt if he will produce a report on his fact-finding visit after he returns to Brussels.  Will he share his experience of the last 48 hours with Mr. Barnier?  How concerned does he believe the European Parliament is about the impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement?</p></speech>

I welcome our Members of the European Parliament and all the invited guests.  I thank our committee chairs and committee members for organising what has already been described as a unique but very important meeting and gathering.</p> <p>  It is extremely important to thank Mr. Verhofstadt for his willingness to come to Ireland but also, and most importantly, for his willingness to deepen his understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and, of course, the Border issues.  It is very clear from his statement that he has a very real understanding of how fragile the peace process is.  I thank him for his work to date as the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit.  As the European Parliament plays such an important role in the Brexit negotiations, it is important to thank him for his supportive statements to date on the peace process and on the Border and for his words of solidarity with the Irish people today.</p> <p>  While Brexit may not be the first priority for all member states, it is, of course, a very real and imminent concern for many Irish citizens, for Irish businesses large and small, and for our industries, in particular the agrifood sector which is already feeling the effect of Brexit.  I know that Members here, throughout this debate, will be very keen to hear Mr. Verhofstadt's views and an update on how negotiations are progressing, but also to hear his further views on the future of Europe.  The future of Europe is not Brexit.  It is a Europe without the UK and we need to ensure it is a Union that protects, empowers and defends its citizens.  It is even more important that this conversation is one that all citizens should be involved in.</p> <p>  I look forward to a very positive engagement with Members and our three committees as, I am sure, does Mr. Verfhofstadt.  I thank him again for his support and for his recognition of our unique situation.</p></speech>

We will now move to a session of questions and answers.  In accordance with the yesterday's recommendation of the Business Committee I will take blocks of three questions, each lasting approximately two minutes, starting with the party leaders.  I will start with Deputy Martin.  We will take three questions then return to Mr. Verhofstadt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.668" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017092100002#E00500"><p>I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for his very illuminating address.  I also thank him for his strong support for Ireland, for the manner in which he has facilitated the ALDE group in supporting the Irish cause in respect of Brexit, and for his determination that Ireland would not suffer.  In the limited time that is available I will put two key points to Mr. Verhofstadt, if I may.  He rightly drew attention to the citizenship dimension of the Good Friday Agreement and the idea of multiple identities - of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.  It is extremely important that in the ultimate resolution of this, the idea of Irish citizenship as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is protected in the context of the resolution between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In a post-Brexit scenario, Northern Ireland will have the largest concentration of European Union citizens outside of the union's borders.  It is essential that mechanisms are found which will ensure those citizens are in a position to continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of European citizenship.</p> <p>  Second, notwithstanding the British position at the moment in terms of the customs union, which is ultimately the key issue in terms of the Border question, we have been putting forward the idea that a special economic zone needs to be considered.  There are many examples of economic zones across the world.  Economic zones in themselves do not challenge or undermine the unique constitutional framework of east-west, North-South and the Northern Ireland settlement.  In other words, it is possible within the existing constitutional framework to devise an economic zone for the North and the Border counties which would maintain freedom of trade - goods, services and people - North and South.  We need to move on from the language of a "frictionless border" or "no border" and start working on concrete ideas and solutions that could ultimately bring a resolution to the issue.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid bu&iacute;och de faoi choinne a chuairt.  I offer Mr. Verhofstadt a hundred thousand welcomes and thank him for his visit to our island.  I welcome the content of his speech very much.  In his remarks today, Mr. Verhofstadt acknowledged that people are very critical of the European Union.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's position.  We want to see a more democratic, demilitarised, peaceful European Union which embraces economic and social justice, international solidarity and an end to poverty.  Notwithstanding that, we campaigned in the North for a Remain vote, because it is our view that to have one part of the island outside the European Union and another part inside is just folly.  It is a really significant fact which has been ignored by some, but people in the North supported that position.  They voted to remain within the EU and we believe that vote should be upheld and actively defended.  The various policy positions which the British Government has unveiled, including leaving the customs union, will all cost jobs, undermine the economy and subvert sectors in both parts of the island.</p> <p>  I particularly want to welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's remarks on the Good Friday Agreement.  I know that he values the peace process and I understand he met some of our colleagues: Martina Anderson MEP, our group leader in the European Parliament, our national spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy David Cullinane, and our Members of the European Parliament.  His description of the Border and of partition is very much appreciated, as are his warnings of the dire consequences if it is reinforced.</p> <p>  To move on to my questions, will Mr. Verhofstadt give us an assessment of the possibility of agreement, given that there has only been limited information available thus far and that there does not appear to have been any real progress from the British side?  I welcome his suggestion that the North remain within the customs union and the Single Market.  That is effectively the designated status for the North which we have campaigned for and which the D&aacute;il, the majority of MLAs and the European Parliament support.  The threat and the danger to the Good Friday Agreement could be averted if the agreement was incorporated in full as a protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  I commend that position to Mr. Verhofstadt and ask him to give his support to that proposition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.670" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017092100002#E00700"><p>I welcome the visit of Mr. Verhofstadt.  His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments in relation to enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed.</p><p>I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland.  He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter.<br/><br/>My first question is very simple.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principle of parity of esteem and human rights protection is upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU?  If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights?<br/><br/>My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in <i>The Observer</i>on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position in relation to citizens' rights.  He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement.  This is another simple question.  How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years?  I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Guy Verhofstadt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017092100002#F00300"><p>It is a question of how many minutes I will be given to respond to all the remarks that have been made.  I thank the honourable Members and the Chairs of the committees.  Maybe I can pick three elements from the various interventions that have been made.  Reference was made to the state of the negotiations and I was asked whether we will use our veto.  One needs to have something to veto before one can use one's veto.  For the moment, there is nothing to veto because - let us be honest - no real progress has been made in the negotiations.  We have had three rounds of negotiations.  The first round involved the formal start of negotiations, the second round involved the presentation and the third round involved the clarification.  I think it is time for the negotiation in the fourth and fifth rounds.  That is what we are hoping for now.  Maybe the intervention of the British Prime Minister will lead to a breakthrough in the coming days.  Based on the state of play now, those of us on the European Parliament side do not see sufficient progress to call for the so-called "second stage" of the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  The sequencing is important because Article 50 of the treaty says that there needs to be an agreement on withdrawal in the first instance before a new relationship can start to be established between the EU and the withdrawing country.  Let us be very blunt about it - the first three rounds were very slow.  We hope the fourth and fifth rounds in October can speed up the negotiations.  It is time for the uncertainty to stop, in the interests of everybody, particularly businesses and citizens.  This uncertainty is having a negative impact on the hearts and minds of citizens and on daily economic life.  The only way to stop it is to go forward in the negotiations.</p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to the Good Friday Agreement.  The European Parliament has made it very clear from day one - it pushed this in the guidelines of the European Council - that the wording of the Good Friday Agreement should be included in all its parts.  This has been a request from the European Parliament.  Keeping the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is a key element for us.  We cannot risk the possibility of Brexit creating a return to the Troubles that we saw in the past.  That is a key element for this whole negotiation.  I found that this point - the risk to the Good Friday Agreement posed by the Brexit discussion - was not touched on sufficiently during the whole debate before the referendum in Britain.  I accept that this is in the past now.  Ireland can count on the European Parliament to defend the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  We will never allow whatever solution is reached to put that in danger.  As the EU played an important role in the Good Friday Agreement, it is keen to defend its own work and its own achievements.</p> <p>  The third issue is the solution for Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier, I have heard many solutions for Northern Ireland already.  It has been suggested that an economic zone could be created, or that the Single Market and the customs union could continue to be extended to Northern Ireland.  All of these solutions are possible.  As the European Parliament will express in its next resolution, however, the position paper that the British Government has put on the table is not possible because it says that there should be a return to a border and that it will be made invisible.  I have always thought that if a border is not visible, it is no border.  If a border is visible, it is a border.  It is not only with a number of technical features that the problem can be solved.  We are in favour of any solution that avoids in any way a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  That is going to be our goal.  As I indicated in my intervention yesterday, the main proposal for avoiding a hard border that I have heard involves Northern Ireland continuing to participate in the Single Market and the customs union.</p></speech>

I have no doubt about the stupidity and, frankly, obnoxiousness of the Tory position when it comes to the negotiations about Britain's exit from the EU.  I am thinking particularly of its anti-immigrant policies.  Given that the EU insisted on the cruel punishment of our citizens for the banking collapse, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says that the EU will not allow Ireland to be punished for Britain's decision to leave the EU?  For example, the EU insisted on the imposition of dreadful austerity on our citizens for things that were not their responsibility.  Given that the EU insists on borders of steel, barbed wire and police camps enforced by Frontex in order to keep out tens of thousands of desperate refugees who are fleeing warzones like Syria, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says noble things about the EU not believing in borders and wanting to reduce borders to lines on maps?  If the EU is willing to do this to desperate and vulnerable people, some of whom are drowning in the Mediterranean as a result, how can we take seriously Mr. Verhofstadt's pledge to try not to impose borders here?  What Britain decides to do is one thing, but I would like to hear an absolute guarantee that the EU will not insist on some sort of border in order to protect its Single Market.  If we were to get such a commitment from Mr. Verhofstadt, we could deal with Britain and the problems it is imposing.</p><p>Can he give us that guarantee?  Can we give credibility to his assertions about not believing in borders, given his insistence on imposing them in a very cruel way in other parts of the European Union?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work that has been done by our officials, Departments and various bodies to prepare for the unknown while working in a vacuum.  At the founding of the EU its principles were peace, harmony and economic and social development for everybody but those principles are being undermined by the way Europe responded to the migrant crisis and by the economic crash, which showed a widening division between rich and poor.  Is this an opportunity for the EU to redefine its vision and to become more committed to the values on which it was set up?  There is an issue around development aid and we are seeing an increasing securitisation agenda.  There is a fear that this will divert badly needed funding and there will now be a further shortfall from Britain.</p> <p>  My second question relates to Ireland as we will be particularly affected in many areas because of Brexit and its potential economic consequences.  How can Europe support Irish jobs and businesses in that area?  A terrible gamble is being taken with the Good Friday Agreement.  Flawed as it is, it has ensured peace for a generation who have not experienced the violence their parents and grandparents experienced.  As well as economic consequences, there are consequences relating to identity and culture.</p></speech>

He visited the Border yesterday and I hope all the cows will be as quiet as those he met in Monaghan.  He said we needed to sort out and clean up our banking but we left it a bit late in the day for that.  We did not get a lot of assistance when we had the crash and we had to sign up to some very stiff penalties.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt said other countries had recently had votes which were more conciliatory towards the EU, and that is good.  I interpreted him as saying there was one last chance to be more democratic, but democracy in Brussels has been lost.  I welcome our MEPs here today, but there have been many regulations and restrictions as to what we can and cannot do and that is why Brexit happened.  They need to look at that, and comments from some very senior people after Brexit were not very helpful.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt might elaborate on what he meant by a frictionless border.  There is a massive border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is much bigger than ours with three checkpoints and which was built with EU funding.  Mr. Verhofstadt says it will not happen here and that Great Britain will have to look after the Border, but that is not good enough for us.  We need concrete and tangible measures.  It is difficult but we need to know the bottom line and the impact it will have on the Single Market, among other issues.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Clare Bailey, from the Assembly in the North.  We are very close to our English and Scottish colleagues and our colleagues in the European Parliament, Philippe Lamberts and others, with whom we work very closely on the European Green Party position.  I am very heartened by what Mr. Verhofstadt said because it marks a change from what Mr. Barnier said when he was here a few months ago, to the effect that a border is a border.  He said there would be free movement of people but not of trade or goods, but Mr. Verhofstadt has said the solution has to be one where an effective customs union or the Single Market is upheld.  Will that be the red line?  Will the Parliament, which has the ultimate veto on any agreement, accept it?  We are now into the second phase of the negotiations because the first phase was primarily about people.  It seems Mr. Verhofstadt said that he will protect this island in the area of customs, goods and services.  He concentrated on four words, which were, "as they may choose", and in respect of the Good Friday Agreement there are another four key words, "in all its parts".  How will the European Parliament choose when it comes to preserving the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts?  Mr. Verhofstadt's language today could not have given a clearer signal that we were going to preserve an island for the trade in goods and services and not just people.  I welcome his clarity on this as it is the right position.  Mr. Verhofstadt should be strong on it or the negotiations will take place and, at the very end, the British will say they did not know that was his position.  I agree with the position he has set out today.</p></speech>

It is not for us to say it has to be this or that system as that is for the negotiations to provide, but we have to give the green light, or the red light if we do not agree.  "No hard border" is not a rhetorical element of our position but a firm position of the European Parliament and we will never accept an outcome of negotiations which does exactly the opposite.  There are possibilities to achieve it and in the negotiations we will have to try to find viable solutions.  I have indicated a few possibilities in this area.</p> <p>  There was a remark on my commitment to the external borders of the European Union.  When there are problems with the external borders of the European Union, they are mainly because of a lack of European Union.  They are problems caused by policies of nation states and not by a so-called European policy.  There is a lack of European policy on migration, asylum and border management.  Excuse me if a use a non-parliamentary term, but it is crazy.</p></speech>

It is nonsense to do that.  In that respect the position of the European Parliament is that we support a European border management in a decent, human way.  This is absolutely needed.  Do Members know the budget of the European Border and Coastguard Agency, which used to be known as Frontex?  It is &euro;250 million.  Homeland security in the United States is &euro;62 billion.  We think we can solve problems at a European level without giving the means and the possibility to do so.  People say the Union does not tackle the challenges of today and does not have good results, but to have good results one needs good policies, for which one needs the financial means.  In terms of a European asylum system to replace Dublin - excuse me for criticising Dublin but I refer to its place in asylum policy, in the form of the Dublin Regulation - we need ways of having legal migration because this is the only way to tackle illegal migration.  We push asylum seekers into the arms of criminal organisations because the only way to ask for asylum is to set foot on European soil.</p><p>I remember the first time I attended the European Council as Belgian Prime Minister.  It was in 1999 in the north of Finland, in Tampere, where it is always dark.  We decided that we should have a common European asylum and migration policy.  So many years later, we are still not there.  That is the problem of Europe.  It is not only a question of announcing things but also of making them really happen.</p><p> The third question was on the specificities and interests of Ireland.  The strategy we and the EU negotiator are following is that all the interests of Ireland are taken on board in the negotiation mandate of the European Union.  That is the way to work on this.  That is the way to ensure that those interests are taken on board in the final agreement.  It is also the best way to keep the unity of the EU 27 because - let us be very realistic - there are going to be attempts to undermine it, which cannot happen.  The only way to prevent it is to fully take on board the interests of Ireland - the Irish Republic - in the negotiation mandate, and that is what we in the European Parliament will try to secure.</p></speech>

He should also be complimented on his passion and commitment to the European concept, something which has become vague in some quarters and countries and the results of which we have seen.  He has the commitment and determination to follow through on what he has said, which is hugely important for this country and for the island of Ireland.</p><p>The <i>status quo</i>must be maintained.  Any diminution of what we have enjoyed for the past 20 years in respect of Northern Ireland or of what we have achieved during our years of membership of the European Union must be prevented.  We must improve, grow and develop these conditions as time goes by.  We must guard against any movement whatsoever to diminish the role of the European Union in our affairs or our role in European affairs.  We must be very careful not to go down that road.</p><p>Mr. Verhofstadt has been very constant and consistent in his views since we met him in Brussels on a number of occasions.  Does he remain satisfied that the European project will continue for all other EU countries?  Will disruptive words such as occur from time to time be curtailed and will all members of the EU be conscious of the need to work together for the Union?  Each member state must take ownership.  None of us is on the outside looking in.  We are all part of Europe and must maintain that position.  Can Mr. Verhofstadt be sure that we will be able to maintain that position throughout Europe in the future?</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.  I would like to ask him about the customs union.  I met recently with members of the British Government in London.  They are resolute that they are leaving the customs union and were pretty clear that they are open to regulatory divergence, including in food, animal welfare and so on.  As we all know, they insist both are possible without any borders.</p> <p>  There has been a bovine theme this morning so I will give an example in keeping with it.  Brazil produces high-quality, grass-fed beef at just above half the price that British and Irish farmers can afford.  If the UK, outside the customs union, were to reach a zero-tariff agreement with Brazil on beef, large containers of high-quality Brazilian beef would land in Belfast.  Smugglers would convey that beef into the Republic.  Some of those smugglers have links to paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, the beef would continue on to the rest of Europe.  Northern Ireland would thus be used as a back door for cheap, high-quality, tariff-free, illegal beef to come into Europe.  Inevitably, the EU would have to respond and, inevitably, we would see a hard border.  We would have a nationalist community in Northern Ireland pulled out of Europe against its will, seeing a fence built around it, at the same time as profits from smuggling would start funnelling into paramilitary organisations there.  Brazilian cows could contribute to the material destabilisation of the peace process.</p> <p>  I sense some softening of a position in the UK on the customs union.  The British are saying they will leave the customs union but might be able to talk about a customs union.  What is the European Parliament's position on trying to find the space where people can save face politically but, by changing the word "the" to "a", where the UK can stay in the customs union in all but name, thus avoiding a hard border around the Six Counties?</p></speech>

I hope he will report back to the European Commission on these welcome engagements.  On behalf of my colleagues who are MPs and MEPs, I ask if he intends to produce a formal report not just for the Commission but also for the steering group of the European Parliament that is dealing with Brexit.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt said he accepts Ireland's unique circumstances.  That is something we saw in the European Commission's paper as well and I welcome it.  We want to hear what, in the final analysis, the term "unique" will mean for Ireland.  I welcome that Mr. Verhofstadt says that the North of Ireland must remain in the customs union.  As we know, the British Government is against this.  That needs to be a very clear, firm view not just of the European Parliament but also of the Commission.  It has to be an absolute red line issue.  If the North is taken out of the European Union against its will and if it is also taken out of the customs union and Single Market against its will, there will be an EU frontier on the island of Ireland.  There will be a border.  We do not want a hard border, a soft border or any type of border.  It has to be a very clear, firm position of the European Commission that the North should remain in the customs union.</p> <p>  We also want it set as a protocol that the Good Friday Agreement, as was said, be attached to the withdrawal agreement.  That gives full legal protections to the agreement.  We cannot cherry-pick the Good Friday Agreement.  It must be protected in its entirety.  Citizens in the North have to have access to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>  In respect of reforming the European Union, democracy is the key issue.  Reform means different things to different people.  My view of reform of the European Union might be different from that of Mr. Verhofstadt.  If we are to learn anything from Brexit, it is that we need more democracy in Europe.  I hope that will be at the heart of any debate on the future of Europe.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for attending.  I am delighted to hear him talk about the new-found solidarity of a post-Brexit EU in which Irish citizens will not have to pick up the cost of reckless banking across Europe in the future.  I will move on from that matter, however.</p> <p>  There is a notion that the UK is responsible for the Border and that it is, therefore, its problem.  Let us be totally honest; it is not.  As the Deputy across the Chamber just pointed out with his Brazilian beef example, the problem is Europe's and not the UK's.  The British will have no interest whatsoever in putting a border in place.  Their sole concern is migration.  They can control migration on the boats and aircraft travelling from Northern Ireland.  One has to have one's passport to get a flight to Britain as matters stand.  How do we protect the Single Market when confronted with a Britain that could not care less about a border in Northern Ireland?  How do we defend the rights of some 1.5 million Irish citizens or potential Irish citizens who are, by reason of geography, living on the wrong part of this island?</p><p>How do we guarantee them access to such programmes as ERASMUS+?  How do we guarantee them free travel throughout the European Union?  How do we guarantee them access to all the benefits that are bestowed on every citizen of Europe?  A citizen of Ireland is by default a citizen of Europe.  How do we guarantee these things?  Finally, how do we bring the European Union closer to the citizen on the ground?  Citizens in this country have taken one hell of a beating over the past eight to ten years with austerity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Guy Verhofstadt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017092100002#J00200"><p>Again, I will respond to three of four of the points that have been made.  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will start with the last point on citizenship because we have talked a lot about borders and economic interests but perhaps not enough about citizenship.  The position of the Parliament, which will be reiterated in the new resolution, is that we need to protect fully the EU citizenship that several hundred thousands of Northern Irish citizens who have Irish passports have.  We must take this seriously.  It concerns all the elements linked to EU citizenship.  EU citizenship is not something from which one can pick and choose - consular aid, yes, but voting rights, no.  It is a concept that is linked to EU citizenship and the position of the European Parliament is that we must protect it.  In the Brexit steering group, one of the priorities is to look into this and be sure that we on the European side defend this concept during the negotiations.  It cannot be the case that we say these people are EU citizens but that EU citizenship does not mean anything.  That is not possible.  It must mean what it is: all the rights that are in fact linked to that concept.</p> <p>  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will respond to another question that has been put forward: what is happening now in this discussion about citizens' rights in general?  This also concerns Irish citizens living in Britain.  Our concept, our proposal, from the European side and the European Parliament side is that we simply continue collectively the rights that the more than 3 million EU citizens living in the UK have currently.  We are very critical - and we will reiterate this in the next resolution - of the UK side's proposal to introduce a new concept of settled status in British immigration legislation that will require each one of these millions of citizens to make an individual request to continue to have his or her rights.  Individual means individual, so if there are four family members, four requests need to be initiated.  There will be a number of conditions and a need to prove a number of things.  This will create an enormous administrative burden on these millions of European citizens, including many Irish citizens in Britain.  The same goes for UK citizens living on the Continent but I do not think this is such a big problem because all the remaining EU member states recognise that the best way forward is simply to continue the rights those citizens have now.  I am saying this because this is a key issue that must be solved, it is to be hoped as quickly as possible, to end the uncertainty for these millions of people who are today already subject to a number of practices by which they are losing a number of their rights.  This is not to mention that some of them received a letter - apparently it was a mistake - stating they had simply to leave the country as quickly as possible.  This is completely against the EU treaties because, until withdrawal, the UK continues to be a member of the European Union, needs to apply fully EU law and does not have the right to send such letters.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the customs union and the example of beef was given.  Other examples are possible.  The problem for the European Union is not that the British side may say tomorrow they want to continue in the customs union.  Nobody in the European Union will say that is not possible.  However, to be in the customs union also means that the competence to make trade agreements continues to be exercised by the European Union.  That is the consequence of a customs union.  In a customs union a country does not negotiate tariffs and trade agreements individually; it is the European Union that does that based on the treaties.  One cannot say one wants to be in the customs union but will manage trade oneself.  That is not the European Union.  I think everyone will accept, certainly now that it has already been proposed by some in Britain, that the UK should stay for a transitional period in the customs union, but it cannot pick and choose and say it wants to be in this but not that.  One cannot say, "I want to be in the customs union and the Single Market but I do not want to pay, I do not want the oversight of the European Court of Justice, I do not want migrants coming from eastern Europe and I do not want it to be the European Union that negotiates trade deals in the future."  That is not possible.  Membership comes with positive things but also with obligations.  One cannot create a system in which not being a member of the European Union is more favourable than being a member.  One would then destroy the European project.  I am very open to and positive about what Deputy Donnelly said in his question but, as I said, it is not a question of taking the benefits and putting the burden on the remaining 27 member states.  That will not happen and will not be allowed to happen.  That is not objective, not serious and certainly not the kind of European Union we all want.</p></speech>

He may recall that he met the European affairs committee in Brussels last February.  At that time there was much uncertainty about the place, but I think we appreciated then and we appreciate now the sympathy and understanding he has shown for Ireland's position.  As he knows, Ireland has major concerns regarding the Good Friday Agreement, the common travel area and the possible implementation of a hard border.</p> <p>  Because I only have one minute, I will go straight to my questions.  Regarding the Brexit negotiations, does Mr. Verhofstadt think it will be very important for the British Prime Minister to give some significant indication tomorrow of the UK's position on the EU budget contribution into the future?  I think Mr. Verhofstadt said solutions to the Irish question are solely a matter for the UK.  Does he not think the Commission and the Parliament could also have some draft proposals on solving our particular problem?  Regarding the future of Europe, the Commission has put forward five scenarios.  I think the President of the Commission put forward a sixth scenario in all but name during the week.  Ireland has concerns about proposals for corporate tax harmonisation and a deepening common defence policy.  We are losing a friend as we lose the UK from the European Union.  Can Mr. Verhofstadt assure us, now that the Franco-German axis is fully restored, that the interests of small nation states will not be forgotten about as we plan the future of Europe?</p></speech>

Things have changed quite dramatically in the meantime.  C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to Mr. Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator.  I was impressed by his visit to Belfast and the Border areas, including Monaghan, to see the invisible Border between the North and South.  He described it very well.</p> <p>  Post-Brexit, we will need more support from the European Parliament and the European Commission to strengthen our regional airports and ports.  I will refer in particular to Ireland West Airport Knock, which needs a derogation and additional Government support, which are matters for the Commission.  I would like Mr. Verhofstadt to bring that point back to the Commission.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt's points about a customs union, or a single market, between North and South were good.  A single market is essential.</p> <p>  I appeal for the power-sharing Executive to be re-established in Northern Ireland.  Why would someone allow Brexit MEPs to be Ministers in Northern Ireland?  It is unthinkable.</p></speech>

If history has taught people in Ireland anything over the centuries, it is that Ireland disproportionately suffers from belligerent British foreign policy.  I welcomed Mr. Verhofstadt's statement that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit.  Those were fine and well-meaning words, but we need practical measures to ensure that it does not happen.</p> <p>  There has been much discussion of the Border and the Good Friday Agreement, and rightly so, but I do not want Europe, Mr. Verhofstadt, his team or the European Parliament to lose sight of the fact that there is &euro;60 billion worth of trade between Ireland and Britain every year, underpinning hundreds of thousands of jobs.  The Border is crucial, as are business and people's livelihoods.  What are the practical measures?  Our party has proposed a European reform fund to support exposed areas and sectors at a European level.  Our agrifood industry has lost nearly &euro;800 million from the value of its exports, but it is just one of many.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt understands the situation and I welcome his visit today as well as his visit to the Border, but let us not lose sight of the hundreds of thousands of jobs in Ireland underpinned by, and dependent on, the &euro;60 billion in trade with our nearest neighbour.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tUasal Verhofstadt.  He and I met yesterday in my home city of Belfast.  In this Oireachtas, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those of us in the North who are Irish do not derive our Irishness from the Good Friday Agreement.  It, of course, runs much deeper than that.  When the agreement was lodged with the EU and the UN, however, it affirmed our legal rights in the eyes of the world as Irish and, therefore, EU citizens.  It says that on the front of our passports to remind us.</p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt has referenced comprehensively something that we discussed yesterday, namely, the importance of the psychology of citizenship and our place within the world.  While our Irish citizenship in the North should never be partial, conditional or second class, nor should our EU citizenship.  Mr. Verhofstadt was clear in his remarks regarding a future for EU citizens living in the North, but perhaps he might expand on what that will mean for the EU citizen who is a farmer in Fermanagh, a worker in Strabane or an entrepreneur in Newry.  If such people are to access their rights and entitlements as full EU citizens, what will that look like?</p></speech>

Those of us on the island of Ireland see that, once again, the British have shot themselves in our foot.  We feel bad about that.</p> <p>  I am Vice Chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Most of the parliamentarians from Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales and other jurisdictions are concerned about this situation and would like to see a change.  Mr. Verhofstadt answered Deputy Donnelly regarding the lengthy transition period.  I view the statement made by Mr. Jeremy Corbyn as indicating a change in the political climate in the UK, which could lead to a second referendum.  We would welcome that, but will Mr. Verhofstadt share his opinion on the matter?</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's views on safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement.  The EU has been a significant stakeholder in the agreement, if not the most significant, and has underpinned it.</p> <p>  Turning to a concern for the island of Ireland, would it be possible to have a final deal without Ireland's agreement?</p></speech>

I am not referring to citizens' rights, which have been discussed at length.  Human rights equivalence is a pillar of the agreement.  I would appreciate Mr. Verhofstadt's thoughts on how it can be enforced as a key aspect in the negotiations and kept from being lost.</p> <p>  In terms of peace building and the Good Friday Agreement, it is important for Europe to understand Ireland's role and global contribution as a neutral nation.</p> <p>  My specific question is on the second stage of negotiations.  Mr. Verhofstadt has been clear, in that the European Parliament will have a say over whether we enter those negotiations.  A new trade negotiating mandate will need to be given by the Council to the Commission.  In his role in the European Parliament, will Mr. Verhofstadt seek for environmental, equality and employment standards to be central in any negotiating mandate so as to ensure that there is no race to the bottom, which would damage Ireland deeply?  Given that Mr. Verhofstadt's country of Belgium has referred investor courts to the European Court of Justice to test their compatibility with European law, can we expect that any trade negotiating mandate given to the Commission by the Council and supported by the Council will not include such mechanisms?</p></speech>

Presumably, that includes the European Parliament's British Members as well.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Verhofstadt agree that the problem with the state of the negotiations arises from the divisions within the British Cabinet?  Until Mr. Johnson, who Mr. Verhofstadt mentioned, is removed, banished or whatever and the British Cabinet reaches a single position, progress will be slow.  Perhaps a little time has to be allowed for that.  Does Mr. Verhofstadt agree that, as negotiations proceed, the British Cabinet will have to become more realistic?  If, like all of us, it wants to ensure the continuation of the invisible Border, it will have to be.</p></speech>

Much of what has been said today concerns what scenario we are to face, in that, it is in the future and the negotiation must conclude - if it is to conclude - successfully.  However, the reality for many people in this State is that the decision of the British people to leave the EU has been having a dramatic economic impact for some considerable time already.</p> <p>  In solidarity with hard-pressed sectors of our economy, will the EU respond with assistance and supports for struggling Irish enterprises?  As has been mentioned, these enterprises are found especially in the agrifood industry.  Mr. Verhofstadt may have met some of them yesterday.  Coming from County Monaghan, where Mr. Verhofstadt was yesterday, and representing Cavan and Monaghan as I do in this Chamber, I am conscious of the reality of daily life for many people.  There is a sizable fear that, whatever is decided, sectors will be significantly reduced and jobs lost without solid economic supports.</p></speech>

I noted with interest his comment that the EU would never allow Ireland to suffer from the UK's decision to leave Europe.</p><p>We greatly welcome that.  We are presuming Mr. Verhofstadt speaks on behalf of the EU negotiating team and that is what we are pinning our hopes on.  However, he stated that the solution in respect of Brexit has to come from the UK.  Unfortunately, those two positions are not compatible and they have not been compatible for the past 15 months.  There is nothing the UK Government has done that gives any bit of solace to us that the solution will come from the UK.  Along with all of my colleagues, I believe that if Mr. Verhofstadt can take one message from his visit here today, it is that we are depending on the EU to ensure that Ireland, as the country most exposed to this decision, does not suffer.  If we are depending on the UK to come up with a solution, as Mr. Verhofstadt said, that simply will not happen.  We have to proceed on the basis that it is the EU's responsibility to protect us, and that is what we need it to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-21a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Guy Verhofstadt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017092100002#L00200"><p>On the questions on external security, as I have already indicated in the first resolution, we in the European Parliament think that for the future relationship, the best way is to use an association agreement, as was seen in the Lisbon Treaty.  That gives the possibility not only to talk about trade but also to talk about the other issues we have to tackle in the future and the other parts of that relationship.  It can be on culture, on education or on research, and it can be on internal and external security matters.  I think it is in the interests of everybody, including the Union, that we do that.  Therefore, it will not only be about trade and economics; it will be a broader decision, in that sense.  I underline what has been said, namely, that the British side has proposed a number of ideas.</p> <p>  Second, many speakers said that it is all very well what I am saying but asked how, in practice and on practical matters, it will work.  I can tell them that, yesterday, I spoke with many representatives of sectors, especially about the practical consequences of Brexit and how to deal with these.  I did not only talk about borders and avoiding a hard border.  We spoke a lot about the general position of the Irish economy and of the Republic of Ireland, and the threats because of Brexit, because it is a main trading partner of Britain.  We spoke of how to secure this trading position and also the trading position of Ireland towards the rest of the European Union because the normal streams of goods towards the European continent are under threat if we have no good solutions in these Brexit negotiations.  I spoke about very concrete solutions for that with the different representatives of the sectors in order to understand their fears, their problems and how they see they could be solved in the future.  I have taken on board a number of very practical suggestions on how that could be done within an agreement with the UK while defending the economic and trade position of Ireland after the withdrawal.</p> <p>  I have noted also the suggestion that has been made by some speakers to put the Good Friday Agreement as an annex of the withdrawal agreement.  It is also a suggestion that has been made in the European Parliament and we are discussing that at the moment in the Brexit steering group.</p> <p>  On the divisions and the development of opinions in Britain, it is true that these are not for the moment helping the negotiations move forward.  However, let us hope that these divisions of opinion will be overcome in the coming days and weeks in order that this fourth negotiation round can be a step forward towards the future.</p> <p>  Another element, having noted the negative impact of Brexit, is whether the Union will take its responsibility.  Naturally, the Union will take its responsibility.  We have the instruments for that and the funds for that, and it will certainly be done.  However, let us first negotiate a good withdrawal agreement and a good association agreement on future relationships to minimise the impact, and then see what will be the nature of that impact.</p> <p>  On a last point, when I said in my introduction that it is for the UK to take responsibility and to come forward, this is not for lack of ideas because I have given ideas in my introduction and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has made a proposal here about an economic zone.  I have spoken about what some have said to me, which is that the best way to solve it is to extend the Single Market and the customs union to Northern Ireland.  All this is on the table.  However, the reason I am saying this is that it is true that the decision to go out of the European Union has not been taken by Ireland, by the Irish Government or by the European Union.  It is a consequence of a British decision so there is also, in that sense, a responsibility on their side to come forward with proposals that can work - not proposals which create a hard border, but proposals which avoid that.  That is the reason I am recalling that all the time.  There is, on their side, responsibility to accept a solution that is workable and, at the same time, that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.</p> <p>  We have to see it a little bit as an element of the negotiation.  It is not that they have taken a decision to go out and, so, we have all the problems on our back and have to find solutions for all the problems.  No.  There is a responsibility also on their side.  For example, financially, one cannot go out of the European Union and say that the whole financial burden is for the remaining 27.  Commitments made by 28 member states cannot be later on paid by the remaining 27.  In one or another way, it is like a divorce.  I have to tell the House I have no practical experience of divorces personally but I know that, in a divorce, you cannot go out and leave your partner alone in the house and say, "Now, all the financial things are for you.  Bye-bye."  That is not the way it works.  Commitments have been made and if commitments have been made, then it is also normal that payments will be required based on these commitments.</p></speech>

Today's meeting has provided another opportunity to highlight Ireland's priorities in the Brexit negotiations and the need for flexible and imaginative solutions in regard to the special position of Ireland.  The guiding principles published on 7 September by the EU in regard to the talks on Ireland and Northern Ireland are positive and encouraging.  It is clear that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area, are fully recognised.  This meeting also provided an opportunity to underline the importance for Ireland of its continued membership of the EU and its commitment to Europe.  Given his role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament, we look forward to continued engagement with Mr. Verhofstadt as the negotiations continue.  We wish him and the European Parliament steering group well in the work ahead.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p></speech>
