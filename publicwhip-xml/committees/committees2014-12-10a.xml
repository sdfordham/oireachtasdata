    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000002#A00400"><p>We are discussing the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 26 - Education and Skills, for an amount of &euro;103 million.  Under Standing Order 161 the discussion must be confined to the items contained in the Supplementary Estimate and no discussion may be raised on the original Estimates, save in so far as it may be necessary to explain or illustrate the particular items under discussion.</p> <p>Members will have an opportunity to review the additional allocations now being sought on an item-by-item basis, to focus on why they are being sought and to review the targets for the relevant items, the resources already made available for these items and the outputs and impacts of the activities concerned.  Members have been circulated with the Department's brief and a brief prepared by the committee secretariat, which are intended to assist them in their consideration of each item.  </p><p> I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, and her officials and now invite her to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000003#B00200"><p>I thank members of the select sub-committee for this opportunity to discuss my Department&rsquo;s requirement for a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;103 million for 2014.  As stated by the Chairman, a briefing in this regard has been circulated to members, and I therefore propose to keep this opening statement brief.</p><p>  The Supplementary Estimate sought will increase my Department&rsquo;s overall net Voted allocation from &euro;7,848.5 billion to &euro;7,951.5 billion.  The additional funding requirement is in respect of current expenditure only.  There are three main factors behind the requirement for the supplementary amount of &euro;103 million that is now being sought.  First, a sum of &euro;77 million, or three quarters of the total supplementary amount sought, is required to facilitate a technical accounting adjustment between the 2013 and 2014 financial years.  The briefing material provided shows that certain salary and pension payments made at the very end of 2013, and originally recorded as expenditure incurred in that year, should have been recorded as expenditure incurred in 2014.  This is because the payments in question were not actually available to staff and pensioners until early January 2014.  This issue was raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his examination of my Department&rsquo;s 2013 accounts.  The result of that examination was that my Department&rsquo;s recorded expenditure for 2013 was reduced by &euro;77 million, with a consequent requirement to provide for this expenditure in 2014 by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  I would again, however, make clear the technical nature of this request &ndash; the net effect of the adjustment over 2013 and 2014 expenditure is zero.</p><p>  Second, a sum of &euro;25 million is needed to cover a projected net excess of current expenditure compared to the original allocation.  A major factor behind this requirement is the fact that the projected number of retirements across the education sector this year will be higher than that allowed for within the funding allocation provided.  While an estimated 2,200 retirements were planned for in 2014, the actual number of retirements is now likely to be over 2,650.  The additional funding is required to meet the lump-sum and pension costs of the additional retirees.  My Department has no control over this element of expenditure.</p><p>  Third, a further &euro;1 million is required to cover the cost of the 25% Christmas bonus announced by the Minister for Social Protection in budget 2015.  The &euro;1 million will cover the cost of paying the bonus to some 18,000 participants on vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, courses and other education and training board, ETB, programmes, which fall under my Department&rsquo;s remit. </p><p>  I am also proposing, in line with normal practice, to offset current expenditure savings emerging on some subheads against excesses emerging on other subheads.  In these cases, there is no net effect on funding.  Similarly, I am proposing to reallocate funding for capital expenditure across subheads by allocating savings on schools capital expenditure to the subhead for expenditure in higher education, mainly to fund expenditure on the DIT Grangegorman site and on St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra.</p><p>  I trust that colleagues will not mind if I use this opportunity to update the sub-committee on plans to introduce necessary reform of the junior cycle and the strike action on which both second level teacher unions have embarked.  As members will know, in recent weeks I have made a very significant move in a genuine effort to reach agreement with both unions.  That move has been welcomed by the National Parents' Council Post Primary, the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, a range of management bodies, the education and training boards and employer representatives.  I appreciate this broad support from education partners.  I also thank various committee members for their supportive comments.  It is deeply disappointing that, in response to this generous and significant proposal, the response of both the ASTI and the TUI has been to embark on strike action.  The main point at issue at this stage is school-based assessment.  School-based assessment is an important element of reform.  Teachers already engage in school-based assessment.  They correct homework and award marks for examinations set in the summer and at Christmas.  Perhaps most importantly, the vital advice and guidance given at parent-teacher meetings is largely based on the teacher&rsquo;s assessment of a student.  </p><p>  The new framework for reform will give teachers an input into the formal junior cycle examination process through assessment.  Under the current system, this professional teaching judgment and experience is excluded from formal junior certificate assessment.  This needs to change.  I am proposing that it contribute to 40% of a student&rsquo;s marks.  The remaining 60% will be awarded through an externally assessed final year exam.  It is on this point in particular that both teaching unions have decided to strike, closing schools and inconveniencing students and their families.</p><p>  I have said that my door is open for talks.  I have also made it clear that for those talks to be meaningful I need to see movement from the unions on the issue of school-based assessment.  A negotiation needs movement from both sides.</p><p>  It is now a week since the ASTI and the TUI took to the picket line.  They will be meeting again this week and they plan another one-day stoppage in January.  In an effort to avert industrial action and restart talks I will now ask Dr. Pauric Travers, who chaired talks between both sides in November, to consult with myself, my officials and both teacher unions to see if the conditions for meaningful talks exist.  Dr. Travers's role in the previous talks was appreciated by both sides and I would like to publicly thank him for the time he is investing in this process.  My departmental officials will also be meeting with parents&rsquo; representatives, the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union and other partners to brief them on the current state of play. </p><p>  My position is that agreement on junior cycle reform can and will be reached.  I would again ask the ASTI and TUI to respond to my initial proposal, as another round of strikes and disruption will serve no interest.  I felt it would be appropriate to announce at the committee meeting rather than outside the House that I have asked Dr. Travers to get involved.  I am happy to respond to any questions.</p></speech>

The first subhead is A3 - salaries, wages and allowances for primary school teachers.  I refer members to page 3 of the Department's brief and page 3 of the committee secretariat briefing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000003#B00400"><p>According to the Minister, the amount being sought under this subhead is to correct an accounting technicality whereby money was paid out this year rather than last year.  How did that work out in terms of the budget?  It was also stated that there was an underspend in the Department last year and that that underspend would be carried over into this year.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate further.  I presume there will be no knock-on effects on next year's budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000003#B00500"><p>What happened is that the moneys were lodged into the banks in 2013 but were not available to teachers and pensioners until 2014.  The view then of the Comptroller and Auditor General was that the funding should more properly have been accounted for in 2014.  It will have no knock-on effects.  As I said earlier, taking the two years together, there will be zero effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1013" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000003#B00600"><p>On the face of it, this appears to be a technical accounting measure, but if the adjustment will apply this year is there then a requirement to adjust the accounts for 2013, because obviously they will have changed as a result?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000003#B00700"><p>We are, in terms of what is being done now, correcting both.</p></speech>

Why was this not foreseen by the Department such that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not have to pick up on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000003#B00900"><p>I was not Minister for Education and Skills at the time, but my understanding is that a view was taken that because the money was paid into the banks in 2013 it could be accounted for in 2013.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General took a different view and felt it should be accounted for in 2014.  I understand a similar problem arose in two other Departments.  As the pay date was 2 January, that was why it arose.</p></speech>

It relates to teachers' retirement and salaries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000004#C00400"><p>How much do teachers' salaries come to?</p></speech>

This provides for some 62,000 teachers and 1,380 additional posts, including 300 additional resource teaching posts.  Given the amount of money involved, it is extremely difficult to be exact for every subhead.  When the Estimates are settled, the aim is to ensure sufficient moneys are available overall to meet all commitments.  We have been able to adjust the subhead through the Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1013" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000004#C00600"><p>With regard to the number of teachers retiring, 2,200 retirements were forecast but 2,650 occurred.  How did the Department plan this and how did it get the figures wrong?  How did the overrun occur?  Was it open-ended - a matter of anticipation - or an incorrect forecast?  Is it as simple as that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000004#C00700"><p>It can be quite difficult to forecast the actual numbers, because teachers can retire at any time between the ages of 50 and 65.  Statistics show that only 10% of teachers retire on age grounds - they retire across the age spectrum for a variety of reasons.  In 2012 more than 3,300 teachers retired, but in 2013 only 1,670 retired.  The figures vary from year to year and, obviously, the prediction for 2014 was not accurate.</p></speech>

One tries to be as accurate as possible, but the numbers are variable.  The Department does its best to forecast the numbers each year.  There have been various grace periods in recent years and they have affected teachers' decisions on retirement and made it harder to predict retirement figures.</p></speech>

Has the number of available posts been estimated, or are extra jobs available?  The original allocation for salaries was for 11,060 staff, an increase of 335 on 2013.

It was noted that 430 more teachers have decided to retire than was originally estimated.  The Minister said that teachers can retire at any age between 50 and 65 and that only 10% of teachers retire on age grounds.  I apologise if this question sounds stupid, but is there any deadline for teacher retirements?  Must they give the Department advance notice of one, two or three months?</p><p>  As I said, this area is new to me.  The Chairman raised a question about whether contracted teachers or permanent teachers cover the duties of newly retired teachers.  Are the retirement figures consistent across the country or do they apply particularly to large centres of population such as Dublin?</p></speech>

Some people have a bigger problem with this issue than I do.  At the same time, retirements should open opportunities for those new to the profession and allow them the chance of a proper, permanent and secure job.  Does the Department check how posts are filled?  I think there is an issue around the transparency of schools' recruitment policies in the ETB sector and generally.  Does the Department have information on the advertisement of permanent posts once they have been vacated, and does it ensure they are filled properly?  Is there any way of overseeing the sector in this regard?</p></speech>

The rehiring of retired teachers is discouraged because we want to create opportunities for young teachers, as many feel insecure in their positions.

We monitor the practices of schools to ensure they recruit younger teachers instead of rehiring retirees.</p></speech>

Is the Minister satisfied with the appeals system for grants in her Department?  It is a very fine and crude instrument to have a cut-off rate for eligibility for grants.  While self-employed people are able to work within the system to a greater extent, and we have to be careful how we phrase that, it is an extremely crude instrument for people who are on PAYE.  I had a case recently where someone received a one-off additional payment of &euro;800 as part of the Haddington Road agreement.  It was a one-off and not to be repeated in the next year but to have that reflected adequately is extremely difficult.  Does the Minister have a comment on whether the appeals system is robust enough to take genuine cases into account where these are hit very hard by being a couple of hundred euro over the limit?</p></speech>

There will always be someone on the wrong side of the cut-off point unfortunately.  As public representatives, we all know of situations where somebody is unfortunately on the other side.  These issues can always be reviewed and they will always be under consideration in terms of whether one needs changes in the system.  While there were difficulties in the first year, SUSI has settled down well in general.  For example, an issue that was raised in committee previously was around independent students and how one defines whether one is independent from one's family.  Issues like that are always kept under review if we feel there may be a need to change.  I have no immediate plans to change the cut-off points.</p></speech>

It provides a superb service which all of us as public representatives would acknowledge.  Certainly, I would and I have no difficulty with SUSI.  The issue is where someone does not fit the typical box.  My specific question is whether the Minister is satisfied that the appeals system is robust enough and sufficient discretion is afforded to the appeals process under her Department in reviewing these cases to accommodate genuine applicants?</p></speech>

That is what is being asked about in terms of the Minister's happiness or otherwise with the discretion.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to make that point to the Minister.  I would like her to feed back if appropriate.</p></speech>

While SUSI has greatly improved, I found it very hard to get it to take certain things on board.  In a way, the applicant has faced a brick wall.  It was only persistence that got SUSI to look at it again.  Some applicants have an estranged parent, which can be a difficulty and there are still issues around it.  The committee did a great deal of work with SUSI and it really got its act together to be fair.</p></speech>

My difficulty is with the extent of latitude that SUSI might exercise if the legislation allowed it to do so.  The appeals body has that latitude.

The school has had five or six prefabs for the past eight to ten years.  It has been told it will not be allocated money for a new building for up to the next eight years.  However, it was told in the previous week that planning permission would be going up to indicate that the building to proceed.  I recognise the Minister cannot answer that specific question because I have not told her the name of the school but, in the general case of DEIS schools in poorer areas, which take in pupils whose needs are greater than in other areas, why is a project of this nature not being dealt with in a separate way?  I am anxious to know why the &euro;35.5 million could not have been allocated to schools which need this money now rather than in five or six years time.</p></speech>

Two schools in my area are not on the five year programme, even though one has been waiting for 15 years.  One of the prefabs in that school is in a disgraceful condition.  In the two schools in question, approximately 400 students have been accommodated in prefabs for a decade.  Over the years I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on the issue.  Even the work aimed at reaching the stage where an architect takes a first look proceeds at snail's pace.  I do not know whether this is by design or because of a lack of resources but the issue also arises that money is not being spent on construction because there are insufficient shovel ready projects.  Is anything being done to speed up the various stages, which seem to take years to complete?</p></speech>

All of these projects will be constructed.  There are also programmes for prefab replacement which were announced by my predecessor at the beginning of the year.  As in any Department, when one comes to the end of the year sometimes there are reasons why projects are delayed.  The money may not be spent in that particular year but in most of these delayed cases it will be spent early in the coming year.  In order to ensure we do not have an underspend in our capital programme, which none of us would want, money can be transferred to a project that can use it in the current year.  That does not mean that the delayed projects will not proceed.  They are already in the programme announced for this year.</p><p>  In regard to the schools to which the Deputies referred, we will be announcing the next major construction programme in early 2015.  Schools that are on a list and have been waiting will be considered for that programme.  In terms of major construction, the previous programme was almost completely driven by demographics and growth in numbers, and the need to ensure that every child had a school and a classroom to attend.  </p> <p>That was the primary driver of the major spend over recent years.  In the coming programme, we will have to account for demographics again.  We also want to look at older schools that need replacement and we will continue with the prefab replacement programme.  There are several strands to the schools building programme and there are various reasons some of them have not moved as quickly as expected.  One reason is the new building control regulations which came into force on 1 March.  In some cases, these have caused some of the projects to go slower than was originally expected.  This accounts for some of the underspend.  Rather than lose the moneys because we cannot spend them, we would use them in another project that is part of the spend.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/994" speakername="Jim Daly" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000007#F01000"><p>Any time we have this conversation, it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the extraordinary work achieved by the Department under the direction of the Minister and her predecessor.  When we came into government, priority was given to replace prefabs and start building projects.  With previous Administrations, while houses were built at every crossroads, they did not invest in school accommodation for our children.  The work done by the Government is worthy and needs to be recognised.  In my constituency, the schools infrastructure in towns such as Clonakilty has been utterly transformed in the Government&rsquo;s lifetime.  I wholeheartedly welcome this significant investment in our children&rsquo;s futures.</p><p>  Unfortunately, there is an issue around subcontractors for schools building projects not being paid by main contractors.  On Monday, I spoke with a subcontractor who mentioned some well-known construction firms getting moneys from the Department for school works but not paying their subcontractors.  It is probably down to tight tenders.  Often, it is those first on site who will be paid but landscapers and the finishers on a project are not paid.  That is how these main contractors are getting the edge over their competitors.  The Department needs to be mindful of this and more needs to be done to protect subcontractors from getting burnt by some of the large contractors.  The Department needs to remember that the cheapest quote for a schools building project might not be the most realistic and the only way the main contractor can come in at that price is by burning subcontractors.  It is a despicable practice which we must condemn and we need to work hard to ensure it does not happen.</p><p>  Another issue which I raised several times with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor is where suppliers of goods and services have not been paid by school boards of management with moneys from devolved grants.  While the devolved grants are suitable from the Department&rsquo;s perspective, as a school principal I know it is an extraordinary task to go through design and planning.  For many principals it is a difficult journey and they are not qualified in that area.  I had a case recently where &euro;74,000 was allocated by the Department for the provision of accommodation for a school but it was never paid to the supplier by the school&rsquo;s board of management.  The Department must ensure the moneys given for a specific purpose are spent accordingly.  While I accept boards of management do not come under the Minister&rsquo;s remit and are a closed shop, there have been some cases where moneys from the Department have been misappropriated.  The Department must be made aware of this and put structures in place to ensure better accountability with boards of management for moneys devolved to them.</p></speech>

If I were managing this operation, I would be saying someone was slacking and we need to find out why these moneys were not spent.  There are schools in every member&rsquo;s community waiting for schools building projects.  However, it turns out to be just an accounting exercise at the end of the year and it does not matter if the money was not spent.  It should matter.  There should be an investigation into this underspend.  I know the Minister said there are various reasons why it occurred.  However, from a control point of view, this should be broken down in detail to find out why these moneys were not spent.  Was someone not doing his or her job?  We need to look behind the individual numbers, not saying this is an accounting procedure at the end of the year and everything is grand because it is not.</p></speech>

Some schools that got ambitious building projects have low enrolment numbers which would not justify the spend in the end.  There are other schools meeting the needs of a growing school-going population but the children are left in prefabs.  Why does the Department not get more schools to be ready to proceed with a project if moneys become available?  Why is the process so slow?  While we welcome moneys from the primary sector going to the third level sector, in this instance to DIT, should school buildings be a priority?</p></speech>

These 41 large-scale projects involved 30 projects in the primary and 11 in the post-primary sector.  A further 60 large-scale projects are under construction, while another 67 are advancing towards or are at tender stage, prior to commencement on site.  Some of these were delivered in the traditional manner and some were devolved to different bodies like ETBs, etc.  It is a major programme.  I share the concern that we would spend where we should be spending.  The school sector is a major priority for all of us.  We do not want to see delays happening, but sometimes they happen for genuine reasons.  We want to make sure we spend the money and do not let it go.</p><p>  There has been considerable improvement in terms of things moving more quickly than they did in the past.  I remember a time when many stages were involved and things seemed to take forever.  I am aware of a large number of projects which are ready to go, if funding was available for them.  If there are delays I would be happy to investigate why they exist.</p><p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Daly on sub-contractors, I share his views on non-payment of sub-contractors.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has been working on strengthening the rights of people who are losing out in that regard.  In my Department, the Contractors Administration Services, CAS, conducts random audits of school building projects to ensure they are compliant with regulations under the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  If criminal activity was involved, recommendations could be made.  It conducts audits on building sites and if it sees anything it believes is untoward, it can refer it to the relevant authorities and have them investigated.  The Department does that in order to ensure that there is no abuse of the various regulations and obligations of contractors and sub-contractors working on sites.</p></speech>

I made the point on numerous occasions that a specific allocation should have been made in last year's Estimates and in next year's Estimates  towards that.  When the &euro;28 million is combined with the almost &euro;40 million underspend, the total underspend on the schools' capital budget is &euro;65 million.  This is not new.  We had the same situation last year, whereby approximately &euro;70 million in the school capital project budget was underspent.  </p><p>  The former Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced minor works grants when the figure became clear.  He also announced that there would be a summer works scheme from the funding, something the Minister decided not to do.  She is taking the &euro;40 million from the primary and secondary sector and is putting it into the third level sector.  She has made a definite decision not to fund a summer works scheme in the coming year, but will instead use the money elsewhere.  That is a major issue for many schools which have pent-up demand for projects.  There was no scheme in two out of the past three years, and it now seems to be the case that it may not be paid for three out of four years.  </p><p>  It is something to which the Minister must have given a lot of thought and the Department would have considered very clearly.  I find it difficult to see how the Minister came to the decision not to pay the summer works scheme because of the nature of the projects awaiting that funding.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that decision.</p></speech>

The total budget for schools is &euro;451 million for 2014, and is &euro;70 million for higher education.  The policy is to spend the vast majority of the capital budget on schools.  As I said, I intended to announce the minor works scheme, which was announced at the same time the previous year.  It was a priority, in terms of underspend.</p><p>  As I understand it, in regard to the summer works scheme money will still be spent in 2015.  I will probably need to come back to the committee to clarify that at a later stage.  Expenditure in the order of &euro;56 million on the summer works scheme is expected by year end and provision has been made in the 2015 allocation for the carryover costs of such improvement works not completed this year.  There will be some money spent next year on the summer works scheme, which was previously announced.  </p></speech>

I understand that around this time last year the former Minister made an announcement similar to the Minister's announcement this year on the funding of a minor works grants.  He also announced a summer work scheme, for which applications would be sought and money spent throughout 2014.  Does the Minister have any plans for a 2015 summer works scheme?  Money was not allocated in the 2015 Estimate for a summer works scheme or minor works grants.  Some &euro;40 million has become free due to an underspend.</p> <p>Does it mean no summer works scheme is planned for 2015?</p></speech>

The Minister assured me that it was having no impact on capital spending on education, but when one takes &euro;60 million that could have been used for school buildings and allocates it elsewhere, it very definitely has an impact.  The many schools that await funding are unable to avail of it.  While schools on which the money was going to be spent will get some from next year's capital budget, others will miss out as a result.  Is it possible to have a breakdown of the schools that were due to get capital funding this year, the amount that was earmarked for those projects and the schools that did not draw it down as a result of the delay?  St. Mary's national school, Stranorlar, is seeking funding for a new school building for which a site has been bought.  It is on a main national road and faces pedestrian safety issues, and has very small classrooms.  It is one example of a school which is not getting funding as a result of the underspend of &euro;60 million.  The Minister and Department are not focusing on ensuring that the money is spent on school buildings.</p></speech>

We will not underspend.  The amount for DIT is the amount allocated to it.  If DIT is ahead in its spending and spends its money this year rather than next year, it does not follow that it will receive more.  I reiterate the Government's very strong commitment to spending on schools.  Many projects in the higher education sector have been sitting on lists since 2011 and have not been advanced.  DIT was prioritised because of the work that was happening on the Grangegorman campus.  The Government is very strongly committed to the school building programme, and anything that was delayed this year was not delayed because we wanted to underspend in the area but for genuine reasons.  Some of it was devolved and we had no control over the delays.  The delays, which are regrettable, will be made up next year, but not at the expense of the school building programme.  We are not trying to spend less on schools and more on higher education.  The emphasis is very much on schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/994" speakername="Jim Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12014121000009#H01900"><p>I have a comment on the overall issue of the Estimates and budgetary process, which I have made at each of the previous Estimates meetings to the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, for whom I had enormous time.  He contributed to the education system.  I have worked in the education system at primary, secondary and management level and have some understanding of it.  I feel passionately that we politicians must put our priorities on the table at this time of year.  Yesterday, through a parliamentary question, I learned that savings of nearly &euro;5 million accrued on the day of industrial action last week.  I will pass no comment on this, good, bad or indifferent.  It is a mathematical issue.  A saving of &euro;4 million was made on rental accommodation.  If the Minister wishes to leave her mark on the education system, both personally and politically, it could be in the area of the allocation of resources for children with special learning needs.  As a member of the committee and a politician, it is my top priority.  I plead with the Department that where any savings accrue, such as in the areas I mentioned or on the rental of accommodation thanks to the schools building programme, they be reinvested into special needs learning.  It has progressed enormously in my lifetime from a zero base, and I want it to continue.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that Mr. Travers has been asked to intervene and try to engage with the Minister and teachers' representatives to see if there is a way towards reaching an agreement with which everybody can be comfortable.  It is unfortunate that it has come to this.  Had the Government taken a different approach, primarily the Minister's predecessor, we might have avoided it.  We are back to what was on the table before the Government came to office, but in a much more difficult industrial relations sphere.  Those who should have been partners in the reform are now in conflict with the Government.</p> <p>The Minister's decision some weeks ago to return to the proposal for external assessment of 60% of the new junior certificate and for it to continue to be State certified is welcome .  If the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Government had engaged with teachers from the outset, instead of taking a dictatorial and solo approach to important reforms, we would not have found ourselves in the situation we are in now.  An accommodation could have been reached in a way that would have ensured we would see reform implemented more quickly than see now.</p><p> Now, both the Department and the teacher representatives are retiring into their trenches and are becoming very much focused on the principle of either complete external or internal assessment of the remaining 40%.   The focus should be on the end curriculum and the learning experience for the student, how it can be delivered and what agreement can be reached to ensure the 40% being assessed internally in the school leads to the student having an improved curriculum and learning experience.  They focus should be on getting down to the nitty gritty and discussing the detail of this to ensure this is the outcome.  As long as either the Department or the teachers stick to their view, they cannot get down to the level of detail required to see what the experience of the student will be.</p><p> I hope Mr. Travers can engage with the Department and the teacher representatives and get down to that detail.  I believe the Department's unwillingness to engage on the detail of this with the teacher unions unless they agreed in advance of engagement that it would be internal assessment in the schools put an unnecessary barrier against talks on the 40% assessment that is to happen over second and third year in school.  If the Department had offered to talk to the unions about their remaining concerns, we could have avoided a situation where we have already had a one day strike and face a potential second.</p><p> Hopefully, the Minister's decision to re-engage Mr. Travers will allow a platform where we can have serious discussion between her and the teacher representatives as to how the 40% assessment can be delivered and how to deal with the issues and concerns in regard to that so as to avoid a further strike day and get real agreement.  I believe this agreement could have been achieved three years ago if the Government had taken a different approach than it has.  Unfortunately, even though curriculum change has started with English, we are probably further behind overall than when the Government came to office.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy McConalogue for his positive views on the moves I have made.  I believe we need to see movement from the teacher unions and hope that through the re-engagement of Mr. Travers, we will be able to avoid a further strike that does not serve any purpose.</p><p>  At all times, the focus of the Department, myself, my predecessor and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which made the recommendations, is in the interest of students to ensure we give them the opportunity to be assessed on a variety of skills, competences and intelligence, not just those that are measured in an exam at the end of a three year cycle.  The sooner we can get on with this and get working on implementing the curriculum, the better.  As the Deputy said, we have started with English, but the sooner we get beyond this impasse, the better for everybody concerned.  </p><p>  It is important to realise that some of the other partners in education, particularly parents at post-primary level are strongly in favour of this change taking place.  The same is true for the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  We must be cognisant of these partners and for that reason, the Department will meet with them in parallel with the talks Mr. Travers is having with the teacher unions in which we hope he will make progress.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McGrath" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014121000003#C00300"><p>I am pleased to appear before the committee to discuss the operations and functioning of the Office of Public Works and answer any questions that members may have.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works, as the committee is aware, is responsible for a wide variety of functions, with an overall budget of &euro;381 million in the current financial year.  The two principal functional areas of responsibility on which I wish to focus are the priority reform areas for Government of flood risk management and estate portfolio management.</p><p>  In regard to flood risk management, the Office of Public Works is the lead agency for the management of flood risk in Ireland and has invested more than &euro;400 million on behalf of the State in the period 1996 to 2014.  The Government has committed &euro;225 million to flood risk management under its Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012&ndash;2016 Medium Term Exchequer Framework - a substantial capital allocation which is enabling the OPW to continue with its flood relief capital works programme in conjunction with local authorities.</p><p>  In order to advance the State's approach to flood risk management in Ireland, the OPW has developed a catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, known as the CFRAM programme.  This programme lies at the core of the assessment of flood risk management in Ireland and long-term planning of the flood risk management measures throughout the country.  The CFRAM programme is a central pillar of national policy on flood risk management, and its implementation is also ensuring that Ireland will meet the requirements of the EU flood directive that came into force in November 2007.</p><p>  At present, CFRAM is focused on 300 areas of potentially significant risk which were identified through a national screening exercise completed in 2011 following public consultation.  It is important to recognise and understand that although CFRAM is identifying existing areas at risk of flooding based on the analysis of data collected, the CFRAM process is not creating any new risks.  The current position is that draft flood maps are currently been produced for the areas for further assessment, and the OPW is rolling out a series of public consultation days on these draft maps in these areas.  The maps will contribute directly to the improved management of flood risk in the medium to long term.  It is only through the clear identification of existing risks or risks that may arise under different climate change scenarios that all the main stakeholders can work together towards the implementation of sustainable measures to effectively address that risk.  In that regard, the OPW recently engaged in a public consultation with all the main stakeholders in Dublin Castle.  In addition, OPW is engaged with the Department of Finance and Insure Ireland on the matter to ensure detailed information is made available to its member companies in an agreed format on completed flood relief schemes to allow it take that information fully into account when considering insurance cover for its customers.</p><p>  With regard to progress to date, a number of major flood relief schemes have been completed or are nearing completion in Dublin, Clonmel, Carlow, Kilkenny, Mallow, Fermoy and Ennis.  Further major schemes in Bray and Waterford and on the Dodder and Wad rivers in Dublin are currently under construction, and schemes at design stage include Cork, Bandon and Skibbereen.  While we are running the CFRAM programme, in parallel, we are continuing with the capital investment programme.</p><p>  In order to supplement the capacity to deal with flood risk, the OPW also provides funding to local authorities to undertake smaller-scale works to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  Funding of almost &euro;30 million under this scheme has been allocated since 2009, involving up to 470 projects.</p><p>  As the committee will be aware, earlier this year a number of severe flooding events occurred, mainly in coastal areas.  The Government allocated &euro;69.5 million for the repair and remediation of public infrastructure that was damaged.  Some &euro;19.6 million of this was allocated to OPW for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defences following the flood events of December 2013 and January 2014.</p> <p>This funding is being made available in 2014 and 2015 to local authorities through the Office of Public Works based on programmes of works submitted by local authorities.</p><p> Another significant area of work carried out by the office is on the property side.  The estate portfolio management programme encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State's property portfolio.  This includes the conservation, protection and presentation of national monuments and historic properties in State care.  The programme, which has an overall budget of &euro;312 million this year, provides a variety of services, including professional services such as architecture, engineering, valuation, quantity surveying and project management.</p><p> In recent years the number of staff in the public service has decreased, and this has presented an opportunity to achieve significant reductions in the cost of office accommodation, one of central government's largest administrative overheads after pay and pensions.  The OPW has made significant progress in this area.  For example, the rental outturn for Departments has fallen from &euro;131 million in 2008 to an expected outturn this year of &euro;94 million through a programme of lease renegotiations and surrenders.  This programme will continue to deliver an annual cash saving of over &euro;30 million for the Exchequer.  The outturn may continue to fall further with the appropriate investment in office accommodation along with significant administrative savings for Departments and greater efficiency in property management.</p><p> Within the estate portfolio, the heritage services manage the conservation and presentation of 760 national monuments and 30 national historic properties, with a combined provision of 70 visitor centres throughout the country.  The visitor numbers at our staffed heritage sites continue to grow, with over 4 million visitors recorded in 2013.  Multiples of this number attend sites which are open throughout the country on an annual basis, and we do not note the numbers at these sites.  As part of our efforts in this area, the office is engaging on an ongoing basis with parties in the tourism sector, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland, to ensure our strategy is aligned with overall investment strategies for tourism.</p><p> I will set out the position on property asset management reform and the Government's agenda in this area.  The OPW's evolving role under the property reform programme is a significant undertaking.  It is being progressed against the backdrop of continuing rationalisation of the portfolio, to which I have adverted, and this has seen our rental outturn fall significantly.  The ownership of State property in Ireland is legally vested in many State authorities and agencies.  At times, this can result in an independent approach by each State entity in managing its portfolio.  Changing this approach to a more centralised model through legislation would be an onerous undertaking and, therefore, ownership remains the same.  However, a collaborative approach to reform has been adopted in this area through the establishment by Government of the steering group on property asset management reform, a committee which I chair.  The steering group is comprised of representatives from the wider public service, including the County and City Managers' Association, the HSE and senior public servants nominated by virtue of their Department's role as property holders as well as their oversight role in respect of bodies under their aegis.  The primary objectives of this group are to secure property related reforms, and we are seeing progress on many of these.  The objectives include improving our combined strategic decision-making capability in managing the State's property assets, developing an intra-public-service map-based register of all State property, standardising building performance measurement or key performance indicators throughout the public service, developing a more co-ordinated approach to State property acquisitions, intra-state property transfers and asset sharing protocols, and optimising our expertise throughout the public service and benchmarking ourselves against international best practice.  I expect that if we achieve these deliverables, real savings will be attained.  They will be realised by sharing assets, expertise and information throughout the public service as well as through streamlining administrative and legal property transactions.</p><p> Already we are seeing more effective engagement and use of the State's property assets, including optimisation of the use of State facilities for the public good through our disposal programme.  This includes the provision of several surplus properties to community and voluntary groups and the transfer of certain properties to councils for various other uses and to other bodies in the public sector.  Separately, the office has engaged with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of the current homelessness issue.  Several properties under the OPW's remit have been examined for their suitability with a view to identifying interim solutions.  This engagement is ongoing.  We work closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and other public bodies in this area.</p><p> In the area of office rationalisation, Ministers have committed to ensuring that their Departments and agencies co-operate fully with the implementation process such that the State can achieve better utilisation of the existing portfolio.  This can be realised through accommodation sharing across the public service, for example, as well as more modern, open-plan and cost-effective accommodation solutions and work practices.  I believe the drive to optimise office space utilisation will be enhanced and facilitated by statistical evidence setting out the full cost of accommodation borne by the State.  This evidence will derive from the key performance indicators arising from the application of a standardised approach to facilities management to be adopted by public property managers.  This will provide a basis on which to assess building performance and identify where improvements in space and energy efficiency can be achieved.  In the meantime, the OPW must continue to respond effectively to the property-related requirements of new Government programmes such as Intreo, as well as sustaining our core day-to-day business.</p><p> In order to meet these needs of the Government, we have initiated a process of internal organisational change to ensure the optimum alignment of our processes, resources and structures to sustain day-to-day activities and position the OPW to lead the programme of property-related reforms.  I thank the committee and I am happy to answer any questions members may have on our operations or functions.</p></speech>

Ms McGrath and her colleagues are welcome to the committee meeting.  First, I wish to deal with flood risk management.  Following that, I intend to deal with property-related issues.</p><p>  Will the commissioner explain the position on catchment areas, which are important in respect of flood risk management?  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government water investment programme was based on the catchment areas of certain rivers and where they enter the sea.  We have become accustomed to that.  There was a logic to the framework because it ties in to the source of the water and rivers in the various counties.</p><p>  Surface water is an issue when rivers are flooding.  The OPW has a role in this area, as do local authorities.  I do not intend to delve into the day-to-day matters in this area, but Irish Water has a role as well.  Will Ms McGrath outline the work the OPW has done up to now in conjunction with local authorities, especially in cases of flooding, surface water and public area flooding?  How do these types of flooding affect sources or lead to pollution?  How does flooding lead to pollution with wastewater from treatment plants?</p><p>  What role does the OPW have in respect of Irish Water?  I have some concerns about the setting up of the new body.  Off the top of my head I can think of three state organisations - namely, the OPW, local authorities and Irish Water - which now have an involvement with water when it emerges on the streets of a town or when water and wastewater services and sources are affected.  Will Ms McGrath set out the OPW's position and explain any discussions with Irish Water on this issue?</p></speech>

We undertake schemes for river or fluvial flooding.  These are capital investment works and we maintain these schemes.  Where we do work, we maintain the schemes.  Separately, local authorities have responsibility for district schemes under different legislation.  These are clearly identified.  Local authorities have responsibility in that area and they are funded centrally for it.</p><p>  In 2004 the Government produced a flood risk management policy document which set out the position overall on flood risk management.  The document sought to identify roles and responsibilities in respect of the entire area.</p> <p> In respect of rivers flooding and coastal flooding, the Office in Public Works had lead responsibility in terms of future flood risk management but co-ordinates responsibilities across a lot of stakeholders.  </p><p> The Deputy talked about urban drainage.  That is the responsibility of local authorities.  If that responsibility is moving then it is a responsibility between local authorities and Irish Water.  </p></speech>

First, flooding from rivers which is called fluvial flooding and we have responsibility to bring forward schemes to protect against such flooding.  Second, there is coastal flooding from tidal or tidal surge for which the OPW can bring forward schemes along with local authorities who have a role under the Coast Protection Act.  The third element, which is the type mentioned by the Deputy, is the design and maintenance of urban infrastructure and is a matter for the local authorities.  In terms of the capacity of urban infrastructure, it is for local authorities to size up those pipes as part of road drainage or that.</p></speech>

In other words, if rivers are not properly drained and maintained flooding will result which then becomes a problem for the OPW.</p><p>  We are all familiar with joint drainage boards between local authorities but the initiative was abolished recently.  Their demise is connected to the local election results of last year because new municipal authorities have since been established.  Let me give a classic example.  Part of the Barrow Drainage Board, affecting Offaly, Laois, Kildare and Carlow, has been abolished and local authorities have been told to sort the matter out themselves.  The joint approach is not underpinned and the statutory instrument has been dissolved.  What has happened in those towns?  The OPW has a scheme in Carlow under way which came about as a result of flooding on the River Barrow.  Portarlington suffered flooding on the same river as does Athy and different areas.  Does the lack of drainage and maintenance by local authorities lead to problems for the OPW?  Do the local authorities say: "If the problem gets bad enough OPW will have to come up with a scheme?"</p></speech>

These drainage districts are the responsibility of local authorities and that is where responsibility remains.  We provide some support for this situation through the minor flood risk and coastal protection programme.  The scheme allows local authorities to apply where there are capacity issues.  Subject to meeting particular criteria, cost benefit criteria and funding by us allows them to apply for funding for certain areas.  We would not take over responsibility for maintenance, a task which rests with them for their areas.</p><p>  Under the catchment flood risk and assessment management plans we are looking at the 300 areas of greatest risk, irrespective of where responsibilities lie.  In respect of those areas, we will bring forward, in 2015, and will outline design stage schemes for the 300 areas, including 90 coastal areas.  We will also take account of climate change impacts.  In those areas we will take on the development of programmes of work, and subject to capacity and funding, we will bring those forward over a number of years. </p></speech>

Perhaps it has put down on paper what is considered a 100-year or 1,000-year event.  The maps are a good thing.  However, they have worked their way into county development plans causing difficulties, correctly so in some areas, for planning applications.  The maps have had a far greater impact than people appreciated.  A 1,000-year event is now included on these maps.  I have encountered instances where banks have been unwilling to advance mortgages in areas and towns where the local people have no recollection of flooding in the past 100 years.  Now the  OPW has recorded flood risks on its maps even though it is a 1,000-year event.  Some banks are nervous about the risk of flooding.  The maps have been positive but there have been downsides for the citizens.  Some of the 1,000-year events are based on hearsay and colloquialism.  I have seen instances where such details on a development plan have been challenged and removed.  The NRA is consulted about planning applications if a flood risk affects a national route.  Do local authorities consult legally the OPW about planning applications in areas that the OPW has identified in its maps as flood risk areas?  What is the OPW's view on the matter?</p></speech>

Then guidance was issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in consultation with the OPW, on planning locally in respect of areas covered by these maps.  As the Deputy has rightly said, the OPW does not create risk but identifies where areas are at risk.  Local authorities should take account of that information when they make decisions.</p><p>  Recently the Minister referenced the fact that where decisions are made to build in areas at risk an issue for the taxpayer will come later.  A defence scheme must be installed to mitigate the risk at a later date.  There is an issue around housing.  We are saying that these are the maps, this is the identification of risk and guidance is provided for local authorities.  There is guidance for their local area planning and development and there are guidelines on how they might treat such information.  We expect that they are dealing with such information.  We do not deal with individual planning applications in that sense.</p></speech>

Banks have adopted a particular view on established houses which are not new dwellings because a county development plan has identified an area as being at risk.  The maps have put an incumbrance on a lot of houses.</p></speech>

I have two questions but I wish to follow up on a point made by Deputy Fleming about flooding having a knock-on effect for private property owners in residential areas, in particular.  I am aware of a stream in local authority owned land flooding in 2010.  As a result the row of houses that back onto that land have not been able to get home insurance because of an inappropriate loading on their policies.  Upstream on publicly owned land, as far as I am aware vested in the Minister of Finance, there was a blockage at the mouth of a river where it met the sea.  This resulted in the water backing up in the stream that caused this problem in Kinsealy in 2010.  The local authority washed its hands of responsibility on the basis that it was private property, however, it was not, it was public property.  I am aware of similar instances in a number of places.  I am not entirely sure if Ms McGrath will be able to give me an answer.  There are major knock-on  effects when maintenance of ditches or steams in public ownership does not occur.</p><p>  I wish to raise the issue of coastal erosion.  Ms McGrath will be familiar with what occurred in Portrane a year or so ago.  While the OPW has been very helpful in providing funding, which has been matched by Fingal County Council to complete a study, inertia is creeping in.  The storms will blow in very shortly and there are homes a couple of metres from the water mark of the tidal surges 12 months ago.  I understand the necessity for the studies, but homes are located in areas where they should not be, but that is not at issue, but the local representatives have to deal with the impact of tidal surges.  Ms McGrath's comments would be appreciated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014121000006#F00500"><p>The OPW works with local authorities, who have particular responsibilities under the legislation, for coastal protection.  We are minded to provide support and advice as well as funding to enable the local authorities to deal with coastal protection.  Unlike flooding, coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon that must be addressed, in doing so, priority must be given to where there are homes.  In fairness, I think that is what local authorities are doing.</p><p>  The physical work in doing all flood protection work is technically very challenging.  When dealing with coastal erosion, other factors are at play because it is a natural phenomenon and one must be careful of what one does further up and down from the site of the works.</p><p>  We are mindful that the local authority would be working to find solutions but it does require complete and detailed surveys and analysis to inform the decision.  It is then a question of how quickly it can be expedited.  We would be supporting the local authorities by assuring them that funding is ringfenced for the work.  I appreciate that is of little comfort to people in homes.  </p></speech>

To be fair, the previous Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, the former Deputy Brian Hayes, came to a large meeting in the area and the OPW was not found wanting in terms of the manner and the speed at which it came up with the money.</p><p>  The other side of the problem is that under the law, people cannot erect block walls even on a temporary basis while these surveys are taking place.  I accept fully the knock-on effect of putting in inappropriate flood defences.  I am aware that work done in Rush had a knock-on effect in Donabate and Portrane causing other issues to arise.</p><p>  As Ms McGrath said, the surveys take time and this offers no real comfort to homeowners.  I know some have taken the law into their own hands and put in place various measures that are not in compliance with environmental legislation and will probably not stand up to the test of time.</p><p>  Has the OPW received an increase in funding to deal with these issues?  Has it the potential to make greater investment in programmes and studies on coastal protection?  I am very aware that coastal erosion occurs in the main on the west coast, but Donabate and Portrane are low lying and are protected in the main by a ring of dunes, most of which have been breached in the past three or four years during particular storms.</p></speech>

Other parts of our allocation were cut, but there have been no cuts in our allocation for this work since 2008.  Government has ensured that funding is in place to support this work.</p><p>  I would say, and it is a policy question, that the legislation covering this area dates from 1963.  I think there are things we can consider - and we want to move into that space - in regard to coastal protection.  We are looking at 90 coastal areas as part of the CFRAM programme, and taking account of climate change.  We will be dealing with some of the more populated areas, because they meet the criteria of the programme.  In 2009, we introduced the minor flood risk and coastal protection scheme through which we are providing the funding to local authorities.  I think the local authorities have an issue with their capacity to deal with that number.  The local authorities had to deal with storms in January.</p></speech>

I have a question on the care of our built heritage.  I am a fan of Leinster House and other buildings in State ownership, many of which were lost at the founding of the State.  I am glad to say that a number of buildings are beginning to flourish.  There is a significant number of notable properties where there are difficulties with ownership.</p><p>  I understand that Aldborough House, in Portland Row, Dublin which had been neglected for more than a decade has been purchased.  It is as notable as Leinster House in terms of its importance.  There are a number of properties right across the country, one in County Sligo, which I understand has been purchased recently but was allow to become dilapidated for 20 years. </p><p>  Properties have been purchased by the State over the years.  Is this Government policy or a response to political pressure?  Is there an allocation in the Vote of the OPW to consider buying properties that are at extreme risk?  Does McGrath envisage that more money will be allocated to do this in the coming years?  It is fair to say that the Department of Finance has worked on the policy in regard to the maintenance of significant properties, by giving property owners the opportunity to avail of certain tax breaks to rejuvenate properties.  Is the OPW considering that actively?</p></speech>

Decisions on State acquisition of property from private owners do not come under our remit, other than through section 1003A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p> <p>We have an involvement at that end of things.  In relation to the former, it is a decision of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as to whether a property would be included.  This has not happened, but where a property was required, the Department might look to the Office of Public Works, a local authority or community group to manage and maintain it.  Our role in this area is in respect of the properties that are in our care.  There is an aspect of this where by reason of issues around access or issues with adjoining properties in relation to properties in our care, we might think strategically and determine what is important in respect of the heritage property we have.  We would treat with that as we have the core property and might see opportunities.  There is no direct funding and we look to that in relation to our own resources.  It is about doing it strategically out over a number of years and we would obtain Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanction around that.  In terms of the Deputy's originating question, we would not be looking at privately held properties and requests in that space, which would be policy matters for the Department.</p></speech>

I congratulate the OPW and its staff there who do tremendous work.  It is a major tourism attraction and benefit to the community of east Meath and south Louth, being located on the county border.  Aisling and her team there do tremendous work.  I brought my children there at Hallowe'en and there were things in terms of children's entertainment one would not have expected the State to provide, but it was fantastic.  Hundreds of families enjoy the amenity every day during the summer.</p><p>  There was a proposal I promoted when we were in government and which the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, supported to install a playground at Oldbridge estate.  The OPW had a proposal to provide substantial funds in the range of six figures on condition that Meath County Council would also provide some money.  As far as I can tell, the local authority has always rejected any suggestion that it would offer a share of funding as the playground at Oldbridge would benefit villages in Meath that Meath County Council could not supply with playgrounds for various reasons.  It would also benefit a number of villages in Louth and Drogheda.  I am thinking of Donore, Slane and the general east Meath area.  Given that the OPW has the funds and the planning permission, would it not be better to provide a smaller playground and forget about the Meath County Council contribution?  It would provide a huge benefit to the site in terms of attracting visitors.  Children could play while parents looked at the house and visited the restaurant.  It would attract more people.  Is it possible for the OPW to do a solo run on this and to provide the playground itself?  It would be very welcome in the area.</p></speech>

I sometimes see the OPW as something of a national local authority in the sense that it provides central services for Government in local areas.  However, I suggest that it is important that local communities as represented by their local authorities participate in this.  The Office of Public Works would be providing the site and funding, but I understood that it had been agreed that the local authority would participate.  Setting up a playground involves many health and safety issues and it must be carefully done.</p></speech>

We see it as an addition to the facility, but it has a wider aspect in the context of the community.  There is a community gain and the local authority was part of that.  I would be concerned that we create expectations of joint approaches with joint responsibility rather than to have either one of us stepping back.</p></speech>

For various reasons, Meath County Council did not want to go for it.  It says it has no money whereas the OPW has a certain amount.  It is getting caught now and families are losing out.  The OPW and the site itself are losing out by not having it.  The OPW was able to spend a great deal of money recently on the walled garden, which is fabulous.</p></speech>

In terms of prioritisation, I note that while the Government has ring-fenced the funding on the flood risk management side, there has been a cut of 89% since 2008 in the capital aspect of the Vote.  All areas have to be prioritised.  On our heritage side, we look to other bodies, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, to support us in funding initiatives around the care of our estate.  It is not all from our own resources and it is an important principle in terms of the long-term sustainability of certain of the properties to look to communities as well.  When I say "communities", I am looking to local authorities in relation to the care of the estate within their areas.  We play our role as do they.  I thank the Senator.</p></speech>

The OPW is a powerful organisation which reaches into every county and a great many communities.</p> <p>The work it carries out impacts on those communities.</p><p> I wish to raise three issues.  One is flooding and the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, CFRAM, which is probably the OPW's flagship project in respect of flooding.  There is a jaundiced view in Cork, which tends to happen when an area is repeatedly flooded and there is a perception that no practical steps have been taken.  What is the position regarding Cork city flood relief measures?  There is a public consultation but when can people expect to see activity on addressing the root causes of recurring flooding in the city, given the huge adverse impact it is having on business and residential areas?  There is view about CFRAM that a great deal of money has been spent on consultants and reports but there are very few practical measures, particularly in the Cork area?  I realise that is not the case elsewhere and that there have been some works in west Cork, but perhaps Ms McGrath would give me an update on the city.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McGrath" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014121000008#H00200"><p>I will ask the director of engineering to reply to that.  With regard to what the Office of Public Works does, I am concerned about the perception that there are lots of reports and so forth.  A total of 38,000 mapped areas will emerge from the CFRAM in this regard.  It will involve the 300 areas I have mentioned, 90 of which are coastal.  In our work we take the greatest degree of care to ensure we are not adding to risk, upstream or downstream.  That involves a great deal of work.</p><p>  It is important that the committee knows what is involved in bringing a scheme forward.  There are very complex engineering and construction operations where physical works are involved.  These impact a great deal on people's lives, the built heritage and the natural environment.  They require lengthy decision-making.  When we reach the point of carrying out works, we are going in on and interfering with other people's property and we revert the property to them when we have completed the works.  That is unlike when we are carrying out construction work on a building site.  There are, therefore, long lead-in times, including lead-in consultation times.  At all times we have regard to and take account of what the public says about the schemes we are proposing.</p><p>  The aspects of the scheme contributing to the length of time include establishing the most appropriate solution, technically and economically, from the various ranges of mitigation options.  It is quite complex in the lower Lee area.  Quite correctly, there is extensive public consultation at the various stages so all those affected by it and even some who are not directly affected but who have a view on the scheme have an input to the design.  Ecological and archaeological issues invariably arise.  They must be analysed and we must provide the necessary information to ensure we get the proper statutory consent.  There is constant balancing between providing the protection from flooding on the one side and on the other side ensuring we are not doing harm ecologically, environmentally or in other places as well.  Then there are the processes and timescales for procuring.  We do not undertake the work ourselves.  We largely maintain schemes, so consultants and contractors are required.  That is done under EU procurement and there is a time period attached to it as well.</p><p>  It is a very long process given the nature of what we are doing.  I will ask my colleague, the director of engineering, to discuss the lower Lee scheme.</p></speech>

The complexity of that area is trying to get the balance between reducing the constructed flood defences in the city and using the ESB reservoirs in Carrigadrohid and Innishcarra as a storage mechanism when a flood is coming.  That requires getting the technology of that and the forecasting system right, understanding what type of flood would come down and how the dam storage can be utilised, that is, to empty it first before the flood arrives and then to store the flood, which in turn will reduce the extent of works necessary through the city and, therefore, the cost of those works.  That is ongoing with design consultants at present.  We are hoping to go to statutory exhibition in the spring.  It is a little later than we had expected, but it is driven by the timeline of the consultants in coming to a conclusion and working with the ESB and the councils in Cork.</p></speech>

Nearly every winter they might be under two or three feet of water.  A couple of years ago, the then Minister of State, Brian Hayes, approved minor flood relief works funding for the local authority in respect of the two villages.  There was resistance in the context of the CFRAM, which did not wish to facilitate anything.  The Minister of State stuck his neck out and provided for some minor works.  It involved minor river cleaning along the banks of the river and there has not been a problem in those villages - one cannot say there will not be - in the years since those works were carried out.  It is vital that we do not put all our eggs in one basket.  There are minor relief works that can be very effective and cost relatively small amounts.  I believe it did not cost more than &euro;30,000 in respect of both villages.  A house or business that is destroyed costs multiples of that amount, and there were several of them under feet of water in those villages.  What is the position with minor works funding on an annual basis and ensuring these small sums of money, which can have a significant dividend, are still available to deal with localised flooding problems outside the CFRAM framework?</p></speech>

It is not for maintenance but for schemes where there is an identifiable measure that could be put in place to alleviate risk.  It does not remove responsibility from the owner in respect of maintenance, and I would not like it to move into that area.

Regard will be given to the overall estate of the State and whether decisions can be made in regard to the register of where property in the State is sourced.  We have used that for Cork County Council and Fingal County Council, where we now have protocols and are sharing accommodation or making our property available to other public bodies or they are making their property available to us.  </p><p>  We are doing that under new protocols, involving single valuations agreed by the Valuation Office and single legal advices, in order that the procurement of assets for the State is done in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  It is something about which we are concerned.  We are an organisation which has a lot of responsibility around office accommodation.

Other public bodies also have office accommodation and through this new system we are looking to see how we can extract further value, in particular where we are leasing accommodation, and share accommodation.  </p><p>  We are going into properties which local authorities have and they may share property we have.  We are driving efficiency on the State's footprint into the future.  The protocols have been established with a view to intra-State property transactions being done as effectively as possible between public bodies in the interests of the public purse.</p></speech>

Ms McGrath referred to driving efficiency in the State's footprint.  I want to draw her attention to a specific issue, which may have been flagged with her in advance.  The OPW, in conjunction with Cork County Council, for the decentralisation programme went about the purchase of a site in Kanturk for a decentralised Government Department.  Cork County Council feels particularly aggrieved about the process.  It acted in good faith on behalf of the OPW and was hung out to dry when the Government pulled the plug on the decentralisation project.  It was left paying for lands when it had acted in good faith.  It also acted in the public interest, but was left holding a bill of &euro;166,000 which the OPW claims it is not contractually bound to repay.  Do the witnesses have any views on that?</p></speech>

The OPW, on behalf of the State, acquired a lot of land from local authorities during decentralisation for particular prices at the time.  We are holding the land and have found alternative uses for it for other public services in quite a number of locations.  Decisions were made and we are in discussions with the local authority.  Properties were acquired for decentralisation and decisions were made to suspend it, leaving entities with properties which we now have to deal with in the new environment.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the same issue as Deputy Creed, namely, the Cork city flood scheme.  It is probably a question Mr. Smyth can address.

I ask him to talk me through the steps involved in getting to the point of flood relief works taking place.</p></speech>

The design of the flood defences in the city are being developed, including the new operating environment for the reservoir, with different discharge protocols and a forecasting system that would inform the operators of the dam when they might draw it down to create storage and hold back part of the flood so that flood defences would be adequate for whatever flood comes along.  </p><p>  That will go to public statutory exhibition in the spring.  It will be open to the public to comment at that time and we will take any comments or observations.  It is a statutory process and we will determine whether what the public has to say to us will inform any changes.  The process will then move to a detailed design to prepare tender documentation for a construction contract.</p></speech>

Last September, Insurance Ireland wrote to local Deputies about the plans the OPW had put on display during the summer.  It raised quite a serious concern.  The flood relief works will be designed to prevent another flood from happening and, it is to be hoped, give enough confidence to the insurance sector for it to begin providing flood cover again for businesses and households in Cork city.  </p><p>  There are serious concerns about the plans that went on display and Insurance Ireland made it pretty clear that it was not satisfied that the standard of work put on display would be sufficient to allow flood cover to be reinstated.  Is the OPW engaging with Insurance Ireland to bring it on board, address its concerns and make sure that it is satisfied with the final design so that flood cover can be reinstated in a few years' time for people in Cork city?</p></speech>

The flood scheme in Cork is not driven by a sum of money, which it seemed to indicate in its letter.  Rather, it is driven by providing a particular standard of protection against flooding.  The budget is then developed to support that.  A cost-benefit analysis and other things have to be done, but we do not start with a sum of money and see what we can get for it.  We start with a level of protection and then determine how much that costs.  We raised the issue that it was of concern.  It is too early for it to make a call.  That can be done when it sees the scheme in spring 2015.</p></speech>

There is not a large number of demountables proposed to be installed in Cork but there may be particular areas where access to a river is required.  An example is in Mallow, where the main street has to be closed off with a demountable defence.  There is no alternative given the way the river floods into the main street in the town.  The Deputy probably knows it.</p></speech>

The funding is phased over a number of years.  Cork is obviously one of the 300 areas for further assessment that I spoke about so it would be prioritised within the CFRAM programme.  It is now being developed.  As I stated, while we are developing the CFRAM for the 300 areas, work on certain areas is already completed or in train.  They will be the first within the overall programme.  It is the case that, unless there is a change, this will be accounted for in our budgeting.</p></speech>

The insurance industry just seems to have a red flag over Cork city in respect of flood cover.  I refer also to subsidence on the south side of the city but that is a different matter.</p><p>  I wish to raise the way in which minor flood relief work programmes or projects are managed.  The delegation may revert to the committee on the detail of the case I wish to raise, which relates to a specific location, the Glen, Glenbrook, Passage West, County Cork.  I highlight it as an example because a number of houses there were very badly flooded in November 2009.  What has transpired since, five years later, can only be described as a circus.  In 2010, the OPW provided funding under the scheme of approximately &euro;100,000.  There was a small element of co-funding from the council so the total fund came to &euro;110,000.  Since 2010, a number of consultants have been appointed.  Approximately &euro;35,000 has been spent on consultancy fees but a shovel has not been lifted.  I believe there is now an agreed design in place, and the project has been costed at a sum in excess of &euro;300,000.  Since the funding committed was &euro;110,000, the council is now scratching its head over how it is to make up the shortfall.  There must be a better way of managing projects like this.  Money was being spent designing a project that was never likely to be funded.  Approximately one third of the money originally allocated is gone on consultancy costs.  There is now a more elaborate design, which was not originally anticipated, and there is no money to do the work.  The residents cannot get flood cover.  They were badly flooded and are coming to us for answers.  To be honest, we have been banging our heads against the wall for the past few years.  This is a specific example and I do not expect answers now.</p></speech>

In general, we are constantly seeking to review the minor flood works.  Therefore, if there is a matter in the area in question that we need to take on board in terms of our processing and treatment procedures, we will do so.  We constantly do random sampling of the methods used by local authorities to deal with this matter to ensure auditing of how money is being spent.  As I stated, I am anxious that local authorities have regard to the criteria of the scheme before making an application.  We set out very clearly what is involved and what needs to be done.  We expect councils to have regard to the criteria in advance of making an application and to be of the belief that the project is feasible.  It is problematic when a project turns out not to be cost beneficial.  There are steps that could be taken at local level or at the level of individual houses.  I welcome the points made by the Deputy.  We will revert to him on the specifics, on the reviewing of the actual programme and on what we are doing.</p></speech>

That all has to be part of the planning of the regeneration process.  The actual construction can happen at a different time but the thinking through of what is to happen on the island as part of the regeneration is an important dimension.

We now face the issue of optimising existing space as the bulk of our accommodation is owned but in need of considerable investment.  When it comes to density of occupation by employees, this accommodation is not good.  As I said, all Ministers and Departments are driven to increase density and use space more efficiently.  There should be a commensurate reduction in space.  We need investment to refurbish our owned estate to allow for increased density, where possible.  Departments have been very engaged in this programme.  When a lease is surrendered, it is the case that additional floor space is required - people occupy the surrendered leased space and require to be rehoused in owned estate.  We have increased density in owned estate.  I suggest the amount of floor space released is greater than the number of reductions, but we are seeking to exploit capacity in owned estate.  We are employing new working methods, using open plan spaces and increasing densities.  Occupiers are working with us in this process, although it presents challenges.</p></speech>

When rent reviews occur, even if they are upward-only rent reviews, we seek to leverage the State's covenant across a range of properties because we deal with landlords in the round.  For example, accommodation may be up for review in one area, but we may have a lease with the same landlord elsewhere; therefore, we deal with them based on the value of the State's covenant.  Renegotiation is challenging and not always successful, but it is a route we take.  I will revert to the committee on the rent roll savings attributable to renegotiation.</p></speech>

Success in the area of upward-only rent reviews has been achieved where the OPW concurrently rents a different property from the same landlord and a lease break is approaching in the case of the latter property.  In other words, given the demand for office accommodation, we look at the matter in the round.  The aim at all times is to see how we can best use the State's covenant to achieve a reduction.

This relates to the purchase of a site in Kanturk for a decentralised office and I am conscious that the advice is in respect of individuals.  I reference correspondence, dated 21 May, sent by the private secretary to the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to the then acting county manager.  It states:<blockquote><br />The Commissioners of Public Works advise me that discussions with the Council on the purchase of the site were on a &quot;Without Prejudice / Subject to Contract&quot; basis.  As the Decentralisation Programme, in the context of which the site was identified, was cancelled on foot of a Government Decision, the Commissioners have further advised me that they have no current interest in the site and no contractual liability to [Cork County] Council.....</blockquote>There is a substantial six figure sum at stake and the local authority is out of pocket.<br/>I will read correspondence, dated November 2006, from an individual in the property management section of the OPW to the estates section of Cork County Council, which opens as follows:<blockquote>Further to your recent discussions with [an individual in the OPW], we would be pleased if you could instruct the agent who is acting on your behalf to acquire the site for the Fire Station, to endeavour to acquire the adjacent lands on behalf of the Commissioners for Public Works.</blockquote>Further correspondence, dated 7 December 2007, to the then county manager in Cork states, &quot;The Commissioners are extremely anxious to advance this project in Kanturk&quot;.  In any of the correspondence, until the letter from the Minister of State's private secretary, there was no reference to the local authority acting &quot;Without Prejudice / Subject to Contract&quot;.  This has only been invoked when the local authority has looked to be reimbursed for the funds it spent while acting on behalf of the Office of Public Works.<br/>I opened my contribution by asking what were the protocols where the OPW acted in conjunction with others to acquire sites.  In a way, what we are witnessing is bullying by the OPW of another State agency and I will tell Ms McGrath why I think that is so.  Recently, there was a similar experience in Macroom where the OPW and the local authority were buying a site, by coincidence, for a fire station and where the OPW was acquiring a site for a Garda station.  Fortunately, it is now over the line and the contracts have been signed.  However, the local authority was being asked to subjugate its interest which, given its previous experience with the OPW, was quite unhappy to do in terms of protecting the funds it was putting into the project on behalf of local ratepayers, etc.  It was being asked to act in good faith and trust that the OPW would not abuse its dominant position.  It took the intervention of the Minister to ask the local authority to acquiesce.  Does Ms McGrath accept that, given its experience, the local authority was so reluctant and that what manifests in Kanturk is an abuse of the OPW's dominant position?  <br/>I dealt with some of the officials along the chain when this matter was progressing through the OPW, most of whom were extremely courteous and helpful, but I did hit a road block where a senior official in the OPW had dumped on Cork County Council officials in a manner that I found most unacceptable.</p></speech>

From the perspective of the OPW, is there a plan for a reduced scale office or does the OPW have plans to extend what was the original office?  As Ms McGrath knows, the OPW has approximately seven leases for seven properties in Portlaoise for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine alone.  In the interests of efficiency, it makes no sense to spread them around.  Every business park near the town and every new development has spare offices.  The OPW is spending approximately &euro;1.2 million annually on rent for seven properties.  Many people say that if it does not intend to go ahead with the original plan, or with a reduced size building on the original site, it should at least consolidate its position.  I will not ask Ms McGrath to go through the details here, but will she send us a note on it?</p></speech>

We have acquired from the Courts Service the adjoining Kilmainham courthouse, on which we are carrying out work in order to open up access to it.  As the Deputy knows, there is a particular difficulty in seeking access to Kilmainham Gaol because there is only one entry point.

I also welcome Ms Jenn Byrne.<br/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the recording equipment, even in silent mode.

By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>It is a very appropriate week for the delegates to be here, given that the D&aacute;il, in a Private Members' motion, is discussing the situation in Palestine and the need for the Parliament to recognise the State of Palestine.  Last night, a number of committee members contributed to the debate and other members will contribute tonight.  We would like to get an update on how the delegates believe we can move forward from here and we are delighted to have them here.</p> <p>I invite Ms Jenny Derbyshire to commence the proceedings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jenny Derbyshire" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014121000003#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us to appear before the committee.  My name is Jenny Derbyshire.  I have been an Ecumenical accompanier twice, once in Jerusalem and once in Bethlehem and have just returned from the West Bank where I had been for a week.  I was able to visit a new placement in the Jordan Valley.  I wish to introduce Mr. Patrick Costello, who will speak after me, Ms Hilary Minch, and Ms Jen Byrne who has visited the West Bank earlier in the year.  We have all been ecumenical accompaniers and have all been there this year.</p><p>  As the committee may be aware, the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, EAPPI, is essentially a human rights observer programme established ten years ago by the World Council of Churches.  Observers are recruited from various countries around the world and live and work at seven locations across the West Bank.  We used to be in Gaza but since the blockade of the Gaza Strip that has become impossible so that we are no longer in Gaza.  We were there for between three and four and a half months.  Observers are recruited from the UK and Ireland by Quaker Peace and Social Witness in London.  We are all volunteers.  My role is that of volunteer advocacy co-ordinator.  Previously the position was held by Mr. Joe O'Brien.  To date 30 Irish people have served in the field for EAPPI.  The committee will probably realise when it hears us today that overall, the position is getting worse in the West Bank but I think that will reveal itself.</p><p>  Our role as EAPPI observers includes offering protection through non-violent presence, monitoring and reporting violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, supporting acts of non-violent resistance alongside local Palestinian and Israeli activists.  That we work with Israeli activists as well as Palestinian is important in terms of the strength of the programme.  We also engage in advocacy to bring about the end of the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  Our advocacy is also part of our protective presence, particularly for the Israeli peace groups.  Our core principles are guided by international law and human rights.  I shall hand over to Mr. Patrick Costello. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Costello" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014121000003#B00300"><p>I have recently returned from the EAPPI placement in Bethlehem where I lived and worked for three months.  There are a variety of chores which include supporting Palestinian children with access to education, observing the situation at  checkpoint 300 in Bethlehem which is one of the largest in the West Bank.  One of the main chores is working across the Bethlehem Governorate supporting the local villages.  Two of the most pressing issues which are inter-related with these villages are the actions of the Israeli Government in terms of settlement building and the actions of the settlers themselves.  I shall speak about those two issues which are inter-related but I will split them into Government actions and the settler actions.<br/>Bethlehem is about 5 km from Jerusalem and is cut off entirely from Jerusalem by the illegal separation barrier that runs across the north of Jerusalem and down to the east around Beit Jala so that it is sandwiched and is open only to the south and to the east.  During my time in Bethlehem the Israeli Government announced the confiscation of 4,000 dunams of Palestinian land.  This was described by the Israeli NGO, Peace Now, as the largest land confiscation in over 30 years.  The land would come from the areas surrounding five Palestinian villages, Al Jab&lsquo;a, Surif, Wadi Fukin, Husan and Nahalin, all of which we worked in and had close contacts.  When this was announced we reached to these villages to find out what was happening on the ground.  We called our local contact, Nasser El Din in Al Jab&rsquo;a who was incredulous.  He said this could not be happening here as they have already taken all our land.  We arranged to meet him the next day or the following day and he admitted that it was happening, that they were taking their land.  They had already taken so much of the farm land in the village but they were coming back for what was left.  He was heartbroken.  He said, &quot;We struggle to save money for years to buy one dunam of land and they come and take 4,000 in the blink of an eye&quot;.  All of this land is lost.  It will soon be surrounded by state land which will eventually become a new settlement.  These confiscations have been accompanied by road closures, closing the road that connects the village to its neighbouring village Surif.  Road blocks were being put on them in the name of security cutting Palestinian freedom of movement. <br/>One of the other villages badly affected was Wadi Fukin in the north of the Bethlehem Governorate which is already squeezed between the Green Line and the Settlement of Beitar Illit.  The Settlement of Beitar Illit rises above it, similar to Benbulben, as a giant hill with about 45,000 settlers living in it compared to a population of 1,300 in the village of Wade Fukin.  The head of the village council, whom we met on numerous occasions, Ahmed Sukkar, explained that most of the land being confiscated was land further down the valley that was the village farm land.  This village, like most Palestinian villages, has huge levels of unemployment and relies on agriculture and selling the produce grown in the fields.  Some 70% of the village&rsquo;s economy is based on selling what is grown on the farm land, land that will soon be lost.  This will utterly devastate the village.  Given its position, squeezed between the Green Line and the Settlement, Ahmed Sukkar described it as similar to living in a giant prison.<br/>It is important to realise that the confiscation of the 4,000 dunams comes on the back of the confiscation of 1,000 dunams in the region in April.  Between the two of these and lands previously taken, such as the lands Nasser El Din mentioned, there is a huge contiguous piece of land that stretches from Beitar Illit to Gvaot right down to Kfar Etzion which was one of the first settlements built in the region in 1967.  The president of the Gush Etzion Council was very positive about what was happening.  Gush Etzion is the settler council and essentially he is the settler mayor in the area.  He described with great joy in the Israeli press how Gvaot was going to be a new city for the settlers in the Gush Etzion area.  With the confiscation there was constant expansion of the settlements.  Beitar Illit was building a new hill to continue its growth.  A flat settlement was growing constantly while we were there.  There was never any type of settlement for these whatsoever. <br/>The Jerusalem municipality announced the building of 2,500 homes in Givat Hamatos<b></b>which is just inside the Green Line but north of Bethlehem, so it is in the area where land is already lost on the other side of the wall.  In the past few days before the Government was dissolved before the election, the finance committee diverted huge moneys into settlement buildings away from other services such as education and quickly dissolved parliament so that nobody could do anything about it.<br/>It is important to remember that these settlements are illegal under the Geneva Convention.  Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states clearly that &quot;The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.&quot;  This expansion, coupled with the land confiscations undermines the ability of these villages to survive, pushing Palestinians off the land, which is also illegal under Article 49.  The continued growth of settlements is not just a threat to the two state solution but is also an ongoing war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  Ireland as a signatory of the Geneva Convention has a responsibility to act on war crimes.  That was the Government action.  We then had action by the individual settlers and the individual settler communities.</p> <p> One of the obvious aspects is the growth of illegal outposts.  These outposts are rudimentary settlements built by settlers.  They are illegal under Israeli law as well as international law, but little is done to dismantle them.  They can start as a tent or a trailer and slowly grow from there until there is a full settlement with buildings growing and taking over more of the land.  The outpost covers more than just the footprint of the tent or caravan because they would set up a security exclusion zone around it.  So they are very significant in taking over land.</p><p> One of the most significant of these outposts is Khallet Annahla, which is just south of the main municipal area of Bethlehem.  This piece of land was under court dispute and instead of waiting for the court decision, settlers went and built a tent on land that was privately owned by a Palestinian farmer.  This action was condemned by the courts.  Things they had done, including opening a new road, were declared illegal.  Still it was not dismantled by the army or police.  There are no attempts to move it on.  Khallet Annahla is very important because if a settlement is built there it starts to cut off Bethlehem from the south.  Bethlehem is cut off from the north and the west.  Khallet Annahla and linking through to Tekoa provides a block at the bottom to block it off from the south.</p><p> To the east of Bethlehem there is a former Israeli military base.  When the Israeli army left in 2006 the Palestinian Authority tried to acquire it to turn it into a hospital.  It has been taken over by a group called "the women for Israel's tomorrow" also known, as the women in green.  They are attempting to establish a presence here calling the development "Shdema".  Their website refers to the importance of Shdema as providing a contiguous path from Jerusalem to Har Homa, a large settlement in east Jerusalem just north of Bethlehem, into Shdema and down to Tekoa and Nokdim, which are slightly further south.  They emphasise that it is important to create a unified presence of the settlements which would cut off Bethlehem to the east.  </p><p> Around the Gush Etzion area, villages such as Wadi Fukinare are essentially surrounded by settlements.  This is repeated across the West Bank in places such as Yanoun, but this is now Bethlehem that will be surrounded, cut off and choked.  Bethlehem is one of the largest and most ancient of the Palestinian cities.  It has always been a significant Palestinian city and will now be at serious risk of being surrounded by settlers and choked from any further growth or development.  This is a significant deterioration and undermines any sort of two-state solution.  If we believe a two-state solution is fair and want to work towards it, the settlement building will totally destroy it.</p><p> Alongside this are the violence and harassment we have witnessed from the settler community.  As the settlements grow so do the violence and harassment from the settlers and the army.  Article 27 of the 4th Geneva convention states that an occupying power has a responsibility to protect against threats and acts of violence towards civilians and their property.  I have witnessed the failure to protect Palestinians from settler violence which constitutes a breach of Article 27 and this will be further exacerbated by the increased settlement expansion.  There are clear violations of international law throughout the area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilary Minch" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014121000004#C00200"><p>Little of what the members will hear today will be news to them.  They are all well informed and many of them have travelled to Palestine and Israel in recent years and months.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has recently returned from Yanoun.  They will have heard testimony from witnesses, including Palestinian civil society, Israeli human rights groups, politicians and church leaders.</p><p>  In September I travelled back to the little village of Yanoun in the north of the West Bank, near Nablus where I had served for five months in 2011.  When we previously appeared before the committee in September 2012, my colleague Emmet Sheerin presented the story of Yanoun.  I love to speak about Yanoun because it is such a special place.  It is a tiny village; it is the smallest surviving village in Palestine.  It is at the end of a beautiful valley filled with flowers.  It could be such a special place.  It is surrounded on three sides by the settlement of Itamar and its associated outposts.  In 2002 all the villagers of Yanoun were forcibly displaced after a long campaign of violence.  People were shot.  Animals were killed.  There was vandalism.  They were all forced to flee the village.</p><p>  The people of Yanoun are very resilient and were determined to go back to their village.  They were able to return with the support of international and, importantly, Israeli human rights activists who provide a protective presence.  There is now a house in Yanoun where EAPPI has a permanent base.  We will stay there for as long as is needed.  I wish we could leave next week but we will stay for as long as we are needed.</p><p>  The main problem facing Yanoun is that the villagers have lost most of their land due to the settlements.  According to Rashed Murrad, mayor of Yanoun, before the establishment of the settlements, the villagers had nothing to be scared of, but now they live in constant threat of violence and forced displacement.</p><p>  Since 2003, the EAPPI programme has had a permanent presence in Yanoun.  During my five months in Yanoun I witnessed almost on a daily basis violence from the settlers, the pollution of the well where people got their drinking water, the Israeli army entering in the middle of the night with sound bombs, aggression, vandalism, but most of all the loss of the land.  The farmers with their sheep and goats cannot even go to graze their animals or pick their olives.</p><p>  In recent years it has become a little quieter in Yanoun.  There is slightly less violence than previously, but unfortunately other villages in the region are experiencing much worse violence and levels of attacks.  The important thing to say about the violence by the settlers is that it is often accompanied by the Israeli army.  Settlers and the army work very closely together to intimidate and threaten the Palestinians on their land.</p><p>  Our presence and the presence of Israeli human rights observers provide some breathing space but it is not a solution.  The only solution for Yanoun, the other villages and Palestine as a whole is the implementation of international law which would result in an end to the occupation and the dismantling of the illegal settlements.  Only then could everyone begin to live normal lives.</p><p>  Every year, when I return to visit Yanoun, I drink the lovely sweet Palestinian tea with the women, eat delicious bread and cheese and watch the children growing up.  Palestinians have said to me repeatedly, "What can we do?"  There is an awful sense of hopelessness.  People are devastated after the summer attacks on Gaza.  It is up to us as EAs, as civilians and as parliamentarians to do the best we can to ensure that international law is upheld.</p><p>  We have two main requests today.  I will deal with the first one and Ms Derbyshire will deal with the second one.  We urge the Government to unconditionally and immediately recognise a Palestinian state.  We have heard indications that the Government will not oppose the motion being debated tonight, which is superb news.  We also ask members to go a step further and speak on behalf of the committee that the Government should recognise Palestine and also write to the Minister in that regard.</p><p>  I have a few points about the recognition, if I may-----</p></speech>

Ms Minch might come back to it because some of the questions will probably relate to what she wants to talk about.</p><p>  I believe Ms Derbyshire has a second point.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and I shall let her contribute a few times if she asks questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014121000005#D00300"><p>I know the work of the ecumenical programme because the first time I travelled to the West Bank it was organised by Ms Minch and I was accompanied by a member of the programme in Jerusalem.  Then we visited Bethlehem where we saw the checkpoint and the work done by the programme.  Next we went to Yanoun which was the most amazing place.  On the way there we visited a school and one in Yanoun where the ecumenical programme has a presence.  In Yanoun we also had the most amazing lunch with a gentleman farmer who was the mayor at that stage.  It is a great testament to those people and to the programme that such places still exist.</p><p>  The organisation monitors and reports human rights abuses.  What happens then?  The delegation is here to talk to us but there is a frustration among Palestinian people and Israeli people at what is going on.  The legal process takes so long.  The case appears to be cast iron but there is no guarantee it will get anywhere.</p><p>  I am particularly interested in the Bedouin in the Jordan Valley and their situation, in particular.  There is a major waiting list of people wanting to join the programme.  A lot of people in Ireland are interested in this matter.  I wish to draw attention to the amazing work being done by the organisation such as in youth groups like in Arroed camp, theatres in Jenin and Hebron, and the heritage groups in Berzit.  The Palestinian Authority could do.  I am not sure if the delegation can comment on the matter but I would like to hear their views.</p></speech>

We prepare reports, bear witness and  go to the European Parliament.  There are human rights organisations that are better placed than us to do some of the long-term legal work.</p><p>  The Deputy asked what else can be done so I shall outline the big thing to do.  Unfortunately, as we have seen, Israel will not act without external pressure being applied.  Therefore, we should still pursue all the legal and human rights angles that we can but, in as friendly a way as possible, bring pressure to bear on the government of Israel that it must act and end occupation.  One of the things we can do relates to the banning of settlement good.  We could make a decision not to trade will illegal settlements.  Two key ways to put pressure on Israel is to recognise Palestine as a state and to balance things slightly for negotiations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jenn Byrne" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014121000005#D00500"><p>I shall speak a little about the Bedouin as the Deputy has said she was particularly interested in hearing about them.  Over the past couple of years Israel has announced plans to forcibly transfer 12,500 Bedouin from areas around the E1 area of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley to three settlements around the valley which represents a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions.  Under the Geneva Conventions a grave breach is separate from a normal breach, not that one can ever have a normal breach of international humanitarian law.  States who are party to the Geneva Conventions are obliged to take action to pursue the offenders who have permitted, ordered or orchestrated a grave breach and to try them in national courts.  That provision ties member states to taking action.</p><p>  The Bedouin lead very difficult lives because over 80% of its population do not have access to water or electricity and over 50% are children.  As the committee is probably aware, the Palestinian population is quite young but the percentage is even greater among the Bedouin population.  When I worked in the region I was based in the northwest of the West Bank and I visited, along with the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, two Bedouin communities.  One community was based close to a Palestinian village and had illegal water and electricity hook-ups but the other one could not access same.  Our contact in the region told us that it is not that these communities did not have the money; it is that they cannot use it to develop themselves.  In other words, any time they built anything it was demolished.  </p><p>  I was in the region as part of a medical relief society and our job was to provide basic medicines and diabetes medication.  In these regions the Bedouin population must live cheek by jowl with their animals because they cannot build proper buildings to house their animals.  One of the towns, Arab al-Abideen, is situated on a hill and effluent from the animals runs along homes so many people suffer from respiratory illnesses as a result.  The town is in the shadow of Alfei Menashe which is one of the largest settlements of the Kedumim finger settlement blocs.  The Bedouin can develop but their efforts are inhibited from doing so.  </p></speech>

I have a question regarding the debate taking place in the House during Private Members' time in which, apparently, there is unanimous willingness to assist in a positive way and to try to put international pressure on the various combatants, for want of a better description, and various positions.  To what extent does the delegation think that Ireland, as part of the global community, can be a positive influence on the Israelis, Hamas, Fatah and the Palestinian Authority with a view to establishing a forum?  Is it possible, at this forum, for these organisations to begin to air their grievances, re-establish the peace process and reach an understanding which is fundamental to anything that happens in the region, of each other's willingness to allow the other to exist?</p></speech>

Therefore, we need to look at settlement building and to recognise the Palestinian State.  Also, if one looks at our experience in Northern Ireland, we need an honest broker to work between them.  The European Union, Ireland or another country like Brazil that does not have skin in the game and is neutral could provide proper mediation.  Those are the kinds of things that we as a nation and the Government can ask and push for at European and UN levels and internationally.  They are the sorts of things that we need to do to get both sides together.</p></speech>

Therefore, I wonder if it is possible or feasible to achieve a settlement.</p><p>  In terms of the potential for a two-state solution, one will discover when one visits the area that there are three or four states so I am not sure there will be success.  That question has been raised during debates in the House and I have raised it before.  I have looked at the situation on the ground and have two questions. Is it feasible to continue pursuing the line that the international community has pursued?  How effective is such a policy?  To my mind, it is not an effective solution.  To what extent has either side moved towards to accommodate each other?  Are they willing to accept an international forum to deal with the situation?  Are all sides willing to accept such a forum?</p><p>  On one of my visits to the region it was suggested to me that we could create a tunnel between Gaza and the West Bank, Hebron or whatever.  That is one of the suggestions put forward and I am not sure it is based on reality.  It made me wonder how feasible some of the proposals have been.    </p><p>  Finally, a President of Egypt and Prime Minister of Israel were assassinated following their efforts to bring about a settlement.  They were virtually isolated by their own people who did not go along with their proposals.</p> <p>How does the international community exert sufficient influence to convince the opposing parties to recognise that it cannot go on forever - or can it go on forever?  We have had a recent meeting with representatives from that area who appeared to suggest that, from an Israeli point of view, they intended to hold fast forever if necessary.  I do not think that is feasible.  Nor it is feasible to expect that any kind of arrangement can be reached that will accommodate all parties or any party if that contingency position is adopted by anyone.</p></speech>

We are talking about people who have been living under military occupation and have had their homeland taken.  We are talking about the Palestinian refugees.  It is not two equal sides, and in 1988 the Palestinians declared a state on just 22% of what was historic Palestine.  This huge historic compromise was made before the Oslo accords.  There has been a solution available since then but no negotiations have worked because, as Councillor Costello mentioned, there has been no proper pressure brought to bear on Israel.  There have been no sanctions.  UN Security Council resolutions and the UN Charter have all been breached and in our capacity as EAPPI we----</p></speech>

The recognition of a State of Palestine will not change things on the ground but it does help in the negotiations between Israel and Palestine, and that is why it is so important.  Whatever the final outcome is, one, two or three states, at least we are recognising that the Palestinian State in whatever form it takes has a right to exist.</p></speech>

They are very brave people.  I think I may have met some of their people in Columbia also in very poor conditions.  I congratulate them on their Christian enthusiasm.</p><p>  As a Christian organisation, could the witnesses offer us an opinion as to whether the Christian population is in decline in this important religious region of the Middle East?  Why might that be?  </p><p>  I think Ms Derbyshire may have said that things are getting worse in the West Bank, which is controlled by Fatah.  Let us say Fatah is gone and Hamas is gone and we are left with the Palestinian Authority.  While I will be voting in support of Ireland recognising a Palestinian State, I would like to ask whether the witnesses believe the Palestinians in the new authority are unified sufficiently to be able to run a state?</p><p>  The witnesses speak in terms of settlers, or do they speak in terms of religious settlers?  Who are they?  Are they people moving to better accommodation from the existing Jewish Israeli population or are they settlers being brought in from Ethiopia, Russia, Lithuania, Moldova or wherever?</p><p>  It contributes to my frustration when we are looking for this honest broker - Councillor Costello mentioned countries like Brazil - that in the real world surely it has got to be accepted that the power brokers are America and Germany.  Much as we would like to fly a flag on behalf of the Palestinians by granting recognition of their state, is it at this point a viable state run by a government of the Palestinian Authority?</p></speech>

I will address the one on the Christian population because I have just been at a conference in Bethlehem organised by the Palestinian Christians.  Yes, they are shrinking, and one reason they give is that they generally have more connection with the outside world and more opportunities to leave.  Palestine is under huge pressure economically as well as politically and the people who have the option to leave tend to be the ones who are leaving.  They express solidarity with their Muslim brothers and sisters all the time and regard themselves as all Palestinians working together.  That is the message I am bringing from them.</p><p>  On the Palestinian Authority, people always disagree with their governments.  The Palestinian Authority needs to be given the opportunity to govern and at the moment they are not being given that.  If we recognise the State of Palestine there will be some movement forward.  </p></speech>

He was wondering where they come from and who they are.  I will give him a figure first.  The numbers range from a UN estimate of 550,000 to an estimate by Peace Now, an Israeli organisation, of 650,000 settlers between east Jerusalem and the West Bank.  They are made up of both ideological and economic settlers.  The ideological settlers believe the West Bank and all of the greater area belong to the Israeli Jewish population as a mandate from God.  The economic settlers, who also make up a large number, move there because there is currently a housing crisis in Israel and they receive economic incentives from the Israeli Government to move.  That cannot be discounted.  Whatever their make-up, the settlements are illegal under international law.</p> <p>Outside of this there are more than 100 settlements that are recognised by Israel and more than 50 outposts.  Outposts tend to be havens for the more radical ideological settler and some of them comprise a caravan here or there, while others have populations of several thousand and these are the ones that orchestrate the majority of the settler attacks and violence against the Palestinian population.</p></speech>

The Christian population of Palestine has declined dramatically and the main reason Christians give in research for the decline is the occupation.  They are being driven from The Holy Land, from Palestine because of the economic impact of the occupation.</p><p>  In relation to the situation on the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority and, in some ways, Hamas-Fatah are not so relevant because the whole of the West Bank and Gaza are under military occupation.  A certain amount of administration work is done by the Palestinian Authority and the different parties, but Israel has absolute control over the land, the sea, the air, over who comes in and goes out, over taxes and trade.  The level of administration work that can be done is very limited.  The Deputy asked whether the Palestinian Authority was ready to govern, but we should it a chance.  The World Bank published a very interesting report in which it talked about the different elements of governance that needed to be in place for a state to be run.  It is in no doubt that these elements are in place such that Palestine could be run as a state.</p></speech>

It is up to the people of Palestine to elect who they want to have in government.  In 2006 there were elections on the West Bank and in Gaza and more than 55% of the population voted for Hamas.  Whatever personal feelings people have about Hamas and the kind of party it is, it was democratically elected and universally boycotted by the rest of the world.  It is not up to us to interfere in internal Palestinian politics as to who should rule; that is for the Palestinian people to decide.  They should have their own free and fair elections.</p></speech>

I am sorry that I missed the presentation.  </p><p>  On the honest broker about whom Councillor Patrick Costello spoke, the European Union has been a generous donor in the rebuilding of Gaza on a number of occasions.  Does Ms Minch sense a willingness on the part of the European Union from her interaction with the Commission to move on and be as forthcoming on the political side?  A number of weeks ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, told us he believed the European Union had to take a more proactive role in the Middle East peace process.  Has there been any indication from the new High Commissioner and the External Action Service that they will take a more proactive approach?</p><p>  With regard to the ban on settlement products, am I correct that only a small number of countries, perhaps northern European countries, have a ban on such products?  Is there any indication that the European Union has a regulatory framework in place for a ban on such products should it decide to activate it?  I remember that number of years ago the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and the former US President, Mr. Jimmy Carter, at an event in the capital city spoke about the need to have in place a realistic ban on products from the settlements.</p><p>  In view of the massive expansion of settlements that has taken place - one of the largest acquisitions of territory took place on 1 September or 1 October last - how viable is a two state solution based on the 1967 borders?</p></speech>

I have been working in the area where 4,000 dunums of land were seized.  It has not yet been build on.  If there is sufficient action and external pressure, no settlements will be built on it.  We need to act - strongly and quickly - in order that there will be no settlement building and to maintain a viable Palestinian state.  One of the problems is that Bethlehem can be choked.  Any chance of peace can be choked.  That is why the issues of recognition and settlement need to be acted on quickly.  There is still hope, but time is running out.</p></speech>

None of the international or EU aid promised to Gaza has made any difference on the ground.  That is because Israel decides who and what comes in and out Gaza.  All of the money available means nothing if Gaza is under siege.  I do not know what is happening at EU level, but Ireland must do as much as it can to persuade its EU partners to introduce a ban on settlement goods.  It can look at the existing mechanisms and the EU-Israel association agreement which gives Israel and other non-European countries tariff free access to the European Union.  Article 1 of the agreement talks about the human rights obligations of all parties and if these obligations are being breached, there is a mechanism for cancelling or changing the agreement.  I do not think we have to look for new things to do, but we need to use the mechanisms we have available to create a sense of urgency and the will to do something.  As Deputy Bernard J. Durkan said, after 65 years the situation is getting worse and we have an obligation and a duty to do the best we can.</p></speech>

To Ms Minch's knowledge, when the European Union, on behalf of its 500 million citizens, makes a pledge to provide much needed funding to relieve the desperate plight of so many innocent people, is there any interaction between it and Israel to try to remove the blockages in order that pledged money can be drawn down to build facilities and homes for the Palestinian people?</p></speech>

A parliamentary question at EU level was asked about the funding provided.  During that period &euro;49 million worth of EU funded and member state projects were destroyed.  A question was raised whether member states and the European Union could claim back some of the money from Israel.  A motion to claim it was put to a vote, but the vote went against it.  There is no will at EU level to ask for reparations to cover the cost of the destroyed EU funded projects.  That lack of will extends to removing barriers to EU aid.  When one walks around the West Bank - I have been on the West Bank and in Gaza - one sees signs everywhere on US Aid, EU and EU member state funded structures, but that does not mean they are safe.  Water towers donated by the Swedish Government were demolished.</p> <p>We can talk about this, but the political will is not there.  I believe this has to come at a member state level and not an EU level, because there are big players such as Germany which will vote against it.</p></speech>

The military aid, because it is tied to US companies, is essentially a $3 billion subsidy for American companies.  There are too many vested interests associated with the Americans because of that subsidy and because of those $3 billion worth of connections.</p></speech>

Boycott, divestment and sanctions are recognised as legitimate forms of protest.  If America was serious, it would be looking at boycott, divestment and sanctions, the most significant of which is its $3 billion worth of aid.  Throughout its time in negotiating, this has never been reduced or even threatened to be reduced.  Coming back to Deputy Durkan's earlier point, Bill Clinton may have used moral pressure, but until this gets backed up with action, there is no pressure.  It is the same with us.  We can sit here and talk, but until it gets backed up with action, there is no pressure.</p></speech>

He put a huge effort into bringing the sides together and into establishing a platform for a peace process, and I say "a platform".  He was very disappointed and clearly indicated so.  The possibility of American aid in the form Mr. Costello is talking about being brought to a halt is fairly slim in the circumstances.  I do not think that is going to happen in the short term.  What other means can be found?  Given the Americans have the goodwill, and the moral support they give, to bring about the setting up of a platform again for peace discussions, what else is there?  The Oslo Accords do not seem to be working.  There has been no great progress in any direction.  Since I was a small lad, and that is not today or yesterday, the situation is the same.  How can we achieve progress?</p></speech>

She was looking at a picture I had.  Her answer was: "Could they just not stop taking the homes?"  Essentially, she was asking could they just not end the occupation.  There is a solution available.  Israel needs to end its occupation of Palestine.  If it is not going to do this willingly, which clearly it is not, we, the Irish people and the Government, and the EU have so many things we can do to put pressure on Israel.  There is the EU-Israel association agreement, and the banning of settlement goods at the very least.  At UN level, the UN Security Council should have acted, and it will not, for reasons we understand.  I agree there is no peace process.  The longer the talks go on, the more land Israel appropriates and the worse the situation becomes for Palestine.  It is a horrendous situation.  I do not want us to be back here in two years time, still talking about the empty peace process and the lack of freedom and human rights for Palestinians.  There are so many mechanisms at our disposal and we should be using them, talking to our MEPs and talking to the other governments in Europe.  We should also be acting unilaterally on the settlement goods and the recognition of Palestine.</p></speech>

Whether we like them or not, they should be able to represent their own people.  This is key.</p></speech>

Whether it is recognising Israel as a Jewish state or a non-Jewish state is not really the point.  It recognises the state of Palestine as being on that 22%.  That is recognising Israel on the remainder of the land.  If we talk about different political parties and the parties in Israel, the Likud charter refuses to recognise a Palestinian state.  It refuses to recognise any land west of the Jordan River as being Palestinian.  The same could be argued for the Likud Party of which President Netanyahu is in charge.  I do not think it is all that helpful to get into what the different political parties-----</p></speech>

This has been a policy we have pursued, that all peace attempts have pursued and it has got nowhere.  In the past six months, things have deteriorated to the point where people are saying maybe it is not viable.  Mr. Costello was talking about the chain, the wall and the settlements.  Never mind politically, physically is a two-state solution viable?  The Chairman was saying that Hamas will not recognise Israel as a state.  The reality is that Israel is already a state.  The very fact that one aspires to a two-state solution is a recognition of this.  Therefore, that is a dubious justification for not coming to the peace table at all.  Irish and EU policy is shifting.  They are now looking at recognising the state, or at least using it as leverage to try to bring Israel to the table.  Is that a good idea?  If we declare a recognition of Palestine, do the witnesses think that this precludes looking at other options if the two-state solution is no longer viable?  Should we be looking at power sharing?  Would we put the frighteners on Israel to come to the table with other possibilities?</p></speech>

She is right on the issue of the viability of a one-state or two-state solution.  However, it is important to remember that the recognition of Palestine as a state based on the 22% of the land is the right thing to do, but it strengthens the hand of the Palestinians for negotiations.  It does not dictate what the final outcomes should be.</p> <p>Many of the Palestinians and Israelis I have spoken to in recent months and over the years have mixed feelings at to whether they want to live in one state or two states.  In some ways, it does not matter because what they want is equality and human rights in whatever state they are living in.  Tonight's vote is not saying that this is going to be the final state of Palestine and that is Israel.  That has yet to be decided.  The important thing is for people to live with equality and human rights in whatever state.</p></speech>

If our Government recognises the state of Palestine, will it matter one iota seeing that so little progress has made over the past 60 years, as has been referred to?  My question, which was partially answered earlier, related to humanitarian aid and the rebuilding of all the buildings that were destroyed.  Is there any significant move that can be made by the EU to ensure that the pledged aid that the various member states have indicated that they are prepared to provide can start to filter through, start the rebuilding process and begin to restore some sort of normality for the people who are suffering most and who are living in appalling conditions?</p><p>  I have not visited Palestine so I do not quite know the extent of the settlement goods but could the witnesses quantify the economic value of the settlement goods?  What would it mean or how big a hit would the producers of settlements goods take if there was a ban on settlement goods?</p></speech>

The Israeli government estimates that the value of EU imports from settlements at around &euro;230 million per year compared to &euro;15 million from Palestinians so it is very significant.  It would also be politically significant in terms of Ireland or Europe saying that it will not give support to the settlement project.</p></speech>

Senator Mullins asked what state recognition would mean.  This applies to Deputy Mitchell's question as well.  On a Palestinian citizen level, it would mean hope.  The fact is that settlement expansion and violence are whittling away at the hope of the Palestinian population and this is leading to a rise in tensions.  We have not had an intifada in over a decade and I am getting worried.  I know that older members of the population remember the harshness of the second intifada quite well and are afraid of a third one.  I know that what we need to give the Palestinian population to relieve tensions is hope.  I believe that state recognition is our way of giving them hope.  I can tell the committee that after Sweden recognised Palestine recently, there was an upsurge in morale that was observed by EAPPI volunteers.  It is something that Ireland could definitely do to make the situation on the ground better for the Palestinian population.</p></speech>

A few weeks ago in the West Bank, I was very struck by the number of Palestinian people who have moved away from the two-state solution and who talk about a one-state solution.  Part of it is their loss of faith in the Palestinian Authority.  Part of that is also because no elections have been held.  That is not doing the Palestinian people any good.  They need hope from their own politicians as well as politicians outside Palestine.</p></speech>

It is questionable because I pose to her the following question.  What difference would it have made?  Today, we, hopefully, have the merging of Fatah with Hamas and one now has the Palestinian Authority.  Hamas will not release its authority at a governmental level to the Palestinian Authority.  There are terrible tensions here.  Let us call a spade a spade.  It is important for the Palestinians that we give this moral support tonight.  However, would the witnesses not agree that if every country theoretically looked at a map and said that they recognised that state, without a government that is resourced and capable of running it, we would be putting the cart before the house?  Surely we should be resourcing the Palestinian Authority, which is the representative body of the three different zones?  If we do not have a government that is capable of running the place, should we not put our resources in the direction of empowering and resourcing it and having it consolidate with a view to being internationally recognised as a potential or actual government of a state that all the countries in the world have recognised?</p></speech>

If the Deputy thinks it has not happened, does he think it will happen with a continued occupation and that we can resource a government that does not have the ability to govern?  Outside Area "A", the Palestinian Authority lacks any authority and then has only limited authority.  During Operation Brother's Keeper, the Israeli military entered Area "A" and performed military activities and arrested people in Palestinian cities that were supposed to be under Palestinian Authority control.  No matter how much we try to build capacity to make a government that can govern accurately, widely and effectively, we need to make sure it is happening in a place where it could utilise its capacity to govern.  At the moment, the occupation inhibits that.  No matter how much one builds up the Palestinian Authority, it cannot govern under occupation.  That is as clearly as I can put it.</p></speech>

We must be clear about what is happening.  It is the Parliament, more than likely, which will recognise the state of Palestine.  The Government has said that it will recognise the state of Palestine when the time is right.  Could Ms Minch tell me whether it is case of "damned if you do and damned if you don't" in respect of recognising or not recognising the state of Palestine?  I am talking about every country.  Is there a danger that recognising the state of Palestine could lead to more violence on the ground as we have seen in the past and a failed state?  If we do not recognise it, are we not letting down the people of Palestine in respect of their entitlement to statehood?  Are we caught between two stools?</p></speech>

We went there last year.  First of all, I went to Gaza and Israel with the then leader of the Opposition, An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and Deputies Billy Timmins and Alan Shatter.  The committee has gone on a number of occasions.  We went last year to the refugee camps in Jordan.  We think Jordan has an important role to play in the peace process.  It is a very poor country and is affected by what is happening in the Middle East.  We also met the chief negotiator for the Palestinians, the Palestinian foreign minister and some senior politicians in the Knesset in Israel.  There was no foreign minister in place in Israel at the time so we did not get an opportunity to meet them.  My question relates to the future.  If this thing was simple to solve, it would have been solved many years ago.</p></speech>

As Ms Minch in particular has said, the issue is inequality.  We have recognised the state of Israel so we should recognise the state of Palestine.  It is then to some extent up to them to move on from there.</p><p>  There were two points in respect of the Palestinian Authority.  The Israeli group, Breaking the Silence, met the committee in the summer.  Am I correct?  </p> <p>I was once on a tour given by Breaking the Silence, and the ex-soldier leading the tour stated he felt the Palestinian Authority is not given enough credence for what it is doing to hold the line with regard to non-violence.  It has managed to keep a lid on a very difficult situation and he felt it should at least be given recognition for this.  It has also established institutions.  I know there is much wrong, but it has made great progress.  There has been a loss of faith in it.  When I was there I heard more people speak about a one-state solution, but what undermines this is the declaration of a Jewish state and what is going through the Knesset at present which has led to the downfall of the government.  Recognition of the state of Palestine is important in terms of equality and for it to move forward from there.</p></speech>

Who are we to deny someone else's right to self-determination?  A very important point to remember is this is what Palestinians are asking for.  They are also asking for their freedom and an end to the occupation.  In a statement the Palestinian Christian leaders said:<blockquote><br />send our urgent message to the whole world and particularly to Europe: We are yearning for justice and peace.  Recognizing Palestine and defining Israel&rsquo;s borders is a first step towards that goal....We believe that recognizing the State of Palestine on the 1967 border is the first step towards changing the current status quo.  Banning settlement products and divesting from companies and organizations linked directly or indirectly to the Israeli occupation is also a must.  66 years after the beginning of the Palestinian Nakba and 47 years after the occupation, it is time for the State of Palestine to be free and become a full member of the United Nations.  That is why we call upon European governments to fully endorse the just Palestinian quest for freedom and independence.</blockquote></p></speech>

A ban will not be effective unless every country in the European Union makes it effective, and this will not happen.  Europe is very divided with regard to the Middle East and the foreign ministers will tell one this.  The gesture is more symbolically than economically effective.  I do not want to mention particular countries, but countries such as Germany will not ban settlement goods.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Ann Ferris and Senator Mulcahy.  As this meeting is being broadcast live, I would ask those present to switch off their mobile phones or put them on aeroplane mode so that they will not interfere with the broadcasting systems here.<br/>Deputy John Paul Phelan has been discharged from this committee and Deputy Fergus O'Dowd is his replacement.  I want to put on record, as I am sure the members will agree, our thanks to Deputy Phelan for his service to the committee and I welcome Deputy O'Dowd to the committee.<br/>The purpose of the meeting this morning is to engage with a number of those who have made a written submission on the issue of gangland crime.  This is the start of work we are doing on this.  Deputy Finian McGrath has agreed to act as rapporteur on this issue and the briefing has been circulated.<br/>I welcome Ms Patricia Flynn from the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development, ACJRD, Ms Suzanne Vella, Mr. Gerry McNally and Mr. Mark Wilson from the Probation Service, Ms Anna Quigley from the Citywide Drugs Crisis Campaign, and Mr. Dermot Gough and Ms Marian McKenna from the Dublin North East Drugs Task Force.  I thank them for giving of their time and expertise to assist us in this work today.  We really appreciate that.<br/>The format, as per usual, is that I will invite the witnesses to make a brief opening statement, if possible, as close to but not more than five minutes, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session with members.  I suggest we might do something a little different today.  I held a discussion with Deputy Finian McGrath before we started.  I suggest each member would ask three questions initially and if he or she wants to come in a second time we can go around again rather than have a member feel that he or she must ask ten questions at the beginning and will not get in a second time.<br/>Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the position on privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should also be aware that under salient rules of the Chair they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I ask Mr. Gough to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

My name is Dermot Gough and I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Marian McKenna, who is a director of the local drugs task force and also TravAct, which works with Travellers in the area.</p><p>  I manage an addiction project in Darndale, Dublin 17.  I have 20 plus years experience of working in the area of addiction and homelessness and I suppose I have that unique trait of working across the voluntary, statutory and community sectors.</p><p>  I currently manage the Dales Centre, which is a community based addiction centre set up in and by the local community.  It is important to note that it was set up by the community 14 years ago.  We are funded entirely through the HSE and the Dublin north east local drugs task force.  We work closely, as do all the projects in the area.  As set out in the brief the committee received, there are 20 or so youth and drug projects in the area which would work closely with each other but also with the task force.  I sit on a number of committees, including the treatment and rehabilitation of the task force.</p><p>  I will give a brief background of the task force.  Its role is to complement the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  The service level agreement of the Dales and all of the projects in the area would reflect and be in line with the aims and objectives of the national strategy.  We received over &euro;1 million funding annually in Dublin North-East to go across all of the projects and the role of the task force is very much to identify gaps in services and work to extend the level of drug services in the area.  In the future, our brief is looking at merging alcohol in with drugs, that is, the national drugs strategy with the national substance misuse strategy, and fill in identified gaps.</p><p>  I will speak on my own experience, and the experience of the other projects in the task force area, of gangland crime which is the topic here.  Addiction is a hugely complex area and we need to say that from the outset.  Mark Twain, for example, is credited with saying, "Giving up alcohol is easy; I have done it hundreds of times."  It shows how complex addiction can be.</p><p>  When one begins to talk about addiction and drugs and alcohol in Ireland, nearly everybody has an opinion and he or she will offer that opinion.  Often it is quite simplistic.  That may be down to the fact that Ireland has a unique association, and problems, with alcohol.  There is probably not a family in the country that is not touched by alcohol addiction, or certainly the damages of alcohol in some way, and I would include my own family in that.</p><p>  I do not have the answers to stopping gangland crime.  It, too, is a complex issue.</p> <p>The projects with which I am involved take a rehabilitative approach.  We try to work with people and build relationships with them, no matter who they are.  We deal with some of the most challenging people in society.  They are marginalised, excluded and operate within a subculture.  It is not unusual for clients to walk into our facilities wearing bullet-proof vests.  Also, when we make appointments with clients, they often change the times from week to week because of the danger of keeping regular appointments.  Often they have been warned by garda&iacute; that their lives are at risk so they cannot stick to regular routines.  </p><p> The drug services are very good at working with such people.  They open the door to them and welcome them in, despite the fact that they are quite challenging to deal with.  Those of us who work in this area cannot but be affected by it.  We work with people who have lost brothers, sisters, mothers or fathers through gangland crime and addiction.  People ask why they do not call the police.  We have all seen the television series, "Love/Hate" which showed that to be a "rat" or to "grass up" on a neighbour or someone in the area is a social taboo.  Not only is there a huge social stigma around being a rat, as Nidge would say, there can also be enormous repercussions for the individual and his or her family.  It is very difficult for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address that issue.</p><p> Drug users are using cocaine, heroin and cannabis or "weed", all of which are illegal substances.  Therefore, by virtue of using illegal substances, drug users are criminals.  Is legalisation the answer here?  Do we legalise drugs?  That is a topic for debate but I believe the short answer is "No".  There is no simplistic answer to this problem.  We know that authorities in the US have spent billions on the war against drugs but they have not made a dent in the drugs trade.  Can we learn anything from that?  We know that alcohol is legal.  Dr. Bobby Smith, a consultant psychiatrist spoke at a conference last week and argued that alcohol is a gateway drug.  For a large proportion of the people he comes into contact with - and for those we work with - alcohol was their first drug of choice.  Do we go back to the days of Prohibition and impose a ban on alcohol?  </p><p> Our brief is rehabilitation.  We believe that in order to halt the increasing levels of gangland crime, we must reduce the demand for drugs.  Drugs and gangland crime are inherently linked.  We must increase the number of options for people who want to use addiction services.  We must also increase the provision of such services to drug users, as well as the provision of associated and ancillary services, including mental health services.  Addiction and mental health problems are strongly related.   We have extremely high levels of suicide in this country.  </p><p> It is also important that we invest in schools and early education programmes.  Almost every drug user who uses our services was an early school leaver.  There is a very distinct link between early school leaving and drug use.  Diversionary activities are also hugely important.  Youth services, youth reach programmes and alternatives to mainstream education as well as additional sporting and recreational facilities are also vital.  </p><p> There is an acute need for an increase in resources to allow for the expansion and development of our services and to enable us to plan strategically.  All of our funding comes through the HSE and we are very grateful for that.  However, the funding is provided on a yearly basis which makes it very difficult to plan strategically for a three or five year period.  The role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also hugely important.  We have an excellent relationship with garda&iacute;, as do all of the drugs projects.  Garda resources must be increased and we must involve garda&iacute; who are confident working in this area because they are working with very challenging people.  Finally, there is a need for increased co-operation between local communities and various statutory bodies.  When the national drugs strategy was first launched, there was significant buy-in from the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Social Protection but that has waned to some degree.  </p><p> I am not sure what winning the war against drugs actually means but I do know that we must work with people to help them to make positive choices in their lives and move away from addiction and criminal activity.</p></speech>

The CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign is a network of community organisations which are tackling the drugs crisis on the ground in our most disadvantaged communities.  We represent the community sector in the national structures of the National Drugs Strategy.</p><p>  I wish to comment today on the impact of gangland crime on the aforementioned communities.  I will speak about the impact on communities in general and on young people in particular.  In the context of the impact on communities, there are two issues.  The first is low-level intimidation and the second, serious violence around drug-related debt.  </p><p>  On the issue of low-level intimidation, members will remember that 20 years ago when we first began to see activities related to the drugs market in local communities, those communities responded.  They took action by taking to the streets and marching on drug dealers' homes.  There was a community response whereby people said that they would not tolerate drug trade activities in their communities.  That does not happen anymore and people often ask why that is the case.  It does not happen because of the levels of violence associated with the drugs trade today.  While most people in a community do not have direct experience of that violence and are not direct victims of it, the threat of violence is implicit at all times.  It is a case of not crossing certain people because one knows what those people can do.  People have described how they keep their eyes down, mind their own business and keep their mouths shut.  It is almost impossible to describe the corrosive, negative effect this has on communities, day after day.  In these communities, community bonds, links and supports helped people to survive in the past but these are being seriously undermined by low-level intimidation.  That means that communities are more open to drug-trade related activities.  It is important to point out that such low-level intimidation will never show up in Garda statistics because it is not a question of incidents happening but of fear.  It only takes one shooting in an area for 30 or 40 people to be silenced.  That is how it works.  We should not underestimate the importance of low-level intimidation which is extremely corrosive over time.</p><p> Violence related to drug debt can range from horrific beatings right the way up to death, which is the ultimate punishment.  There is no sense of proportion around this.  The actual debt itself can be very small in some cases - &euro;100 or &euro;200, for example.  It is not about the amount of money but the principle of paying a debt.  This can have an impact on entire families.  Often it is not just the drug users who are held responsible for the debt; their families and friends can be subjected to violence and intimidation too.  We have heard of quite a number of young people who have committed suicide because of a drug debt but in some circumstances, the debt lives on.  Their families have been told that they have inherited the debt, which is an absolutely horrific situation for them. </p><p>  In many disadvantaged communities young people are growing up in an environment where the activities associated with the drugs trade have become normalised.  Young people are looking out their windows at what is happening on the street and they do not see that the people involved in the drugs trade are being sanctioned in any way.  That normalisation also means that the drugs trade has become part of local economies.  Young people are making, from their point of view, rational economic decisions.  They are in low-income families and have very limited opportunities to earn money.  They see that within a very short space of time, say an hour, they can earn &euro;100 or more by getting involved in the drugs trade in some way.  That is a very appealing economic opportunity for many young people.  </p> <p>As Mr. Gough mentioned, intervention at the earliest possible stage is really important.  It is crucial that we now have practical initiatives and responses in order to break the cycle.  People out there have a sense of utter hopelessness and feel they can do nothing and cannot stand up to these people.  It is extremely important that we do have initiatives, no matter how difficult it is.  There are a number of initiatives in place on the ground, such as the community policing forums.  There are major operations to tackle drug dealing and it is particularly important for young people to see there is a response from the police and the State.  However, we always emphasise that it is not enough to have all the resources going into an operation if there is then no more policing for weeks afterwards.  That does not work.  If there is an operation, it must be backed up afterwards with day-to-day community policing.  Otherwise it just reverts really quickly.  We need both together.  The National Family Support Network has established an intimidation reporting helpline in co-operation with the Garda.  In every Garda station in the country there is a named person with responsibility for taking calls from families dealing with intimidation.  In terms of breaking the silence, we are involved with the Health Research Board in auditing the extent and levels of intimidation citywide.  Because of its nature, it is extremely difficult to put any kind of figure on it, but for policy reasons and to have it taken seriously we need to try and gather the data no matter how difficult that might be.</p><p> To back up what Mr. Gough said, youth interventions are crucially important.  Young people are unsure whether they should get involved with the youth services and the alternatives they have to offer, or go out onto the road and earn &euro;200 doing a message for a drug dealer.  That is the choice they are facing and it is really hard to direct them the way we would want them to go.  Youth services are crucially important and have been hit by significant cutbacks, which is making their work nearly impossible.  Community services also cannot be emphasised enough, and I am afraid people in bureaucracies do not understand the importance of local community development projects.  They do not get it - they look and ask what service is being delivered.  They do not understand how important it is that people have that support so they can maintain their sense of having a right to stand up in their own community, a right to say "this is not acceptable and we should not have to live like this", a right to say they should not have people behaving like that within their own areas.  All those community supports have been devastated.</p><p> While it is crucially important that we have practical initiatives, the reality is that poverty and disadvantage underlie all of this.  The communities most affected are the poorest ones, and it is from those communities that the people carrying out the intimidation and violence come.  If we do not seriously tackle poverty and disadvantage we will never deal with this problem.  People do not like to hear that because they think it is too big an issue, but it is the truth.</p></speech>

There was a lot of food for thought there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry McNally" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014121000004#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  I want to begin by introducing myself and my colleagues.  On my right, Ms Suzanne Vella is director of operations in the Probation Service, and on my left, Mr. Mark Wilson is the regional manager for Dublin north.  I am the assistant director with responsibility for research and special projects.</p><p>  The Probation Service is an agency within the Department of Justice and Equality operating nationally, with almost 400 staff.  We are the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in the community and we also work in prisons to address offending and the reintegration of prisoners on release.  At any one time, the Probation Service is supervising approximately 9,000 offenders - juveniles and adults - in the community, including offenders who are on supervision post-custody.  A core element of how the Probation Service works is its partnership and joint working with the other criminal justice agencies such as the Courts Service, the Irish Prison Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as all the other statutory and voluntary community organisations such as the drugs task forces across the country.  The Department of Justice and Equality - through the Probation Service - and the Irish Youth Justice Service provide funding to 60 community-based organisations to support their work with offenders. In the main, this is to support the reintegration of offenders into their communities by providing specialised treatment, skills and support.</p><p>  The Probation Service has experience in working effectively with high-risk offenders including gang members and those involved in organised crime. We use evidence-based interventions with an emphasis on addressing pro-criminal attitudes and behaviours, resolving addiction and related factors and promoting changed behaviours and lifestyles.  For most offenders this involves a radical change in their lives and there can be many risks of relapse.  </p><p>  Bringing about lasting change requires the input of a wide range of services.  Inter-agency co-operation with our justice partners, particularly the courts, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Irish Prison Service, is critically important in this work, as is collaboration with the statutory and voluntary bodies.  It is a question of joined-up services.  I would like to take the opportunity to highlight several initiatives in which the Probation Service has participated, targeting higher-risk offenders who have been involved in serious offending including gang-related and organised crime.  The Probation Service in co-operation with the Prison Service has been a partner in an EU-funded project, JCN, which is examining and developing best practice across Europe in the transition management and supervision of high-risk offenders leaving custody.  It is about preparation and supervision of offenders post-custody to reduce any risk of further offending.  We have also participated with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a two-year EU-funded project, SOMEC, which focuses on safeguarding citizens against serious and violent offenders travelling across Europe.  It is about the transnational movement of crime.  Sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, is a multi-agency model established by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service.  It involves co-location of staff and has provided important learning and experience which we can use in the supervision and management of high-risk and gang-involved offenders.  Opt In is a new joint agency response to crime developed by the Probation Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, which will target persistent and prolific adult offenders.  Again, this concerns people who will be involved in crime both in the communities and in gangs.  It is similar to the integrated offender management model in the UK.  As part of the increasing co-operation and co-ordination in these initiatives, Irish Prison Service personnel are now located in the Probation Service and a Probation Service manager is also part of a multi-agency team at Garda headquarters.</p><p>  In terms of this committee&rsquo;s deliberations, the Probation Service proposes the development of a co-ordinated overall strategy to support joined-up interventions across the social, criminal justice, education and economic realms to tackle gang and organised crime on individual, community and gang levels.  We propose enhanced information and data sharing and joint working across the criminal justice bodies as well as other statutory and community-based services.  We propose the increased use of probation supervision as a sanction including post-custody supervision with enhanced joint working and collaboration.  We propose prioritising the allocation of resources for intensive interventions with offenders involved, or at risk of involvement, in gang and organised crime.  We also propose that there should be particular research on the factors and causes which contribute to organised crime, in order to identify the risk factors and those at most risk and to inform effective interventions.  We propose investigation and evaluation of initiatives both here and in other jurisdictions to identify lessons that can be learned and approaches and actions that can be implemented to improve the outcomes and results.  We also support and propose continued participation in European and international projects to develop and share best practice in working with offenders in general, and in particular with those at high risk of reoffending and becoming involved in the kind of crime we are discussing this morning.</p><p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to come here today.  The Probation Service will fully co-operate with and provide any necessary information required by the committee in its work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/978" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014121000004#C00400"><p>I thank Mr. McNally and am again taken with the level of co-operation between the Probation Service and the other services, something that should be developed further.</p> <p>I represent the ACJRD, the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development.  It is a non-governmental, non-profit-making organisation that seeks to promote the reform, development and effective operation of the Irish criminal justice system.  It comprises organisations and individual professionals from the criminal justice system.  The views represented in this presentation are those of ACJRD in its independent capacity and are not those of its member organisations or their employers.</p><p> As the committee has heard, gangland activity, including killings, is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.  It does not have a simple cause or solution and no single agency can provide a solution to the problem on its own.  Tackling gangland activity will require a multifaceted, multi-agency approach which will require inter-agency co-operation and collaboration at local, national and international levels.</p><p> Public perceptions of gangland homicide support a strong link to the drug trade, but other motivating factors include social, economic, psychological and family factors.  Empirical research and anecdotal evidence from youth and community workers indicate that the drug market is a factor in gangland activity.  Gangs are ingratiating themselves into communities, targeting vulnerable individuals and instilling fear into individuals in the community.</p><p> Children as young as 15 either are on the periphery of gangs or have already been recruited by them for drug dealing and even tiger kidnappings.  Recent research by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol suggests that this activity has, for the most part, been unaffected by law enforcement.  In order to tackle the problem, early intervention is required at community level.  We need to involve local communities and their leaders in any interventions, particularly those individuals working on the ground who understand the problems.</p><p> An essential key for the success of any intervention will be providing a safe and secure environment for participants.  To this end, we need a strong Garda presence in the community to provide public order and safety, and to control anti-social and offending criminal behaviour.  Although policing on its own cannot resolve the problems, it is needed to allow other interventions the opportunity to work.</p><p> The ACJRD recommends the following.  We need to develop a national collaborative strategic approach to combating gangland activity and violence.  We need to review the implementation of the Criminal Justice Acts that were particularly focused on gangland crime.  There should be a focus on community-based initiatives that encourage education, economic and social development and community safety partnerships.  Examples of these include the Ballymun and Limerick regeneration projects, the National Collective of Community-Based Women&rsquo;s Networks, and projects such as Garda community liaison schemes, juvenile diversion schemes and other projects outlined earlier.</p><p> We need to encourage at-risk communities to report criminal activities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This will require an improvement of confidence and trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system.  We need to continue to develop the witness security programme and introduce a robust victim support programme.  We need further training for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that will assist in fostering understanding and in the delivery of services to at-risk communities and to witnesses to and victims of crime.</p><p> We need to review the Planning and Development Act 2000 with a view to insertion of crime prevention strategies.  We need to introduce programmes and policies into the school curriculum that will assist communities in the prevention of crime.  We need to share knowledge by establishing a knowledge hub to track offenders both within the communities and in prisons and child detention services.</p><p> We need to allocate funds to at-risk communities and those who wish to conquer their addictions and desist from offending.  We need to promote relevant multidisciplinary and multifaceted research into the causes of gangland activity and its effect on communities.  We need research into what works so that funding can be linked to outcomes.</p><p> With greater investment in community safety programmes, early intervention and community-based programmes for families in socially deprived areas, anti-social and offending behaviour by gangland criminals can be changed.  Although the State cannot be expected to eliminate the motivation to offend, responses to the crime issue can be controlled.  Ensuring that resources are available to support those who wish to conquer their addictions, increase their social capital and desist from offending is critical to redressing the harm caused within communities.</p><p> The key principles of success for these programmes and interventions are inter-agency co-operation at local, national and international level, a multifaceted approach to interventions, particularly educational community safety programmes, in-reach programmes for offenders in custody, robust enforcement of powers, and sufficient funding and resources to implement programmes and legislation.  Confidence and trust in the law enforcement agencies is integral to any initiative to counteract gangland activity, as is a robust witness and victim support programme.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their written submissions to the committee.  The background to these hearings is that we are trying to deal with the effects of gangland crime on communities.  In recent years I, along with other Members of the Oireachtas, have privately met in our clinics families who have been devastated by drugs-related issues and have also been intimidated.  They are so fearful that they will not go to the Garda and instead come to our clinics or other private meetings.  It is essential that the witnesses know that is the background to these hearings.  We are listening to their advice in order to try to come up with solutions on how to help those families.</p><p>  The oral submissions seem to focus on three issues required to deal effectively with gangland crime in communities.  They are seeking a social and educational response and a response dealing with poverty and disadvantage.  They also want support for and investment in communities.  The third point was the need for a high-quality policing service that is in tune with local communities in order to have their trust and support.  We know there is an addiction problem and some sort of disadvantage problem.  Does the solution go down to those three things of dealing with educational and socioeconomic disadvantage, support for communities, as Ms Quigley mentioned, and good solid local policing.  The people from the community are telling me that third item is not evident on the ground.</p></speech>

Part of the challenge with this is that we all name the big picture issues and the need for broad action around education, disadvantage and policing.  While we have to state that, in order to get past the sense of this being such a big issue and how are we going to make a difference and how we can help people now, we definitely have to say they are the overall objectives we are working towards, but we need to identify the practical steps we can take now that will move us towards them.</p><p>  We always talk about poverty, disadvantage and education, and people say that is all very well but it will not happen overnight.  The Deputy is right in saying they are the underlying causes and that they need to be addressed.  However, we need to identify practical steps we can take in the meantime.  In terms of policing, the community policing forums on the ground are really important.  That kind of day-to-day low-key stuff is very important.  The community policing forums act as an intermediary between the community and the Garda.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, when people go to a local policing forum or use the reporting system or the family support network, they will not get a solution.  The drug debt will not be written off and whoever wants the money will not go away.  However, the first step is to have a place where somebody supports them in the process, which breaks down the isolation.  I referred to the audit.  The first step must be to get people from a place in which they are dealing with this in isolation and feeling powerless to a space in which, at least, people in the community are coming together and deciding that they are not powerless and there are things they can do.  The community policing forum is a very practical place where this happens, and it is crucial, as are local community services where people come together.  Anything that keeps people in isolation is very damaging, so we need to have supports in place for people as a first step.</p><p> Youth services are already in existence and doing this work.  There are big questions with regard to resources, but they are already doing the work.  Much of what is already happening forms part of the steps needed to improve the situation, but it goes without saying that it is all under-resourced.  The challenge for us is how to combine an understanding of the broad change needed in our communities if we are to seriously address the issue with the taking of practical steps.  The practical steps are based on measures that are already being taken in our communities but which, unfortunately, instead of being supported and developed over the past two years, have been undermined.  These include community policing forums, local community organisations and youth services.  They are all there, but they do not receive the support they need to do the level of work needed.  I cannot emphasise enough that to break the silence there need to be places in communities where people who experience this type of intimidation and difficulty know there is support available.  This is a crucial first step.  Long-term, we must tackle the broader issues of education, employment and disadvantage.</p></speech>

I am speaking specifically about the intimidation issue.  The witnesses from CityWide Drugs Crisis spoke about low-level intimidation and stated that there were no incident or Garda reports and that those experiencing it keep their heads down, do not make eye contact and mind their own business.  Last week I met a gentleman who lives on the same street as a serious player, and the gang is intimidating the entire street.  He keeps his head down and makes no eye contact.  This is how broken he is.  He told me he felt he could not go to the Garda because he would be burned out or acid would be thrown on his kids' cars, so he came to me privately.  I have advised the Garda on it but the garda&iacute; tell me they have no evidence.  He will not go to the Garda.  There are many streets in Dublin, Cork and Limerick like this, where the people have ceded control to the gangs, which is heartbreaking for these families.</p><p>  Will the witnesses comment on this from a policing point of view and based on their own experience?  Some of the kids doing the intimidation are among the 9,000 kids who have just been released from prison.  When I say kids, I mean those aged up to age 18 or 19 years.  They are part of the jigsaw also.  What advice can the witnesses give the committee with regard to responding to this ceding of control of an entire street?  It is just not acceptable.  It is also not acceptable from a policing point of view to hold up our hands and ask what can we do.  The same families tell me when Johnny was kicking a ball on the Howth Road two garda&iacute; pulled up, stopped him and told him he should not be kicking the ball there, but they seem to back off dealing with the serious issues in communities.  We must address this problem.  The committee is seeking solutions.  How would the witnesses advise us on this aspect of it?</p></speech>

This model is based on the high level of overlap between these services, in terms of the individuals with whom we work, and it examines how we can best utilise our statutory roles to have best effect on these individuals.  To take the Deputy's example, we are targeting the opt-in initiative in east Ballymun to try to increase public confidence in areas of low-level intimidation.  We are targeting a small number of prolific offenders, some of whom have come through prison, and making it clear to them that once they have been identified as part of this project, based on their level and type of offending, we will have a high level of involvement with them, either with their engagement or, if they choose not to engage, with higher levels of interference from the Garda through the way in which they are placed.  The idea of opt-in is that they will continually be offered a carrot-and-stick approach.  We want them to make positive life changes and will provide opportunities for change, but if this does not happen we will look to have a higher level of contact with them.  Through structured temporary release programmes for persons coming out of custody - such as the community return initiative under which prisoners are obliged to do three days of community work - as well as supervision by the Probation Service and Garda activity, we can use motivation to effect change for these individuals.</p></speech>

There was a huge political response and drugs were seen as a priority issue.  The national drugs strategy at the time set out very clearly the principles people have been speaking about today, such as inter-agency operations, work at a local level in local communities to tackle the problems and community engagement.  All of these principles were clearly set out.  There was also clear recognition that the issues of disadvantage and poverty needed to be tackled.  This was clearly stated in the drugs strategy.</p><p>  Unfortunately, what happens is that such a strategy gets a few years in the sun, and for several years it was a critical priority.  I remember it was one of the top five issues in the manifestoes for the 1997 general election.  By 2002, however, it had disappeared as an issue.  Unfortunately, once structures are established, which is what happened with task forces and national committees through the national drugs strategy, there is often a sense, politically, that the job has been done.  However, setting up the structures is only the start of the job.  While in principle we still have the same structures, inter-agency operation and community involvement, in practice, we no longer have the commitment to it at political level.  This feeds through to Departments, where there is no longer the same commitment either, and to the people who have responsibility for making decisions.</p><p>  We still have the strategy and structures, but the implementation is very weak and the problem is no longer viewed as being rooted in disadvantage and poverty.  In our experience, the drugs issue is now seen as a problem that individuals have that needs to be dealt with.  This completely negates the reality of what we are discussing, which is the impact on communities.  The fundamental principles of the drugs strategy are excellent, but over time the commitment to implementing it has dwindled as it has become a lower political priority.  This morning, everyone has restated these principles as being key.</p> <p>If we are to tackle the issue of intimidation, and the broader issues, it is time these were re-established as priority issues.   </p></speech>

At the end of the day, where does the buck stop?  Ms Quigley mentioned the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Transport, Tourism and Sport, all of which have various responsibilities.  Would the appointment of one person with responsibility for this area who would then report to the Oireachtas on it be a way of addressing this issue?</p></speech>

When this initiative started it was the responsibility of then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who had a seat at Cabinet.  There have been approximately nine different Ministers of State with responsibility in this area over the past number of years, all of whom were excellent.  Currently, there is no Ministry responsible for this area and it is now a matter for the Department of Health.  We have met with the Minister for Health, who has said that while he is interested in the issue his agenda is too large.  He was very honest about that.  There needs to be a Minister of State with responsibility for this issue only and who is dedicated to addressing it.  It is crucial that the parent Department, which is currently the Department of Health, sees its role as bringing together all of the other Departments on this issue.  Its role cannot be a paper exercise.  It must have the authority to hold all of the agencies to account in respect of what they should be doing.  That worked in the early days of the strategy.  If a Minister of State is appointed, he or she must have a real commitment to this issue and have a track record in this area.  Up to recently, that was the case.</p></speech>

When the taskforce and national drugs strategy was working people at a local level felt they had access to places of seniority and that gave them confidence.  Reference was made earlier to the lack of confidence people have in their communities and their feelings of disenfranchisement and isolation.  The task force meetings which were held on a monthly basis were attended by senior Garda, officials from the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Health, and this instilled a feeling of inclusiveness that filtered down.  When difficulties and problems arose communities had an avenue and platform to highlight them.  However, as stated by Ms Quigley that has dwindled.  Former Minister of State, Pat Carey, would regularly visit projects.  People felt empowered by that.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the work being done by the task force in Darndale, Kilbarrack and Edenmore and I have had many dealings with it.</p><p>  Darndale was mentioned as an area of focus in terms of the type of anti-social behaviour that arises from crime and the drug addiction problem.  Has any of the delegates come across people who have had to leave their homes in particular areas because of intimidation by local crime gangs?  I have come across one or two cases of it myself.  As has been said, very often the people involved are afraid to put their heads above the parapet, leading to victims not getting recourse because they are unwilling to give evidence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is a matter which I believe needs to be addressed.  I would welcome the views of the delegates on that, as the people working on the ground.</p><p>  I was particularly interested in the presentation made by Ms Quigley, in regard, in particular, to the community policing forums and local safety forums in the north east constituency.  I am sure there are similar forums in the inner city constituency.  Ms Quigley mentioned that these forums are not receiving the same priority they got in the past.  That point is well made.  Under housing legislation the local authorities have a role to play in dealing with criminal gangs living in local authority estates.  In Ms Quigley's view, are the local authorities doing enough in terms of housing and estate management to tackle low-level criminal activity, including intimidation?  We hear much on the news about people being shot but nothing about the everyday low level intimidation that annoys people intensely and makes life unbearable for them.  I would welcome the delegates' views on what more the local authorities could do or if there is need for further legislation in that regard.</p><p>  I have one more question.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Quigley" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014121000007#F00800"><p>On the local authorities, obviously they do have a role in this area.  In many areas, in particular the north inner city, the council and Garda work closely on issues relating to persons living in local authority accommodation who are causing difficulties, including intimidation of neighbours and so on.  This is a difficult issue.  As stated by Deputy McGrath, the council will proceed if it has evidence but the difficulty that arises is how that evidence is gathered in the context of peoples' fear around providing it.  The legislation is very complicated in that at the end of the day people have the right to a home and, if evicted, they will need to be housed somewhere else.</p><p>  The fundamental issue underlying all of this is that there are legal systems and structures to enable address of the issue but people are too afraid to come forward and give evidence.  There is a process by which people can be evicted from council housing, which is a difficult and long process and, rightly so, because nobody should be easily evicted from their home.  However, the council can only act on evidence given to it by other residents.  The difficulty is around peoples' fear of giving that evidence.  In regard to Deputy McGrath's question as to what is the answer to this, the reality is there is no instant answer.  Nobody, including a garda, can advise a person to ignore another person who is intimidating him or her.  The reality is that often people are advised to pay up if they can come up with the money to do so.  None of us can give a commitment that we can protect one person from intimidation by another person.  In that immediate case, it is difficult for people.  If we are to bring about change in this regard, everyone needs to work together.  If a Deputy comes to us seeking help we would like to be able to offer it but we cannot do that.  We cannot say to anybody that if they come forward and identify and name in court those who are intimidating them they will be protected.  For this reason, all of the solutions offered, taken together, is the only way forward.  We have to start with supports for those people.  We cannot and do not just tell them we cannot do anything for them and to go away.  We must at least provide them with support by way of a local service or structure to which they can go.  </p><p>  Policing, including community policing, is crucial.  The issue that arises for people living in areas experiencing a lot of intimidation is the lack of visible policing on the streets.  Where surveillance of a drugs issues is in place normal policing is withdrawn from the streets.  While that is understandable it is not acceptable.  Again, I know resources is an issue in this regard.  I am aware, for example, that Garda numbers at Store Street Garda station have reduced by 65.  That is bound to have an impact.  I am sure that is replicated in other areas.  There is need for a return to garda visibly patrolling areas, as they did in the past.  Visibility in terms of policing provides reassurance for people.  The previous Minister for Justice and Equality once stated we no longer need that type of policing because of the availability of technological equipment.  However, visible policing is important.  </p><p>  I do not believe that what is needed at this stage is more processes, procedures or laws.  The difficulty is around peoples' fear of giving evidence.  I am not suggesting that evidence is not given in some cases because it is.  However, giving evidence is very difficult.</p></speech>

Previously, this was the responsibility of the current Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, and prior to that Deputy Rabbitte, was the first Minister of State with responsibility in this area.  There have been a number of appointments since then of Ministers of State with particular responsibility for this area.  The message from the delegates is, I think, that this position needs to be reinstated.</p> <p>I was interested in the point made by the speaker from the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development on providing a safe environment where people can come forward and give their views.  She mentioned that a Garda presence is required, with boots on the ground, in order to make people feel safe, so they come forward and give information that will lead to some kind of resolution of these problems.  One hopes that when these new extra garda&iacute; are trained and become available, that will release more garda&iacute; who can go back to doing the kind of work that was previously done in that area.  </p><p> I asked a question earlier about cases in which people have to leave their homes. </p></speech>

It can be heartbreaking for families when they have to send their children away for their own safety.  Often, people will not leave their homes.  They are proud to stay there, but they are very often living in fear.  As Ms. Quigley said earlier, it is difficult to report this.  People live in fear and even though their windows might be broken, they will not go to the garda&iacute;.  Therefore, these crimes are not reported.  These people receive beatings.  They are not severe enough to require them to go to hospital, but they are severe enough to hurt them and do serious damage.  This will not be reported and the statistics are down as a result, but it is happening and it is very real for people.  As Ms Quigley said, the person knows not to go any further.  If someone gets a bad beating, he or she is definitely not going to report that.</p></speech>

There have been issues between Travellers and other Travellers, but also between Travellers and other gangs within the wider community.  It does happen, and there is no reporting as such of it to the Garda.</p></speech>

This kind of stuff has been around for a while.  He brought up this issue earlier on.  I would like him to revisit that and to hear his views on it.  Perhaps others might like to come in on this also.  The drugs scene is integral to our discussion today.</p></speech>

It is controversial.  Should we do it?  Could we do it?  What would be the implications and the ramifications?  There are areas outside Ireland which have done it.  Canada, for instance, provides legalised heroin under supervised injection as a way to reduce the risk of HIV, hepatitis and overdosing.  Safe injecting rooms are a way forward as well.  The Ana Liffey Drug Project in Dublin is contemplating and examining the possibility of opening up safe injecting rooms.  Cannabis is very much a hot topic at the moment.  We are running a seminar tomorrow on cannabis, or weed, because we are seeing many problems and difficulties in this regard.  A number of years ago, cannabis, or weed, was perhaps viewed as a soft drug.  I am not sure I would agree with this.  The attitude was "It is only cannabis."  We are seeing serious problems, for young people in particular, caused by weed.  It is being produced at home and its strength is much higher than it used to be.  Drug-induced psychosis is a real issue.  The amount of debt people are getting into buying cannabis has risen drastically.  People are running up drug debts and getting themselves into difficulties with people in organised crime.  I am not sure about legalisation.  Alcohol is legal, and we know all the problems and difficulties we have with alcohol - so much so that we have included it in our national substance misuse strategy.  We would have to think long and hard about this and look at other possibilities before we look at legalisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.548" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Quigley" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014121000008#G00700"><p>One of the important points is to distinguish decriminalisation from legalisation.  They are two very different things.  We strongly favour decriminalisation.  Currently, we make a person a criminal for using a drug.  People use drugs for all kinds of reasons, including personal or social reasons.  To make them a criminal for doing that makes no sense.  It only adds to their difficulties and increases their engagement with the criminal justice system.  We believe there should be decriminalisation, which is much more widespread than people think.  People think of Portugal and the Netherlands, but in fact there has been decriminalisation in around 30 countries.  Places such as Germany, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic have all had some form of decriminalisation.  We need to look at this as an option.  Around 70% of prosecutions relating to drugs are for possession.  In terms of resources, decriminalisation makes sense.  Legalisation is far more complicated.  As Mr. Gough said, our track record with alcohol is not great.</p><p>  In the UN, there is a move by the Latin American countries to instigate a review of the war on drugs and a new approach to it.  All international drug controls are operated in Latin American countries, and these are the countries which suffer the brunt of the illegal drugs trade.  We all know what is happening in countries such as Mexico and Colombia.  Nobody is going as far as to suggest legalisation.  However, there is a general recognition in the international drugs policy area that what we are doing now in the war on drugs is not working.  Across the world, it is the poorest communities that suffer the damage.  We should decriminalise drugs.  This approach is about not making a criminal of a person who is using a drug, no more than I should be a criminal if I drink a glass of wine.  Legalisation is a far more complicated issue.  However, we should have a discussion.  We should not just say no to this.  We need to look at the evidence, which tells us that what we are doing at the moment is not working at all.</p></speech>

Like all babies, they are dependent on their parents for love, attention and sustenance.  She went on to talk about the parents being out drinking and so on, and the baby not getting appropriate attention.  Later on, such a person may find a sense of identity and belonging within the gang on the streets.  There is a sociological issue here and she speaks about the need for extra research.  She spoke about gangs carving out territories, having access to lethal weapons and killing and torturing people and so on.  She also mentioned youth workers.  There is a lot of stuff in this.  The key question is how much research is going on at the moment in this area.   What needs to be done?</p></speech>

That is why we advocate more research in this area, on its causes and its effects on the community.  We have a lot of anecdotal evidence, but we do not have a great deal of specific empirical evidence.  We need a cross- or multidisciplinary approach to research which would take in the whole gamut of services and community support groups on the ground.  We need to talk to these people and the wide range of professionals working in the field, particularly An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service.  It needs to be a multidisciplinary body of research.</p></speech>

I have provided hard copies of our presentation.  There has been much discussion about the Eircode system proposed by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We are in favour of the system proposed.  It is very innovative, has been well thought out and is particularly suited to the conditions in Ireland, particularly in rural areas, where up to 60% of addresses are not unique.  As the largest privately owned parcel delivery business in Ireland, we support Eircode as it is proposed.  Last week was our peak shipping season.  Given that coming up to Christmas, my company will have made approximately 500,000 deliveries in Ireland, we are well qualified to talk on the topic.  I have been interested in the topic and have followed it with great personal and business interest for approximately 25 years.  In 1989, I wrote my first letter to An Post to inquire about the introduction of a postcode system for Ireland.</p><p>  From some of the media coverage and presentations to the committee, we know there are concerns about the proposed system.  I have knowledge of postcode systems in other jurisdictions, particularly the UK, given that we have a substantial delivery business in Northern Ireland and work with the UK postcode system.  We are aware of the deficiencies of the UK system, particularly in rural areas.  In the debate about the appropriateness of Eircode, people often ask why we cannot use the same system as the UK.  In my presentation, members will see a road, the R106, which runs between Malahide and Swords in north County Dublin, which I have used as an example because I am from Malahide.  Two of the basic principles of the UK postcode system are that all roads must be named and every property on a road must be numbered.  While it might seem reasonable, in this example, when one leaves Malahide one is on the Swords Road, whereas when one reaches Swords the same road is called the Malahide Road.</p><p>  Under the UK postcode system, the road would have to be renamed with one name, or we would have to define the point at which it stops being the Malahide Road and becomes the Swords Road.  I invite members to think about it for a minute.  Naming anything in Ireland can be contentious.  For example, there was much debate about naming the new Luas bridge over the Liffey.  As a nation, we do not like such change.  If we decided not to rename the road in my example, we would have to draw a line across it to determine where one ends and one begins, and this is a potentially contentious issue for the people who live along the road.  The same could apply to many roads in Ireland.</p><p>  Having overcome this contentious issue, we would have to number all the properties on the road.  On the map, members will see that there is considerable open space along the road, as in many rural roads.  If we numbered all the properties, for example from one to 100, and a new property were built, the number sequence would be out of synch.  We would have to renumber every house on the road or introduce sub-numbers.  This is why naming every road and numbering every property would be potentially divisive and very time-consuming and expensive.  Almost every road which we would name and number would involve a debate with the people who live there as to what it will be called and what number each house will have.  The UK was the first country to introduce a postcode system.  It was originally introduced in London in the 1850s, but it took until 1977 to complete the process of implementing it across the UK, with most of the work done between the 1950s and the 1970s.  It took almost 20 years for the UK authorities to give everything a name and number, because it was so divisive and contentious.  It was a very costly and lengthy process.  With the Eircode system, whereby every property has a unique identifier, we can build new properties along a road without having to renumber or rename anything.</p><p>  The next slide in my presentation is about current challenges and I have permission to use the example of a customer of ours, Pinewood Healthcare, a manufacturing business based in Ballymacarbry.  Its address, according to its website, is Ballymacarbry, Clonmel, County Tipperary.  However, in its official address on the An Post website, Ballymacarbry is spelled &ldquo;Ballymacarbrey&rdquo;.  Locally, the name of the area is spelled without the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo;, and this is common for addresses in the area.  If I were a truck driver, leaving Dublin to make a delivery to this factory in Ballymacarbry, I would probably drive to Clonmel and then start looking for Ballymacarbry.  However, Ballymacarbry is actually in County Waterford, and is 17 km away from Clonmel.</p><p>  Differences between local and official spellings of place names are common in Ireland, and the Eircode system will allow us to leave them as they are.  We need not change anybody's address or spelling.  When this factory gets its Eircode next year, a truck driver will not go to Clonmel to look for the factory, but will put the Eircode into the navigation system, which will give directions to the door.  The reason the postal address is Clonmel, County Tipperary is that the postal route that covers the area comes from Clonmel.  In Ireland, there are many postal addresses which do not reflect that actual location, and Eircode will allow us to keep all this in place while adding the Eircode to the address.</p><p>  Eircode will also help with the issue of non-unique addresses, which applies to 60% of our rural addresses.  My surname, "Tuohy" is quite prevalent in the west of Ireland.</p> <p>My father came from a townland near Portumna in County Galway.  Everybody's surname in the townland was either Tuohy or Conroy.  In the old days, when my mother wrote a letter to my grandmother in County Galway, she would write my grandfather's name and his father's name in brackets after it so that the postman would know which Tuohy family to deliver it to.  The properties in that townland had no name or number.  The postman knew their location by the names of the people who lived there.  The roads to those properties did not have names either.  The introduction of the Eircode system is a great idea because it will allow all those aspects to remain the same.  There is no need to change the name of a road.  The houses in a parish do not need to be numbered or given a name; they will be simply given a code.  That means a courier, postal operator, appliance repair man or ambulance driver can drive straight to the door of a property without the need to change any of the attributes in terms of the address.  It means that everyone with the same surname in a townland can have the same address, but the addition of an Eircode will allow us deal with the non-unique addresses.  That phenomenon is quite unique to Ireland, and the addition of an Eircode will allow us to address that very well.  It is particularly appropriate for Irish conditions, and this is before we talk about those areas in the Gaeltacht where addresses are in Irish and there may be particular nuances in terms of the Irish language.  There is no need to change any of that; all that is needed is that an Eircode be added and everything else will remain the same.  </p><p> To return to the point I made about the way the UK postcode works, locations in rural areas pose particular challenges in the UK.  There are approximately 20 million addresses in the UK but there are only 1.7 million individual postcodes.  If one were to round up those numbers, one would say there was an average of 100 addresses per postcode, but in urban areas such as London and Belfast there might be four addresses to a postcode and in an area such as Fermanagh, with which we are quite familiar, there could be 100 addresses to a postcode and a single postcode could cover 20 sq. km.  This is an issue not only in Northern Ireland but in the highlands and islands of Scotland, where the postcode system is inappropriate for locating individual addresses.  I hope I have dealt with that issue.  The UK postcode system has its own challenges in terms of rural areas, and that is precisely the issue that the Department and its advisers have tackled in terms of the non-uniqueness of rural addresses in Ireland.  They have done a good job on that.  I recommend that we press on with the schedule of implementation of the Eircode system as proposed.</p><p> To summarise, the introduction of the Eircode system will allow people to retain their current address without the need to change the name or number of a property.  Roads will not need to be named or renamed.  It will give a unique identifier to every rural address in Ireland.  A feature of the Eircode system that might be helpful for Deputies is that it will allow a TD to write to all his or her constituents.  Currently, it is not possible to define the addresses in a constituency unless one goes to a public library and checks the electoral register.  It will allow a TD to identify the Eircodes of all the properties in their constituency and to communicate better with the constituents in an area.  It is also possible to sectoralise, which would enable a Deputy to deal with an issue that is presenting in one part - as opposed to all parts - of their constituency.  The Eircode system will allow for that to be done, whereas currently I do not believe it is possible.</p><p> I will respond to any questions members may have.</p></speech>

There have been a few detractors with regard to the introduction of the Eircode system.  It is refreshing to hear the volume of business Nightline has throughout the country and that it is in favour of this system.  A number of people, including those in the emergency services, have been critical of it with respect to a raft of issues.  I am not sure if the witnesses are aware of such criticism of the way it is proposed to implement the system.  How would the delegates reassure such detractors, particularly some members of the emergency services who have been in contact with us, that what is proposed is the right way to go?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tuohy" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014121000005#D00400"><p>I believe the emergency services have come on board in support of the Eircode system now that they have been provided with more information on how it will work.  I do not believe the emergency services are officially against its implementation.  However, some other companies in our industry have been critical of it.  Those are multinational companies that are minority players in the Irish market.  However, they are big corporations in their own right, which means their voices are disproportionately loud in this conversation.  The issue multinational corporations have with the proposed system is that they adopt a one-size-fits-all model for their computer systems.  They use the same systems in every country in the world, systems that were largely developed 30 or 40 years ago.  Such systems would support UK- or US-style postcodes but they would not support this new and innovative system.  Those corporations would have to spend money adapting their systems to the Irish market and, for them, the market is probably too small for them to do that.  Rather than changing their systems to support the new postcode, such corporations would prefer to change the new postcodes to work with their older computer systems.  That is the issue that multinationals operating in this market - which are big companies in their own right, even though they are minority players - have with this new system.</p><p>  I draw a comparison between the introduction of this system and the design of the Dublin Port tunnel 12 or 14 years ago prior to its construction.  In a similar way, minority interests said the port tunnel would be too small for trucks to be driven through it.  I drove through it on my way into town this morning and I can assure the members there were no trucks stuck in it.  That tunnel was built to EU standards that were new at that time, but a number of minority-interest operators in the market had lorries that were built to an older UK standard, which would not fit in the tunnel.  Those operators wanted us to redesign the tunnel in order that their trucks would fit through it, as opposed to redesigning their trucks to the new EU standard.  The members will note the parallel I am drawing.  Similarly, a small number of multinational corporations do not like our new postcode system because it does not fit their systems.  They do not want to spend money changing their systems to suit it and, therefore, they will shout loudly to try to persuade us to change our postcodes to suit them.  It may appear that I am being cynical, but I think that is exactly what is going on.  It is a similar debate.  </p><p>  I do not believe the emergency services have an issue with the Eircode system as it is proposed.  When the Eircode system is implemented, a person living in a rural area who has to telephone for an ambulance can give his or her Eircode over the phone and the ambulance driver will be able to drive straight to their door and avoid having to drive up and down a country lane looking for a house that may be in off the road and cannot be seen from the main road.  Similarly, we have hundreds of delivery vans in rural areas.</p> <p>More than 100 of them will drive up and down the road on the phone to a customer, looking for directions and one can apply that to other courier firms and postal operations, whereas if they can phone a customer and ask them for their Eircode, the driver can put it into the satellite navigation system and drive straight to their door.  It will save us time and fuel and it will be better for the environment and everything else.  I very much recommend the proposed system.  It has been well thought-out and is particularly suited to Irish conditions.  </p></speech>

I have a huge issue in south and east Limerick with postal addresses in Charleville in county Cork and Tipperary, so I know exactly what he is talking about.  One of his competitors recently stopped me in the street while I was in the village of Athea in west Limerick with an address that is practically down beside the town of Newcastlewest, about ten miles away.  To return to Deputy Moynihan's question, Mr. Tuohy is before the committee today to give a different perspective on some of the criticism, which may or may not be justified.  That is what we are to find out.  Has Nightline looked at some of the alternative technologies that were suggested, and used them to see whether they would be a more efficient way of delivering the same thing?  I am not necessarily referring to the postcode model in the UK, but we have received a great deal of correspondence on alternatives to Eircode, which would do "what it says on the tin", as Ronseal says, but for much less money.  We have a scrutiny role, which is to see whether the tendering was as it should have been, whether the technology is up to speed with what it should be and whether the outcome for customers like Nightline and the person receiving the parcel, the ambulance or the letter from the Deputy is satisfactory.  Before Nightline committed itself to supporting this initiative, did it look at other options and assess whether they fitted Nightline's needs?</p></speech>

The address of all the townlands around there is Newcastlewest, regardless of where they are.  It is another very good example.  I believe the Department received a number of tenders and gave all of them a fair assessment, so I am comfortable with that.  The most important consideration in implementing a public postcode system like this is that the national postal operator can use it.  If we brought out a new technology that An Post could not use - I know it is not the only stakeholder in this - we would struggle to get people to adopt it in the market.  The proposed system is not perfect for everyone's use but it is good enough for everyone to subscribe to.  We will all have to tweak our systems and our processes to adapt to it, but at least most of the stakeholders in the market have signed up and said that it is a good idea.  During the consultation period, when the Department and its advisers came to talk to us about this, the first thing I said to them was that we want a system that An Post can work with, because if An Post does not adopt this we will struggle to get it off the ground.  An Post attended the previous hearing and it has said that it is a good system and it can work with it too.  The alternatives were assessed by the Department and its advisers at the time.  What we have come up with is fast to deploy.  As it is so fast and easy to deploy, without getting involved in renaming or numbering or anything else, it will also be the lowest cost.</p><p>  We are well overdue this.  We are the only developed country in the world without a postcode system.  We hear a great deal of talk about our smart economy and how we want to be the latest and greatest, rolling out broadband and so on.  We are doing all this in the absence of a key piece of infrastructure, namely, a national postcode system.  The solution the Department came up with is innovative.  It is new, because every address has a unique identifier, which is not the same in other markets, but it is quick to deploy and will generate the lowest costs.  That must also be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

Is this something the industry as a whole can absorb?  It must obviously invest in its own technologies in order to avail of the code system.  Will it impact adversely on the sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tuohy" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014121000006#E00500"><p>There will be some capital investment in integrating the system and adapting our processes to use it.  However, the benefits in terms of reducing fuel consumption, improving productivity and so on are huge, because one will be able to find addresses quickly, without driving up and down a rural road.   Many of my van drivers in rural areas would echo this.  They spend a great deal of time driving a commercial vehicle up a narrow rural road, getting to one end of it, turning around and driving back down the other side and then having to ring the customer for more directions.  The long-term benefits of eliminating all that far outweigh the initial investment required to implement this.  If we were a multinational, I would have to change a system that covers every country in Europe just for the Irish market.  I would probably have reservations about that.  However, for the Irish conditions and for operations whose business is primarily in Ireland, it will be a boon and a significant improvement.  The benefits will far outweigh the required investment.</p></speech>

We are getting a different message from them than we got from the Road Hauliers Association.  I have two issues with the Eircode system.  The overall issue is that I do not quite understand.  I always look for simplicity and to my simple mind we are looking at a system under which one has a code that links a building or a place with the terrestrial co-ordinates and one should do it in the most efficient way possible to set up and maintain.  I have some questions on the whole project, the initiation, analysis, testing, design, testing, the proof of concept, implementation, which people and companies were involved in it and at what stages they were involved, and so on, but that is not the concern of this meeting and I am looking at that separately.</p><p>  Nightline and the Road Hauliers Association have a broadly similar function.  Both are travelling around and going to addresses.  I am sure it makes sense for both organisations that one would deliver to houses in a row of houses if one has a parcel for more than one house on a street or in a row, and yet one of the two organisations came before us and said that the bottom line is that the system is not useable.  Now Mr. Tuohy is saying not only that it is useable, but that it is probably the best solution to what Nightline does.  There is a conflict of views.  I know Mr. Tuohy has put forward some rationale, but I am not sure I fully understand it.  The first concern, therefore, is that the system is not sequential and people cannot plan routes based on it.</p><p>  The second major concern that was put forward is the cost and the effort of maintaining that table of addresses.</p> <p>Every time a new address is added, will it involve maintenance of a series of tables, because someplace within the system there must be a table that links to the terrestrial co-ordinates?  Every time a new address is added, somebody must create the link between the code for the new address and the terrestrial code, unless it is done automatically through Google Maps or some other way.  This may be an unfair question for Nightline, since it was not involved in this part of the development, but I have one further question to do with this.  When the system was designed, did anybody from the design team talk to Nightline about how it operates or how it plans its routes and deliveries?  Did anybody have that discussion with it or was there any testing of the concept in a live situation?  If this happened, what feedback came from it?  Has Nightline any information on the cost of maintaining an updated table of codes for these geographic areas?</p><p> At least one of the five emergency organisations has serious concerns regarding the usability and safety of Eircode and I intend to talk to them about those concerns.  I have many other questions, but Nightline is not in a position to answer all of them.  I am puzzled as to why two organisations, basically in the same business, have such different views on Eircode.  One says it is of no use, while the other says it is very useful and probably the best solution.</p></speech>

On the issue of sequencing, this discussion only arises if we assume we do not have modern technology available.  Once every property in the country has a label or code and we know where it is, then it is possible to sequence the delivery route of a driver or postal operator.  The first part of the Eircode, the three starting digits, is what we consider a high level code.  This will refer to an area.  We will have 139 of these "routing codes" as Eircode calls them, but I call them high level postcodes.  Therefore, the country will be divided into 139 areas.  Currently, when we sort parcels at our hub in Finglas, we can only sort parcels into 26 areas, by county, which is inefficient.  Now, we will have 139 subdivisions, which is quite enough.  In the UK system I mentioned earlier, covering the whole of the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, there are only 124 high level post codes.</p></speech>

There are only 124 of those covering all of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  Therefore, 139 is enough for Ireland.</p><p>  The great benefit of this system lies in the flexibility designed into it to add more of those if we want more granularity or more subdivisions.  If we want more, we can increase the number without having to redesign the entire system.  In terms of sequencing, within those areas, once we have modern technology available - as all businesses have now, even it is down to using a tool such as Google Maps - sequencing and routing is possible.  Therefore, I do not accept the argument against that.</p></speech>

This was a joint effort by Ordnance Survey Ireland and An Post in the 1990s, 15 to 20 years ago.  This address database is already in existence, which is another reason this is such a cost effective way to introduce the Eircode system as proposed.  These geocodes referred to by the Deputy - that database - already exists and is already maintained jointly by Ordnance Survey Ireland and An Post.  Therefore, even today, if new properties are created, they are already being added to that database.  What Eircode will do is just add another column to that database, adding the Eircode to those properties.  Therefore, I do not see how an issue arises, as this database is being maintained already and people can subscribe to that service and get the new geodirectory updates that issue four times a year.</p></speech>

The Freight Transport Association Ireland has been very vocal in its opposition to this and on its website it mentions being consulted by the former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, in 2012.  It has been involved in the consultation process also.  I believe its issue is that while we were all involved in the information gathering side of the process.  The Department took everybody's views on board - it certainly took ours on board - and then produced this system based on those views.  An Post had different requirements to what we had, the emergency services had different requirements and Irish speaking people and people of Gaeltacht areas had their concerns about retaining their names and so on.  I believe the Department did a good job of taking all views on board and of coming up with a system that satisfies most of everyone's requirements.</p></speech>

The system as designed is a good system and is innovative and workable, but its implementation is the key issue.  The company that has been awarded the contract to implement it is Capita and it now needs to work with the stakeholders to ensure it brings everybody's concerns on board at this stage.  Possibly, it would be advisable for it to conduct a pilot before it goes live throughout the country.  This is to do with implementation rather than design.  The design is sound, but we need to watch carefully how it is implemented and ensure the views and concerns of all the stakeholders are taken on board.</p></speech>

It is said a picture paints a thousand words.</p> <p>On the Malahide Road and Swords Road anomaly, I entirely understand the proposition but how will this be addressed?  The witness is correct that sometimes there is an ingrained familiarity in the Irish mindset.  Often when a building in rural Ireland ceases to function as it did previously it retains its former title in some way; for example, if a building formerly functioned as a post office the likelihood is it will still be known as the "old post office".  This can be quite confusing when one considers how buildings are situated in towns and villages and how they are named.  How can this be addressed?</p><p> I know Ballymacarbry in west Waterford and I am very familiar with Clonmel.  I asked myself whether there is another Ballymacarbry near Clonmel because people in west Cork take the N25 to Ballymacarbry and the M8 to Clonmel.  Will the recognition of postal areas cause confusion when a postcode system is introduced?  Will there be a division?</p><p> How realistic is numbering properties and renaming roads?  I have huge reservations about this process, not least because of the traditional method of recognising placenames and areas.  If we do not number properties and rename roads, will it adversely affect the roll-out of postcodes?  Is this process realistic?  It might be fine in Malahide, Swords and urban areas but it may be unrealistic in rural areas, though I would welcome views to the contrary.</p></speech>

For clarity, the Eircode system means this is not necessary.</p></speech>

For example, on postal addresses, Ballymacarbry is the postal address for Pinewood Healthcare and it would not be necessary to change this.  The great thing about Eircode is it means things do not have to change.  I am sure Deputies would rather not deal with people who are concerned about name changes to their roads, towns and areas.  Many placenames in Ireland are local and do not appear on official records.  The people of Ballymacarbry decided to drop the letter "e" from the placename, though the official name contains an "e".  We do not have to change things like that because the beauty of the Eircode system is we can put a code on everything and keep the name, whether it be in Irish or English.  The spelling of a placename could be based on local customs passed down through generations and this will remain the case because the Eircode means nothing need change and people need not be upset.  This is the beauty of the proposed system.</p></speech>

I have not mentioned the issue of common placenames in Ireland but, for example, I think there is a place called Grange in every county.  There is a Kill in every county and there are many Kilmores.  All of these names can remain because the Eircode is unique for each address and we need not upset people by changing placenames or the names of roads.</p></speech>

The witnesses presented a very good case supporting postcodes but do they have reservations on the roll-out?</p></speech>

The company awarded a contract must step up to the plate, make itself visible and speak to stakeholders who have concerns regarding how the system will work.  The design is sound and it does not need to be revisited as it suits Irish conditions.  Implementation is the key and it is important that we inform people of their Eircodes and the importance of using them.  The industry must address the roll-out and deal with stakeholder concerns on implementation.</p><p>  There will always be people who doubt the prospects for success of a major infrastructure project like this.  When the Luas was proposed for Dublin some media reports suggested it would be an unused white elephant but every Luas tram I see is packed and there is now talk of expanding the scheme.  There are always doubts ahead of major infrastructure projects and minority voices that do a good job of being heard in the media do not help.  We must press on with this because the pitfalls lie in implementation so that is where we must be careful.</p></speech>

Mr. Tuohy may not be able to answer my question on implementation because Capita has the contract.  How long will it take to implement this?  What kind of interaction with the public is required?  I am sure some people will use a normal address and leave out the postcode because that is how they have always done it.  Will letters be returned if postcodes are not used?</p><p>  The witnesses mentioned that there are many gaps between houses in Ireland and that using a number system would require changes.  How was this done in the UK?  They are still building in the UK so I am curious.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-10a.598" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tuohy" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014121000008#G01000"><p>The UK system is very contentious.  If one starts numbering everything in a rural area that previously had neither names nor numbers one must decide which house will be number one and which number 13.  Even before one names a road, these are contentious issues.  Eircode avoids such problems because they can slow down implementation.  In the UK they use subdivisions and add letters to numbers.  That system might slot properties along a rural road under the numbers 10, 10A, 10B, 10C and so on.</p><p>  Regarding implementation, we are ready to go.  We deal with many online retailers because many customers shop online.  During the initial phase addresses without an Eircode will be tolerated by all operators because we cannot simply assume that everyone will use the system from the start.  Modern technology provides tools that enable us to clean addresses.  If we get an address without an Eircode we can do a best match and get the Eircode from the national database that is already maintained.</p><p>  Emergency services are a different matter because it will be very advantageous to them if a caller from a rural area can give an Eircode.  An ambulance, for example, will be able to come straight to a door without further information.</p><p>  Again, implementation and communication with the public are the most important things.  A person needs to know his or her Eircode and should pin it up in the kitchen so it can be referred to in an emergency, if an ambulance is coming or if a courier phones looking for directions.  People living in rural areas are blue in the face, particularly at this time of year, from dealing with couriers seeking directions on the phone.  Many people order items for Christmas online and if they live in obscure rural areas and must constantly give directions it can be frustrating.  It will be very helpful to simply give one's Eircode to repairmen, doctors, couriers and delivery men as they can enter the code in a cheap, widely available piece of equipment, like a satellite navigation system, and drive straight to the door.  It will be a revolution when it comes to services for rural communities.</p></speech>

It is revolutionary, it is not like the postcodes in other countries.  For rural communities in particular, being able to access services at low cost, from deliveries to repair men, is going to revolutionise how we deal with customers living in rural areas.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the issues Mr. Tuohy has articulated so well.  I recall in one area we had five different families with the exact same name and surname.  Trying to get successful deliveries to those people was a nightmare.  Equally, where I live, in Castletownbere, frequently we would have Castletownbere, Castletownkinneigh, Castletownroche and Castletownsend all thrown into the mix and about 5% of mis-sorts or misdirected items would be just because there was confusion with the names.</p></speech>

If the public do not have confidence in the use of the postcode it will be the biggest inhibiting factor to a successful roll-out.  I take the point about Capita.</p><p> Some operators did have genuine concerns and we have to take those as they are, but it seems to me that a trend has emerged whereby the high-volume operators like An Post and Nightline are more in favour of this code and those with fewer or larger items seem to have a difficulty.  The implementation will be key and the public buy-in will be absolutely important.  I am thinking of the public confidence.</p><p>  To conclude, I think we have given the issue a very good airing and I thank Mr. Tuohy and Mr. Murray for their attendance and engagement.
