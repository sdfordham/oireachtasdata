    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#A00600"><p>On behalf of Age Action, I thank the committee for its invitation.  In my opening comments I will focus on the gender gap in State pensions, especially the implications of the changes introduced to the pension system in budget 2012.  My colleague and I are perfectly happy to take questions on broader policy issues related to budget 2018.<br/><br/>I am the senior policy officer at Age Action.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Justin Moran, head of advocacy and communications.  I lead the organisation's policy team.  Of critical importance to this work is capturing the lived experience of older people in Ireland.  For some time we have been contacted by women pensioners who have highlighted injustices in the current pension system.  On foot of such contacts, in 2016 we commissioned research on the impact of changes that took effect in 2012 related to the eligibility criteria for receipt of the State contributory pension.  One woman said:</p><blockquote>I was so shocked, angry and annoyed when I first heard the amount I was to be awarded, it brought back the anger I felt in 1972 when I had to leave my job.  I believe I am being penalised for caring for my children.</blockquote> <p>Another woman said:</p><blockquote>I was devastated when I received the letter outlining how much I would receive.  I am so angry that they have taken the few contributions I made while a student into the averaging.  The system is grossly unjust and it is not there to ensure a just and adequate pension but rather to reduce the State's obligation as far as possible.</blockquote> <p>These quotes are from women who participated in Age Action's research project, Towards a Fair State Pension for Women Pensioners.  They are merely a sample of the many who have contacted us.  For many of the current generation of older women, legal restrictions, cultural norms and practices during their working lives meant that they often gave up work on marriage or to look after their children.  Their contributions to the pay related social insurance system can, therefore, be broken.  When averaged, their reduced number of contributions means that they are awarded a lower weekly rate of State pension than they would have expected.  A gender breakdown of State pension recipients is illustrative of this, as women are more likely to be claiming a non-contributory rather than a contributory pension payment.  For example, in 2015 a total of 62% of recipients of the State non-contributory means-tested pension were women.  The trends are reversed in the case of the State contributory pension, with 64% of recipients being men.  A typographical error was included in the submission to the committee on this point.</p><p>Overall, however, the breakdown is 50:50, in other words, pension recipients are divided equally between men and women.  However, we see these disaggregated gender issues when we look at the contributory and non-contributory system.</p><p> A further gender disaggregation across the contributory payment bands indicates that only one third of all female recipients of this payment receive the top weekly rate versus two thirds of all male recipients.  The overall gendered nature of accessing contributory and non-contributory pension payments was also evident in 2011.  This is not, therefore, a recent phenomenon.  From 2012 onwards, changes in the eligibility criteria of the contributory State pension made it increasingly difficult to access the top rate of payment, as indicated in table 1 of the presentation.  This is mainly because the weekly pension rate is calculated on the average number of contributions made over a working life.  The table shows the differences and band changes introduced in 2012, on which I will make some brief comments.</p><p> Originally, there were four band payments.  In 2012, band 2, which was the band of between 20 and 47 average yearly contributions, was split in three.  Until 2012, a person would receive 98% of the payment if he or she fell within this band.  However, after the band was split into three, a person who made 20 contributions would only receive 85% of the top rate of the payment.  </p><p> The rate of payment made to those in bands 3 and 4, which are now bands 5 and 6, was also reduced in 2012.  I will cite the example of an individual who worked for a few months in 1968 before leaving the workforce to raise a family, during which time she did not make contributions, and subsequently returned to work in 2000.  The average number of pension contributions she made would be divided by 48, which is the number of years between 1968 and 2016.  In effect, the weekly pension rate would be much higher if the individual had not worked in 1968 as the average would be divided out over only 16 years.  This means the woman in the example and women like her are being punished financially for choices they made decades ago.  They are also losing out because the homemaker's scheme, introduced in 1994, is not backdated.  As a result, these women, who would generally have carried out their caring duties in the 1970s and 1980s, derive no benefit from the scheme.</p><p> Age Action's research on this issue identified 36,000 individuals - one third of new pensioners - who had been negatively impacted by these changes between September 2012 and June 2016.  This figure is now undoubtedly higher, and of this number, 62% were women.  Those most negatively impacted have lost more than &euro;30 per week or more than &euro;1,500 per year.  It should also be noted that many male pensioners have lost out as a result of the changes introduced in 2012 because their contributions were also broken.</p><p> Age Action urges the joint committee, in its role of providing Oireachtas oversight of the budgetary process, to consider two recommendations.  First, the changes introduced in 2012 should be reversed and backdated in order that those currently affected are placed in the pre-2012 bands again, at least until moves are made towards the total contributions assessment approach planned by the Department of Social Protection for 2020.  The second recommendation, which is perhaps a more long-term objective, is that the committee examine ways in which changes could be made to the budget to eliminate the gender pension gap, including the backdating of the homemaker's scheme to 1973 when the marriage ban ended.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00200"><p>I thank Ms Feely for her presentation, which told us much of what we know.  We have been hearing the same thing every year since 2013.  Ms Feely spoke about a generation of women who have been let down by the State through the marriage ban and the absence of child care options.  Notwithstanding the poor provision of child care now, child care was non-existent for many of the women in question.  The changes made in 2012 are the final insult.</p> <p>  Age Action makes two recommendations.  What would be the cost of reversing the 2012 changes and backdating payments?  How many people would be affected if the recommendation to backdate the homemaker's scheme to 1968 or 1973 were implemented and how much would such a measure cost?</p> <p>  I will focus briefly on a number of non-pension issues that affect older people.  Fuel poverty is frequently raised, specifically the fact that the fuel allowance is not paid from March onwards, despite April often being a cold month, as was the case this year.  Is the impact of this issue increasing in terms of Age Action's daily case book?</p> <p>  As the budgetary process recommences, what are Age Action's key priorities for older people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00300"><p>First, on the reversal and backdating of the changes, our information from replies to parliamentary questions presented to the D&aacute;il is that the changes achieved annual savings of &euro;10 million.  If the changes were to be reversed today, it would cost approximately &euro;60 million.  If payments were backdated for those who have been impacted since 2012, the cost would be approximately &euro;200 million.  However, we would need to have updated figures to be precise.  Reversing the change would, however, cost &euro;60 million.</p></speech>

The latest figures from the Department show the cost of backdating the scheme would be &euro;290 million.  When the Department provided this information in the D&aacute;il it did not make clear on what year the figure was based.  We are trying to determine the year on which the figure on the cost of backdating is based.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00500"><p>What year is Age Action proposing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00600"><p>The 2007 Green Paper on pensions referred to backdating the scheme to 1973 and provided a figure of approximately &euro;150 million.  The paper acknowledged, however, that its figures were not calculated in detail.  Since January, the Department has been indicating that it has done much more substantial work on how it would backdate the homemaker's scheme and has provided an estimate of &euro;290 million for doing so.  However, it is not clear which year it used as the basis for backdating, nor is it clear how many people would take it up.</p> <p>  Ms Feely will address fuel poverty, after which I will discuss some of our other priorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00700"><p>A major issue in respect of the fuel allowance is that the scheme has not been very responsive to the increase in fuel prices.  We are often contacted by telephone by older people living alone who may have lost a spouse in the recent past but still face paying the same energy costs.  The scheme needs to be responsive to such cases and this will certainly be one our priority areas when we make our budget submission.</p> <p>  The fuel allowance is highly effective as an income support, although it does not address rising costs.  What we would like to see is a broader strategy and increased support for making homes more energy efficient.  In preparing for this meeting I read some work done on energy poverty by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  It examined the different costs depending on the building energy rating, BER, of houses.  It found that in the case of an energy efficient house, a household might spend &euro;35 per week and these costs would be met by the current rate of the fuel allowance.  However, those in energy inefficient homes, for example, a house with a rating of BER E1, would pay approximately &euro;83 per week to heat their house.  The allowance is not responsive to these differences.</p> <p>  Another issue we encounter with the fuel allowance is that it would be preferable if it were paid in one or two lump sums.  Making this change would be straightforward.  Older people tend to live in houses that require them to fill a tank of oil which costs a couple of hundred euro.  It is very hard to save up a little each week or pay out &euro;100 or &euro;200 for an oil delivery.  In many submissions to the Department we have encouraged the payment of the allowance in one or two lump sums.  Not everybody will be able to use the payment to buy coal or briquettes every week, which is fine, but we would like the scheme to be administered in that way.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran will elaborate on Age Action's priorities in a moment.  With regard to social protection, we would like the 2012 changes to be reversed and moves to be made towards setting a rate for the State pension of 35% of average earnings.  We will ask again, therefore, for the pension to be increased.  One of the critical issues is the need to review the living alone allowance.  The Vincentian Partnership has done good research on adequacy which found that pensioners who live alone have inadequate incomes.  We will ask again for an increase in the living alone allowance to take account of energy costs which may previously have been covered by two pensions or by one pensioner and another qualifying adult.</p><p>Food costs do not automatically halve for a person living alone and the figures indicate that while two-pensioner households may spend &euro;80 per week on food, this only falls to &euro;64 for a pensioner living alone.  These are the key things on the income side that we will be looking at.  Mr. Moran will speak about the health priorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#C00200"><p>Our big focus in regard to health is on home care.  Government policy since the late 1960s has been that people be assisted to stay home as far as possible and that the care and supports should be available to enable this.  Unfortunately, in the past number of years there has been a reduction in the amount of home help hours provided.  The HSE will provide fewer home help hours to fewer people in 2017 than in 2011.  A real concern is that the number of people who need it is continuously increasing.  The HSE's estimate is that between 10% and 11% of people aged 65 will need home help supports, which works out at approximately 63,000 people.  We are supplying home help support to some 50,000 people at present so there is a gap between what the HSE anticipates and what we are fulfilling.</p> <p>  In the immediate future we seek an injection of funding to support home help, as 4,500 people are on a waiting list for home help hours or home care packages and that number will grow.  We welcome the effort of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy McEntee, to move forward with a consultation on a statutory scheme to provide home care, which is badly needed.  We look forward to participating in the scheme but it is a medium to long-term solution.  The immediate problem concerns people who are in hospitals and who cannot get home help hours and family carers who do amazing work but who are driven right to the edge to support people.  Social workers tell us they are waiting for recipients of home help hours to die to free up home help hours they can reallocate.</p> <p>  The budget for home help is &euro;192 million and we will be looking for an increase, though we have not come up with a specific figure yet.  The HSE has also indicated that it will be looking for investment in this area.</p></speech>

Can families afford it?  The recent Bus &Eacute;ireann strike highlighted the irrelevance of the bus pass for a lot of older people because they could not access transport.  What feedback did the witnesses receive from member organisations on this issue?</p></speech>

People are now waiting an average of four weeks for their application to be processed and that is as good as can be expected.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#C00600"><p>We would agree with the principle but would have question marks about how it would work.  To access the fair deal scheme, for example, a person needs to pass a care needs assessment and be assessed as having a level of care that could only be treated in a nursing home.  Many people who need home help support would not meet that criterion.  Second, with the fair deal scheme, part of the payments are made with a levy on the family home on the basis that one is not in the family home any more but in a nursing home.  Home help, on the other hand, is received at home.  We will be arguing for a statutory scheme specifically designed for home help and home care, rather than that the fair deal scheme be adapted to fit.  They are quite different processes.</p> <p>  We need to avoid setting nursing homes and home care against each other.  We need a continuum of care and many older people will never need any home help or home care supports.  A percentage will need home help and a percentage will need home care while some will need to go into nursing homes.  Consequently, we need investment in quality nursing homes.  The funding for fair deal and the application process are working reasonably well at the moment.</p> <p>  As regards transport, we have an information helpline available to people to contact us on benefits entitlements etc.  With the threat of the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike we got a large number of phone calls, particularly from people in rural communities who were concerned about how it would affect them.  As Ms Feely mentioned, one of the differences between the incomes of pensioners in rural areas and those in urban areas is transport and we have dealt with a lot of people who have raised the issue of car insurance.  They may be eligible for the travel pass but they do not have public transport so it does not make much of a difference to them.  They need to keep a car on the road and to pay for petrol or diesel and car insurance.  These transport costs are an issue for a lot of older people.</p></speech>

What is he looking for in that scheme?  There are issues with the fair deal scheme.  What specific issues need to be addressed in that scheme and in respect of the supports that should underpin it?</p> <p>  Dementia care comes up on a regular basis when I deal with advocate groups for older people.

I apologise to Mr. Moran.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran touched on the changes made in 2012 to the State pension.  Have they been costed?  How much would it cost if we were to reverse the changes made to the bands?  Is the transition pension an issue for older people, or one on which Mr. Moran has been lobbied?  How does it affect people?  Should it be a priority in the upcoming budget?  His organisation has put forward alternative budgets in the past.  Has this issue ever featured?</p> <p>  There were a lot of secondary welfare cuts, including to pensioners, with home care packages and telephone allowances cut, among other things.  Of those, which are the key ones that impact on older people and which the witnesses would like to see reversed?</p></speech>

If a person is in a nursing home, under the fair deal scheme bed and board will be covered but that person will have to pay additional charges out of income.  Under the fair deal scheme, one pays 80% of income to the nursing home and retains 20% but we encounter people who are obliged to pay for everything, from incontinence pads to extra GP services and social activities, out of the 20% of income they are allowed to retain.</p><p>We are working on a piece of more detailed research in this area which we hope to publish in the coming weeks.  We have certainly had experience of people on low incomes who, under fair deal, are supposed to have their choice of nursing home, but who find their choices severely restricted because of the income with which they would be left and the charges with which they would be faced.</p><p> In respect of the consultation on home care, Age Action Ireland and about 14 or 15 other NGOs have put together a discussion document which we sent to the Minister and to the political parties' health spokespersons.  It identifies the issues we would like to see addressed in the home care consultation.  They include clearly defining home care, ensuring we can include assistive technology in the provision of home care, and ensuring it is person centred and geared towards individual need.  The consultation must also take account of the needs of the workers providing home help and home care.  One of the unfortunate changes of recent years has been the reduction in the amount of time that each home help worker has for a client.  There are people who might get 15 minutes in the morning and the evening.  That can be very difficult for the worker and, obviously, for the client.</p><p> Another issue that must be addressed if we are to introduce a statutory home care scheme is how we are going to pay for it.  However, we are hoping that the consultation does not focus primarily on that but rather on reaching agreement and consensus about a vision of home help and home care.  We must also address the point made about people with dementia who need home help supports specific to that condition.  Once we have that overall vision, we will figure out how to pay for it.  It might require increased funds from general taxation or co-payments.  We will approach that with an open mind.  We would, however, be very concerned about any attempt to means test such a scheme.  Many of our members have had quite negative experiences of medical cards in that respect.</p><p> On the costing of the State pension for 2012, if it was restored in 2017 it would cost just over &euro;60 million.  That is bringing everybody who lost out from 2012 to 2017 back into the bands they would have been in.  The per annum cost of maintaining them in those rates would be around &euro;10 million going forward.  On the issue of the transition pension, I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Naomi Feely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#D00200"><p>Coming back to the Deputy's question on the dementia strategy, my understanding is that there is an implementation plan.  While we have the national positive ageing strategy, a big issue on which Age Action Ireland has campaigned is the lack of an implementation plan for it.  As far as I am aware, there is an implementation plan for the dementia strategy.  We have only finite resources for our own work.  We tend to collaborate with Alzheimer's Ireland a lot.  It has done quite a bit of work on this area so it might be worthwhile for the committee to link in with Alzheimer's Ireland too.</p> <p>  The transition pension was abolished in budget 2014, I think, or perhaps it was in the previous budget.  It is no longer available to recipients.  It is a big issue for us that a public sector worker is required to retire at 65 but is not entitled to a pension until the age of 66.  We hear a lot from people who are forced to retire from their jobs and have to go to the social welfare office and apply for jobseeker's benefit there.  As the committee is aware, there are conditions attached to that benefit.  We are aware - it was in a newspaper article a few years ago - that people are not really forced to go out looking for a job.  Nonetheless, it seems a little unclear to me.  We have done quite a bit of work around the issue of mandatory retirement and have called for its abolition.  That would be the key issue in respect of the transition pension which, obviously, is no longer available.  There might have been one or two people still on the payment in 2015 but that is not the case for this year or last year.</p> <p>  The point about secondary cuts is very important.  Our work on previous budgets highlighted that while the State pension was protected, when we added up all the little income cuts such as the fuel allowance, the abolition of the telephone allowance, and the changes in the electricity portion of the household benefits package, older people who were solely relying on the State pension and those supports were facing a cut of &euro;13 per week.  That was on top of the introduction of the carbon tax.  We also had water charges.  A lot of fear was created among our members.  Our submission last year called for the reintroduction of the telephone allowance.  It is a vital support, allowing people to stay connected through pendant alarms, to phone younger relatives abroad and so on.  This year, we are focusing on the fuel allowance and the living alone allowance.  The living alone allowance was introduced at a rate of &pound;6, which was converted up to &euro;7.70 when the euro was introduced.  Since then, we have only seen one increase, to &euro;9.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice research from three years ago indicates that it should be around &euro;11.50.  We will be emphasising the issue this year and teasing out the costs.  Individuals living alone are facing the same costs as a pensioner couple.</p> <p>  Was there another question from Deputy Cullinane?</p></speech>

I have heard their contributions at the Committee on Social Protection and am familiar with their work.  I thank Age Action Ireland for the work it does for our older population.  Older people have been hit detrimentally by the changes introduced in budget 2012.  One of my first pieces of work as a newly elected Deputy was to bring forward a motion on pension equality and fairness, which sought to address some of those changes, particularly for female pensioners.  The witnesses' submission today highlights those changes from budget 2012.  It shows that 62% of recipients receiving the non-contributory pension were women.  The Government knew exactly what the repercussions and implications of this measure would be, and that it would increase the pensions gender gap.</p> <p>  The qualifying age for the State pension was also increased to 66, as Ms Feely just said.  People have worked all their lives and paid their contributions, yet at the end the goalposts have been shifted.  They have been forced onto jobseeker's payments.  The latest figures from the Department show that at the end of January this year, there were 5,239 65 year olds forced to sign on.  That should be enough to set off alarm bells.  We know the impact it has.  People who should be receiving their State pension in full are receiving about &euro;40 less on the jobseeker's payment.  Many of them never signed on for social welfare before in their lives.  I brought forward the pensions equality and fairness motion to try to address these anomalies and reverse the unfair changes that were made in 2012.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was defeated not just by the Government; Fianna F&aacute;il voted against the motion as well.

Unfortunately, that motion fell.  We know the changes introduced in 2012 have impacted on over 36,000 people, who are now receiving lower payments than they would have received had they retired in 2012.  Do the witnesses have any updated figures aside from those dated 2016?  I think they say in their statement that it is expected and understandable that the figures would increase.  Was that critical research that Age Action carried out sent to the Department and the Minister?  If so, was it acknowledged, and did the Minister give any feedback on it?</p> <p>  Age Action puts forward a very important and very simple proposal on the fuel allowance.  It would be paid in either one lump payment or two lump payments.  I put this very point to the Minister and I do not think he really got it.  He could not differentiate between someone in receipt of the State pension and someone on a basic jobseeker's.  He said he would not consider the proposal because of the challenges and difficulties it would create.  The simple point there is that if someone - for example, a young person - signs on, it is hoped he or she will not be on jobseeker's for too long.  The simple thing would be to differentiate perhaps between someone who is 65 and someone who is 66 or older.  Whether to issue a one-lump payment or a two-lump payment could be considered.  We know the challenges people face if they want to get fills of oil.  One cannot pay on a weekly basis; it is an up-front payment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.60" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#E01800"><p>I will take the questions in reverse order.</p> <p>  A draft copy of the report was sent to the Department of Social Protection in advance to get its comment, feedback and information.  Then, once it was published, copies were sent to the Minister and the Department.  We received an acknowledgement from the Minister.  We have not had an opportunity to discuss the report with him but we have discussed it with officials from the Department of Social Protection as recently as Monday as part of a bilateral meeting with the community and voluntary pillar.</p> <p>  Regarding updated figures, we wanted to use the figures we had in the report because the Department gave us them quite specifically.  I believe a parliamentary question about this was asked last year.  I forget the exact figure, but more than 40,000 were affected by the cuts from 2012.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's last point about the transition pension and mandatory retirement, it is a very good example perhaps not of a budgetary cross-cutting theme, but certainly a Government cross-cutting theme.  A decision was made to increase the State pension age to 66 by abolishing the transition pension - in effect, that was what was done - and it will increase to 67 and then to 68, but mandatory retirement clauses were left uncut.  If one does one and not the other, one then ends up with the anomaly the Deputy has pointed out, namely, the large number of people aged 65 on jobseeker's benefit.  If an increase in the pension age were to be considered, the abolition of mandatory retirement ages should be considered.  This will get worse when the pension age increases again to 67 in 2021.  Obviously, we are hopeful legislation seeking to abolish mandatory retirement will be enacted - I believe Deputies introduced such legislation - but this is one example of a Department doing one thing and not necessarily thinking through how it might affect another Department.</p></speech>

People were forced to retire at 65 and sign up to a jobseeker's payment.  The cost of reinstating the State transition pension is in and around &euro;84 million, but abolishing the mandatory retirement age would dramatically reduce that I think.  Perhaps the witnesses can elaborate on the impact on people of their having to retire against their will.  People should be given the choice to continue working.  Females should be able build up their contributions.  Regarding the changes introduced in 2012, if they want to continue in the workforce, they should have an opportunity to do so, build up their contributions and get higher payments.  I am sure there are a multitude of reasons people may not want to retire, and perhaps the witnesses will be able to outline some of them.  I have spoken to many people about this.  Mr. Moran is right that I have introduced a Bill to abolish the mandatory retirement age.  Thankfully, it received cross-party support.  It is due to proceed to Committee Stage and I hope it will continue to proceed through all Stages until the mandatory retirement age is abolished.  Perhaps the witnesses could give their experiences of engaging with older people and the impact being forced to retire has on them.</p></speech>

They may still have mortgages, loans and family members going to college.  They do not necessarily want to work for the rest of their lives but they would like to work an extra few years to be financially secure.  From a budgetary or economic perspective, there is also the difference between someone working at the age of 65 and someone being 65 years old and in the social welfare system.  One of the challenges we often find when we talk about the issues Age Action wants to raise is that we talk about pensions, home help and home care and nursing homes.  We miss the fact sometimes that older people have an enormous amount to contribute.  These are skilled, experienced and trained workers.  One case that has always stuck in my memory is a HSE nurse who was forced to retire due to a mandatory retirement clause at the same time as we were trying to attract nurses into this country.  There is a financial and economic imperative in that regard.  Instead of a worker being put on the dole and then the State pension, if he or she wishes to continue working, paying tax and helping to drive the economy forward, that would be a positive thing.  We also hear, certainly from research conducted in Britain, that a large part of the reason people want to keep working is social as well.  These are their friends and colleagues.  People attach a huge sense of value to that.  To be told at the age of 65, "It is your birthday, you are done, it is time to go", is a real blow to the self-esteem and pride of the people affected by the situation.</p></speech>

Previous to the introduction of Deputy Brady's Bill, Anne Ferris, a Member of the previous D&aacute;il, also introduced a Bill on this matter.  There was a very good committee discussion with people who had been impacted by the situation.  I remember hearing at the launch of the report individuals - Deputies and Senators - saying they were very much struck by the powerful nature of the contributions that day.  In addition, through our lifelong learning work, we have a very good group in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and the individual charged with setting that up wrote a brilliant blog on our website about the issue of mandatory retirement, describing how on a Friday he was in work running an embassy office in Finland, on the Saturday he was packing up his boxes to leave and, on the Monday, he came home.  It very much captures the lived impact of the situation.  As for Age Action's work, we strongly rely on the lived impact of policies in trying to get our message across and in examining recommendations to Government surrounding these issues.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late and missing their contribution but I read their statement.  As others have done, I commend Age Action on its ongoing representation of, and advocacy for, older people in this country.</p><p>A major issue which we all have heard about, and on which I have received representations, is the number of pensioners, particularly women pensioners, who have been significantly adversely affected by the changes introduced to the way the contributions to the contributory pension scheme are calculated combined with the lifetime average method of calculating ultimate entitlement and the failure to backdate the period spent as a homemaker to those who left the workforce before the specified dates by the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton in 2012.  People have been dealt a triple whammy, which has negatively impacted on 36,000 pensions, particularly women.</p><p> The issue has been raised with the Minister and he indicated a willingness to look at it, but I have not heard anything since.  Has Age Action heard anything further about what the Government proposes to do?  Nobody could fail to acknowledge this injustice and how it impacts on gender.</p><p> This injustice will get worse if it is not addressed.  Has Age Action any estimates or projections on the numbers that will be affected as time goes on?  I would have thought that another cohort that will be affected by this measure as time goes on, unless it is changed, is the people who had to emigrate, and we have had successive waves of emigration in recent years.</p><p> An issue that I do not think was mentioned, or was referred to briefly is the thresholds for entitlement to a medical card.  This was in spite of the significant resistance and struggle of people to protest at the time the automatic entitlement to a medical card of a pensioner was attacked.  The then Government rolled back under the impact of the protests by pensioners and in particular the bodies, including Age Action which organised the protests.  Is there an ongoing creeping problem of pensioners losing their medical card and then having to apply for a discretionary medical card?  That puts people through the hardship of losing the card and having to reapply for a medical card.  Will Age Action comment on that? </p><p> Another issue which I have been chatting to Mr. Moran about is the issue of motor insurance for pensioners.  I know that our older population are one of the groups that are being particularly hard hit by the extortionate rises in motor insurance premiums.  A number of categories are being hit, but older people are definitely a category that are being discriminated against.  Is that something that we can and should raise in the context of requiring some sort of action in the budget that would begin to address the unfairness of motor insurance premiums?</p></speech>

On the question of whether we had a response or an indication from the Minister that the Government would backdate to take account of the 2012 cuts, we have not seen that.  The position seems to be that while the Government acknowledges that there are anomalies created by the averaging system, and we would say they are much more than anomalies, these would be addressed by the total contributions approach which the Department hopes to roll out in 2020 or 2021.  Many members would have been affected by the 2012 cuts.  When they write to the Minister or a Deputy writes on their behalf, that is the response that comes back.  The problem with that response is that even if that resolved the issue, people are losing income for three years - assuming it comes out in 2020; second, we are not clear what the total contributions approach will look like.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar has been quite clear about saying that there would be winners and losers from the move to that system.</p> <p>  In the medium to long-term future of the State pension, how the total contributions approach is calculated and how it will work and how it will be effective is important, but we do not see any move to try to reverse these cuts.  Raising the issue with the budget scrutiny committee is part of our campaign to try to get that issue addressed.</p> <p>  In 2013 about 94% to 95% of people over 70 years got a medical card.  I know that by 2015 that had dropped to 80% coverage, which is a pretty substantial decrease.  To pick up on two points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, the medical card limits do not rise with the rise in the State pension, so that in the past number of years, there have been two increases in the State pension, a &euro;5 increase delivered in March and a &euro;3 increase delivered in the preceding year.  If a person had a gross income of &euro;495 and was just under the medical card limit, the State pension increases push the person over the limit and one could potentially lose the medical card on that basis, unless one was to apply for a discretionary card.  If the Deputy spoke to some of our members who were in poor health, and told them one could have an extra &euro;5 income or a medical card, the majority of those in poor health would want the medical card.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#F00400"><p>It is something that has come up.  I would not have described it as widespread, but when we are talking about the pension increase we have had members raise it.  We are in the middle of our budget meetings with members but we have not had very many come to us and say that they have lost the medical card, but a number have said to us that they are very conscious that they are quite close to the limit, so they ask can we work on increasing the limit because it is getting closer to their income level.</p> <p>  To be fair, the Department has been better about the issuing of discretionary medical cards in the past six to 12 months.  That is certainly our experience.  There is an issue around people who are experiencing multiple morbidities, perhaps they have mental health problems and other difficulties and may not be able to engage in the process.  Many people may not necessarily know that discretionary medical cards are available and if they do they must go through an application process and they can often need support and assistance to do so.  We would suspect that there are people in the community who could get a discretionary medical card but cannot.</p> <p>  On the question of car insurance, this is an issue that the Deputy and I have discussed before, the real challenge is for older people in rural communities, because without a public transport system they are entirely dependent on their own ability to drive or on family members.  We have dealt with members who have had very substantial increases, ranging from 30% to 50% increases in their car insurance premiums.  It typically seems to happen when one goes from 64 to 65 years or from 69 to 70 years and one moves into a different category.  These are issues we have raised with the finance committee when they were working on car insurance.  In terms of how it might impact or affect the budget, one of the arguments we make is the reason we need the increases in incomes supports that Ms Naomi Feely has articulated is because of the increase in costs that older people are facing.  That can be an issue of car insurance or private health insurance, as many older people see private health insurance as an absolute basic requirement because they are unwilling to trust the public system.  When we argue for an increase in income supports, we are arguing for it not just because we believe it is necessary but because we believe it is necessary to meet rising costs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#F00600"><p>The priorities that  Ms Naomi Feely referenced were the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and the State pension.  Separating that out from the 2012 cuts, we are hoping for an increase of &euro;5 in the weekly State pension rate; we want to increase the living alone allowance to approximately &euro;11 - we have not finalised that figure but we are looking at the Vincentians figures of around &euro;11 and we still have to finalise our proposal on the fuel allowance.  We will finalise our figures before the end of June and they will be distributed to members.</p> <p>  I think it is important to take a moment to make this point on the State pension.  Ireland is one of very few countries in the European Union that has no system for how the State pension is increased.</p><p>If one looks at Britain, for example, there is the triple-lock mechanism where its state pension increases every year on the basis of the consumer price index on average earnings of 2.5%.  I am not necessarily saying that we should take that system but it is an example of the kind of systems that are out there.  Almost every other European country has some sort of system, whether it is measured by GDP or by average earnings, or a formula or combination of the two.  I believe that Ireland is one of only two or three EU countries that have no formula and the figure is decided on through a budgetary process.</p><p> One of the arguments put forward by Age Action is that the national pensions framework, published in 2010, sets out that the State pension should be 35% of average earnings at the top rate.  This would mean a State pension of around &euro;249 based on CSO figures for average earnings in the first quarter of 2017.  We are currently at approximately &euro;238 and a &euro;5 increase would move us in that direction.  That is one of the reasons we would argue for it.  The 35% as identified by the Government in 2010 was to keep people out of poverty and the State pension is the single most important tool we have to keep pensioner poverty down.</p></speech>

I presume that some of the members of Age Action are public sector pensioners.  What is Mr. Moran's opinion on the moves being mooted, as I and many workers and unions see it, and on the talk of further eroding public service pensions? There is talk of increases being linked only to inflation rather than to half of career-end earnings or the average earnings, which was the first phase of attacking those pensioners.  Has Mr. Moran any thoughts on that subject?</p> <p>  It may be a controversial area to get into from Mr. Moran's point of view but there is a school of thought around improving the pensions for low and middle-income pensioners and for ordinary pensioners on the State pension, which is to do something about the huge tax breaks for the very wealthy on their private pension contributions.  They get very nice pensions at the end of it and a huge proportion of the tax breaks available for this area actually go to that cohort.  If we began to look at that measure then we could use the money to increase the level of the State pension.  Does Mr. Moran have views on that debate?</p> <p>  I will move on to my last question.  I know that Mr. Moran spoke of home-care packages and the increasing demographic pressure to provide for our growing, older population.  Mr. Moran said he would rather start with a vision on what it is we want for people and then afterwards talk about how we would pay for it.  I believe this is the right starting point but we on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight must consider how to pay for it.  I agree that we must start with the vision but we also need to think about how to pay.  The unions have been pushing, quite rightly, on the whole issue of employers' PRSI and the very low levels of employers' PRSI being paid in the State compared to the rest of the European Union.  I believe it is fairly indisputable and is just a fact.  Calculations have been done that show if Ireland moved anywhere close to the average EU PRSI contributions, a huge pot of money would accrue from that.  It would actually begin to generate the sorts of revenues we need to deal with the problems and needs of an ageing population.  Perhaps Mr. Moran would comment on some of those suggestions.</p></speech>

I shall take some of the Deputy's points and I will consider the issue of private pensions first.</p> <p>  When we talk about the State pension in Ireland the figure of &euro;7 billion is generally used as the spend on the State pension, which is absolutely accurate.  We actually spend around &euro;9.5 billion in pensions because the private pensions tax breaks, as calculated by Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins, amount to &euro;2.5 billion.  When we consider the figure of &euro;9.5 billion spent on pension supports for older people there is a very strong argument to look at that &euro;2.5 billion and ask ourselves if we are getting the best value if our objective is a fair and sustainable State pension system that keeps people out of poverty.</p> <p>  One of the aspects of the national pensions framework that has always interested me is that the measures that will be unpleasant for pensioners, such as increasing the retirement age, have been delivered whereas some of the other measures were not delivered, such as the State pension being 35% of average earnings.  The framework also suggested changing the private pension supports from 41% to 33% which would save a substantial sum of money that could be invested in the State pension system.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is that we are very conscious of the amount of money spent on private pensions.  We do not have a problem with the State providing an incentive for people to take out private pensions.  It could be part of the solution to people having a guaranteed and decent retirement income.  We believe, however, that the people who benefit the most from private pensions are not necessarily those who need the benefit.</p> <p>  On PRSI, Age Action has identified that at 10.75% employers' PRSI is one of the lowest in Europe.  One of the issues that will come up is if employers'  PRSI is to be increased then what is it paying for? In delivering a sustainable pension increase, generally speaking there is broad agreement that part of the solution would be a need to increase PRSI rates at some point in the next three to five years, whatever that figure might be.  Some people may argue for a substantial PRSI increase and to leave the retirement age as it is.  Others may see it as part of a suite, which might include an increased retirement age.  The issue is also being looked at in the context of home care provision.</p> <p>  One of the arguments around how we could pay for home care is an increase in PRSI rates. This could be a way of doing it.  When we consider the Health Research Board's recent research that looked at home care systems in Germany, Sweden and Scotland - I want to say the Netherlands also but I could possibly be wrong on that - one of the systems of payment used by those countries is a version of long-term social insurance contributions specifically designed and set aside for home care.  In Ireland, the model of that would be an increase in PRSI designed to pay for home care supports.  Age Action's attitude to this is if we are to increase PRSI to pay for home care, does this make it more difficult to increase PRSI to pay for a sustainable State pension if that is something we need to do? Can we do both of those things?</p> <p>  We are genuinely entering into the consultation on home care with an open mind around financing.  We want to see more evidence and more of the arguments that will be put forward.</p> <p>  With regard to public sector pensions, as an organisation we would typically focus on the State pension and this is where most of our efforts go.  This is the area with the highest numbers of pensioners who are dependent on State transfers, especially at the lowest income rates.  We would certainly be uncomfortable with measures around public sector pensions that could end up driving people into poverty.  Our focus, however, would generally be around the State pension.</p></speech>

One of the points made was on people who may have taken time out of the State, particularly those who emigrated around the 1980s when people were out of work here.  This is a critical issue.  It might appear to be outside the remit of this committee but it is about planning for an ageing population and not just thinking about the circumstances of older people today.  We must also think about those of us who are in our 30s and 40s and what is needed to ensure that, as we age, we have a very positive experience of ageing and that Ireland is a good place in which to grow old.  This brings us back to the national positive ageing strategy and while it is not within the remit of this committee, the financing and funding of health, pensions, transport supports and enabling people to stay in their own homes is really critical and must be looked at also.  It is an important point to make.  What happens when we have more people who have taken time out from the workforce here and who may have given less of a contribution in Ireland?</p><p>That should be taken into consideration.  There is no point worrying on the day it happens that we suddenly have all these people.  We need to plan for it now.</p></speech>

The report compiled by Maureen Bassett, Towards A Fair State Pension for Women Pensioners, was very helpful.  When I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on 21 February 2017, he indicated that he would give this committee a remit to examine the recommendations made by Age Action Ireland.  I apologise for missing the start of the meeting.</p> <p>The witnesses made two fundamental recommendations.  The first is that the 2012 changes should be reversed and backdated, at least until there is a move to a total contributions assessment approach.  The Taoiseach could not tell me what level of savings the Government made each year from 2012 as a result of the changes.  Perhaps the witnesses know what the net cost would be, were this committee to recommend restoration of the relevant pre-2012 pension arrangements.  It is an emotive issue.  On 21 February I quoted a female constituent of mine who pointed out to me that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, said on several occasions that there are winners and there are losers.  He may discover the truth of that statement in the weeks to come.  Thousands of constituents are very bitter that they have lost the &euro;3,500 indicated by the witnesses' carefully-produced figures.  What would the net cost be were the committee to accept that first recommendation?</p></speech>

Age Action Ireland was very pleased that the issue was referred to this committee.  The information we have received from the Department and in responses to parliamentary questions indicates that savings in the first year following the changes was &euro;10 million and increased by &euro;10 million each year thereafter.  If the committee were to reverse the changes and go back to the four bands that were originally in place there would be a cost of approximately &euro;60 million in 2017.  It would cost an additional &euro;10 million for each year it were to be maintained.  If the payment were backdated, there would be a cumulative cost of approximately &euro;200 million, bearing in mind the yearly &euro;10 million increase.</p></speech>

The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar has repeated that backdating the scheme will involve a very substantial cost, although I am unaware of the timeframe on which he has based that calculation.  Today's witnesses have reiterated that there would be a substantial cost were the homemaker's scheme to be backdated.</p></speech>

Age Action Ireland and the National Women's Council of Ireland, which is supportive of this initiative, see 1973 as the preferred year to which the scheme should be backdated.  A cost of &euro;290 million for this has been indicated to us but it is unclear to what year the scheme has been backdated in the calculation carried out to reach that figure.</p></speech>

That was before PRSI was brought in.  It was an important gesture.  There are precedents for the committee to backdate the homemaker's scheme.</p></speech>

It is very important to recognise the contribution made by men and women, predominantly women, who were carers.  They were not collecting a salary and paying stamps but they were raising families and many of them gave up good jobs to do so.  For them not to receive any credit or recognition for that from the pension system is unfair.  They may not have made PRSI contributions but they made a contribution to this country and society, which deserves to be recognised.</p></speech>

The narrowing of population numbers in statistics as one ascends age bands is familiar to all.  Many Members have attended funerals of people who were in their 50s or early 60s when they died, be they friends, friends of colleagues or otherwise.  Is there any research on the issue of people who did not reach retirement but had made a contribution?</p></speech>

That group made a number of recommendations to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  It also recommended that training and supports be provided to enable older workers to remain in employment or to assist people to return to employment.  That report contained some good recommendations that could be usefully pursued.</p></speech>

The Social Insurance Fund is in surplus once again and provides a huge chunk of social protection spending every year.  Was an increase in employers' PRSI important?  There was a stage during the recession when there was a deficit in the Social Insurance Fund and we want to avoid a repeat of that.  We should be considering additional support we can give to older citizens in particular.  Do the witnesses perceive the Social Insurance Fund as being of particular importance?  How can the State encourage workers to take out supplementary pensions?  It would be helpful to this committee if more citizens were to have supplementary income streams along with the State pension.</p></speech>

It is hoped to publish it in the third quarter of 2017.  It will provide an insight into the funds available not just at present but for the next ten years and the demands which are going to be placed on the Social Insurance Fund.  It may not be within the remit of this committee but it would be useful if the Oireachtas were to pay close attention to the audit because it will inform decisions in regard to the State pension over the next five to ten years.</p><p>It is very important in that context. </p><p> In terms of supports to encourage people to enter into private pensions, one of the interesting points that the Department is considering is a new mandatory second-tier pension universal retirement savings scheme.  The Minister for Social Protection intends to publish an action plan for pensions before the end of June.  It will set out the pension reforms that he would like to see in the first, second and third tiers.  The mandatory pension may be similar to the system that has been introduced in Britain.  Certainly, we would have no principled objections to that.  We would be a little bit concerned about its potential to undermine the State pension system.  We know one of the models that the Department has discussed and considered is a mandatory pension scheme where everybody is required to make a 2% contribution.  That means the employee and employer make a 2% contribution and, potentially, the State, whether in the form of a tax break or a direct payment, makes a 2% contribution.  That might help build up a private pension pot but a question will arise if one needs to approach the employer or State to get money to support the State pension.  The initiative might be more challenging because there is an opportunity cost.  The money that could have been used for the option is gone because it is supporting the new proposal.</p><p> There is also an issue with who runs the mandatory pension scheme.  Is it run by private pension companies?  If so, are there fees?  What is their profit margin?  </p><p> In terms of the work that Government can do now, we suggest some sort of private pension incentive that bears in mind the points that I made in response to queries by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Also, the Government could support younger workers to get on board.  It would be helpful to provide younger workers with more information and encouragement.  It is really important that the Government considers introducing a universal retirement savings scheme.  When the Department declares the model, and if that is adapted, then it will be a huge change in Irish pension policy.  While it could be a positive and sensible change, we need to ensure that it is introduced in a way that does not undermine the existing State pension.  </p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to consider Committee Stage of the Minerals Development Bill 2015, which was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il dated 22 February 2017.  The D&aacute;il passed the necessary motions giving the committee the power to proceed with the Bill and all amendments are in order.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Kyne, who has special responsibility for natural resources and inland fisheries, and his officials.  Does the Minister of State wish to address the committee at this point?</p></speech>

In the Schedule to the Minerals Development Act 1940, dolomite and dolomitic limestone were listed as substances to be regarded as minerals within the meaning of the Act.  During the development of the general scheme of the Bill, this reference was considered to require clarification and an examination of how best to define &quot;dolomitic limestone&quot; took place.  This was a difficult technical proposition.  The formula appearing under the definition of &quot;minerals&quot; in section 2 was arrived at following discussion and consultation.  During the Seanad debate on the Bill, however, Senators raised a number of concerns regarding the practical application of the definitions &quot;dolomite&quot; and &quot;dolomitic limestone&quot;.  In addition, a number of Deputies, including the Vice Chairman, Deputy Lawless, and Deputies Cahill, Stanley, Sherlock and Mattie McGrath, reiterated these concerns on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  My officials have advised me that the practical difficulty of establishing whether a deposit contains dolomitic limestone is such that it would be best to remove dolomitic limestone from the list of substances which are regarded as minerals for the purpose of the Bill.  I am advised that the mineral dolomite does not present the same technical difficulties and that there is no reason this substance, which is of higher in-use value than ordinary limestone, should not continue to be regarded as a mineral under the Bill.</p></speech>

When we change Governments, Departments are changed all over the place.  The current arrangement is very fractured.  There are Ministers with several different pieces in their titles after the most recent change.  Departments have been chopped and changed to such an extent that it is creating administrative difficulties.  Last week, it created difficulties again during Question Time in the D&aacute;il in respect of the hot potato of An Post.  I ask the Minister of State to take that point back to his line Minister, the Cabinet and departmental officials.  I can see how one might change "energy" to "climate action" from one Government to the next.  I can see the sense in that because that is where things are at now.  However, when one starts moving big sections of one Department to another, carving Departments up and appointing Ministers across several briefs, it is a headache from a Government, Opposition and, I am sure, Civil Service point of view.  It does not help the functioning of Government or the D&aacute;il.  While I say that in a helpful way, I will support the amendment.  The Minister of State might just take the point back.</p></speech>

However, I took part in the discussions on the programme for Government through which the need for a Department to cover rural and regional affairs and a Department to cover housing was identified.</p><p>That necessitated some of the change that did happen.  Climate action and climate change have come to the fore in recent years and it was considered that the previous Department which had responsibility for local government and the environment was too large and had too many issues to deal with.  That was part of the reason but I accept that it does not always make for good governance, certainly at the initial stages when Departments change.  The functions within the Departments are reflected in the name changes that are part of the amendment.</p></speech>

The existing licensee whose interest is in, let us say, minerals A, B and C, has, in effect, a standing statement of interest over other minerals in the area of his or her licence.  In the event that a new and different applicant applies for let us say, minerals D, E and F, the sitting licensee is entitled to be notified of the new application and afforded the opportunity to submit a competing application within a specified period.  However, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, it is not considered appropriate that the identity of the minerals applied for by the new applicant be revealed to the existing licensee.  The amendment proposed corrects an error in the existing text which would have required the Minister to notify the existing licensee of the additional minerals applied for in the new application.</p></speech>

Joint venture agreements are commercial arrangements between licensees and other potential investors to allow access to further funds for exploration.  Typically, the incoming joint venture partner earns by funding or undertaking further exploration and if the project continues, they will be assigned a portion of the licensee's rights and obligations.  It has always been Government policy to encourage joint venture agreements in order to maximise potential further discoveries.  However, nothing in any such agreement can supersede or supplant the Minister's right to reduce the liabilities of the licensee.  Nevertheless, it is considered appropriate that the Minister is aware of the agreement in advance and that officials will be able to advise the licensee on provisions in the agreement that may present difficulties in the future.  As originally drafted, the section did not allow for advance scrutiny of joint venture agreements. Unless the joint venture results in an assignment, which can only take place with the written consent of the Minister under seal, the licensee will continue to be responsible for all obligations under the licence, notwithstanding any other agreement entered into by the licensee with third parties.</p></speech>

Under new rules for new mines, a remediation fund will be built into the application so that any remediation costs will be provided for.  That was not always the case.  Section 49 provides that the licensee is not liable for damage caused by a former licence-holder unless the subsequent licence is a renewal.</p></speech>

In other words, the Minister would not have the exclusive right to work them.  The provision was originally intended as enabling the efficient development of small-scale State owned mineral deposits.  </p> <p>  On Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad, Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of Sinn F&eacute;in opposed section 82 on the grounds that he did not wish to see privatisation of State mineral assets, no matter how small.  He considered it would be better for such minerals to be vested in the Minister and for a mining licence to be required for their development.</p> <p>  On Report Stage in the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, accepted an Opposition amendment to delete section 82.  However, for procedural reasons in the Seanad, the amendment fell.  The proposed Government amendment now effects the deletion of section 82. </p></speech>

There are a number of legacy sites around the country from before the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the introduction of the 1964 planning permission system.  I have come across this in my capacity both as a Member of the Oireachtas and previously as a local authority member.  These historic sites tend to cause difficulties for environmental protection primarily, for waste management, for roads planning and for proper planning and sustainable development of local authority areas throughout the country.  There is always the environmental risk and hazard of having a site lying unidentified, whether near to a road, area of natural beauty or anywhere else in proximity to major residential areas.  The intention behind this amendment is to produce a register.  I am aware the EPA has a register of 1977 to 1997 sites, and I welcome the Minister of State's opinion on it.  I believe there may already be a similar register in existence.  The intention behind it is to compile such a register in order that these may be identified and work may begin on a remediation process at a later stage.  The first step is to identify what sites exist and begin that register.  That is the idea behind the amendment.  I welcome any comments on it before we proceed.</p></speech>

In 2006, following incidents at active mine sites in Spain and Romania, the European Union introduced Directive 2006/21/EC on the management of waste from extractive industries.  Article 20 of the directive requires member states to produce an inventory of closed mine waste facilities.  The directive was transposed into Irish law by SI 566 of 2009, also known as the Waste Management (Management of Waste From the Extractive Industries) Regulations 2009.  Section 20 of the 2009 regulations provides that the EPA &ldquo;shall ensure that an inventory of closed waste facilities, including abandoned waste facilities, which cause serious negative environmental impacts or have the potential of becoming in the medium or short term a serious threat to human health or the environment is drawn up and periodically updated.  Such an inventory, to be made available to the public, shall be carried out by 1 May 2012&rdquo;.</p><p>In response to this requirement, a comprehensive historic mine site inventory was undertaken by the EPA, the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, and the exploration and mining division of my Department, which carried out surveys and analyses of mine sites.  The work completed was published and includes drawings, maps and diagrams of each of the closed mine sites.  The report of the study, entitled Historic Mine Sites - Inventory and Risk Classification, was produced in 2009 and has resulted in the most comprehensive inventory of closed mine sites in Ireland.  Geochemical site investigations were carried out at each mine site, consisting of analyses of solid waste, surface water, groundwater, stream sediments and soil.  There is a detailed review of the geochemistry of each mine site studied for this project.  The report classifies the sites that present the greatest threat to human and animal health and the environment.</p><p>The project initially located 220 mine sites located throughout the country from which there has been extraction of minerals using the GSI databases.  Of these, 128 sites were screened and 110 individual mines sites were identified for inclusion in the historic mine sites study.  In the Historic Mine Sites - Inventory and Risk Classification study, 27 historic mine sites and districts were assessed using a source-pathway-receptor conceptual model and were then scored and assigned to one of five classes.  Three mine sites - Silvermines, Tynagh and Avoca - were scored as the highest risk, class 1.  This report is available on the EPA website, specifically <i>www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/land/mines/</i>.  Given the existing requirement in Irish law for the EPA to maintain a list of mine waste sites and the implementation and publication of the Historic Mine Sites - Inventory and Risk Classification study, the Deputy's objectives have, in essence, already been achieved.  As such, it is not proposed to accept the current amendment.</p><p>I note in the amendment that the Deputy specifies 1977.  I think the EPA report goes back further than 1977, so in effect what the Deputy has asked for has already been done.  I am not sure if he has had a chance to look at that copy of the report, but it is quite comprehensive and very informative.  It is a historical source of information as well.</p></speech>

His officials hosted a very useful session yesterday evening where we had a chance to discuss and understand this.  The reason I mentioned 1977 on the amendment was because I am aware of a lacuna between 1977 and 1997, where certain sites were not recorded properly for whatever historical reasons.  It is an anomaly in the system.  The year 1964 is a key date, with the advent of planning permission.  This is something I have come across where sites, especially pre-1964 sites, are often unidentified or local knowledge may suggest their existence but there is not an accurate register.  It is very welcome that such a register has been compiled.  I believe it goes back to time immemorial.  I had a chance to review the report overnight, and it certainly seems to make sense.</p></speech>

The Minister of State says that there is no cut-off time for how far it can go back.  It can be pre-1977, or it can be pre-1964, even before planning permission was required.  Will the Minister of State clarify that?</p></speech>

It empowers the Minister to designate an area as a rehabilitation area and allows for the adoption of a rehabilitation plan and for persons other than the Minister to exercise the functions of a rehabilitation authority.  Section 135 permits the Minister to delegate the functions of the rehabilitation authority to a person, a local authority or the EPA under such terms as the Minister considers appropriate.  Since the Bill was published, responsibility for the EPA has transferred to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment; therefore, the requirement under subsection (2) for the Minister to seek the written agreement of the now Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government before authorising the EPA to act as a rehabilitation authority is no longer appropriate.  Amendment No. 27 reflects this transfer of functions.</p><p>Section 135(3) requires the rehabilitation authority to indemnify the Minister and the State in the exercise of its functions as a rehabilitation authority.  Amendment No. 29 amends subsection (3) to exclude local authorities and the EPA from the obligation to indemnify the Minister and the State as they are emanations of the State.</p></speech>

During this period of consultation, members of the public and other interested parties shall be free to submit their views on this report.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment seeks to achieve a degree of reuse of abandoned mines.  I have had conversations with SFI research centres and iCRAG and read various research reports on the issue.  It seems that many abandoned sites may contain slag heaps or unnecessary or unwanted materials which formerly would have been considered as waste.  Many of these materials have potential economic value, especially rare earth minerals which are extremely valuable and used in electronic devices such as the iPhone.  There are other opportunities also.  In France old mines have become vineyards because the soil and the detritus have advantages in producing wine.  The older the <i>terril</i>the more likely it is to encourage fermentation and growth.  That might not be ideal in the Irish climate, but other options could be pursued or at least investigated.  What was thrown to one side in the past may have the opportunity to become useful again.</p><p>The intention of the amendment is not to pass judgment on whether it is possible but to invite the EPA to perform a study to investigate the potential and report back in two years.  There may be opportunities to remediate some mines along the way.  We could take a mine that was abandoned and not tidied up in the most environmentally efficient fashion and repurpose it to extract new value or close it properly.  Any reactivity on abandoned mine sites should be subject to community consultation.  To this end, the amendment would allow for a six-month consultation process before any such action would be taken.  I hope the Minister and members will support the amendment as it potentially offers a new lease of life, as well as supporting the circular economy.  Rather than taking, using and disposing, we would reduce, reuse and recycle, which is at the heart of what the committee is trying to do.</p></speech>

I very much concur with the general intent behind it.  As I understand it, it is to encourage industry and the Government to focus on whatever opportunities there may be to extract minerals from existing mine waste at abandoned mine sites, thus supporting the concept of the circular economy.  Under existing minerals legislation, State mining leases require the lessee to fully work minerals under the lease terms.  The modern mines at Navan, Lisheen and Galmoy are and were better equipped to extract the full mineral potential of the mine material than older mine sites.</p><p>There is some industry interest in the reworking of mine waste on legacy mine sites, but it is at an early stage and will be driven by the economic potential.  In 2015 the Geological Survey of Ireland commissioned a short-call project entitled, An Economic Assessment of Irish Mining Waste, which was undertaken by Aurum Exploration Services.  The project aimed to analyse samples from mine waste sites across Ireland, with the emphasis on their economic potential.  A total of nine districts from the historical mine sites project were selected, namely, Abbeytown, Avoca, Caim, Clare, Donegal, Glendalough, Gortdrum, Silvermines and Tynagh.  Avoca returned the most positive results, particularly the spoil heaps in which elevated gold, silver, copper and rare earth elements were detected.  The study recommended further analysis of waste dumps at Avoca.  Unfortunately, the majority of historical mine sites sampled were reported to have no economic value.</p><p>The provisions of the Bill facilitate the potential reuse of abandoned mines and associated waste.  The definition of minerals in section 2 includes &quot;all substances, including scheduled minerals, that occur naturally in or on land, or that occur in extractive waste&quot;.  The primary responsibility for mineral resources development lies with my Department rather than the EPA <i>per se</i>.  While I cannot accept the amendment, as drafted, perhaps further engagement on this issue in advance of Report Stage might be merited.</p></speech>

I remember after Hurricane Charlie in the early 1980s that a number of friends of ours went to pan for gold in Avoca on the basis that it would have churned up older sediments.  I must declare that we did not find anything but it was good fun.  On that river there has also been an historic issue of pollution coming from the old mine sites.  There was a certain amount of investment in recent years in remediation but could the Minister of State provide any update?  Is the river still particularly polluted from the old mine tailings or have many of the issues been addressed?</p></speech>

Deputies Stanley and Lawless spoke on it.  I wish to offer my apologises because I was unable to be there.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, moved that motion.</p><p>In essence these amendments propose a ban on primary mercury mining, thus facilitating Ireland's ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.  The convention, agreed and adopted in 2013, is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury.  The convention focuses on a global and ubiquitous metal that, while naturally occurring, has broad uses in everyday objects and is released to the atmosphere, soil and water from a variety of sources.</p><p>Controlling the human sources of releases of mercury throughout its lifecycle has been a key factor in shaping the provisions under the convention.  The provisions of the Minamata convention include: a ban on new primary mercury mines; the phasing-out of existing ones; the phase-out and phase-down of mercury use in a number of products and processes; control measures on emissions to air and on releases to land and water; and the regulation of the informal sector of small-scale gold mining.  The convention also addresses interim storage of mercury and its disposal once it becomes waste, sites contaminated by mercury as well as broader health issues.  Ireland officially signed the convention in October 2013 at the diplomatic conference in Kumamoto, Japan.</p><p>The purpose of these amendments is to insert a new Part 8 that will effect a ban on primary mercury mining in Irish law.  This amounts to implementing one of a number of actions necessary to allow Ireland to ratify the convention in 2017.</p><p>The new section 224 provides definitions for a number of terms used throughout this new Part 8, such as &quot;mercury&quot;, &quot;mercury compound&quot; and &quot;primary mercury mining&quot;, which is defined as mining in which the principal material sought is mercury.  These terms reflect what is proposed for in the convention.</p><p>Section 226 provides that the Minister may not grant a licence in respect of prospecting for mercury or for undertaking primary mercury mining.  Moreover, it precludes the Minister from undertaking such activities.</p><p>Section 225 makes it clear that the holder of a prospecting or retention licence will continue to be allowed to search for traces of mercury where the purpose of such exploration is to assist in the identification of other minerals.  In addition, the use of mercury or mercury compounds for laboratory scale research continues to be permitted.</p><p>Section 227 proposes that a person who prospects for mercury commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine, currently up to &euro;5,000, or on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000.</p><p>Where the Minister authorises a person to mine any minerals or ores, such authorisation shall not permit extraction of mercury as a primary product or extraction of ores of mercury for the purposes of production of primary mercury.</p><p>Extraction of trace quantities of mercury in the course of extraction of other minerals, ores or compounds will continue to be permissible provided the purpose of the extraction is not to produce mercury in metal or concentrate for sale or export.  Such traces would be regarded as contaminants to be removed during the processing of the ore.</p><p>Section 228 proposes that a person who carries out primary mercury mining commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000.</p><p>The proposed amendment to the Long Title is intended to reflect that the Bill will include provisions in respect of the Minamata convention.</p></speech>

A question arose relating to exploration at sea and whether it would apply.</p> <p>  My question is more specific.  An example might arise in the Irish Sea.  Let us suppose there was a seam of coal in a sub-sea area and someone was looking to extract it by various means.  This might not necessarily involve a mine.  One could use steam to gasify it or use other mechanisms.</p> <p>  In our discussions yesterday, we were considering onshore mining exclusively.  An offshore coal seam might be extractable using unconventional methods that would not amount to fracking but could perhaps be steam-based recovery.</p><p>How would such a prospect be regulated?  Is it a petroleum prospect licence or a mining licence or do we in any cases issue mining licences out in our sea waters?</p></speech>

We will have to do some research but as I understand it, it is a mining licence.</p></speech>

It is not a hypothetical question, there is apparently a coal seam out in the Irish Sea which has been considered for a long time.</p> <p>  I do not think we should be doing any exploration for any fossil fuels any more.  We have to put an end to all our offshore exploration for fuels from a climate perspective but that is a real prospect as I understand.  So would that prospect be regulated under this legislation?</p></speech>

I do not know if there is any example where fracking offshore is possible - it would seem to be technically impossible - but if there were an offshore fracking development, would that also effectively be a mining licence application or would it be a petroleum licence?</p></speech>

The Bill has been in gestation since 2015 and I hope we can proceed to the remaining Stages in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>  I commend the officials on the detailed work that has been done on this Bill.

However, the recommendation should have stated that the Department correspond with the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The first petition for consideration is petition No. P00023/16<b></b>from<b></b>Mr. Norman Wilson, entitled, Acknowledgement of, and response to, correspondence by government ministers.

The committee has considered the response from the Department of Transport, Sport and Tourism in relation to its position and it is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the petitioner and to close the petition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017051700002#E00400"><p>I would like to comment on the Leinster orbital route.  We need early action and to see the route finalised, as urged by the National Transport Authority.  It is regrettable that capital funding has not been provided for the provision of this route, which will be a key piece of infrastructure around many towns and counties.  The fact no funding has been provided in the plan up to 2035 is most regrettable.  I will seek that this key piece of infrastructure is progressed.  The petition mentions the Hill of Tara and Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  One could not build a wendy house in Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, such are the stringent planing guidelines, and I should know, having worked on many Meath county development plans.  The protections that are in place for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne are extensive, and rightly so.</p><p>The protection of lives is equally important.  The Slane bypass is still mired in controversy and there has been lack of funding and of planning decisions.  Many people have been killed on that deadly bridge and yet we are not able to provide that crucial infrastructure.  Infrastructure, such as the Leinster orbital route, is critical.  It is misleading to mention places like Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and the Hill of Tara in this context.  I know the Hill of Tara very well because I live only a few miles away.  I spend most weekends on the Hill of Tara with my children, and spent most weekends there as a child.  It is an intrinsic part of the lives of Meath people and I am privileged to live beside it.  When I stand on the Mound of the Hostages most weekends with my kids and I look across the Tara valley, one can barely see the M3, such was the manner in which it was constructed, and yet that road was mired in planning controversy for over ten years by people who would not know how to find the Hill of Tara.  Pat Kenny broadcast a radio show from the Hill of Tara while the road was being built three and a half miles away, giving people the impression that this infrastructure was going through the hill.  It is wrong to paint a picture that national monuments are somehow in danger, it is misleading and it needs to be tackled.</p><p> This references the fact that, archaeologically, the M3 cost taxpayers &euro;740 million more than the contractors were paid to build it.  This was because of misinformation.  When it comes to the Hill of Tara, more archaeological finds were actually discovered because of the work in the surrounding area.  These are now preserved in our National Museum because of the sensitive manner in which the work was handled.  We need to see action on the Leinster orbital route so that towns such as Drogheda, Navan and Naas can realise their full potential, create the counterbalance that is needed to this congested city and allow our regional towns to grow in a sustainable manner.  I want to see this project happen sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

I am not in any way blaming anyone but we cannot do our work like this.  There must be a better way of notifying people.  Our offices have done considerable work on preparing contributions around amendments.  It would be really helpful if we could get this stuff a bit earlier than 8.50 a.m., ten minutes before the meeting.</p></speech>

As Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality, I only had sight of the list of disallowed amendments in the five minutes preceding the commencement of today's meeting.  I echo Deputy Daly's appeal to the Bills Office to ensure that decisions regarding amendments are distributed as early as possible.  Perhaps even the grouping list could be made available more speedily so that members would know exactly where amendments relate to each other.  Does the Minister of State wish to comment on this point?</p></speech>

We got notice of it at the same time as members last night so it is done independently by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They make those decisions.  Obviously, if we had received them earlier, it would save us a pile of work as well.  I spent a lot of time last night going through these amendments and preparing discussion points so it would be helpful but, obviously, there is a lot of pressure on people.  I certainly agree that it would be useful if was done a bit earlier but that is the way it is and the way it has been for quite a while.</p></speech>

There is no need for me to convince members of the importance of this Bill and the very real difference the enhancements of the rights of victims contained in this Bill would make to the experience of victims in the criminal justice process.</p><p>Deputies were already aware of this as was evident from the contributions that there was support from all parties in the House when it was introduced.</p><p> We are proposing 29 amendments on Committee Stage, many of which aim to clarify and simplify the Bill's text or correct drafting errors.  Several more substantive amendments address the issues raised by victims' rights groups and other interested bodies.  Many of these address issues also addressed by Opposition amendments.</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring forward several amendments but we are not in a position to do so today.  Several amendments will be required to section 26, addressing amendments to the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  These are mainly technical amendments required to take account of changes made to the Act by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality also intends to introduce amendments on restorative justice on Report Stage.  I will discuss this in more detail when we discuss other amendments on that issue.</p><p> I fully appreciate Deputies want to make this Bill as beneficial and effective as possible.  For my part, I am open to take on board their issues and concerns and work with them to improve the Bill.  I am looking forward to this engagement.  We are all more or less on the same page from the amendments I have seen.</p></speech>

The definition of &ldquo;significant developments&rdquo; in the context of the investigation contains some important details about the information which a victim is entitled to receive on request under section 7.  These include the arrest of a person, the charging of a person and the release on bail or remand in custody of a person.  The amendments retain all of these factors.</p><p>Amendment No. 33 also adds an additional factor concerning any bail conditions which relate to the list of significant developments which a victim is entitled to receive.  While it is likely bail conditions will be included in the existing text which provides for information relating to the release of a person or the bail of a person, the amendment will make this explicit.</p></speech>

They are to ensure that when restorative justice is provided, it will only take place in circumstances where safeguards are respected.</p><p>The reasons given for the absence of restorative justice in the Bill were that the services are not available nationwide and there is no statutory basis for the services.  I do not think either of these reasons is good enough to leave it out of this legislation.  Restorative justice is an incredibly valuable process for both the victim and for the perpetrator.  Obviously, the victim is given a chance to confront somebody who has committed a crime which many have found incredibly empowering.  For the perpetrator, it can be a first step in understanding the damage of what they have done.</p><p>Many of the NGOs, non-governmental organisations, in the area have commented on this and have actively argued for its inclusion in the legislation.  Article 4 of the victims' directive already states that victims must be informed on first contact with the Garda of the available restorative justice services.  Article 12 provides that member states shall take measures to safeguard the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, from intimidation and from retaliation when providing any restorative justice services.</p><p>That is what is in the grouping of amendments.  I will not read it.  The Deputy and the Minister of State have read it.  There are a number of safeguards.  I gave an example on Second Stage where a judge recommended restorative justice in wholly inappropriate circumstances where a victim of child sex abuse was asked by a judge if she wanted to engage in restorative justice with the perpetrator.  The perpetrator had not accepted the facts of the case and had not accepted the guilty verdict, and was not in any place to engage.  Obviously, the person was put on the spot.</p><p> It is important to have the provision, but we need to have safeguards, which is the purpose of this grouping of amendments.</p></speech>

The main purpose of the legislation is to transpose the directive.  The directive has a definition of restorative justice.  That is why the right of access to information on restorative justice and the right to safeguards on the use of restorative justice should be included in the Bill.  I note that a reference to restorative justice was included in the scheme of the Bill and I believe it should be included in the legislation.</p></speech>

I fully agree that such provision is necessary and I assure Deputies that I intend to make provision for the rights of victims who participate in restorative justice practices in the Bill.  I regret that I have not been able to bring forward these amendments today.  As I informed the House on Second Stage, there are legal issues regarding the most appropriate text for the provision, given the non-statutory nature of restorative justice practices available in the State.  I have just recently received preliminary advices from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.</p> <p>  I am happy to inform the committee that a provision, not dissimilar from those proposed in the amendments before us, will be possible.  Ensuring that the specific wording of the provision does not interfere with or prevent the operation of existing restorative justice services is very important, as is protecting the provisions from legal challenge.  I ask Deputies to give me the time to bring forward amendments that will meet these aims.</p> <p>  Legal advice has also suggested that specific provision should be made for the rights of victims engaging in restorative justice practices in the case of child offenders.  The Children Act 2001 provides for a role for victims in the administration of cautions and in family conferences under the juvenile diversion programme.  Deputies will appreciate that care needs to be taken to ensure an appropriate balance between the rights of victims and the rights of child offenders in these circumstances.  Amendments to provide the necessary changes to the Children Act are under consideration, in consultation with the Garda, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Young Person's Probation Service.  I assure Deputies that the necessary amendments will be brought forward during progress of the Bill. </p></speech>

It also clarifies that it is the specific needs identified, and not just the fact that protection needs have been identified, that must be considered.</p><p>Amendment No. 113 inserts a new subsection into section 18, setting out the special measures available to a victim during criminal proceedings.  The purpose of the amendment is to clearly identify what is meant by special measures during criminal proceedings as some of these measures, such as the exclusion of the public and the restriction on the questioning of a victim on his or her private life, are in this Bill and others are in the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  The approach is in keeping with section 16 concerning special measures during investigations.  The new subsection will be numbered subsection (1) which will involve designating the existing section 18, as subsection (2).</p><p>As a consequence, amendment No. 8 amends the definition of &quot;special measure&quot; in section 2, to refer to the measures set out in section 18.</p><p>The amendments do not alter the substance of the section.</p></speech>

It gives the definition contained in recital 19 that a person would be considered a victim regardless of whether an offender is identified, apprehended, prosecuted and so on.  The purpose is to ensure that the services for victims provided for in the Bill would not be dependent on a victim making a formal complaint or an offender being prosecuted or convicted.</p><p>This is particularly important when we consider the Garda Inspectorate reports on sexual violence.  There have been repeated instances of garda&iacute; being called out to a domestic violence situation and things being said such as, &quot;Ah sure, there's two of them in it&quot; or &quot;Don't annoy him.  He won't come back.&quot;  Those comments are wholly inappropriate.  It is like saying, &quot;Move on - nothing to see here&quot;, and then serious assaults being committed after that and great difficulty in the victim making a statement.</p><p>Having this wording in the Bill would place an obligation on garda&iacute; and also give supports to victims.  The Garda Inspectorate reports refer to other unsolved cases of sexual assault where victims were subjected to pressure from garda&iacute; to either make a statement or drop it, in which case they would not be beneficiaries of the Bill even though they are clearly victims.  This is about giving them the support they clearly need and specifying that in a manner as provided for the directive.</p></speech>

There is a concern that unless somebody can prove that an offence was committed against them, they might not qualify within the definition of victim.  That would be very unfair to a person who was on O'Connell Street last night and beaten over the head.  Even if nobody was ever apprehended, that person is as much a victim as somebody who is able to identify the offender.  I am conscious that it should not be opened up to such an extent that nearly everyone is covered by the definition of victim, but we need an amendment to ensure it is not simply limited to the conviction of an individual of an offence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#D00100"><p>I thank the Deputies for tabling the amendment.  I understand what the Deputies are seeking to achieve but I do not believe that the amendment is either necessary or represents an effective manner of achieving the desired end.  I will explain why.</p><p>In the first instance, it is necessary to state clearly the<i>de facto</i>position in the Bill.  There is nothing in the definition of &quot;victim&quot; to suggest in any way that an offender might have to be identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted for a person to be a victim for the purposes of the Bill.  In fact, it is clear that in many circumstances, for example, at first contact before a complaint has even been made, it would be impossible for an offender to have been apprehended or prosecuted.  Moreover, there is no suggestion that the relationship between the victim and the offender could have any bearing on whether a person is a victim.</p><p>Why put it in?  Is it to be sure?  There are two reasons.  The first is that a single definition of &quot;victim&quot; is used throughout the Bill for clarity and consistency.  As such, that definition must be appropriate to all the provisions where the word is used.  Many provisions in the Bill specifically require that certain conditions, which are excluded in the amendment, are met.  For a victim to receive information on the charging, remand or trial of an accused, it is necessary for an offender to be identified and prosecuted.  For a victim to receive information from the Prison Service, it is necessary for an offender to have been convicted of an offence.  For a garda to conduct an assessment and take into account the particular vulnerability of a victim of violence in a close relationship, he or she must have regard to the relationship between the victim and the offender.</p><p>The intention seems to be to amend the definition of &quot;victim&quot; to apply it regardless of all these factors.  In the case of many provisions throughout the Bill that would create contradictions in its application.</p><p>There is a benefit to maintaining the definition exactly as it is in the directive to ensure any future judgment of the European Court of Justice will directly apply to our national legislation.  The definition in the Bill has been drafted to ensure that any person who has suffered any harm as a result of a criminal offence is a victim and is, therefore, entitled to avail of rights under the Bill.</p><p>For the information of Deputy O'Callaghan, the Government amendment to section 4 will address to some extent the general concerns raised.  That amendment is broader in nature and will ensure that a victim need only assert that he or she has been a victim of an offence and suffered harm.  No proof is required.  It is all on the side of the victim in this case.  A victim need only say that he or she is a victim.  That is covered in section 4.</p></speech>

Previously, we included this definition in the general scheme of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill.  It was recommended by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that the definition, as we have amended it, should be included to clarify the situation.</p> <p>  I understand the point made by the Minister of State to the effect that there has to be parity of access to information.  However, if the perpetrator has not been prosecuted, then there is no court case to which the relevant person would be entitled to information.  Therefore, it does not really matter that we specify it.  Clearly, the information in question does not exist, so no one would be required to give it to the person in question.  Given that the organisation is the Government's human rights watchdog, I tend to favour keeping it.  I do not see it as being messy.  It is present in recital 19 to the victims directive.  It has been included previously.  The IHREC has recommended that it should be included.</p></speech>

We are all seeking the same objective.  My concerns relates to the definition.  It is rather narrow.  I am unsure whether the Minister of State is prepared to look at it before Report Stage.  I have no wish to be divisive at this stage but the objective we are all seeking is the same.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

One people say they are victims, then they are victims under the legislation.  It is a consistent definition used throughout the Bill.</p><p>It is in the recital of the directive rather than the main text for the reasons stated.  In fact, the definition in the Bill is wide; it is not narrow at all.  It does not need to be qualified in any way because it already encompasses what the Deputies have said.  It is already there.  I would be concerned that the amendment would have the effect of narrowing down the definition rather than widening it.  There is no need for it.  We can look at it again on Report Stage, if necessary.  We can reflect on it again.</p></speech>

It is on page 8.  By qualifying the definition we run the risk that an interpretation could be made at a later stage that is in conflict with the section.  We would be narrowing it.  The purpose of the amendment is to broaden the definition or ensure that the definition is as broad as possible.  I would have thought that we would achieve the opposite by inserting qualifications.  At a certain point, they could be used to narrow the definition.  If the Minister of State is willing to look at it again, that is grand.  I would caution on that point.</p></speech>

Part of the problem is that some of the organisations we have referenced have highlighted the point in respect of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being called out to an incident and not treating it as an offence.  The concern or follow-on is that they might not understand the obligation in terms of giving the information, support and protection that we are providing in the Bill.  They may take the view that only two people are involved and that, therefore, it is not an offence.  However, specifying it might get over that problem.  Anyway, if the Minister of State is looking at it for Report Stage, we can reconsider it then.</p></speech>

That is the thrust, genesis or essence of the Bill.  A "victim" means a person who has suffered harm.  Once a person says that he or she has suffered harm, then the supports kick in.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 10 clarifies the point.  The idea is to have consistency throughout.  It is already in the Bill.  It is implied and embedded.  We do not need to expand or qualify it in any way.  Certainly, Chairman, we will examine it on Report Stage.  If it helps, we will certainly examine it again and come back to it.</p></speech>

We have to put it on record.  We are being prevented from broadening the protection that is in place for victims of crime where other State agencies or statutory organisations are involved.  We were trying to do precisely that with this group of amendments and the definition of the competent or investigating authority.  That has been ruled out of order because of costs.</p><p>I appeal to the Government to look at that prior to Report Stage.  It was strongly suggested by the Victims Rights Alliance that, in the context of other entities such as the Health and Safety Authority, it might bring us much closer to implementing the victims directive, which is what we are supposed to do, and have a positive effect on victims in cases where crimes are being investigated by other statutory bodies like Tusla.</p><p> The term "competent authority", which is used in the directive, is broader in meaning than that of "law enforcement authority".  That is what we are seeking to do.  It was not supposed to be just confined to law enforcement authorities, it was supposed to be broader.  We are looking for any statutory authority which has the power to investigate and prosecute criminal offences to fall within the definition of a "competent authority" if it deals with victims who are people - natural persons and so on.  I think it would be very positive.  Not including those organisations prevents victims from accessing information from those organisations in a more timely and appropriate manner.  I am making an appeal to the effect that the Government might include it in light of the fact that we are prevented from doing so.</p></speech>

The amendment says that.  The Minister of State is right.  That is what it is but organisations like HIQA and the Health and Safety Authority have those powers.  There are probably not loads of cases, although there might be.  There are plenty of cases where the victim is a person.  They are out there.  It would bring us much more in line with the directive were we to broaden the definition because it is broader in the directive.  The European Commission justice guidelines talk about how the term "competent authority" is broader than that of "law enforcement authority".  Those guidelines refer to how the competent authorities acting in the criminal proceedings under the directive are determined by national law.  The guidelines say that this does not exclude, for example, customs or border agencies if they have the status of law enforcement authorities.  There are a number of agencies that have power in criminal cases and they should be included.</p></speech>

The amendment removes the general limitation on the application of the Act in respect of criminal proceedings that are instituted before the commencement of the Act.  I am satisfied that the very few provisions in the Bill which if applied to existing criminal proceedings could potentially compromise those proceedings are adequately safeguarded by an interests of justice test within those proceedings.  The second change is the inclusion of a new subsection (2), which provides that it will not be necessary to prove that an offence was committed or that harm was suffered in order for the legislation to apply.  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that it is sufficient for a victim to assert that he or she has been the victim of an offence and has suffered harm to avail of the rights provided and no proof will be necessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 139 amends section 26 to assert the same proviso into the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 to ensure that a prosecutor will not have to prove any elements of the offence or the harm suffered as part of an application for special measures on behalf of a victim.  Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 are consequential amendments required to amend the shoulder note and numbering in section 26.</p></speech>

The relevant ones are that a person cannot get information relating to a decision by the DPP or a decision not to institute criminal proceedings but that he or she would be able to get information in respect of other matters such as significant developments in the investigation of an alleged offence.  If, therefore, an offence occurred ten years ago, notwithstanding the fact that this legislation will only come into play on enactment, the person will be able to get information about any significant development.

The directive came into effect in Ireland in 2015, even though we have not enacted the legislation to give effect to it.  While it should not be retrospective, limiting the rights of victims so that it only applies to criminal proceedings initiated after the Bill comes into force means that victims who are currently in the criminal justice system will be prevented from exercising their rights.  In that sense, it probably creates a two-tier system of criminal justice and could be in breach of the victims directive given that the latter applies to all victims, not just those whose cases were initiated after a certain date.  It would be a bit unfair that some victims would have access to supports that would minimise the risk of secondary victimisation, including testimony aids, victim impact statements and special protection measures, but others would not.  I seek to remove the section to ensure that a two-tier system does not exist.</p> <p>  In terms of people looking for information and the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan about historical cases and information from the DPP as to why a decision was taken not to proceed with a criminal prosecution, there are people out there whose lives have been ruined by unanswered questions as to why a prosecution did not take place.  Some people carry this burden for a very long time.  I would have no problem with them getting that information and the DPP providing it.  There should be transparency.</p><p>The lack of transparency in the DPP's office is something that people find difficult to take.  It has revictimised many people who have not received answers about horrendous crimes committed against family members, including death.</p></speech>

She is opposed to section 4 in its entirety, but many of her objections will be met by my amendment.  The Deputy also opposes the provision that limits the Bill's application as regards information on a decision to end an investigation, not to bring a prosecution or to deal with a person other than by a trial.  From a practical perspective, to make all historical criminal investigations subject to the provisions of this Bill would be administratively and operationally impossible.  In many cases, the relevant information would not be available or maintained in a manner that would meet the requirements of the Bill, as it would never have been envisaged at the time of the investigation.  Reviews of historical decisions not to proceed with prosecutions would also generally be pointless and reversing such decisions would not be possible.  That is not the intention of the EU directive anyway and would be an ineffective use of the valuable resources of the Garda and DPP in particular.  I hope that the Deputy will be satisfied that the revised section 4 meets many of the concerns that she has voiced.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 14 is simple and was proposed on the advice of Rape Crisis Network Ireland to provide more detail of the kinds of support that victims should be informed of on first contact with the authorities for the avoidance of doubt.  The Minister of State will surely say that garda&iacute; would specify medical supports, appropriate specialist services, psychological supports and alternative accommodation, and maybe they would, but maybe they would not.  Some garda&iacute; might not consider alternative accommodation to be a necessary support.  Some might not be aware of the full benefit of, for example, recommending to someone counselling services and other psychological supports.  I see no harm in including this provision.  The organisations at the coalface believe that it would be an addition.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 28 has been ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 30 concerns referrals to appropriate support services.  The rationale for this is that section 6(8) provides that a "member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission... may, where a victim consents, arrange for the victim to be referred to a service" whereas the victims directive refers to "shall".  The directive also refers to victims having access to confidential victim support services and so on in accordance with their needs.  The amendment's reference to "an appropriate and/or specialist service" is an attempt to bring us into line with the victims directive such that garda&iacute; shall arrange a referral to services.  This is about tightening up definitions.</p></speech>

As they stated, this group contains a number of objectives on the provision of victim support services.  I will go through each amendment in turn.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 elaborate on what support services are to be included in the term "services" by including some types of service but not others.  This might be ill advised.  The term "services providing support for victims" is well enough understood in practice in the criminal justice system and among garda&iacute; in particular not to require further elaboration.  It also has the benefit of being broad enough to encompass new types of service that may emerge in future.  To define in law what is envisaged by these services could also lead to one or more specialist services falling outside the definition, with potential challenges to their future funding as victim services.</p> <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality funds 58 services for victims of crime.  Among the services provided are information, emotional support, referral to other services, counselling, accompaniment to courts, Garda stations and sexual assault treatment units.</p><p>Tusla also provides funding to a wide range of domestic violence services, domestic violence refuges and sexual violence services.  Domestic violence victims can be referred on to housing authorities in appropriate circumstances.  Services are provided to victims of general crime, families of homicide victims, tourist victims, child victims, victims of domestic and sexual violence, adult victims of childhood sexual abuse and victims of abuse in medical settings.  Services are provided by phone and text, face to face, one to one and in groups.  It is also to be anticipated in the future that some services using online methods will be developed.</p><p> I am of the view that there is a real risk, in specifying a few particular services from among the wide range of victim supports available, that we are creating a hierarchy of services which may impact the services which are prioritised for inclusion in information material and advice and, indeed, in funding.</p><p> The EU directive requires member states to facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services.  This is implemented in the current legislation in section 6(1)(a), by requiring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Garda Ombudsman Commission, on first contact with a victim, to offer every victim information on services providing support for victims of crime.</p><p> The purpose of section 6(8) is to enable a victim, with their consent, to be referred to a victim support service.  This will happen regularly and at all times of the day or night, for example where a victim who has been recently raped is in contact with police.  In that case, the police will usually bring the victim to a sexual assault treatment unit.  In that unit, medical staff will care medically for the victim and may take forensic evidence, which will be given to the Garda.  The Garda will offer to phone a rape crisis centre on behalf of the victim, with the victim's consent, and to have a volunteer meet the victim at the medical unit to provide emotional and practical support.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 require referrals to appropriate or specialist services.  As I have already outlined, in circumstances where a victim is directly referred to a support service, that referral is to the specific specialist service, such as the sexual assault treatment unit or rape crisis services the victim requires. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#G00200"><p>I disagree with the Minister's analysis of the amendment.  He is suggesting that by specifying medical support, appropriate specialist services, including psychological support services and alternative accommodation, we could be leaving out other services.  However, that is not the intention and nor would it be the outcome of the amendment.  It refers to "services providing for victims, including where relevant" so it does not exclude any other service.  It states that we need to include, where relevant, the medical support and appropriate specialist services, including psychological support.  The wording in Article 4.1(a) of the directive is, "where relevant, basic information about access to medical support, any specialist support, including psychological support and alternative accommodation".  The wording of the amendment comes from the wording of the directive itself.  The amendment does not exclude any other supports that could be available to the victim.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#G00300"><p>I agree with that.  This amendment is necessary precisely because those at the coalface are not referring people to, or making them aware of, some of the services that exist.  If we are serious about consultation we have to deal with the viewpoints of people who deal with victims on a daily basis, particularly the most vulnerable victims of sexual violence.  Their experience suggests that this amendment should be included.  Our amendment to change "may" to "shall" has been ruled out of order.  Only the Minister can do that but the directive is very clear on the matter.  It states that member states shall ensure that victims, in accordance with their needs, have access to these types of support services.  The word "shall" has to be there, even if we cannot put it in.  The fact that we mention some supports does not mean others are excluded and appropriate specialist services are incredibly important, because this puts the onus back on garda&iacute;.  It would be inappropriate to refer a victim of domestic violence to a psychotherapist or to refuse to refer somebody but the Act, as currently constructed, could allow for both of these.  It leaves a gap and we should close that gap.  We should take the advice of those who work with the most vulnerable victims in this area</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Daly that by including the reference to appropriate specialist services, we are actually following the letter of the directive.  I do not think it is a huge request to include that provision as we are not excluding any services that may be provided.  We are recognising that, in certain cases, specialist services may be needed.</p></speech>

The classic problem for people in these vulnerable scenarios is that they do not get the level of services across the multifaceted arrangement that exists.  Typically, the problem is that they have no legislative framework to support their needs.  An argument can always be made that prescribing certain services excludes the others but we could amend it to include "other services as appropriate".  If we exclude what I believe is a reasoned amendment it will not give full effect to what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

The garda&iacute; are not, in the main, qualified to identify a specialist medical service.  I would imagine a victim would go to a GP who would make the decision.  I cannot accept asking a garda of any rank, who does not have medical qualifications, to identify a specialist to whom the victim of an offence should go.  Garda&iacute; are not qualified to do that but they can refer a victim to a GP, who would be qualified to decide.  The interpretation of something in legislation is very important and I am concerned about asking a garda to identify a medical specialist, that is, a consultant in a particular field.</p></speech>

It is often provided in booklet form.  It would be very difficult to provide all of the detailed information encompassed by the amendment in booklet form.  Where a victim has first contact with the Garda or the Ombudsman Commission, he or she should offered information relating services providing support for victims, the procedure of making a complaint, circumstances where any inquiries by a victim relating to a complaint which he or she has made may be addressed and so on.   The phrase "services providing support for victims" is broad enough to cover one's GP, one's hospital or whatever else is required.  However, if specialist services are mentioned, a different level of information would be required.  I urge caution on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#H00200"><p>The Minister of State is mistaking appropriate specialist services as being appropriate specialist medical services.  The amendment does not say that.  It includes, for example, services providing alternative accommodation.  Article 8(2) of the victims directive says that we shall facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services.  The implication of the word "shall" in that section of the directive has not yet been discussed here.  Leaving that aside, an example of first contact with an appropriate specialist service could be a women's refuge in a case of domestic violence.  Psychological support could include having contact details for local counsellors who deal with trauma, rape, sexual violence, assault and so on.  That is a specialist service and it would not be needed by every victim.  It is not just about medical specialist services, it is about appropriate specialist services.  Article 8(1) of the directive states that member states shall ensure victims, in accordance with their needs and the level of harm, have access to confidential victim support services.  The wording of the directive is tailored to take account of degrees of need and suggests the types involved.  This is required in order to provide guidance to the Garda because, sadly, people who go to it now do not always feel that they receive enough support in those areas.  The amendment aims to clear that up.  The Minister of State is over-complicating the matter.  This amendment can reasonably be accommodated .  It is appropriate that, in light of their experience currently, victims would be facilitated in getting that support on first contact.</p></speech>

We cannot do that sufficiently unless we take our lead from the directive.  Section 4(1)(a) of the directive details the type of support victims should be informed of on first contact and mentions "where relevant, basic information about access to medical support, any specialist support, including psychological support, and alternative accommodation".  If we are serious about transposing the directive into law then we need to look to the wording of the directive.</p></speech>

However, the amendment could be kept as it stands if the words &quot;in consultation with&quot; were added and if it read:</p><blockquote>... shall offer the victim information relating to the following:<br /><br />(a) services providing supports for victims, including, where relevant ...</blockquote> <p>A GP could be consulted by the Garda in that regard.  Failure to accept the amendment would undermine potential services.  It is important that we provide it in a legislative form because &quot;services providing support for victims&quot; is too general a phrase.  People in the scenario under discussion often fall victim to very general items of legislation which prevent them from taking action.  If the Minister of State's concern is that some garda&iacute; are not qualified to make assessments of need, the amendment could be changed further to provide for a qualified person to triage the victim and assess what relevant services are needed.  However, the Minister of State's concern is not an argument for undermining the amendment that has been put forward.</p></speech>

Section 6(8) provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, shall, where the victim consents, arrange for the victim to be referred to a service which provides support for victims.  That is a different provision.  This discussion concerns giving information.  I do not want to divide the committee on this issue if it can be avoided so I am prepared to re-examine the matter and also to take on board what Deputy Jack Chambers said.  I do not want to put an unworkable provision in place but I appreciate what Deputies have said.  We can re-examine it on Report Stage, if that will satisfy Deputies, at which point we can attempt to phrase it in such a way that it will not be impossible to operate.

The earliest possible response is the preferred one by far.  Relevant cases came to mind while I listened to Deputies articulate their positions, with which I can easily empathise.

However, in the spirit of new politics, the Minister of State should take on board Deputy Clare Daly's amendment as it is worded and then if he wishes to change it on Report Stage and consider it further, he can do so.  All members would be open to further amendments.  It is important to do that.  It would send a message that we recognise that, on first contact, victims may , as a result of the crime committed against them, be affected in ways for which they need services that would not be sufficiently covered by the phrase "services providing support for victims".  It does not tally with what the directive is trying to achieve.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board Deputy Clare Daly's amendment and if he then wishes to consider the matter further before Report Stage, we will all be willing to do that.  The Bill must also go to the Seanad.</p></speech>

It is not my amendment, it was suggested by Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  It aims to cater for particularly traumatised victims who are probably the first people that will hopefully benefit from this legislation if we get it right.  I accept that the Minister of State will consider the matter before Report Stage.  If, however, we were to pass the amendment now, the onus would really be on him to change it on Report Stage if he so wished.  The amendment is better in its current format.  Can we not just keep it?  The level of engagement by NGOs and so on in respect of this Bill has been immense.  Although, in the context of new politics, agreeing to nothing is not good either.  We could agree it now and then if the Minister of State or his officials need to change it on Report Stage, we will not stand in the way of it by demanding that that wording be retained.  I will press the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#J02700"><p>I think "as soon as practicable" is a moveable feast while "without unnecessary delay" is clearer and more actionable in cases of unreasonable delay.  Unnecessary delay can have the effect of re-victimising a victim.  The amendment provides greater clarity.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 21 and 22, from myself and Deputy O'Callaghan, respectively, differ slightly from each other.  They deal with the need for victims to receive information which they can understand.  Article 3(2) of the directive states "Member States shall ensure that communications with victims are given in simple and accessible language, orally or in writing."  We have to take people's individual circumstances into account.  In the case of somebody with limited reading ability, for example, written documentation will not be of any use.  Conversely, a deaf person may like to receive information in writing rather than receiving it orally.  My amendment provides for choice being given to the victim as to the format in which he or she receives information. </p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 22 provides that the investigating authority should have regard to the level of understanding of the victim, but the decision is the authority's.  I have put it the other way around.  I am not sure the Garda should be the deciding party as it might not be able to adequately assess the comprehension of the victim.  As a garda might simply think the victim probably is able to read it or whatever, the choice should be given to the victim.</p></speech>

As the other speakers have said, the intention is to tailor the information towards what the victim can understand and how he or she can properly access it.  Deputy Daly's point is well made.  At the very least, there needs to be mutual agreement as to the format of the communication rather than an assumption that could undermine the victim's ability to receive information.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I am of the view that the phrase "as soon as practicable" imposes exactly the same obligations on the authorities as the phrase "without unnecessary delay".  The phrase "as soon as practicable" is preferred in the Bill as it frequently occurs in the Statute Book anyway in similar contexts, whereas "without unnecessary delay" is not to my knowledge used in the Statute Book in comparable circumstances at all.  We should stick to what has been tried and tested over the decades.</p> <p>  I understand the rationale behind amendment No. 21 and agree in principle that the means of providing the information should be chosen by the victim.  However, there may be practical obstacles to its implementation.  At first contact, information is most likely to be provided through a specially designed victims information booklet and it may not be feasible for all of the detailed information contained in that booklet to be given orally.  Another example would be if the booklet was not available in the desired language at the time and place of first contact, in which case providing an electronic copy might be the only option.</p><p>I am happy to consider the matter and to consult with the relevant agencies to see if a suitable amendment can be included to ensure the victim's preference is followed unless it is not possible to do so.  There is something in it, so let us have a look at that one again and see where we are with it.</p><p> On amendment No. 22, that issue is already provided for in section 21 of the Bill.  Section 21 explicitly requires all bodies with obligations under this Bill to ensure that all communications with victims are in simple and accessible language and take into account the personal characteristics of the victim, including any disability which may affect his or her ability to understand or be understood.  That is already covered in section 21 of the Bill.  </p></speech>

If we are saying that we are working to try to give the victim the choice, then we need to do that work.  I am slightly concerned that the Minister of State said the information would be given if possible.  There should not be a situation where the information is not available in an accessible format.  I am trying to envisage a scenario whereby that information would not be available.  It would be pretty serious if we could not give a choice of the type of information, for example, a choice between information being given orally or in writing.  I do not have a particular problem with providing information by electronic means if the person has a computer.  If the Minister of State will look at it again to try to reinforce the choice element we will withdraw the amendment in today's spirit of goodwill, but it is a key point so I am little bit worried about why the information would not be there.</p></speech>

It was in the hope that the Minister of State would look at this amendment.  It is important that if one looks at section 6(4) which states: &quot;a victim may be accompanied by a person or persons of his or her choice, including his or her legal representative, when contacting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Ombudsman Commission for the first time in respect of an alleged offence&quot; one then goes forward to section 6(5) which states: &quot;Where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, reasonably believes that the presence of a person referred to in subsection (4), including a legal representative, would be contrary to the best interests of the victim or would prejudice any investigation or criminal proceedings regarding the alleged offence, the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, may require that the person absent himself or herself prior to the member or officer concerned engaging further with the victim.&quot;  </p><p>We ask the Minister of State to include the additional section proposed by our amendment which states that where that does happen, and where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Ombudsman Commission makes a request as referred to in section 6(5), that a victim would be given reasonable opportunity to make alternative arrangements for somebody to accompany him or her, where the substitution of the individual by another suitable person would answer the concerns of the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the commission.  That is important because if somebody goes to make a complaint and, for whatever reason, the garda or the officer of the commission decides that an accompanying person should absent himself or herself in the best interests of the victim, the victim should be given an opportunity to seek somebody else to accompany him or her in making that complaint.  </p><p>We wish to include this section to make it very clear that if that does happen the victim would be given reasonable opportunity to make such an alternative arrangement.  That follows through to amendments Nos. 64 and 75.  It follows through the sections of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#K01000"><p>We are all trying to achieve the same thing in the three different groups of amendments.  Perhaps we are doing so in slightly different ways and we may have to throw everything into the pot to come up with a compromise by Report Stage.  I am not sure.  In terms of amendment No. 24 and the alternative support person, Articles 3(3) and 20(c) of the directive provide that the victim may be accompanied by a person of their choice on first contact, including legal representation, but that the garda or the Ombudsman Commission can object if they believe it is not in the victim's best interest or if it would prejudice an investigation.  If we are talking about circumstances where a victim's support person can be asked to leave, that could potentially leave the victim in a very vulnerable situation.  I am trying to give the victim the opportunity to choose the alternative in those circumstances.  The guidelines produced by the Directorate-Generale Justice on this directive state on page 42:</p><blockquote>Only in exceptional circumstances should the possibility to be accompanied by a person of the victim&rsquo;s choice be limited, and then only in relation to a specific person. If this happens, the victim should be able to choose another person.</blockquote> <p>It would be really bizarre for us to make legislative provisions for a support person or a solicitor on point of first contact, but then to leave a hole for that right to be taken away without an appeal.  I know Deputies O'Brien and O'Callaghan are trying to do the same thing.  With regard to Deputy O'Brien's amendment I am a little bit concerned that, based on the wording, it might be left open to the garda&iacute; to refuse the second person.  Perhaps it is not.  If we are talking about the garda&iacute; substituting a second person that could then be refused, the garda&iacute; might then continue like that so that the victim never gets an appropriate alternative person.  I wonder about that.</p><p>Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment explicitly states that the victim shall be given &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; to choose someone else if an investigator deems their first choice unsuitable.  Again, I am not sure.  I think our amendment is probably better on this issue.  We are all obviously trying to do the same thing.</p><p>Amendment No. 65 leaves no latitude in the legislation to allow the garda&iacute; to get someone to leave a room, or to leave a victim alone at any time, without the option of a replacement or an appeal.  That would be completely inappropriate as far as I am concerned.  Amendment No. 76 gives the victim the choice of an alternative person at the stage of interview and medical examination if the garda&iacute; rejected their first choice, which is not specified by the other amendments.  The rationale for that is really the same as that for the other two amendments.</p></speech>

We are all trying to achieve the same thing.  It will be interesting to see what the Minister of State has to say and to see how all three amendments can, perhaps, be put together to achieve the best outcome.  These amendments are proposed to give people that full support and a right to accompaniment at that acute stage.  It is for us all to come together on how to best legislate for it.</p></speech>

These amendments aim to ensure that where a victim is accompanied either at first contact, when making a complaint or during an interview, and the Garda or officer of Ombudsman Commission excludes an accompanying person, that the victim is given the opportunity to arrange for an alternative person to accompany him or her.</p><p>I appreciate what the Deputies are aiming to achieve, but I do not see how these changes are necessary.  The amendments do not appear to appreciate that, in each instance, the victim is present of his or her own volition and the Garda or officer has no power to compel the victim to stay or continue with the contact, complaint or interview.  The victim is present in a voluntary capacity to get help and is not being charged with anything.  The victim is at all times free to come or go and make such arrangements as he or she wishes in respect of an alternative accompanying person.  If a victim wants someone else to come in, there is no difficulty with that.</p><p> The effect of the provisions allowing a victim to be accompanied is that they prevent the Garda from excluding an accompanying person without reasonable grounds.  The victim has, and continues to have, at all times a right to be accompanied at first contact when making a complaint or at interview.  These amendments have no actual effect other than by implication to suggest that the victim would somehow otherwise not be free to come or go or make such arrangements as he or she wished.</p><p> There is no difficulty whatsoever in a victim bringing in someone else to replace the person who has been excluded.  Obviously, garda&iacute; would have good reasons for excluding a person.  We can appreciate what those might be and they are for the good of the victim at all times.  The victim is free to come and go, is not under any charge or the like, can take a break at any time, etc.  There is no need for these amendments in that regard.  The Deputies might keep in mind that the victim is not under arrest or compelled to stay and can leave at any time that he or she wishes.  Victims can make any phone calls or bring in anyone else whom they want.  There is no difficulty in that regard.</p></speech>

Is the Minister of State saying that, when a victim makes a complaint, gives a statement and is interviewed by a garda, it is open to him or her to leave and find an alternative if the person who is with him or her is asked to leave during the interview stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#L00300"><p>It is a good point that the person is there of his or her own volition, but he or she is there to access support services.  We are making provision for the fact that victims are being provided with the legal right to have a person or solicitor present while accessing support.  When removing that right, there should be a fallback.  This is about choice for the victim.  I understand what the Minister of State is saying, but this is meant to ensure the spirit of the directive and that the victim's choice should only be removed in very limited and specific circumstances.  In a domestic violence situation, for example, we would understand garda&iacute; suspecting that a family member might be present in a coercive rather than supportive way, but there needs to be some protection if the victim has a solicitor whom the garda&iacute; do not like because he or she is perceived as being of a certain type or whatever.  While it is true that the victim can walk out and does not have to stay, we are designing this Bill in order that people can get support.  We want them to get that support.  We do not want them to walk out and leave.  This provision should be considered in some form.  I am not saying which of the three attempts achieves it, but we must do something that is different.</p></speech>

The victim has a right to leave in that scenario, but we must ensure he or she knows of the right to have someone present.  That should be incorporated in the text of the Bill.  As Deputy O'Brien mentioned, it is a multistage process, so it is important that victims get the chance throughout.  The initial stages might be fine, but a victim might need support at a later point in the interview or investigation.  Not to have that provision in the text on the basis that a victim can walk out does not give full support to the victim.  Whatever amendment is made, we need to provide that right for the victim.</p></speech>

Where certain crimes are involved, for example, domestic violence, garda&iacute; might be concerned that a family member who is accompanying the victim is coercing him or her in the complaint or during the interview stages, so I understand why garda&iacute; might ask that individual to leave.  However, if the person is a support worker from the Rape Crisis Centre or the person's legal representative, I do not understand why the garda&iacute; would ask that person to be removed.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline under what circumstances a legal representative who is accompanying a victim to make a complaint or during the interview stages could be asked to leave.  That would be helpful.</p> <p>  Even if there is good reason for that individual to be asked to leave, nowhere in the legislation is the victim required to be given the reason or rationale for that.  Will the Minister of State examine this matter for Report Stage?  It would probably be rare for a legal representative to absent himself or herself, but the victim should have the right to know why that individual was being asked to leave.  Given we are transposing a directive that is concerned with putting the victim at the centre of everything, it is only appropriate that if a victim makes a complaint and is accompanied by a support worker or legal representative who is then asked to leave, the victim has every right to know why, but nothing in the legislation entitles him or her to that information.  The Minister of State might comment on scenarios in which this might happen.</p></speech>

The victim will have the right to have someone accompany him or her.  That is fine.  The Deputies should note as well that, in all circumstances in which someone is excluded, a "record shall be kept by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Ombudsman Commission of any decision to exclude a person ... and such record shall include the reasons for that decision".</p></speech>

Obviously, it would depend on the nature of the offence and the criminal charge that might be laid later.  It is a subjective judgment that garda&iacute; must make.  They are doing it in the best interests of the victim.</p> <p>  I am concerned about a provision in the amendment, that being, "a victim shall be given reasonable opportunity to make alternative arrangements".  This implies that the victim is under a direction of the Garda or the ombudsman, but that is not the case.  Victims can take all the time they like to replace the persons accompanying them.  They can do it straight away.  It is up to them.  They are completely free to make any arrangement that they wish.</p></speech>

For whatever reason, the Garda or GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, asks that legal representative to absent themselves.  The victim can then leave and get an alternative to accompany them.  However, what if the victim does not know the reasons the legal representative was asked to leave?</p> <p>  I can understand where a family member could be asked to leave in, say, a case of domestic violence.  However, I do not understand why a legal representative would be asked to leave and for what reason.</p></speech>

What would happen if the legal representative was a family member, for instance?  Provision has to be made for that.  A legal representative would be asked to leave if he or she was in some way involved in the offence or was putting some pressure on the individual, if the Garda felt it would be in the best interests of the victim that this particular person should not be in the interview and that it might be better if there was another person accompanying the victim.</p> <p>  It could be quite possible that the legal representative could be a family member.  The garda&iacute; involved might have some suspicion that the legal representative might be putting undue pressure on the victim by having a relationship of some sort.  We have to include the provision but it would be rare.  We have to include a legal representative in cases where he or she might be doing something that would not be in the best interests of the victim.</p> <p>  We are prepared to look at it again in respect of the replacement of the person who accompanies the victim.</p></speech>

In a scenario where the person who is accompanied is asked to leave - I accept it could be in rare cases - it might make the difference where the victim does not go back a second time.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will hold on until we complete these amendments.</p> <p>  Members are aware of a recent tragedy which unfolded outside the jurisdiction in County Fermanagh.  I am minded of somebody who has a responsibility for a person with intellectual disability.  What if the victim is not somebody who has the full capacity or competency to represent their specific case?  Is the accompanying need not even more critically necessary in terms of provision?  Is that something that is allied to the points Deputies Jonathan O'Brien, Clare Daly and Jack Chambers have been highlighting?</p></speech>

In the majority of circumstances, that will not occur.  There could be the odd instance, however, where the accompanying person would have ulterior motives and putting undue pressure on the victim.  In that case, if the garda&iacute; see that occurring, they can ask the person to leave.  Arrangements can be made by the victim to have somebody else instead.</p> <p>  While it would be rare, it is all about safeguarding the victim.  It would be bizarre if there was a situation where a victim was making a complaint or giving information and the person sitting alongside them is in some way involved in, say, an alleged assault  or offence.  It involves cases where the victim cannot engage properly with the garda&iacute; by virtue of the accompanying person&rsquo;s very presence.  If the garda&iacute; involved see this, they can ask the person to stand aside and somebody else can be brought in.  There is no time limit.  The victim is completely free to make a phone call to get someone straight away or wait an hour, a day or a week.  It is only in cases where the garda&iacute; feel it is not in the best interests of the victim for the accompanying person to be there.  In rare cases it could be a legal representative.  We have to protect the victim in all instances and this is what this is about.</p></speech>

Where the accompanying person is asked to leave for good reason, we need to be mindful that in some cases it can take a lot of courage for the victim to take the initial step to make a complaint.  They may be slow to take the step again if they do leave.  There should be some sort of follow-up procedure with a victim who decides to leave because the accompanying person has been asked to absent him or herself.  If the victim then decides not to go any further, it is critical there should be some follow-up to give them every opportunity to make a complaint at a later date.  The onus should not be put back on the victim.  The victim may not have somebody else whom they trust or can turn to accompany them.  Will the Minister of State examine this follow-up provision?</p></speech>

It raises other issues, however, with respect to freedom of the victim to come and go and so forth.  On first contact, the victim gets all the information available with respect to support services, agencies and so on.  There are plenty of talented and experienced people available to assist a victim.</p> <p>  We have to work on the best interests of the victim.  If the accompanying person is not working in the best interests of the victim and the garda&iacute; see that, they have to be free to ask the person in question to leave.  It is then up to the victim to decide whether he or she wants to carry on or get somebody else to accompany them.  They are free to do that and the Garda will give all the help and assistance required.</p> <p>  I am certain the Garda would follow up to assist and support a victim if the victim wants it.  One cannot coerce a person to do something they do not want to do, however.  There is a balance involved.  A victim who comes forward is completely free to make his or her own arrangements.  It is only when the view is taken that the accompanying person is not acting in the best interests of the victim, that he or she would be asked to leave.  In rare instances, that could be a legal representative.  Accordingly, we have to make provision for that.</p></speech>

It may or may not be a legal person.  That is a good development.  I also agree there can be limited circumstances where a garda sees something is not right and the accompanying person is actually not supporting the victim and needs to intervene.  I have no problem with these parts of the provision.</p> <p>  My concern is in cases where a garda might have had some indirect involvement or knew some of the people involved and could block an alternative, putting the victim off from seeking support.  It is unlikely but the person should have the right to choose a replacement.</p></speech>

Whatever way that is worded in an amendment for Report Stage, it should happen because we will be leaving a procedural vacuum.  Of course, the Garda probably would, might and should to do this but if it is not in the law, the force does not have an obligation to do so.  Is the Minister of State aware of other legislation whereby there is a legal imposition on the Garda to offer a replacement or to give the victim a choice in that procedural context.  In respect of codifying the section, as has been agreed, if the Garda believes that a person should not have that legal representative with him or her, not imposing an obligation on the Garda to say that the victim can have that replacement could have unintended consequences for the victim if he or she was not aware of the legal position.  Regardless of how it is done, creating that procedural choice by means of incorporating the existing legislative mechanisms would be a welcome development.</p></speech>

First, we will look at making it compulsory for garda&iacute; to inform the victim of the right to have an alternative if somebody is excluded.  I think that is the genesis of what I am picking up here so we will look at that and come back on Report Stage.  Deputy Clare Daly made a point about the alternative.  There is a very slight risk that the alternative might also be a problem, for example, if it involved a family member and another family member was put in instead, so we must keep it open.</p> <p>  The legal capacity legislation has been passed.  It provides all kinds of supports for people with intellectual capacity difficulties.  That will kick in for those kind of supports, as the Chairman is aware because I am sure he dealt with that legislation in the past.  I think we are all on the same page here and the points made by members are well taken.  It comes down to informing the victim that he or she has a right to have an alternative person accompany them if the first person is excluded.  We all agree why a person might be excluded by the Garda if he or she is not acting in the best interests of the victim, so we are all on the same page.  We will look at that suggestion, as Deputies Clare Daly, Jack Chambers and O'Brien have requested.</p></speech>

The Deputy could raise the matter with the Ceann Comhairle. The notification I circulated to members on their amendments was authored in the Bills Office, which takes decisions in these matters.  The proper process in terms of address is through the Ceann Comhairle.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien recorded his concerns regarding amendments that were ruled out of order, as did Deputy Clare Daly regarding earlier amendments.  The Deputies should follow up on the matter and seek substantive advice from the Ceann Comhairle as unfortunately this cannot be done in the committee.</p></speech>

That is the difference between amendment No. 27 and the amendment that was accepted, which outlined the services that may came into play and about which information should be given.

We are all trying to address this issue in slightly different ways.  My amendment proposes to clarify this provision by providing that &quot;all relevant&quot; information be provided.  This relates to information that people need if they are to request, for example, a review of a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to proceed with a prosecution.</p><p>Another amendment in the group provides that &quot;sufficient&quot; information be provided.  While the word &quot;relevant&quot; is slightly subjective, the word &quot;sufficient&quot; is even more subjective.  The former would provide a strong ground on which to mount a challenge in cases where there may be a suspicion that all relevant information had not been supplied.  While the intention is that all information should be given, I do not believe this would be accepted by the DPP or Garda.  The inclusion of the word &quot;relevant&quot; improves the text.  The decision should rest with the victim rather than the investigating authority.  Rather than the investigating authority deciding what is relevant to a person's review, the victim should make that decision.  </p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that "relevant" is stronger than "sufficient", the word used in my amendment.</p></speech>

Paragraph (c), which the amendment seeks to amend, relates to an investigation, which is the Garda part of the process.  The first part is an investigation by the Garda, after which one has a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether to institute criminal proceedings.  The relevant information needs to be provided to a victim to assist him or her in deciding whether he or she wants a review.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say.</p></speech>

The effect of amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 38 would be to require the Garda or Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to provide to a victim all relevant information relating to any significant development in investigation, regarding a decision to end an investigation and regarding a decision not to prosecute a person.  The concern in this regard is that this requirement would encompass the entire Garda, GSOC and DPP case files.  It may not be the Deputy's intention that the victim be provided with the entire case files relating to an offence, the amendments would present some difficulties.</p> <p>  The limitation on the provision of information in section 10 would ensure that much of the information could not be released as it would prejudice or preclude any future criminal proceedings.  This is one consideration but there are also privacy and data protection considerations and considerations in respect of the rights of witnesses and the accused.  The amendment could, therefore, be disproportionate to its aims if one were to end up in that scenario. </p> <p>  On amendment No. 36-----</p></speech>

I see what he is getting at.  It is very subjective and would require the Garda, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to know what information would, in any particular case, be sufficient for that particular victim to make a decision whether to request a review of the decision not to prosecute.  It is a subjective decision for them to make.  As the decision not to prosecute is what may be reviewed, a summary of the reasons on which the decision not to prosecute was made is probably the appropriate information to give to a victim in the circumstances and will provide a sufficient basis in the majority of cases to decide whether to seek a review.</p> <p>  Referring back to amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 38, the issue is with "all relevant information".  If it were "relevant information", we could come back on that.  Including the word "all" assumes all those details I am suggesting and could end up being problematic because they could prejudice criminal proceedings and could breach privacy and data protection.  We can come back to it on Report Stage if Deputy Daly wants to consider that.</p> <p>  I would be interested in Deputy O'Callaghan's views about the points I made about the subjective decision-making his amendment implies.  I do not have a huge difficulty with it, but just make that point.</p></speech>

By including "all relevant information", it presumes it is information that can lawfully be given and would not impede a prosecution or be too sensitive to be given out or whatever.  The word "information" on its own is just too loose.  This is about empowering the victim with as much relevant information as is possible in order for him or her to make informed decisions.  All the definitions and everything we are all saying have a degree of subjectivity.  I am just trying to narrow it and I am not sure I got the best bit.  If the Minister is happy with "relevant", I do not see why she would not be happy with "all relevant".  It is not all information.  It is just all relevant information.</p></speech>

Let us look at it on Report Stage.  I again stress the point that if "relevant" is good, "all relevant" would sit better.

This has been subject to huge debate.  Obviously, I agree with the principle of giving reasons and giving victims as much information as possible as to why a decision would be made not to prosecute.  The concern we have and that I have been advised is at issue here relates to the particular points made.  Perhaps we can address that more fully when we come back.  We may be able to find a form of words that addresses the points the Deputy is making about it being relevant but which does not trespass into the territory of making other criminal proceedings difficult or does not breach data protection or privacy rights of other people.  If she were willing to accept "relevant", we could probably live with that.</p></speech>

The existing text of section 7 on the provision of information provides that a victim shall receive, on request, information on a decision not to institute criminal proceedings.  There are two difficulties with this.  First, the words &quot;criminal proceedings&quot; have a different meaning in the directive, where they apply to the investigation and the court proceedings, from that understood in this jurisdiction, which could give rise to confusion.  Second, section 7 does not provide for a victim to receive information where a decision is made to prosecute but that prosecution does not proceed or is withdrawn.  Section 8, rather confusingly, refers to a review of decision not to institute or proceed with criminal proceedings.</p><p>Amendment 39 replaces the term &quot;institute criminal proceedings&quot; with &quot;prosecute a person&quot;, which is much clearer.  Amendment 40 inserts a new paragraph into section 7(2) to ensure a victim receives information on a decision not to proceed with or to withdraw a prosecution.  It is giving the information to the person in those circumstances.</p><p>Amendment 54 again replaces the term &quot;institute criminal proceedings&quot; with &quot;prosecute a person&quot;.  It also deletes the reference relating to a review of a decision not &quot;to proceed&quot; with a prosecution.  This is because the decision to end a prosecution is not suitable for review, as the decision itself cannot be reversed.</p></speech>

We are looking for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allow for a foreign police service in whose jurisdiction an alleged crime occurred, and where somebody in Ireland has told them about the crime.  I do not know why one would have the condition that the person must be resident in the State.  It is not clear.  The Minister does not speak of habitual residence, rather it is legal residence, which would exclude many people who are in Ireland for relatively lengthy periods.  It is also not clear if it means residence as defined in tax legislation or is it somebody with a valid visa or something else.  It would exclude people who are undocumented or people who are waiting for an asylum claim to be processed under section 12.  They would not be able to go the Garda about something that happened them in their own country and enable the Garda to refer it onwards.  I do not see why a person in Ireland must prove legal residency to have their rights vindicated as a victim.  I do not believe it is necessary and it should be easy enough to remove it from the proposed legislation. </p></speech>

He wants to extend the scope of section 12 which requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to forward a complaint received about an offence that occurred in another member state to any person who makes a complaint in this State rather than just residents of the State.  I should note that section 12 is not concerned with a person's residency status within the State but simply whether a person is resident or not.

The investigating authority, Director of Public Prosecutions, or the presiding judge, as the case may be, shall, when considering whether the victim would benefit from special measures during the course of any criminal proceedings relating to the alleged offence, have regard to the fact that specific protection needs have been identified under <i>section 14 </i>in relation to the victim concerned.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This involves letting judges know about special protection needs.  Section 14 provides for an assessment of a victim's special protection needs to be carried out and for that report to be compiled.  The amendment is saying that report should be provided to the presiding judge in the victim's case and the judge, along with the investigators and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, shall have regard to the special protection needs identified under section 14 during the course of the proceedings.  The reason for this is to assess whether the person has any special needs in the conduct of the court case.  The treatment of some victims of sexual violence in particular and how they have been dealt with in the courts has been a talking point because it has been incredibly problematic for people who have been re-traumatised by their treatment in court.  There should be no excuse for the judge not knowing how vulnerable a person is.  That should not in any way undermine the trial.  It does not invalidate the rights of the accused or anything like that.  It is just a matter of being aware of their vulnerability.  I feel quite strongly about this because judges' mishandling of cases of sexual violence have been well documented in the media and in some instances this has been arguably almost worse than the original offence.</p><p>Amendment No. 114 is similar to Deputy O'Callaghan's and Deputy O'Brien's amendments in this area.  It is pretty self-explanatory.  It proposes that victims of domestic or sexual crime can be accompanied by a support worker unless the court orders otherwise.  That is critical because they go through the legal process alone at a time when they are vulnerable.</p></speech>

While I have sympathy with what Deputy Daly says about the needs of the victim and how important it is that everyone is aware of them, I want to point out some of the consequences of this amendment.  The concerns about it are fairly fundamental.  If the assessment report were to be given to the judge, there would also be an obligation to disclose it to the defence.  The Bill has been drafted very carefully to ensure these assessment reports do not become part of the criminal proceedings to prevent disclosure to the defence and any possible cross-examination of the victim regarding their contents.</p><p>Assessments will frequently contain sensitive and confidential personal information regarding the victim and his or her personal circumstances, including vulnerabilities to victimisation and intimidation.  It would be very inappropriate for such information to be disclosed to the defence.  These amendments provide that assessments would have to be provided to every District Court judge.  Assessments may contain information on previous offences or orders relating to other previous conduct by the accused which pose a risk to the victim.  If the case were a summary case, this could be prejudicial to the rights of the accused as the judge would have been provided detailed information on the victim, the offender and the offence from the victim's perspective.  The Deputy can see that basic issues arise here which I am sure are not intended by the amendment.  I do not think it would be right to go down that route for the obvious reasons of all that information being given in a way that could be damaging.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 108, 109 and 114 provide a right for a victim to be accompanied in court by a support worker.  They mirror new provisions in the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 which make a similar provision for a victim of domestic violence to be accompanied in court when applying for a safety or barring order.  However, the provision is not required in respect of criminal offences.  While domestic violence proceedings are heard <i>in camera</i>, criminal proceedings are heard in public.  As such, the victim has an existing right to be accompanied by any person or persons he or she wishes to accompany him or her during court proceedings.</p><p>There are a range of provisions on the Statute Book which provide a power for the court to exclude the public or members of the public from criminal proceedings, including section 19 of this Bill.  Such provisions generally allow for a parent, relative or friend of the victim to remain in court where other members of the public have been excluded.  I am not aware of any concerns relating to the ongoing court accompaniment of victims of sexual offences by support workers, which the Department funds.  However, I will examine these provisions to ensure they are sufficient to ensure a support worker would also be allowed to remain in court with a victim in such circumstances.</p></speech>

She may be right that it may have consequences beyond what is intended here.  Also, in respect of people being accompanied, that is possible even in cases which are <i>in camera</i>.  I thought it might be of benefit to specify that on a statutory basis but nonetheless, in light of what the T&aacute;naiste says, I will withdraw amendment No. 109 and think about it for Report Stage.</p></speech>

There was no way that we want this information being handed over to the defence or anything like that.  The aim of the amendment is to tackle the re-traumatisation of victims, as a result of some of their experiences in some of our courts, because of the way in which the Judiciary run the courts.  I know the matter strays into other issues such as judicial counsels and all the rest.  The desire was that if the judge was aware of the needs of a person and how vulnerable he or she was then the room for some of the most appalling things that have happened in our courts to recur would probably be lessened.  I will withdraw my amendment for now and will consider how it might be dealt with on Report Stage.  I would like this matter dealt with then.  All of these amendments relate to how isolating the court experience can be for a victim who is, legally, present on his or her own.  Nobody is there for him or her.  In particular, cases of sexual violence and rape are very much more intimate and personal crimes and leave people feeling very vulnerable.  In such cases the victim should be accompanied.  I am aware that there is a provision that a victim can be accompanied but I do not see any harm in us specifying this aspect.  I shall withdraw my amendment and return to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The approach requires an individual assessment of each victim to establish what, if any, special measures might be needed to mitigate the impact of the investigation or court proceedings on the victim.</p><p>However, the directive never envisaged that every victim would have one or more special measures applied to him or her.  This was clear during the negotiation of the directive and in the choice of the term &ldquo;special measures&rdquo;, rather than a broader term such as &ldquo;victim measures&rdquo;.  </p><p> Every response in this area needs to be proportionate.  For example, our statutes already permit the video recording of evidence, in chief for children who have been victims of sexual crimes, in a special interview suite away from uniformed police officers, marked police cars and busy police stations.  This is entirely appropriate for a child victim of sexual abuse.  It would obviously be inappropriate and disruptive if somebody who was, for example, reporting the theft of a mobile phone were to be taken to an off-site interview suite.  I think that is obvious. </p><p> A general access to special measures would give rise to unreasonable delays for other victims who are clearly in need of special measures.  It would also be putting public money to a use for which, if one looks at it logically, it is not necessary.  It would be better to retain the entirely appropriate level of discretion in relation to the application of special measures generally, during court proceedings or investigations.</p></speech>

Not every victim will necessarily want all of these measures that would be available.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to somebody who has had a mobile phone stolen from them.  Under the legislation, that person is a victim.  They have suffered economic loss.  I appreciate the answer given.

That is very positive.</p><p>It has always been envisaged that the child&rsquo;s views would be considered in appointing such a person.  This person is intended to be a support to the child.  However, as concerns have been raised that this is not explicitly provided for, I am tabling this amendment which will ensure the child's views in respect of who he or she wants to accompany him or her will be taken into account.  That means that consultation with the child and the taking into account of the child's view would have a statutory basis.</p></speech>

I addressed a related query to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, when he was here regarding the capacity of the victim.  I see a situation here where I can address this matter again.  The Minister is talking about the views expressed by the child.  There are situations where, irrespective of the age of the individual, he or she is regarded as a child for life.  I am speaking of people with Down's syndrome or other such intellectual disabilities which affect their capacity to properly present.  It is all very well to refer to capacity legislation, but should there be reference to provision in respect of a situation where the victim is indeed someone of adult years but who nevertheless, because of their reduced ability, is unable or incapable of fully engaging on their own?  Accompaniment was the first question put to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  He did not address it satisfactorily from my perspective.  In respect of amendment No. 107, is this something the Minister feels is covered or does it require further address?</p></speech>

The issue is dealt with there in the sense that there is an obligation to take into account any capacity issues and respond to them appropriately when dealing with a person, in order that they understand it take into account any disability.  It comes under the section entitled "Communication, interpretation and translation".  That certainly deals with the issue of being sensitive to the personal characteristics of a person or any disability her or she may have.</p> <p>  The other point is that under the assessment of a victim, there is also a description of any requirements to be taken into account, which include the personal characteristics of the victim including his or her age, gender, health and so on.  I will not go through it all, but it deals with disability.  I can take the issue which the Chairman has raised and see whether there is a need for any further provision in respect of the obligation to communicate and whether we need to elaborate it any further in respect of the circumstances which he has described, or whether we feel that these two sections capture the Chairman's concerns.  I certainly believe it is there in a broad sense.  I think the Chairman's query is whether anything more specific is required to make sure that it happens and appropriate action is taken.</p></speech>

Order 67A, rule 3, of the Circuit Court rules and Order 12B, rule 3, of the District Court rules provide that the record of any criminal proceedings shall be made or cause to be made by a person appointed by the Courts Service.  The rules separately provide that unless otherwise authorised by the rules or by the court, no person other than the Courts Service or a person authorised by it on its behalf shall make any record of proceedings otherwise than by written or shorthand note.  Where persons are authorised by the court to record proceedings, it is done subject to and in accordance with any direction given by the court.  If there is a risk that persons in the court could seek to make an unauthorised recording, the courts may also rely on their inherent jurisdiction to regulate proceedings and prohibit the making of such a recording.  Further, under section 19 of the Bill, if a court is satisfied that there is a need to protect a victim from victimisation, intimidation or retaliation, the court may, on application of the prosecution, exclude the public or individuals from the court.</p></speech>

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has recommended the establishment of an ombudsman for the victims of crime and a complaints procedure and these are now urgent.  The other amendment deals with the training of people working within the justice system.  If we are not allowed to table these amendments, I would appeal to the Minister to do so.  They are in keeping with recital 62 of the victims' directive and the advice of all human rights advisory bodies.  The establishment of a human rights one-stop shop is urgent, particularly given that the commission for the support of victims of crime no longer exists.  All funding to these organisations is directed by the victims of crime office, which is a mad state of affairs.  The Victims' Rights Alliance, who have appeared before us on occasions over the past four years, have met with all ombudsman offices and they would be happy to team up with them to deal with the issue.  If we cannot deal with it, can the Government deal with it?</p></speech>

We are at a critical point in this country, and in Europe, on victims' rights and we are at a turning point with the implementation of the victims' directive.  I will examine the proposal but it would require a Government decision because it would involve significant resources.  It will be on the agenda in the medium term, if not in the immediate future, because these are significant issues.  The victims' directive means there needs to be a sea change in the attitudes to victims across the criminal justice system.  I will examine it but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to come back on it by Report Stage.  I will ask the Department to examine the implications and the submissions made by the human rights body and others.  I will also see if we can give some reassurance on the training issue.  It may not involve a statutory provision.  We are trying to ensure that victims are heard, their rights are guaranteed, their needs are identified and there are solutions.</p></speech>

I commend the Deputies on their diligence in respect of these matters.  It is also appropriate to record our thanks to all the NGOs, including the Victims Rights Alliance and Ms Maria McDonald, who presented to the committee on these matters on a previous occasion, as well as the other groups that have had a direct interest in and a substantial input into the preparation of amendments before us today.  Once again, I offer our gratitude to the T&aacute;naiste.  I ask members to remain here during the one-minute suspension of the meeting as we have other matters to discuss.</p></speech>

Members will recall our discussion last week about the Coroners Bill 2015 and the failure of the Government to provide the money message for the Bill.  As Chairman, I undertook to take certain steps and I wish to update members now on the steps undertaken in the interim.</p> <p>  The first was to seek a meeting of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen through the offices of Deputy Jim Daly, who chairs the working group.  I made this request.  Deputy Daly and I did not have a meeting proper but we have since spoken.  This was superseded by the second course of action, namely, to arrange a meeting directly with the Ceann Comhairle.  This meeting took place last Wednesday.  It was also attended by the former clerk to our committee, Gina Long, representing the Bills Office; Elaine Gunn, representing the Business Committee, I understand; and the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l.  The upshot of this was that the Ceann Comhairle advised that he had corresponded on four Bills that had been presented for address by this committee - we knew he had done so because we were told after the event - and had sought an indication as to the money message being provided or not, as the case might be.  Despite this fact, almost a full month later - as of last Thursday, 11 May, the date of 12 April was long past - there was no reply to the Ceann Comhairle's letter.  I found this most extraordinary and the Ceann Comhairle concurs and intends taking up the matter.  The upshot of the meeting was that the Ceann Comhairle has sought a meeting with An Taoiseach for this week to be attended by the Ceann Comhairle; by me, as Chairman of the justice committee, which is the raising committee; and Deputy Jim Daly, as the chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  The letter was sent last Thursday.  It was drafted in my presence to be despatched shortly after the conclusion of our meeting.  I have no indication at present as to whether the meeting is being accommodated.  I will make further inquiries.</p> <p>  Those were the actions I undertook to take at the committee's request.  We have now brought the matter to a new plane.  Rather than addressing it as a stand-alone committee and in isolation, it will now be addressed in conjunction with Deputy Jim Daly, as the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen, and the Ceann Comhairle on behalf of the D&aacute;il and the system here.  That meeting is to take place with An Taoiseach.  As soon as we have that opportunity, we will be able to report back.  I spoke with Deputy Daly yesterday.  We have agreed that, whatever the outcome of the meeting, we will convene a meeting of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen to brief all committee Chairmen on the outworkings and upshot of our meeting with the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  The other actions to be taken concerned Deputy Clare Daly and the Minister and an exploration of the Minister's letter to me and the committee regarding her willingness to facilitate us in the period running up to the summer recess.  While my address was in broad brush strokes, Deputy Daly's was specific to her Bill, namely, the Coroners Bill, and I invite Deputy Daly to bring us up to date in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.966" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#W00700"><p>In fairness, the Minister convened a meeting with her officials last Thursday, which we attended.  They expressed their intention to deal with this issue and expedite it before the summer.  This is a big ask and a very tight schedule but we agreed to work together to try to deliver it and report back to the committee to seek its co-operation in that regard as well.  In essence, the Minister undertook to ring me then, having made some investigation with the Office of the Attorney General and her own staff.  Some work has been done on it but basically, what is being talked about is that the Department would draft a new stand-alone Bill dealing with the provisions surrounding maternal deaths, specifically mandatory inquests for maternal deaths.  The Minister will go to Cabinet next week with a resolution.  I do not understand what that means, but the drafting is under way and will continue.  They do not expect this to take that long.  It will be quite a short Bill with perhaps about eight provisions.  The aim is that it would come before Cabinet the first week back after the recess, would be published that week and would reach Second Stage in the week of 21 June, Committee Stage the following week and Report Stage the week after.  Then an attempt will be made to expedite it through the Seanad.  That is a very tight schedule but they say they intend to work on it.  There may be hiccups.  I would be a little suspicious, not of the Minister but perhaps of the Department trying to restrict the definition of "maternal death".  We might not be happy about that and it might throw a spanner in the works.</p><p>In fairness, the team has been made available to us.  A member of the team has been liaising with staff in my office.  The Minister undertook to ring me and she did so yesterday.  She told me she had spoken to the Attorney General, and in response to my question as to whether the target of all Stages being passed by the summer was still achievable, her response was that it was but that everybody would have to be willing to engage.  Can Committee and Report Stages be taken together?</p></speech>

There is a real urgency to have the Bill passed before the summer recess.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste is committed to that but there is speculation that she may not be the Minister for Justice and Equality under the new Fine Gael leadership.  We do not know what is happening in that regard.  The point I am making is that we need to keep the pressure on the Department.  In saying that, I am in no way being derogatory to the Minister.  We need to keep the pressure on and, therefore, I would not fully abandon the proposal put forward last week.</p></speech>

Based on what has been said already, including by Deputy Clare Daly, progress has been made.  I have no doubt that the T&aacute;naiste wants to expedite the Bill but as we have seen in the past often that is not what happens.  I think a stick as well as a carrot is appropriate but we do not have to make any decisions about that now.  This select committee decides when to schedule legislation for Committee Stage.  The decision in that regard is not one for the Chairman but the committee as whole.  The proposals I put forward last week can be considered in due course.  Hopefully, we will not have to go there and the Government will ensure the Coroners Bill, in its new guise, will get to Committee Stage here as quickly as possible.  We need to put pressure on Government to do that.  The idea I put forward last week, in terms of putting pressure on the Government, is still a good idea.</p></speech>

When I have concluded my opening statement, Ms Burns, as RSA research manager, will explain the background to the research project, including how we came to the figures on alcohol related deaths, which might be of benefit to the committee.</p> <p>  The RSA mission is to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on Irish roads and to make them safer for all users.  This is our purpose.  It is what drives us and on what we base our positions.  We are not coerced or bounced into taking a view on proposals, such as this Bill, by Ministers, civil servants or vested interests.  We work off the data, the evidence professionally, scientifically and independently analysed.  Unapologetically, our mandate is only to make our roads safer for all road users.  It is important to state that the RSA&rsquo;s pre-crash report is a factual document.  In it, we have presented the evidence gathered by experts from numerous fields, including Garda investigators, forensic collision investigators, public service vehicle, PSV, inspectors, coroners, medical experts, as well as information from witnesses to the prior activity of those involved in the 867 fatal collisions.  The data have been compiled in line with best practice research standards.  There is no emotion in the report, just facts.</p> <p>  From our research, all the 250 drivers who consumed alcohol and were involved in a fatal collision were deemed culpable of causing the fatal collision due to their actions, as per the investigation.  That other contributory factors were also identified in many of these collisions is ancillary to the current debate.  Yes, in some cases speed was deemed to be a factor in addition to alcohol.  In some cases, fatigue was a factor in addition to alcohol.  After the consumption of alcohol, judgment is impaired and this will affect a driver&rsquo;s ability to choose the appropriate speed for the road and for the vehicle.  Feelings of fatigue are exacerbated, especially the day after a heavy night, even though alcohol levels may have dropped in the system.  Members will have heard the light-hearted jokes about the effect of alcohol on a person's self-awareness.  For example, after even one drink, jokes appear funnier, speaking louder is better, texts are sent to people which should not be sent, people convince themselves that they are not bad dancers and, alarmingly, they think it will be okay to drive home after a drink or two, but it will not.  Anyone who says different is lying.  Driving becomes impaired, just like all those other more innocent actions.  Collisions are complex events and result from a complex interplay of many behavioural and vehicle-infrastructural factors, and, ultimately physics and biology.  It is disingenuous to say there is no evidence to support that alcohol was a factor other than a presence in collisions where the toxicology showed levels of 51-80 mg.  It shows not only a lack of understanding of the effects of alcohol on the body or an unwillingness to accept the facts in the first instance, but also a lack of understanding of the cognitive skills required to complete the driving task safely.</p> <p>  According to the European Transport Safety Council alcohol, even in small quantities, immediately affects the brain.  Effects on the human body and behaviour range from anaesthesia after large amounts of alcohol to impairment of behavioural and cognitive capabilities after small doses.</p><p>Alcohol may also decrease motivation to comply with safety standards, which may result in an active search for dangerous situations such as competitive behaviour, or excessive speed, which we saw all too often in these files.  In general, all functions which are important in the safe operation of a motor vehicle can be affected by the levels of alcohol well below current legal limits operating in EU countries.  To give a practical example, the latest evidence shows that the relative risk of crash involvement starts to increase significantly from 40mg per 100ml.  Specifically, driving with a BAC of 50mg per 100ml increases the risk of a fatal crash by up to a factor of five. </p><p> This brings me to the critical point made by some that there is no justification for the introduction of an automatic disqualification of drivers at BAC levels of 51mg to 80mg, and that the RSA's pre-crash report provides no evidence that alcohol was a contributory factor in these collisions.  I categorically refute that.   The analysis in table 28 of the RSA's pre-crash report on alcohol, which the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, has presented in its statement, shows that eight drivers and motorcyclists involved in fatal collisions, for whom a blood alcohol reading was available, had a BAC between 51mg and 80mg.  A further 17 drivers and motorcyclists had a BAC below 50mg.  A total of 25 drivers and motorcyclists with a confirmed BAC between 21mg and 80mg were responsible, therefore, for killing themselves and-or others because they consumed alcohol.  Additional analysis conducted by the RSA, which is in table 1 and which was shared with the committee on 29 March 2017, showed that 35 people lost their lives and eight people were seriously injured as a result of these 25 drivers and motorcyclists choosing to drive while impaired at BAC levels of between 21mg and 80mg.  The VFI has attempted to downplay the value of the lives of these people, as well as the lives of their families, by reducing them to an insignificant statistic.  Presenting the figure of 1.3% is a selective use of the data in an attempt to undermine the impact of drinking and driving.  It is important to state that, of those killed in alcohol-related collisions where the driver or motorcyclist had a record of alcohol consumption, 12% were killed where the BAC of the driver or motorcyclist was between 21mg and 80mg, as confirmed in table 1.  Committee members can see those figures set out clearly.  Furthermore, more people are being killed and seriously injured due to drivers with a BAC of less than 80mg than we have outlined in the table.  This is because, in 11 cases, a positive breath test confirmed that the driver had consumed alcohol, and in a further 52 cases, there was strong evidence in the file that the driver had consumed alcohol but no toxicology report was available.  We had other evidence, and Ms Burns will explain that.  In addition, the RSA has not been in a position to conduct a comparable toxicology analysis of all road users involved in serious injury collisions.  We have only examined fatal collisions to date but we plan to examine serious collisions later.</p><p> The committee may ask whether this trend is continuing because we have all heard that drink-driving is a thing of the past.  We have proved in the pre-crash report on alcohol that drink-driving with a BAC of between 20mg and 80mg is killing, on average, seven to eight people per year.  If that is not evidence enough for some of the opponents to the proposed legislative change, the most current data to hand are further concrete evidence that there is a problem with this type of drink-driving in Ireland.  The Health Research Board, HRB, collected information on 2013 and 2014 road traffic fatalities from closed coroner files on behalf of the RSA in the context of the national drug-related death index, NDRDI.  A total of 49 deceased drivers had a confirmed measurement of alcohol for analysis, and seven drivers reported BAC values between 20mg and 80 mg.  This represents 14% of all drivers with a confirmed measurement of alcohol for analysis in 2013 and 2014.  That analysis does not include other people who were killed or injured in those crashes.  Provisional data supplied in advance of our appearance here for the period 1 January 2016 to 2 May 2017 show that of 246 drivers arrested at the scene of a crash - not detected at an MAT checkpoint or from observed behaviour - on suspicion of driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated, 38 drivers tested positive for alcohol at a BAC level between 20mg and 80mg or equivalent for breath or urine.  The 38 excludes drivers who were medially unfit to be tested, deceased or who left the scene of the crash.</p><p> The Garda also provided data to the RSA that shows each year over the period 2012 to 2016 an average of 573 drivers had a fixed penalty of &euro;200 and three penalty points imposed on them as a consequence of being found driving a vehicle in a public place while the concentrate of alcohol found to be in their systems was between 50mg and 80mg per 100ml of blood or equivalent in breath or urine.  That tells us this is continuing and even this year a significant number of drivers have been arrested with BACs at this level.  All this evidence confirms that we have a serious problem with alcohol consumption and driving at levels below 80mg and the current sanction is not working.  Intuitively, we know that a driver is less likely to get behind the wheel after drinking if he or she knows they might lose their licence rather than face a fine and penalty points.  It is much less of a risk.  We believe the Bill will have a strong deterrent effect on would-be drink drivers.</p><p> We know only too well the devastating impact on families and communities when just one driver makes the decision to drink and drive and this results in someone being killed or seriously injured.  We support the introduction of this Bill for all of these reasons.  We agree this Bill must be supported by enforcement to be most effective, and we are working with the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address this.  Over the years, Oireachtas Members have overwhelmingly supported measures initiated by RSA research to make our roads safer.  They have done so, despite opposition from those who today seek to misinterpret data which have been scientifically and independently analysed.  If their opposition had prevailed, I have no doubt more lives would have been lost on our roads, and without this legislation, more lives will be lost.  We believe that losing one's licence for three months for a confirmed BAC between 51mg and 80mg is a much more compelling deterrent for a driver considering whether to drink and drive compared to the current sanction of penalty points and a &euro;200 fine.  A public attitude survey of 1,000 adults conducted on behalf of the RSA in January 2017 showed that 91% of Irish adults support the introduction of a mandatory disqualification for drivers caught between 51mg and 100mg.  Many of those who support this state they believe disqualification should be for 12 months. </p><p> I feel compelled to clarify a final point, and make sure it is on the record, in reference to the submission by the VFI to the committee, in which it described their interpretation of our pre-crash report as "forensic".  The only valid interpretation of what happened in the fatal crashes outlined in this report was conducted by the investigating garda&iacute; who conducted the forensic collision investigations, the expert statements of medical experts, coroners, and witness statements.  Their conclusions are reflected in our report and the RSA has presented these facts.  The VFI's submission is not a forensic analysis of this report.  It is a vested interest and it is inappropriate to suggest that it represents "one side" of the debate.  The federation has conducted a disingenuous and selective interpretation of the report and it is not in full possession of all the facts in coming to its conclusion.  The report covers a period when the lowest number of road deaths were recorded in the State.  Since then, the situation has, sadly, deteriorated as has the number of people involved in alcohol-related crashes at these levels.</p><p> I hope that this committee, in concluding its pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, will accept the independent evidence that supports it, the integrity of the Road Safety Authority's work in fulfilling our mission, but, most importantly, will move us one step closer to a change in the law which will make our roads safer and ultimately save lives, prevent injuries and protect our local communities from further harm.</p></speech>

All the facts are backed up by the research we have conducted.  For the benefit of everyone in the room, I would like to explain the process involved in the conduct of the pre-crash study.  It is a unique study in Europe as not all our counterparts across Europe have the same access as we have to the fatal investigation files.  It is very valuable information for us.  We are an organisation that pride ourselves on the development of evidence-based interventions, and while we have access to collision data from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a daily basis giving us the update of the number of people killed on our roads every day, that is preliminary information.  The information held in the fatal investigation files is the Holy Grail.  It is the definitive outcome of the investigation and allows us to identify exactly what happened in these fatal collisions.  That is what is contained in this report.</p> <p>  Many questions were asked about various figures in the report.  To explain, this is not an ordinary report.  It is not based on a survey or on dry, secondary research.  People's lives are accounted for in the report.  I was closely involved in the commissioning of this study.  We commissioned two independent researchers to conduct the data collection for us.  We were granted access to the files in Garda headquarters in the Garda National Traffic Bureau.  I have also had an opportunity to look at these files.  A total of 867 files were analysed in the context of this five year study.  That represents 88% of all the fatal collisions that occurred over that five year period.</p> <p>  To explain what is contained in the files, there are a series of reports in them.  There is the report of the forensic collision investigator, which examines the road, the vehicle, whether skidding occurred, etc.  There are also a series of medical reports, including the coroner's report and the medical reports from the hospital if the person had been in hospital for a period.  There is also the vehicle inspector's report, which includes a forensic examination of the vehicle to see if there were any contributory factors.  There are also very detailed witness statements, which is helpful information as to what happened prior to the crash.  In the case of some of these files, for example, where we did not have a toxicology report, there may have been witness statements to the effect that a person had consumed alcohol over a period of hours before they drove.  There is a huge amount of detail in them.</p> <p>  The files were quite harrowing for our two researchers to review.  They referred to the files as boxes of death.  It was painstaking work that was emotionally draining and harrowing.  They were at pains to identify all the contributory factors to these collisions to help us understand exactly what caused them and, ultimately, to give us the information that would then allow us to say definitively what is causing them and how interventions can be best addressed to prevent further collisions on the roads.</p> <p>  That alcohol report is one of a series of reports.  Drink-driving is known as one of the key killer behaviours.  There are other killer behaviours.  We have reports on the other killer behaviours, such as speeding.  We focus on all the killer behaviours, and alcohol is one that has emerged particularly strongly from this study, being responsible for 38% of all collisions that have occurred over that five year period.  It is a very important piece of research.  We have used, and continue to use, the evidence in the development of all our interventions.</p></speech>

I thank them for their opening submissions and I agree with almost everything they said.  My belief is that we should have a zero tolerance approach to drink-driving.  We heard some outrageous statements about drink-driving in this committee in recent months.  The bottom line is that drink-driving is dangerous.  It is the root cause of many road deaths, and it should not be tolerated.</p> <p>  First, for the benefit of the committee, will the witnesses again highlight the reason we should have an automatic ban on those caught drink-driving with an alcohol blood level under 80 mg?  Second, Ms Murdock mentioned in her opening submission that driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 50 mg to 100 ml increased the risk of a fatal crash by a factor of five.  For the benefit of the committee, will she explain the seriousness of that and perhaps give an example?</p> <p>  I agree with Ms Murdock that we have a serious problem with alcohol consumption and driving at levels below 80 mg.  Some members of this committee seem to believe we do not have a problem.  We have a serious problem.  It is important that we realise that one life lost to drink-driving is one too many.  If the introduction of this legislation is to save the life of only one person, we will have done a good job.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe that more can be done to educate people on the real dangers of drink-driving?  Should we should consider introducing a programme at secondary school level to highlight the many dangers of drinking and driving?</p> <p>  Ms Murdock mentioned a public attitudes survey, which showed that 91% of Irish adults support the introduction of mandatory disqualification for drivers who are caught drink-driving with a blood alcohol level of between 51 mg and 100 mg.  Will she give the committee more insight into the survey, for example, the other questions that were asked and perhaps a brief outline of the demographics of the respondents?  Were they mainly rural or urban dwellers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.993" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#D00600"><p>I will start with the first question and will let Ms Burns answer the second.  I will then revert to some of the other questions.  The Deputy asked why we believe that introducing this change in penalty, in terms of a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg to 80 mg, will save lives.  From the research we see that too many lives are being lost as a result of people who have consumed that level of alcohol and gone on to drive.  We have confirmed that at least seven to eight people a year are being killed.  We see that even at the roadside crashes.  In the past 16 months, a further 38 people were breathalysed at the scene of a crash and were deemed to have a blood alcohol level of between 21 mg and 80 mg.  People are still taking a chance.  There is a mixed message being given that it is acceptable to drink at that level and get away with an administrative fine.  It is clear that the deterrent is not working.</p> <p>  To use the analogy of where a deterrent becomes much more effective, when not having a national car test, NCT, certificate became a penalty point offence in December 2014, we saw an 87% increase in compliance as a consequence of that.  It is a very different offence, but attitudes and behaviours changed immediately.  We now have over 92% compliance in this regard.  That was as a result of changing the penalty.  We believe, and our research supports that belief, that changing the penalty is important because it is not enough of a deterrent at the moment.  People will be tempted to drive having had one or two drinks.  They may think they will not be detected.  We see too many people being arrested with blood alcohol levels of between 80 mg and 100 mg.  Too many people are getting six months' disqualification.</p><p>Clearly, we are confusing people out there.  This is an anomaly and it is causing deaths on the roads.  There should be a mandatory ban for those who are caught drinking and driving, which is what this is.  There is no other way to describe it.  That is why the measure is necessary.  The deterrent in place at the moment is not working and people are prepared to take chances.  We must change those attitudes.  The second question was on the research.</p></speech>

There is no problem repeating it because it is so important.  Zero tolerance is the only way.  I have been involved in football all my life and I have a family.  The morning after is the issue.  I have children of my own.  People going to work the next day after having a few drinks the night before do not realise they are over the limit.  If we can save just one life, it is worth it.  It is a matter of continuing to educate people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.997" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Velma Burns" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#E00400"><p>Absolutely.  The research on alcohol and driving is extensive and consistent.  A huge number of studies have been conducted in the USA, which is the most authoritative source of such studies.  Much of the research we have quoted on crash risk comes from the US studies.  An analysis of 117 studies shows that they are all very consistent in their findings.  They show that any amount of alcohol impairs driving, including levels below the current legal limit of 50 mg.  The research shows that one's likelihood of having a crash doubles at 40 mg and that one is five or six times more likely to crash with a blood-alcohol level of 80 mg.  Interestingly, much of the research shows that young drivers are much more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol, which is a very relevant finding given that young drivers are the highest risk group for fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.  Because they have that lack of experience, studies show they are much more vulnerable to collisions when they consume alcohol.  In many cases, the error made may be a small one.  However, a small error can have devastating consequences as I have seen in the individual files and cases I have looked at.  It can be a split second lack of concentration which leads one to deviate from one's lane or to lose control on a bend.  Whereas it might be something one could rectify if one were not under the influence of alcohol, when one is, even at the lower levels, one's judgment is impaired.  We all know that and Ms Murdock set out some examples to which we can all relate.</p> <p>  Impairment is much more devastating when one is behind the wheel.  Driving is a very complex task and one's judgment is impaired when one consumes alcohol as is one's ability to maintain one's lane and to choose the appropriate speed.  The research has also shown that one is more likely to take risks.  Our study shows that half of the drivers who had consumed alcohol and were involved in fatal collisions chose not to wear a seat belt.  That is a much higher incidence than we have seen in our observational studies or the other studies we have conducted.  Alcohol has a huge impact.  To give members a sense of how we know that, many of the studies that prove it have been done in simulators.  Those who saw the "Prime Time" programme recently may remember the subject being asked to drive in a driving simulator having consumed a certain amount of alcohol.  A subject's reading is measured and his or her performance is monitored and measured according to key actions like maintaining lane position, choosing the appropriate speed for the road, negotiating bends and other driving tasks.  It is scientific.</p></speech>

Should we introduce a programme in secondary schools?  I am a firm believer that prevention is the best cure.  I was educated at the young age of 12 in my local school, which is why I became a pioneer at that age.  I do not have a problem with alcohol.  As I said earlier, I train football teams every month.  However, people have to realise the damage alcohol can do.  It is very important given the increasing levels of consumption among young people to introduce a programme in secondary schools to educate people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.999" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#E00600"><p>That is a really valid point.  We recognise that contrary to the myth that this is an older person's issue, we are seeing a real emerging trend that the group showing the greatest propensity to drink and drive and who have admitted to taking alcohol and driven in the last 12 months is those aged under 24.  As such, we have taken the immediate measure of introducing a new module in the driver theory test from October 2016 which relates completely to questions on alcohol, the law and driving.  While that is not enough, it is a start.  We are looking at what other educational material and interventions we need to make.  We have a junior cycle course which has been piloted in a couple of schools and we need to ensure that alcohol is covered as part of that.  One cannot pass a theory test now without answering at least two questions on alcohol and driving.  We intend to enhance that and to introduce more complex psychological questions because, as Ms. Burns said, we must get into the minds of these young people to determine why they think it is okay.  They may have a different perception about what drinking and driving is because they certainly have a different consumption levels to ourselves.  What was deemed a normal intake of alcohol many years ago is considerably less than is consumed now.  There is the whole issue of pre-drinks which perhaps leads people to go out thinking they have not been drinking.  It is therefore important to get the message to this new generation of drivers at an early stage.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick made a valid point about the morning after.  Some 10% of fatal crashes occurred the morning after.  Just because one thinks one has done the right thing the night before, one is still impaired.  As such, one is not doing the right thing.  One is still at a high risk of being involved in a serious crash the next day because one is still impaired.  It is either because one is falling asleep or one's judgment is just as impaired as it was due to the consumption level the night before.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses whose evidence and presentations have been compelling.  I find very little fault with what has been said.  For anyone with any bit of wisdom, drink driving is a bad news story.  We are all on the one side on this issue.  Certainly, my party takes a responsible view on it.</p><p> I have one or two queries.  Deputy Troy has raised a matter a number of times and hopes to engage with the witnesses, possibly even before the day is out.  How up to date are the figures and statistics that we are using?  Are they the latest figures?  If there is a glitch, why?  Does the RSA have more recent figures that we have not seen or heard of and, if so, why?  I ask these questions because, in the context of the recent Garda penalty points controversy, there is a question mark over many statistics that are in the public domain.  It would be important for us to know the status of the figures that the witnesses are offering us.</p><p> Despite the crackdowns and publicity as well as the Garda's large operation over Christmas, there seems to be a continual increase in the number of offences involving people driving under the influence.  Is there any solution to this and are other alternatives being considered?  While we would support all endeavours that were geared towards reducing road fatalities, one wonders whether the overall process is capable of succeeding.  Are there other views on how the issue might be addressed?</p><p> My only negative point relates to the hard words that have been spoken at this meeting about the Vintners Federation of Ireland, almost as if - certainly in the Minister's view - it is the big bad wolf.  To a certain extent, Ms Murdock has gone down that road as well.  Like all organisations, those in the Vintners Federation of Ireland are professionals who represent their members.  I have always found them to be professional and reasonable.  As every committee member will know from personal experience or anecdote, there is no more responsible person in any small community than the local publican, who is well aware of his or her responsibilities.  Publicans' concern for their customers is commendable.  Often, they are the first to spot problems with people's drinking.  I speak from personal experience.  They fill an important psychological role for people in isolated areas.  As such, it is not helpful that the Vintners Federation of Ireland should be conveyed as the big bad wolf in this story.  It has a role to play.</p></speech>

The figures that we referred to in our report relate to the 2008-12 period in which this comprehensive 18-month study was conducted.  It is an in-depth process and can only be conducted when we have a closed coroner's file and the case has been concluded.  Ms Burns mentioned that 88% of files from that period were available to us.  The remaining 12% were probably still ongoing.  They could have been complex cases, under a court ruling or not been adjudicated on by a coroner or court of law for whatever reason.</p> <p>  A process is ongoing in terms of the 2013-14 period.  Quite a number of 2013 files are still open.  In this country, it takes a long time to get a case from occurrence through to final adjudication.  We cannot assess files that are still under review.  We do not get to see them until a coroner is finished with them.  Ms Burns might elaborate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.1014" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Velma Burns" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#F00300"><p>I will briefly explain our process for collecting data on 2013, 2014 and 2015 fatal collisions.  Data collection on 2015's fatal collisions is ongoing and almost complete.  We have an arrangement with the Health Research Board, which collects the data for us through the national drug-related death index, NDRDI, which Ms Murdock mentioned.  We have a preliminary report for 2013 and 2014 based on approximately 70% of cases that were closed at the time of data collection.  The results from the two studies are consistent with what we saw in our pre-crash study.  They show that 31% of fatalities in 2013 and 2014 had alcohol in the toxicology.  The only methodological difference with the pre-crash study is that we have only collected toxicology data on those road users who were killed.  For example, if a driver was killed because the other driver involved in the collision had consumed alcohol but the second driver survived, that toxicology information is not included in the study.  I am explaining this because the 31% figure is understating the problem slightly.  Our evidence for 2013 and 2014 is consistent with the data from the previous five years and show that alcohol remains a significant problem in fatal collisions.</p> <p>  We consider ourselves to be up to date in terms of the type of study that we are undertaking.  As Ms Murdock explained, it typically takes a year or two - sometimes even three or four, depending on the complexity of the collision - for the inquest to be held, the case to be closed and so on, so the file is not available to us immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.1015" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#F00400"><p>We have 100% confidence in the figures in our files.  There is no ambiguity about them.  They are independently reviewed by professional researchers.  They include all of the statements and reports from a multitude of experts, coroners, medical professionals, hospitals, forensic collision investigators and garda&iacute;.  This is not something that is left to chance.</p> <p>  Regarding the continuing increase in the number of people drinking and driving, Ireland has an issue with its relationship between alcohol and driving as well as with alcohol generally in society.  As a society, our relationship with alcohol needs to be addressed.  It spills onto the roads.</p> <p>  The Senator asked whether the battle was a lost cause.  Absolutely not.  We are still punching above our weight in terms of European performance on road safety, but we must emulate countries like Sweden and the UK, which have lower levels of drink driving.  There is no reason that we cannot change attitudes and behaviours.  Ireland has been successful in other areas of society.  For example, we have been tremendously accepting of the smoking ban.  No one would contemplate lighting up in a pub now, yet there is not the same stigmatisation of drinking before heading off to the car.  However, I fully believe that we will get there with the correct measures.  We can make inroads.  In line with typical years, 60 to 70 people were involved in alcohol-related crashes in 2016.  If we can make even a 20% or 30% dent in that and bring our 38% alcohol-related crash rate down to something more akin to the level of the UK and Sweden, which is 14%, we will potentially save lives.  We can and will do that.</p> <p>  We have a chart with us that we would be happy to share with the committee on the interventions of the past 15 years.  It tracks from when we introduced mandatory alcohol checkpoints to when we lowered the level from 80 mg to 50 mg as well as the various interventions in road safety that have resulted in Ireland moving from languishing in the middle of the EU 28 to being in the top 5% to 8%.  We will strive to improve on that year on year and can do so with the help of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  An increase can be disheartening.  To date this year, 59 people have been killed on our roads.  That is still too many, but it is ten fewer than last year.  The debate in itself and the focus on road safety are having an effect and changing behaviours.  We need to get this over the line and make further improvements.</p><p>The vintners are no shrinking violets.  As they alluded to lies and liars, they are well able to stand up for themselves.  They are not getting a hard deal.  They are a vested interest which represents a small cohort of pub owners and publicans in the drinks industry.  The Road Safety Authority represents all road users, men, women and children, and all of Ireland, not only rural Ireland.  Figures show that 81% of car crashes occur in rural Ireland and that 92% involve male drivers.  We have a responsibility to make the roads safe for all road users, not some of them.  People in rural Ireland are as entitled to safe roads as those in urban areas. </p><p> The bigger issue of rural isolation should not be considered a consequence of being afraid to drink and drive.  Many older people are afraid to drive at night because it is dark or they have lost confidence.  A complex range of other issues need to be dealt with in terms of rural transport.  The issue should not be concentrated on drink driving.  That is disingenuous to the people who do not drink.  Many people in rural areas, including many farmers, do not drink.  We do not have representation for a cohort of people.  The RSA seeks to ensure we represent all road users and, for that reason, we hope to get the Bill across the line.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about support for the Bill.  The survey to which I referred was in-depth and the demographics covered a cross-section of the country.  It was carried out across all four provinces.  The level of support for a mandatory ban in urban Ireland was 89%, but in rural Ireland, including Munster, it was 93%.  There was, therefore, a higher level of support in rural areas for a mandatory ban, which some people may find surprising.  Our survey of 1,000 people was very in-depth and involved face-to-face questioning.  It was not anonymous; it involved asking a series of questions about support for a mandatory ban, for how long a ban should apply and whether the respondent condoned having a drink before driving.  It is worrying that 25% of the people we surveyed admitted to having taken a drink before driving.  We have different surveys in which the number of people who admit to having taken a drink before driving varies.  That arises whenever there are confusing messages being sent that it is okay to drink at certain levels and that even if people are caught, they will get away with a small fine and a penalty points offence.  This message can lead to bad judgment, with people drifting into a higher level of consumption.  Once a person starts, judgment is affected.  Drinking to blood alcohol levels of between 50 mg and 80 mg is tacit acceptance of higher drink driving levels and more concentrated alcohol in the system.</p></speech>

In recent years we have consistently seen approximately one in ten drivers admit to drinking and driving.  I support the point Ms Murdock makes in that regard.</p> <p>  A question was asked about some of the other measures the Road Safety Authority was implementing to tackle the issue of drink driving.  We have a couple of other measures which are articulated in the Government's road safety strategy.  For example, we are looking at the introduction of alco-locks as a sanction for repeat offenders.  We are also looking at the introduction of rehabilitation programmes.  These measures are specifically targeted at high risk offenders and those who are consuming alcohol at higher levels.  This is a highly complex group and the issue is separate from that which we are discussing.  International research shows that it is difficult to change the behaviour of high risk offenders because in many cases alcohol dependence is involved.  As such, we are almost straying into the realm of public health. </p> <p>  The proposed Bill has the potential to be an easy win for us because it is easier to change the behaviour of motorists who take a chance by having a couple of drinks.  It is at lower blood alcohol levels of 80 mg, below which we believe we can save lives because the proposed measure would have a strong deterrent effect.  It makes a big difference for motorists who are considering getting behind the wheel after drinking two or three pints if they know that, instead of getting a couple of penalty points and a fine, they would potentially be put off the road for three months, which would change their ability to go about their daily lives and do their job.  This has a strong deterrent effect and we know from international research that licence withdrawal is a very effective measure in deterring drink driving.  The effectiveness of the proposal is substantiated by international research.  As Ms Murdock indicated, Sweden is a good example.  It has consistently had one of the best road safety records in Europe in recent years.  It has a lower drink driving limit than Ireland and a phased disqualification system which starts from a 30 mg blood alcohol level.  It is only one example of a country that is doing this.</p></speech>

Ms Murdock has made the important point that the purpose of the Road Safety Authority is to reduce the number of deaths on the roads.  As the delegates will be aware, the representatives of a number of lobby groups who appeared before the committee some weeks ago had a clear motive for opposing the proposed legislation.  It is important to distinguish the role of the RSA from that of lobby groups in so far as they have different reasons for holding their views.  Did the RSA initiate discussion of this matter with the Minister?  </p> <p>  Ms Murdock referred to enforcement.  Will she provide an update on the RSA's ongoing work with the Garda on enforcement?</p> <p>  Ms Murdock has noted that in 52 cases there was strong evidence on the file that the driver had consumed alcohol but specific toxicology results confirming the level were not available.  What was the reason for this? </p> <p>  I am curious as to whether the RSA has evidence to show that suspending drivers would reduce the number of casualties in road traffic accidents.  Is the suspension of drivers' licences the norm in other jurisdictions at the levels prescribed in the Bill or is Ireland the first country to propose this measure?  What evidence is available in other jurisdictions to support the proposal?</p></speech>

At that point, the Road Safety Authority supported outright disqualification at the lower level.  I will be straight up and say there was significant resistance to that proposal.  I forget the name of the Minister who was in charge as it was before my time.  However, we faced significant resistance in having the measure passed at the time.  A trade-off was made and an administrative fine introduced at the lower levels of blood alcohol.  This was done to get the Bill through in some shape or form.  Before the current Minister's tenure, it was the objective of the Road Safety Authority to lower the level to 50 mg outright and have a mandatory ban across the board.  However, we have to be practical.  A start was made.  When he took office, the Minister saw the devastation caused by drink driving, in particular, the big increase in the number of road traffic casualties in 2016.</p><p>The Minister decided to move forward with an amendment to the current Bill, to revert back and say that this is obviously not working and we need to change this to a mandatory ban rather than an administrative fine.  That is some of the background.  When this was talked about in the past, it was our objective and we made recommendations but one has to be practical when it comes to legislation.  It was saving some lives but it could go further and save more.  That is why we are here today and what the pre-scrutiny is about.</p><p> We have a lot more research to hand now.  In 2011 we did not have the in-depth study and the case would not have been as compelling.  Prior to the pre-crash survey, there was a perception that 15% of crashes were alcohol related, significantly less than what we have now proved.  The impetus may not have been there to do it.  We now have unequivocal evidence and it continues on from the research we are rolling out from 2013 to 2015, inclusive.  That is where we are today.</p><p> On the work we do with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we fully accept Garda resources have been depleted over recent years.  However, we are trying to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the files we have analysed to see the critical times of the day, the days of the week, the locations, the counties and the propensity of people drinking and driving, so that it can have more strategic Garda enforcement.  It has continuous programmes, especially over bank holiday weekends and holiday periods.  It has Operation Lockdown and Surround where it surrounds a town and makes sure all roads in and out are manned.  In recent times, there has been much anecdotal evidence that there has been a much more visible presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We fully accept that effective enforcement is required hand-in-hand with legislation but the legislation, the deterrent, has to be in force in the first place.</p><p> That is some of the work we are doing.  Ms Burns's team of researchers will go through the forensic files and the collision files to continue the work we have already done.  The Garda has two statisticians who work with our people to try to ensure we get the most comprehensive information.  We are receiving much more information from the Garda on seat-belt wearing, mobile phone use and licence classification, that is, whether they are unaccompanied learners or learner drivers, so we can try to identify the underlying causes of the crashes on our roads much more quickly.  The work going on is quite comprehensive.</p></speech>

They will not necessarily stay there but it is as a commitment to enhancing visibility.  It is a valid point and we will have to ensure there is a commitment to this, which is delivered on.

That may come from, say, a garda opinion, a witness statement or other strong evidence in the file.  As I mentioned earlier, somebody might have said that he or she was with the person all afternoon, drinking in the pub and he had consumed a certain number of pints.  There was strong evidence in the file and each file was reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure that it was validly included as an alcohol-related collision.</p></speech>

It would be an administrative issue.  For example, we have followed up with a number of cases.  We want to do a study on drugs as a factor in fatal collisions and have followed up, through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and in some cases through the coroners, to get those reports.  I do not understand the reasons but we believe we will be able to access some of those.  They may be with the coroners.</p></speech>

The research shows that a licence withdrawal is particularly effective in certain circumstances, when coupled with very strong enforcement, that is critical.  The phrase often quoted in this context is that there must be certainty about the withdrawal and the licence must be withdrawn swiftly.  That is really important.  Another thing that emerges is that rehabilitation measures are very effective when coupled with licence withdrawal.  This Bill is supported by international research.</p> <p>  On other jurisdictions, I mentioned Sweden earlier as a case example.  In Sweden, there is phased processing whereby disqualification starts from 30 mg and the length of licence withdrawal depends on whether someone is at 30 mg or 40 mg.  Sweden is a best practice country.</p></speech>

I have questioned this aspect before.  I have not figured it out but perhaps it is an anomaly.  A higher number of people have been killed in the 21 mg to 50 mg category than in the next category of 51 mg to 80 mg.  Why?  Is it an anomaly?      </p></speech>

It is just a fact that the files indicate that that was the level that was in their blood at the time.  Maybe it was a closer period, after they had taken that drink, that they were in that car and it was a higher concentration than the people who were in the next category of 51 mg to 80 mg.  They may have had a little bit more time for the alcohol to reduce.  No, sorry, I shall let our researcher answer the question.</p></speech>

The authority is saying that the sanction of putting somebody off the road is a greater deterrent.</p> <p>  The category of 80 mg and over refers to the heavier drinkers and their number seems to be rising.  It can very much depend on campaigns, like the one that was broadcast around Christmas.  The lack of an expectation of being caught, and that is where enforcement comes in, is a factor.  Is there evidence that it is enforcement that matters, as opposed to the loss of a licence? </p></speech>

The evidence supports that it is a combination of effective enforcement coupled with deterrents.  I again refer to the analogy of the NCT becoming a penalty points offence where we saw an 87% increase in compliance.  The initiative changed people's attitudes and there was absolutely no change in enforcement.  The enforcement levels were the same before the initiative was introduced as afterwards.  A penalty change made the deterrent much more effective.</p></speech>

I do not dispute that the RSA has gathered evidence.  I think there are people who try to be responsible.  They would not want to stray into the area of putting themselves at risk of getting penalty points, let alone lose a licence.  The sanctions, not the level of alcohol present, are likely to change with this legislation.  With professional drivers it is 20 mg and that rises to 50 mg and the next category is 50 mg to 80 mg, which is what we have talked about here.</p> <p>  Some mouthwashes and hand sanitiser liquids, like those used in hospitals, contain alcohol.  People will estimate their effect.  We cannot have zero tolerance because there are other ways that alcohol can get into one's system other than consuming alcohol for social purposes or whatever.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the important element that people use different measures, especially at home.  We see different measures in everyday life.  The size of a scone nowadays is three times the size of a scone 20 years ago so things are all relative.</p> <p>  In terms of mouthwashes and such issues, that is a red herring.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety conducts the tests in its labs in UCD and caters for this aspect.  All of this aspect has been researched.  The margin of error is fully anticipated in terms of testing someone's sample.  Eating some sherry trifle will not put one over the limit.  </p> <p>  Ms Burns may come in on this but the morning-after effect is that many people are very fatigued but there is a small trace of alcohol.  This is what we are seeing in terms of contributing factors in alcohol-related crashes.  There are other reasons that alcohol has contributed to the result of a fatal or serious crash.  </p></speech>

We ask road users to be sensible.  We want them to know that if they get behind the wheel in the morning but had ten pints beforehand that they should do the maths.  For example, one of the messages that we have communicated previously was that it takes about an hour for a unit of alcohol to be processed by the body.  People need to exercise personal responsibility and use common sense to a certain extent.  It is a complicated science and we defer to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for the detail on this matter.</p></speech>

That may be the case but this small percentage of motorists have the potential to devastate many lives and communities, and we saw the result with Ciar&aacute;n Treacy being killed by a drink-driver.  One cannot negate such loss of life by saying it was a morning-after death because these lives are just as important.  In terms of the 1.3% of cases where alcohol was a factor at between 50 mg and 80 mg, those lives are every bit as important.  We cannot as a nation and a society allow the current situation to go on.  We cannot resist legislation just to protect people who break the law.  They are drink-drivers.</p><p>That is the first point we make.  It is not a change in levels.  We are not reducing the level of alcohol allowed, rather we are changing the deterrent and we should make no apology for doing so.  That is what is at play.  It is important to point out that we are dealing with people's lives and that we looked at the files.  Fathers, mothers and children are left behind.  It is a very important issue.</p></speech>

However, it is a valid point.  What it does do is undermine the confidence of the public in the potential of being stopped at a checkpoint.  We have to acknowledge that it has had a big impact on people who have been drinking and driving and I can only imagine the reaction of families who have lost members as a result of people drinking and driving.  They are probably asking what would have happened if they had not done so.  That is a normal reaction.  It is very important that we receive credible data from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purposes of our interventions.  We welcome the reviews and examination of this subject, but we do not want them to detract from the Bill which absolutely has the potential to save lives, regardless of other factors.  It is very important to state this is based on hard evidence from the files we have examined.  That is what we are bringing forward.  We are not bringing it forward on the basis of the number of breathalyser tests conducted.</p></speech>

The graph covering the period from 1997 to 2016 shows that many of the measures introduced have saved lives, which is very welcome.  I grew up at a time when drinking and driving was acceptable.  People did not stop because they could kill themselves or somebody else but because they might lose their licence or the cost of their insurance would increase.  The delegates are correct that there is a need for enforcement because if people think they can get away with something, they will try to do so.</p> <p>  Our job, as legislators, is to craft legislation and make sure it is fair.  I have dealt with many vested interests, including various health groups, the Catholic Church, the GAA, chambers of commerce, the IFA and residents' associations.  Certainly, I do not see vintners as a serious pressure group.  I have found them to be quite reasonable.  We all have a vested interest in what happens, including the Road Safety Authority which is interested in ensuring fewer people will be killed on the roads.  It is a personal, not a financial, interest.  A few times I have heard vintners being described as a vested interest.  Yes, they have a vested interest because they are businesspeople who are doing their best, but it is our job to try to be fair.</p> <p>  I am probably guilty of using a mobile phone and texting in the car.  I have a hands-free kit, but I use and look at Google maps while driving through the city.  In my heart and soul I know that is wrong and that I should pull in.  Does this mean that down the road, if we reduce the blood alcohol limit so low that it will save lives, we will effectively ban the use of mobile phones in cars because people are texting?  </p> <p>  As regards people who do not wear seat belts, we have a young child.  If I am sitting in the back of the car with her and she is crying, I am tempted to take her out of the seat, but I will not do so.  The delegates will understand where I am going.  We are tackling the issue of drink driving, rightly so, but will the Road Safety Authority eventually propose that the use of mobile phones in cars be banned, unless part of a hands-free kit?</p></speech>

As I stated, 60 to 70 lives a year are lost in crashes as a consequence of alcohol being a factor.  Use of a mobile phone is absolutely a factor in many crashes but not as many as alcohol and we have legislation in place to deal with the issue.  We are monitoring the position.  New legislation has been introduced in the United Kingdom to double the number of penalty points imposed.  We have other research reports covering speed, vehicles and alcohol and have one coming out on vulnerable road users which will cover the issue of use of mobile phones.  I must point out that the mobile phone element did not feature in the 867 fatal crashes to such an extent that it warrants this level of scrutiny and legislative consideration, but we will absolutely have it as part of our programme.  It is an offence to use a mobile phone in a car and many manufacturers are introducing technology to disable mobile phones.  We have an extensive programme under which we advise employers to adopt an engine on phone off policy.  Many crashes were the consequence of employers contacting employees by mobile phone to see what they were doing, but in this debate that is not relevant.  We will take whatever measures are required in time.</p> <p>  On ultimately ending up in a position where there will be zero tolerance, we have pointed out that consuming any amount of alcohol impairs driving.  We need to tackle the levels we see in our research because 78 lives a year are being lost.  That is what we are here to do.</p> <p>  On the vested interests, the Senator is absolutely right.  Vintners have a vested interest in selling more alcohol as otherwise pubs would go out of business.  We do not have a vested interest, rather we have a mandate to save lives and represent all road users.  That is what is different and why we will make interventions and propose legislation.  We have the support of the motor industry, the AA and victims' groups.  Many vested interest groups fully support this measure.  I would not go so far as to say we are a vested interest but that we have a mandate.</p></speech>

Sometimes people assume it is for financial reasons, but it can be for personal reasons.  However, we will not delve into the matter.</p><p>Is there any modern technology out there that would simply prevent someone from getting into a car and starting it?  Would that be a way forward?</p></speech>

Many countries in Europe have already rolled these out for those who have committed drink driving offences.  The alcohol interlock is installed in the car.  It is like a breathalyser.  The driver blows into the device and it is not possible to start the car unless he or she is confirmed as not having alcohol in his or her system.  We are doing a cost-benefit analysis of it and investigating its feasibility.</p></speech>

I do not know how serious it was.  He was driving a new Ford Fiesta, which has software installed which places an emergency call automatically when an accident happens.  The PSNI arrived on the scene and detected that the guy had taken alcohol and that the car had called the police on his behalf.  This eCall technology will become mandatory in all new vehicles coming out of Europe in 2018.  While we certainly do not want to rely on technology that calls the emergency services after a crash has happened, it is an indication of the prevalence of drink driving.</p> <p>  Many professional driving companies already have alcohol interlocks installed in their vehicles.  A bus company from Dundalk, I think, won the contract to supply transport for the 2012 Olympics as a consequence of having them in its coaches.  Certainly for public tendering purposes, many buyers of services are encouraging the use of the best technology available resulting in the safest drivers.  Having heavy goods vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles fitted with such devices would be very welcome.  They are a high risk group in that they carry more passengers and bigger loads, so they should be safer on the roads.</p></speech>

That is what we are about: educating road users on the impairment effect of alcohol.  That is why the proposed Bill is extremely important.  A deterrent as powerful as the loss of one's licence for three months will make road users think twice before drinking and driving, even at the lower level of two or three pints.  We believe that is critical.</p></speech>

The witnesses have made the point that the lower limit was the reason for the reduction in deaths.  Are the witnesses now putting the blame for the recent increase in deaths on the level of the threshold or the severity of the penalties?</p></speech>

We had got the low-hanging fruit up to 2011.  We have crystallised the real underlying reasons.  As I said earlier, we would have expected around 15% of crashes to be alcohol related.  We also must accept that in 2011 the number of cars on the road was declining.  We are seeing a big increase in employment and disposable income and a change in attitudes.  There is a whole new crop of young people coming out.  Drivers who are now 20 or 21 years old were only in their childhood or early teens in 2011.  The only road safety messages they heard were the safe cross code and what they got in primary school.</p> <p>  We need to change attitudes in exactly the same way as happened for the smoking ban, when zero tolerance was achieved.  We have an issue with alcohol in Ireland and it is creeping into all areas of society.  Road safety is just one element of it.  This is a measure that is needed to change attitudes and make drink driving completely unacceptable.  We have a massive cohort of young people who do not accept drinking and driving.  Unfortunately, there is a growing number who think it is okay.  While everybody does not drink and drive, there is a small number of people who do and, once they start, the problem becomes pervasive.</p></speech>

I am still confused by that evidence and I think it is undermining the witnesses' case.  If I felt one life could be saved by making whatever reduction, I would support it.  However, I have not heard conclusive evidence or explanation as to why there are more deaths between 21 mg and 50 mg.</p><p>The witness has mentioned more time and so on but if drivers are detected with levels of 35 mg or 40 mg and there have been more deaths as a result, that would offer proof but that bridge has not been crossed by the witnesses.

The Senator is almost asking us to predict why someone was not killed in a crash.  These lower levels are 20 mg to 50 mg.  Maybe the figures are higher because younger people or non-professional drivers were involved in the incidents and were more likely to crash.  We have not considered that data.  We have not considered the characteristics of those individuals compared with those with a higher level of 51 mg to 80 mg.  People were killed on the roads in incidents involving blood alcohol levels lower than 80 mg and our argument is that there should be no differentiation.  We should not be telling one group of drivers that it is okay to drink and drive at that level and another group that it is not okay.  It should not be okay for non-specified drivers to drink at that level if it is not okay for specified drivers.  When would the discrimination stop?

Nineteen people were killed as a result of a driver or motorcyclist who had consumed alcohol at a level of between 20 mg and 50 mg.  We have discussed the complexities of identifying one's alcohol level if one chooses to have a drink or two.  The difference in level could be marginal.  It is not possible for a layperson to calculate that he or she has had a certain amount of alcohol, a certain amount of time has passed since the alcohol was had and he or she now knows that his or her alcohol level is 49 mg or 51 mg.  There can be a fine line between being between those levels depending on all the factors mentioned by Ms Murdock such as one's metabolism, age and so on.  It is complex.  Our message has always been that people should never drink and drive.  Any amount of alcohol impairs driving.  This analysis shows that people are being killed by drivers who have consumed smaller amounts of alcohol.</p></speech>

I have been in pubs that are controlled places for people to drink.  The publicans have been caring, have brought people home and stopped people from getting into their cars.  The witnesses can blame the legislators in the Oireachtas rather than the vintners in respect of the issue of people drinking at house parties and getting below-cost alcohol.  Members, as legislators, have not sufficiently addressed that issue.  That is important.  I have no connection with anyone who owns a pub and have no vested interest in the drinks industry.  However, my philosophy is that in any debate nobody is 100% right and nobody is 100% wrong.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  It has been useful to tease out the issues this morning.  I accept their bona fides in terms of getting this right.</p></speech>

They have been sent in here to do a job.  I am sent in here by the public to do a job.  I do not represent vintners.  I am a publican and I have never hidden that.  I live in the pub.  The people I represent have told me that this is a crusade to further isolate people in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  On a previous occasion I attended a meeting of this committee, figures were produced which indicated between 2008 and 2012, inclusive, 35 people were killed in collisions in which alcohol levels of 20 mg to 80 mg were a factor.  I asked whether the figures involved cases such as a person walking on the footpath having had several drinks who is then struck by a car driven by a person who has taken no alcohol.  I want the details of the 35 incidents that were referred to.  I have not received the breakdown.  Do they involve incidents such as someone who had had a few drinks, chose to walk home and fell off the footpath, possibly on a dark road, and was then struck by a driver who had not been drinking?  Perhaps they involve a driver who had an alcohol level of between 20 mg and 80 mg and was minding his own business when some other person going out of his mind and doing 100 mph to 120 mph came across the road and hit him?  Was there an incident of a person going home after having one pint or with an alcohol level of between 20 mg and 80 mg who then hit black ice and that was the overriding factor in the incident?</p> <p>  I want a breakdown of those figures because the statistics indicated that 19 people were killed in collisions in which alcohol levels of 20 mg to 50 mg were a factor and 16 were killed in collisions involving drivers with alcohol levels of between 50 mg and 80 mg.  As Senator O'Mahony said, the argument put forward by the witnesses on the previous occasion is not helping their case.  There is no mention in the document given to members today of the exact figures that were referred to on the previous occasion the witnesses appeared before this committee.  I want the figures to be fairly presented and the witnesses to outline what were the real causes of the accidents.  Many people are killed while walking home.  Many people are killed on the roads while sober.  We need to get the breakdown of those figures because the public is not accepting that a fair argument is being presented to them. </p> <p>   The purpose of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is to save lives.  Members of Kerry County Council and Members of the Oireachtas who represent Kerry have highlighted locations where fatalities have been caused by poor road layouts.  A lady cycling a bicycle was killed a week ago at the top of the Upper Lewis Road in Killarney where one accesses the bypass.  I am not saying that the road layout was the cause of that accident but the design of that junction needs to be addressed.  We have been making representations for many years about places such as that or Glenflesk, where five people have been killed and the road camber is at the wrong angle in both directions.  Why is the RSA not doing something about that?</p><p>To get back to what this debate is about, I need the witnesses to bring the statistics and facts before us or to the D&aacute;il Chamber, if the Minister wishes to do that.  We need the breakdown of blame to be apportioned to the driver when he or she has between 20 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood and to categorically state that a driver with a certain level of alcohol in his or her blood was the cause of an accident or fatality.  To date, they have not done that.  I asked the same of the Minister when he sat over there a number of weeks ago.</p><p> Commercial and professional drivers who drive buses and lorries are effectively at a zero tolerance level of 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  People in rural Ireland with one vehicle, be it a van, jeep or small tractor, are categorised in the same way as that professional driver so they are at a zero tolerance level.  These people have been hit already and they only have one vehicle.  They would lose the van or jeep that they use to bring bags of meal or whatever during the day.  They use the same vehicle to go to town or a local village for a bit of socialising.  They are treated unfairly under our laws.  I asked the Minister to consider this in framing his Bill and to get rid of this unfair anomaly but he or the Department has chosen not to do so.  Why is that not being addressed in this Bill?</p><p> I want the witnesses to state categorically when a driver with between 20 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood was the cause of an accident.  To just say it is a factor is not good enough for me.</p></speech>

These numbers are very small.  I can tell the Deputy categorically that 25 drivers caused the deaths of 35 people at those low levels.  What I understand is that if the Deputy saw the names and files, he would support this Bill.  Is that what he is saying?  I will seek to see if I can provide more clarity on the personal data of those individuals.  As the chief executive of the Road Safety Authority, the Deputy can take it that from the research and extensive examination of the contributory causes, those drivers were deemed to be culpable.  We have files that are not included in those numbers that include pedestrians who fell on the road or were sleeping on the road.  They are not included in these numbers.  A significant number of pedestrians were killed in alcohol-related deaths at the much higher level of 200 mg per 100 ml of blood.  The numbers are very small and it would be completely irregular and inappropriate to give out information in a level of detail that could lead to those people being identified.  I can say the numbers categorically to the Deputy and I will seek to see if there is a way we can show him the information.  It is probably not permissible.  The only reason we got to do this was by keeping the identities of people private.  We have recognised researchers and we have done this to best practice.  We have protocols in place to permit us to do the research in the first place and we stuck to that protocol.  The people in these cases were deemed culpable and not the pedestrian.</p> <p>  With regard to the matter of van and jeep drivers, I will correct the Deputy.  They are subject to a commercial vehicle roadworthiness test but it is C and D class drivers who are professional drivers; they are the specified drivers at levels of 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  I can drive a jeep but I am not a specified driver.  What applies in this respect is the classification of one's licence, and whether one has a C or D licence.  They apply to vehicles that are 3.5 tonnes and heavier.  We should clarify that it is not an attack on rural Ireland but about making all roads safer for all users.  A jeep may be subject to a commercial vehicle test, the licence determines whether one is a specified driver.  A learner driver or a professional driver is a specified driver.  A driver is non-specified if he or she has passed the test with two years of subsequent experience, as long as that driver does not have a C or D class licence.</p></speech>

The other question relates to alcohol being a factor.  The witness seems to be saying it is a factor.  What percentage is that factor?  What else was involved?  That is what we need to know.</p></speech>

There was a forensic analysis of the file and the contributory factors were listed.  In some cases that might have been alcohol plus speed; in some cases it was alcohol and fatigue.  No percentage was apportioned.  However, we know and have mentioned on numerous occasions this morning that the scientific evidence is unequivocal that any amount of alcohol impairs driving.  Therefore, we can conclude that of the 35 people killed by drivers who had consumed alcohol leaving their level between 20 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, alcohol was a contributory factor in those collisions.  We have other reports where we have looked at speeding in particular.  International research indicates that motorists are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviour when they are under the influence of alcohol.  Therefore, they are more likely to speed, lose control on bends and fall asleep at the wheel.  There is a link between alcohol impairment when driving and other contributory factors.  There would only be a very small number of cases where alcohol would be found to be the only factor, as alcohol contributes to other risky behaviours on the road.  That is why there are multiple contributory factors in many of these collisions.</p></speech>

When I go home this evening, I will not eat before getting behind the wheel because I know what it will do.  There could have been many other overriding causes for accidents as well as the consumption of a small amount of alcohol.</p></speech>

Many members of families affected by road crashes have helped in our communication.  I know she would not mind me saying this but Ms Susan Gray lost her husband a number of years back as a consequences of someone who admitted taking two bottles of Miller beer.</p><p>That is exactly what we are talking about here.  We have them probably watching today and listening to the debate and they know all too well the impact on their lives and their communities of having lost their loved one as a result of somebody who thought it was okay to have a bottle or two of lager or whatever.  It just leads to all of the factors Ms Burns has outlined already.  I can imagine Deputy Danny Healy-Rae asking us to prove it to him.  Bar putting one's finger in the wound, I would be more than happy to have some of those people to come forward and say they have been victims of that type of road offence.  To bring it back to the current situation, the reality is that all they will be subject to is a penalty point endorsement and a &euro;200 fine.  That is the reality.  That is the offence and it is totally disproportionate to the consequences.  We must address that and we have an opportunity.</p><p> We hope we have covered all of the questions on the data.  We are open to take any further questions but we believe we have proven unequivocally that this measure will save lives and we seek the committee's support in moving it along with the Bill and endorsing it.  We can take satisfaction from the chart on the other measures that the Oireachtas has supported which have saved many lives over the years.

If we could get this Bill through I believe there would be an immediate effect and we as the authority would immediately engage in an advertising campaign to educate people and ensure that everybody was aware of it.  It would have an immediate effect on driver behaviour.  I will go back to the small change in legislation for having a valid NCT.  Overnight, we saw there was an immediate effect.  In fact, it caused significant problems in the NCT network due to it trying to accommodate the demand by people to get their vehicles up to date.  Likewise, I believe that people will accept the change in this legislation and that there is no grey area &ndash; that they cannot drink and drive &ndash; and they will change their behaviour.</p></speech>

If one also subtracts the 20 mg to 50 mg bracket one is still looking at more than 80% of fatalities caused by other drink drivers.  Would it not be far more productive in terms of saving lives to focus on the 80%, the vast majority?  That is within the context of drink driving alone.  If we look at the overall road deaths we are looking at a far lower percentage in terms of deaths caused by drivers between 50 mg and 80 mg.  In no way do I say that any one life is less important than another.  Every one road fatality or serious injury is one too many.  I have said that here repeatedly, but would we not reap greater rewards from targeting the far higher percentages of deaths caused as a result of higher drink driving levels?  I do not hear Ms Murdock shouting from the rooftops that we do not have enough people in the traffic corps.</p></speech>

Today's debate is about the Bill.  Drink driving is a big issue in this country and I accept many lives lost are at levels above 80 mg.  Ms Burns already alluded to the fact that many of those issues are related to addiction and alcohol dependency.  That is a big societal problem for Ireland.  This is where it starts.</p> <p>  If we can stem the flow, especially in younger drivers, as new drivers are where the educational process starts.  Just because new drivers have a licence after two years and they are now 19 or 20 does not make them experienced drivers and we consider it is a big issue that they think it is okay to have a bottle or two.  If we tackle the 50 mg to 80 mg we remove the confusion and the temptation to have one or two drinks because people think they will be okay.  A significant number of people are arrested who are at the level of 80 mg to 100 mg.  A total of 400 people so far in 2016 were issued with six months' disqualification.  We believe that the impact at this level will cascade across all levels.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has left the room but I am sure he observes decision making in his own pub.  When one takes a drink or two, one's decision making changes.  One has heard the saying, "One for the ditch" and "Another one would not do any harm".  We have to stop the lax approach and the propensity to drink and drive and it has to be at this level.</p></speech>

There is no consistency in the argument.  That is why I am asking Ms Murdock these questions as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Could she be straight and say whether she considers this to be a stepping stone to 20 mg being the limit across the board?</p></speech>

This is the only one in the drink driving category that one can escape with an administrative fine, so if we put in the mandatory ban, all drink driving offences will result in a mandatory ban.

There is a greater risk there and hence the zero tolerance.  For non-specified drivers it is an offence to drink and drive at 50 mg but at the moment one can escape with an administrative fine.  We are saying all drink driving offences should be classified the same and should result in a mandatory ban.  The fact that there are different categories of driver out there is based on risk and it is not a cop-out at all.</p></speech>

Is it something that the witnesses anticipate will happen now as well in the 50 mg to 80 mg per 100 ml blood alcohol content category for non-specified drivers?  The point I am getting at here is that the time it takes for a person accused of drink-driving to come to court is already too long.  Will this not actually further delay the times for people who are accused to come to court?  At the moment, someone could have ten pints, drive home, be caught, be arrested, and drive away for months before coming into court.  I anticipate there will be more court challenges because the figures for court challenges are much higher where the penalty points option is absent.  That was not part of the regulatory impact assessment.  Do the witnesses anticipate that will have an effect?</p></speech>

In fact, it will reduce demand on courts if it acts as a deterrent, as we anticipate.  People will not engage in the activity in the first place, so they will not be issued with a mandatory ban.  Anybody already detected at 50 mg to 80 mg per 100 ml blood alcohol content is fully entitled to go to court to appeal that.  People still have the option to go to court as it stands to appeal that, so that is a draw on court resources-----</p></speech>

People do not want to lose their licences.  That is why they go to court to challenge these things.  The fact that people are afraid of losing their licences and end up having to go to court to challenge it proves in itself that this is a deterrent.  That indicates that this is valid.</p></speech>

Losing one's licence is losing one's licence.  The difference between the minimum period in court and the proposed change in the current legislation is three months.  It is an automatic three-month disqualification versus six months for a first offence.  My point is that there will be a far higher level of court challenges as a result of this change because people who face losing their licences will challenge that in court.  The risk is only three months of a difference.</p></speech>

My opinion is that it will deter people from drinking and driving in the first place.  Hence, they will not be stopped, will not be involved in crashes and will not be appearing in court.

The Chairman might draw the analogy that it is killer behaviour but our research does not show that to be as risky a behaviour as drink driving.

That report is in the public domain albeit it is a bit dated.  I do not recall the figures offhand but I can certainly get the report for the Chairman for clarification.  It is not data that I can provide from the research department, however.  There are complexities around the data.</p></speech>

I furnished numerous examples to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, of systems from around the world.  The greatest number of alcohol-related deaths are caused by people who are well over the legal limit and well over the limit covered by this derogation.  Would it not, therefore, be the sensible thing for us to pursue placing alco-locks in every vehicle?  Would that not simply prevent the crimes from occurring in the first place?  Rather than look at those who are caught for offences, why do we not pursue that?  Why are we saying we are waiting for Europe to do it rather than to do it now ourselves?</p></speech>

There is a significant cost associated with rolling out an alcohol interlock programme.  They have been shown to be effective.  It is important to state that all of the research shows that drink drivers are a heterogenous group.  One cannot, therefore, have one solution for all drink drivers.  As I stated earlier, there are more complex issues going on with drink drivers who consume alcohol at the higher levels.  There is often a dependency issue.  They are a more difficult group in terms of changing their behaviour.  Research has shown that alcohol interlocks and rehabilitation programmes are very effective for the high risk offenders who are repeat drink driving and drink driving at higher levels.  We need tailored solutions for the range of behaviours.</p></speech>

The national fleet comprises 2.7 million vehicles.  I am not sure about the cost of an alcolock but I am sure it is in the hundreds of euro.  If we are talking about alcolocks, we are talking about mobile phone use and technology to prevent that.  We are also talking about technology to prevent someone moving a vehicle without seat belts being engaged.  All of those technologies do improve road safety and we welcome them.  Certainly, in a commercial environment, we welcome buyers of public services ensuring that contractors come with those things fitted.</p></speech>

We have our vehicle standards and are working with the EU on that.  We certainly welcome technological advancements.  For example, it should not be possible to get a vehicle without a mandatory seat belt alert in the rear of the car yet that has still not become mandatory.  We see 20% to 22% of people killed every year because they did not wear seat belts.  Yes, some of them have made that decision because they have taken alcohol but a small measure would be to have an alert to say that a person cannot drive without it.  People are innovative and will come up with ways of circumventing safety methods.</p></speech>

Taking that logic, could we not apply the same thing to speeding, which kills far more people on the roads?  We have the penalty points system at the moment and we have penalty points for speeding offences, which we know kill people.  The witnesses are saying we should not have a penalty points system for drink driving offences because we know drink driving kills people.  Why do we have a penalty points system for speeding?  Should we not apply the logic that if somebody is speeding, speeding kills people so we should disqualify that person for speeding?</p></speech>

Could Ms Murdock give us the available figures?  It is important that we would have them because there is a strong feeling among members of the public that not enough is being done to tackle serious speeding, which is a major killer, and that people can do it far more often than drink driving.

We would be happy to look at further legislation in terms of speeding but we must be quite firm about what we are here to do today.  We are here to clarify questions about the pre-crash report on alcohol.  We have a very detailed report on speed and speed is also a killer behaviour that is combined with alcohol.  Members will see that in the report.  People make decisions as a result of drinking alcohol and also speed.  There is a lot of overlap whenever we talk about these killer behaviours.</p></speech>

That should be retrievable among the data.  It is important that the witnesses issue that information to the committee as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The chart is quite striking and what stands out is the establishment of the RSA in 2006 when the figures for road fatalities were well over 400 per annum.  Thankfully we have seen a serious reduction to 162 in 2015.  The figure went up last year, unfortunately.  The downward trend will, we hope, continue this year.  There is no room for any complacency.  I want to make the point that in the 30 years prior to the establishment of the RSA, there was a reduction of just one third in road fatalities.  Since then we have seen a huge reduction.  We never know who they are but there are hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people who are walking around today in Ireland who would not be here without the work of the RSA and the other State agencies tasked with reducing road fatalities and serious injuries.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the representatives and the RSA for the work and efforts in this area.</p></speech>

We have had cross-party support for many of the measures that are resulting in those reductions.  We unashamedly seek its support on this one also.</p></speech>

It is important that as Members of the Oireachtas there would be full scrutiny, that every question that needs to be answered would be answered, and that every question that needs to be asked would be asked.</p></speech>
