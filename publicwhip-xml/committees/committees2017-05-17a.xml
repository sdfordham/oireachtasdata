    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#A00600"><p>On behalf of Age Action, I thank the committee for its invitation.  In my opening comments I will focus on the gender gap in State pensions, especially the implications of the changes introduced to the pension system in budget 2012.  My colleague and I are perfectly happy to take questions on broader policy issues related to budget 2018.<br/><br/>I am the senior policy officer at Age Action.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Justin Moran, head of advocacy and communications.  I lead the organisation's policy team.  Of critical importance to this work is capturing the lived experience of older people in Ireland.  For some time we have been contacted by women pensioners who have highlighted injustices in the current pension system.  On foot of such contacts, in 2016 we commissioned research on the impact of changes that took effect in 2012 related to the eligibility criteria for receipt of the State contributory pension.  One woman said:</p><blockquote>I was so shocked, angry and annoyed when I first heard the amount I was to be awarded, it brought back the anger I felt in 1972 when I had to leave my job.  I believe I am being penalised for caring for my children.</blockquote> <p>Another woman said:</p><blockquote>I was devastated when I received the letter outlining how much I would receive.  I am so angry that they have taken the few contributions I made while a student into the averaging.  The system is grossly unjust and it is not there to ensure a just and adequate pension but rather to reduce the State's obligation as far as possible.</blockquote> <p>These quotes are from women who participated in Age Action's research project, Towards a Fair State Pension for Women Pensioners.  They are merely a sample of the many who have contacted us.  For many of the current generation of older women, legal restrictions, cultural norms and practices during their working lives meant that they often gave up work on marriage or to look after their children.  Their contributions to the pay related social insurance system can, therefore, be broken.  When averaged, their reduced number of contributions means that they are awarded a lower weekly rate of State pension than they would have expected.  A gender breakdown of State pension recipients is illustrative of this, as women are more likely to be claiming a non-contributory rather than a contributory pension payment.  For example, in 2015 a total of 62% of recipients of the State non-contributory means-tested pension were women.  The trends are reversed in the case of the State contributory pension, with 64% of recipients being men.  A typographical error was included in the submission to the committee on this point.</p><p>Overall, however, the breakdown is 50:50, in other words, pension recipients are divided equally between men and women.  However, we see these disaggregated gender issues when we look at the contributory and non-contributory system.</p><p> A further gender disaggregation across the contributory payment bands indicates that only one third of all female recipients of this payment receive the top weekly rate versus two thirds of all male recipients.  The overall gendered nature of accessing contributory and non-contributory pension payments was also evident in 2011.  This is not, therefore, a recent phenomenon.  From 2012 onwards, changes in the eligibility criteria of the contributory State pension made it increasingly difficult to access the top rate of payment, as indicated in table 1 of the presentation.  This is mainly because the weekly pension rate is calculated on the average number of contributions made over a working life.  The table shows the differences and band changes introduced in 2012, on which I will make some brief comments.</p><p> Originally, there were four band payments.  In 2012, band 2, which was the band of between 20 and 47 average yearly contributions, was split in three.  Until 2012, a person would receive 98% of the payment if he or she fell within this band.  However, after the band was split into three, a person who made 20 contributions would only receive 85% of the top rate of the payment.  </p><p> The rate of payment made to those in bands 3 and 4, which are now bands 5 and 6, was also reduced in 2012.  I will cite the example of an individual who worked for a few months in 1968 before leaving the workforce to raise a family, during which time she did not make contributions, and subsequently returned to work in 2000.  The average number of pension contributions she made would be divided by 48, which is the number of years between 1968 and 2016.  In effect, the weekly pension rate would be much higher if the individual had not worked in 1968 as the average would be divided out over only 16 years.  This means the woman in the example and women like her are being punished financially for choices they made decades ago.  They are also losing out because the homemaker's scheme, introduced in 1994, is not backdated.  As a result, these women, who would generally have carried out their caring duties in the 1970s and 1980s, derive no benefit from the scheme.</p><p> Age Action's research on this issue identified 36,000 individuals - one third of new pensioners - who had been negatively impacted by these changes between September 2012 and June 2016.  This figure is now undoubtedly higher, and of this number, 62% were women.  Those most negatively impacted have lost more than &euro;30 per week or more than &euro;1,500 per year.  It should also be noted that many male pensioners have lost out as a result of the changes introduced in 2012 because their contributions were also broken.</p><p> Age Action urges the joint committee, in its role of providing Oireachtas oversight of the budgetary process, to consider two recommendations.  First, the changes introduced in 2012 should be reversed and backdated in order that those currently affected are placed in the pre-2012 bands again, at least until moves are made towards the total contributions assessment approach planned by the Department of Social Protection for 2020.  The second recommendation, which is perhaps a more long-term objective, is that the committee examine ways in which changes could be made to the budget to eliminate the gender pension gap, including the backdating of the homemaker's scheme to 1973 when the marriage ban ended.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00200"><p>I thank Ms Feely for her presentation, which told us much of what we know.  We have been hearing the same thing every year since 2013.  Ms Feely spoke about a generation of women who have been let down by the State through the marriage ban and the absence of child care options.  Notwithstanding the poor provision of child care now, child care was non-existent for many of the women in question.  The changes made in 2012 are the final insult.</p> <p>  Age Action makes two recommendations.  What would be the cost of reversing the 2012 changes and backdating payments?  How many people would be affected if the recommendation to backdate the homemaker's scheme to 1968 or 1973 were implemented and how much would such a measure cost?</p> <p>  I will focus briefly on a number of non-pension issues that affect older people.  Fuel poverty is frequently raised, specifically the fact that the fuel allowance is not paid from March onwards, despite April often being a cold month, as was the case this year.  Is the impact of this issue increasing in terms of Age Action's daily case book?</p> <p>  As the budgetary process recommences, what are Age Action's key priorities for older people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00300"><p>First, on the reversal and backdating of the changes, our information from replies to parliamentary questions presented to the D&aacute;il is that the changes achieved annual savings of &euro;10 million.  If the changes were to be reversed today, it would cost approximately &euro;60 million.  If payments were backdated for those who have been impacted since 2012, the cost would be approximately &euro;200 million.  However, we would need to have updated figures to be precise.  Reversing the change would, however, cost &euro;60 million.</p></speech>

The latest figures from the Department show the cost of backdating the scheme would be &euro;290 million.  When the Department provided this information in the D&aacute;il it did not make clear on what year the figure was based.  We are trying to determine the year on which the figure on the cost of backdating is based.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00500"><p>What year is Age Action proposing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00600"><p>The 2007 Green Paper on pensions referred to backdating the scheme to 1973 and provided a figure of approximately &euro;150 million.  The paper acknowledged, however, that its figures were not calculated in detail.  Since January, the Department has been indicating that it has done much more substantial work on how it would backdate the homemaker's scheme and has provided an estimate of &euro;290 million for doing so.  However, it is not clear which year it used as the basis for backdating, nor is it clear how many people would take it up.</p> <p>  Ms Feely will address fuel poverty, after which I will discuss some of our other priorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#B00700"><p>A major issue in respect of the fuel allowance is that the scheme has not been very responsive to the increase in fuel prices.  We are often contacted by telephone by older people living alone who may have lost a spouse in the recent past but still face paying the same energy costs.  The scheme needs to be responsive to such cases and this will certainly be one our priority areas when we make our budget submission.</p> <p>  The fuel allowance is highly effective as an income support, although it does not address rising costs.  What we would like to see is a broader strategy and increased support for making homes more energy efficient.  In preparing for this meeting I read some work done on energy poverty by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  It examined the different costs depending on the building energy rating, BER, of houses.  It found that in the case of an energy efficient house, a household might spend &euro;35 per week and these costs would be met by the current rate of the fuel allowance.  However, those in energy inefficient homes, for example, a house with a rating of BER E1, would pay approximately &euro;83 per week to heat their house.  The allowance is not responsive to these differences.</p> <p>  Another issue we encounter with the fuel allowance is that it would be preferable if it were paid in one or two lump sums.  Making this change would be straightforward.  Older people tend to live in houses that require them to fill a tank of oil which costs a couple of hundred euro.  It is very hard to save up a little each week or pay out &euro;100 or &euro;200 for an oil delivery.  In many submissions to the Department we have encouraged the payment of the allowance in one or two lump sums.  Not everybody will be able to use the payment to buy coal or briquettes every week, which is fine, but we would like the scheme to be administered in that way.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran will elaborate on Age Action's priorities in a moment.  With regard to social protection, we would like the 2012 changes to be reversed and moves to be made towards setting a rate for the State pension of 35% of average earnings.  We will ask again, therefore, for the pension to be increased.  One of the critical issues is the need to review the living alone allowance.  The Vincentian Partnership has done good research on adequacy which found that pensioners who live alone have inadequate incomes.  We will ask again for an increase in the living alone allowance to take account of energy costs which may previously have been covered by two pensions or by one pensioner and another qualifying adult.</p><p>Food costs do not automatically halve for a person living alone and the figures indicate that while two-pensioner households may spend &euro;80 per week on food, this only falls to &euro;64 for a pensioner living alone.  These are the key things on the income side that we will be looking at.  Mr. Moran will speak about the health priorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#C00200"><p>Our big focus in regard to health is on home care.  Government policy since the late 1960s has been that people be assisted to stay home as far as possible and that the care and supports should be available to enable this.  Unfortunately, in the past number of years there has been a reduction in the amount of home help hours provided.  The HSE will provide fewer home help hours to fewer people in 2017 than in 2011.  A real concern is that the number of people who need it is continuously increasing.  The HSE's estimate is that between 10% and 11% of people aged 65 will need home help supports, which works out at approximately 63,000 people.  We are supplying home help support to some 50,000 people at present so there is a gap between what the HSE anticipates and what we are fulfilling.</p> <p>  In the immediate future we seek an injection of funding to support home help, as 4,500 people are on a waiting list for home help hours or home care packages and that number will grow.  We welcome the effort of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy McEntee, to move forward with a consultation on a statutory scheme to provide home care, which is badly needed.  We look forward to participating in the scheme but it is a medium to long-term solution.  The immediate problem concerns people who are in hospitals and who cannot get home help hours and family carers who do amazing work but who are driven right to the edge to support people.  Social workers tell us they are waiting for recipients of home help hours to die to free up home help hours they can reallocate.</p> <p>  The budget for home help is &euro;192 million and we will be looking for an increase, though we have not come up with a specific figure yet.  The HSE has also indicated that it will be looking for investment in this area.</p></speech>

Can families afford it?  The recent Bus &Eacute;ireann strike highlighted the irrelevance of the bus pass for a lot of older people because they could not access transport.  What feedback did the witnesses receive from member organisations on this issue?</p></speech>

People are now waiting an average of four weeks for their application to be processed and that is as good as can be expected.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#C00600"><p>We would agree with the principle but would have question marks about how it would work.  To access the fair deal scheme, for example, a person needs to pass a care needs assessment and be assessed as having a level of care that could only be treated in a nursing home.  Many people who need home help support would not meet that criterion.  Second, with the fair deal scheme, part of the payments are made with a levy on the family home on the basis that one is not in the family home any more but in a nursing home.  Home help, on the other hand, is received at home.  We will be arguing for a statutory scheme specifically designed for home help and home care, rather than that the fair deal scheme be adapted to fit.  They are quite different processes.</p> <p>  We need to avoid setting nursing homes and home care against each other.  We need a continuum of care and many older people will never need any home help or home care supports.  A percentage will need home help and a percentage will need home care while some will need to go into nursing homes.  Consequently, we need investment in quality nursing homes.  The funding for fair deal and the application process are working reasonably well at the moment.</p> <p>  As regards transport, we have an information helpline available to people to contact us on benefits entitlements etc.  With the threat of the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike we got a large number of phone calls, particularly from people in rural communities who were concerned about how it would affect them.  As Ms Feely mentioned, one of the differences between the incomes of pensioners in rural areas and those in urban areas is transport and we have dealt with a lot of people who have raised the issue of car insurance.  They may be eligible for the travel pass but they do not have public transport so it does not make much of a difference to them.  They need to keep a car on the road and to pay for petrol or diesel and car insurance.  These transport costs are an issue for a lot of older people.</p></speech>

What is he looking for in that scheme?  There are issues with the fair deal scheme.  What specific issues need to be addressed in that scheme and in respect of the supports that should underpin it?</p> <p>  Dementia care comes up on a regular basis when I deal with advocate groups for older people.

I apologise to Mr. Moran.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran touched on the changes made in 2012 to the State pension.  Have they been costed?  How much would it cost if we were to reverse the changes made to the bands?  Is the transition pension an issue for older people, or one on which Mr. Moran has been lobbied?  How does it affect people?  Should it be a priority in the upcoming budget?  His organisation has put forward alternative budgets in the past.  Has this issue ever featured?</p> <p>  There were a lot of secondary welfare cuts, including to pensioners, with home care packages and telephone allowances cut, among other things.  Of those, which are the key ones that impact on older people and which the witnesses would like to see reversed?</p></speech>

If a person is in a nursing home, under the fair deal scheme bed and board will be covered but that person will have to pay additional charges out of income.  Under the fair deal scheme, one pays 80% of income to the nursing home and retains 20% but we encounter people who are obliged to pay for everything, from incontinence pads to extra GP services and social activities, out of the 20% of income they are allowed to retain.</p><p>We are working on a piece of more detailed research in this area which we hope to publish in the coming weeks.  We have certainly had experience of people on low incomes who, under fair deal, are supposed to have their choice of nursing home, but who find their choices severely restricted because of the income with which they would be left and the charges with which they would be faced.</p><p> In respect of the consultation on home care, Age Action Ireland and about 14 or 15 other NGOs have put together a discussion document which we sent to the Minister and to the political parties' health spokespersons.  It identifies the issues we would like to see addressed in the home care consultation.  They include clearly defining home care, ensuring we can include assistive technology in the provision of home care, and ensuring it is person centred and geared towards individual need.  The consultation must also take account of the needs of the workers providing home help and home care.  One of the unfortunate changes of recent years has been the reduction in the amount of time that each home help worker has for a client.  There are people who might get 15 minutes in the morning and the evening.  That can be very difficult for the worker and, obviously, for the client.</p><p> Another issue that must be addressed if we are to introduce a statutory home care scheme is how we are going to pay for it.  However, we are hoping that the consultation does not focus primarily on that but rather on reaching agreement and consensus about a vision of home help and home care.  We must also address the point made about people with dementia who need home help supports specific to that condition.  Once we have that overall vision, we will figure out how to pay for it.  It might require increased funds from general taxation or co-payments.  We will approach that with an open mind.  We would, however, be very concerned about any attempt to means test such a scheme.  Many of our members have had quite negative experiences of medical cards in that respect.</p><p> On the costing of the State pension for 2012, if it was restored in 2017 it would cost just over &euro;60 million.  That is bringing everybody who lost out from 2012 to 2017 back into the bands they would have been in.  The per annum cost of maintaining them in those rates would be around &euro;10 million going forward.  On the issue of the transition pension, I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Naomi Feely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Feely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#D00200"><p>Coming back to the Deputy's question on the dementia strategy, my understanding is that there is an implementation plan.  While we have the national positive ageing strategy, a big issue on which Age Action Ireland has campaigned is the lack of an implementation plan for it.  As far as I am aware, there is an implementation plan for the dementia strategy.  We have only finite resources for our own work.  We tend to collaborate with Alzheimer's Ireland a lot.  It has done quite a bit of work on this area so it might be worthwhile for the committee to link in with Alzheimer's Ireland too.</p> <p>  The transition pension was abolished in budget 2014, I think, or perhaps it was in the previous budget.  It is no longer available to recipients.  It is a big issue for us that a public sector worker is required to retire at 65 but is not entitled to a pension until the age of 66.  We hear a lot from people who are forced to retire from their jobs and have to go to the social welfare office and apply for jobseeker's benefit there.  As the committee is aware, there are conditions attached to that benefit.  We are aware - it was in a newspaper article a few years ago - that people are not really forced to go out looking for a job.  Nonetheless, it seems a little unclear to me.  We have done quite a bit of work around the issue of mandatory retirement and have called for its abolition.  That would be the key issue in respect of the transition pension which, obviously, is no longer available.  There might have been one or two people still on the payment in 2015 but that is not the case for this year or last year.</p> <p>  The point about secondary cuts is very important.  Our work on previous budgets highlighted that while the State pension was protected, when we added up all the little income cuts such as the fuel allowance, the abolition of the telephone allowance, and the changes in the electricity portion of the household benefits package, older people who were solely relying on the State pension and those supports were facing a cut of &euro;13 per week.  That was on top of the introduction of the carbon tax.  We also had water charges.  A lot of fear was created among our members.  Our submission last year called for the reintroduction of the telephone allowance.  It is a vital support, allowing people to stay connected through pendant alarms, to phone younger relatives abroad and so on.  This year, we are focusing on the fuel allowance and the living alone allowance.  The living alone allowance was introduced at a rate of &pound;6, which was converted up to &euro;7.70 when the euro was introduced.  Since then, we have only seen one increase, to &euro;9.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice research from three years ago indicates that it should be around &euro;11.50.  We will be emphasising the issue this year and teasing out the costs.  Individuals living alone are facing the same costs as a pensioner couple.</p> <p>  Was there another question from Deputy Cullinane?</p></speech>

I have heard their contributions at the Committee on Social Protection and am familiar with their work.  I thank Age Action Ireland for the work it does for our older population.  Older people have been hit detrimentally by the changes introduced in budget 2012.  One of my first pieces of work as a newly elected Deputy was to bring forward a motion on pension equality and fairness, which sought to address some of those changes, particularly for female pensioners.  The witnesses' submission today highlights those changes from budget 2012.  It shows that 62% of recipients receiving the non-contributory pension were women.  The Government knew exactly what the repercussions and implications of this measure would be, and that it would increase the pensions gender gap.</p> <p>  The qualifying age for the State pension was also increased to 66, as Ms Feely just said.  People have worked all their lives and paid their contributions, yet at the end the goalposts have been shifted.  They have been forced onto jobseeker's payments.  The latest figures from the Department show that at the end of January this year, there were 5,239 65 year olds forced to sign on.  That should be enough to set off alarm bells.  We know the impact it has.  People who should be receiving their State pension in full are receiving about &euro;40 less on the jobseeker's payment.  Many of them never signed on for social welfare before in their lives.  I brought forward the pensions equality and fairness motion to try to address these anomalies and reverse the unfair changes that were made in 2012.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was defeated not just by the Government; Fianna F&aacute;il voted against the motion as well.

Unfortunately, that motion fell.  We know the changes introduced in 2012 have impacted on over 36,000 people, who are now receiving lower payments than they would have received had they retired in 2012.  Do the witnesses have any updated figures aside from those dated 2016?  I think they say in their statement that it is expected and understandable that the figures would increase.  Was that critical research that Age Action carried out sent to the Department and the Minister?  If so, was it acknowledged, and did the Minister give any feedback on it?</p> <p>  Age Action puts forward a very important and very simple proposal on the fuel allowance.  It would be paid in either one lump payment or two lump payments.  I put this very point to the Minister and I do not think he really got it.  He could not differentiate between someone in receipt of the State pension and someone on a basic jobseeker's.  He said he would not consider the proposal because of the challenges and difficulties it would create.  The simple point there is that if someone - for example, a young person - signs on, it is hoped he or she will not be on jobseeker's for too long.  The simple thing would be to differentiate perhaps between someone who is 65 and someone who is 66 or older.  Whether to issue a one-lump payment or a two-lump payment could be considered.  We know the challenges people face if they want to get fills of oil.  One cannot pay on a weekly basis; it is an up-front payment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.60" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#E01800"><p>I will take the questions in reverse order.</p> <p>  A draft copy of the report was sent to the Department of Social Protection in advance to get its comment, feedback and information.  Then, once it was published, copies were sent to the Minister and the Department.  We received an acknowledgement from the Minister.  We have not had an opportunity to discuss the report with him but we have discussed it with officials from the Department of Social Protection as recently as Monday as part of a bilateral meeting with the community and voluntary pillar.</p> <p>  Regarding updated figures, we wanted to use the figures we had in the report because the Department gave us them quite specifically.  I believe a parliamentary question about this was asked last year.  I forget the exact figure, but more than 40,000 were affected by the cuts from 2012.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's last point about the transition pension and mandatory retirement, it is a very good example perhaps not of a budgetary cross-cutting theme, but certainly a Government cross-cutting theme.  A decision was made to increase the State pension age to 66 by abolishing the transition pension - in effect, that was what was done - and it will increase to 67 and then to 68, but mandatory retirement clauses were left uncut.  If one does one and not the other, one then ends up with the anomaly the Deputy has pointed out, namely, the large number of people aged 65 on jobseeker's benefit.  If an increase in the pension age were to be considered, the abolition of mandatory retirement ages should be considered.  This will get worse when the pension age increases again to 67 in 2021.  Obviously, we are hopeful legislation seeking to abolish mandatory retirement will be enacted - I believe Deputies introduced such legislation - but this is one example of a Department doing one thing and not necessarily thinking through how it might affect another Department.</p></speech>

People were forced to retire at 65 and sign up to a jobseeker's payment.  The cost of reinstating the State transition pension is in and around &euro;84 million, but abolishing the mandatory retirement age would dramatically reduce that I think.  Perhaps the witnesses can elaborate on the impact on people of their having to retire against their will.  People should be given the choice to continue working.  Females should be able build up their contributions.  Regarding the changes introduced in 2012, if they want to continue in the workforce, they should have an opportunity to do so, build up their contributions and get higher payments.  I am sure there are a multitude of reasons people may not want to retire, and perhaps the witnesses will be able to outline some of them.  I have spoken to many people about this.  Mr. Moran is right that I have introduced a Bill to abolish the mandatory retirement age.  Thankfully, it received cross-party support.  It is due to proceed to Committee Stage and I hope it will continue to proceed through all Stages until the mandatory retirement age is abolished.  Perhaps the witnesses could give their experiences of engaging with older people and the impact being forced to retire has on them.</p></speech>

They may still have mortgages, loans and family members going to college.  They do not necessarily want to work for the rest of their lives but they would like to work an extra few years to be financially secure.  From a budgetary or economic perspective, there is also the difference between someone working at the age of 65 and someone being 65 years old and in the social welfare system.  One of the challenges we often find when we talk about the issues Age Action wants to raise is that we talk about pensions, home help and home care and nursing homes.  We miss the fact sometimes that older people have an enormous amount to contribute.  These are skilled, experienced and trained workers.  One case that has always stuck in my memory is a HSE nurse who was forced to retire due to a mandatory retirement clause at the same time as we were trying to attract nurses into this country.  There is a financial and economic imperative in that regard.  Instead of a worker being put on the dole and then the State pension, if he or she wishes to continue working, paying tax and helping to drive the economy forward, that would be a positive thing.  We also hear, certainly from research conducted in Britain, that a large part of the reason people want to keep working is social as well.  These are their friends and colleagues.  People attach a huge sense of value to that.  To be told at the age of 65, "It is your birthday, you are done, it is time to go", is a real blow to the self-esteem and pride of the people affected by the situation.</p></speech>

Previous to the introduction of Deputy Brady's Bill, Anne Ferris, a Member of the previous D&aacute;il, also introduced a Bill on this matter.  There was a very good committee discussion with people who had been impacted by the situation.  I remember hearing at the launch of the report individuals - Deputies and Senators - saying they were very much struck by the powerful nature of the contributions that day.  In addition, through our lifelong learning work, we have a very good group in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and the individual charged with setting that up wrote a brilliant blog on our website about the issue of mandatory retirement, describing how on a Friday he was in work running an embassy office in Finland, on the Saturday he was packing up his boxes to leave and, on the Monday, he came home.  It very much captures the lived impact of the situation.  As for Age Action's work, we strongly rely on the lived impact of policies in trying to get our message across and in examining recommendations to Government surrounding these issues.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late and missing their contribution but I read their statement.  As others have done, I commend Age Action on its ongoing representation of, and advocacy for, older people in this country.</p><p>A major issue which we all have heard about, and on which I have received representations, is the number of pensioners, particularly women pensioners, who have been significantly adversely affected by the changes introduced to the way the contributions to the contributory pension scheme are calculated combined with the lifetime average method of calculating ultimate entitlement and the failure to backdate the period spent as a homemaker to those who left the workforce before the specified dates by the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton in 2012.  People have been dealt a triple whammy, which has negatively impacted on 36,000 pensions, particularly women.</p><p> The issue has been raised with the Minister and he indicated a willingness to look at it, but I have not heard anything since.  Has Age Action heard anything further about what the Government proposes to do?  Nobody could fail to acknowledge this injustice and how it impacts on gender.</p><p> This injustice will get worse if it is not addressed.  Has Age Action any estimates or projections on the numbers that will be affected as time goes on?  I would have thought that another cohort that will be affected by this measure as time goes on, unless it is changed, is the people who had to emigrate, and we have had successive waves of emigration in recent years.</p><p> An issue that I do not think was mentioned, or was referred to briefly is the thresholds for entitlement to a medical card.  This was in spite of the significant resistance and struggle of people to protest at the time the automatic entitlement to a medical card of a pensioner was attacked.  The then Government rolled back under the impact of the protests by pensioners and in particular the bodies, including Age Action which organised the protests.  Is there an ongoing creeping problem of pensioners losing their medical card and then having to apply for a discretionary medical card?  That puts people through the hardship of losing the card and having to reapply for a medical card.  Will Age Action comment on that? </p><p> Another issue which I have been chatting to Mr. Moran about is the issue of motor insurance for pensioners.  I know that our older population are one of the groups that are being particularly hard hit by the extortionate rises in motor insurance premiums.  A number of categories are being hit, but older people are definitely a category that are being discriminated against.  Is that something that we can and should raise in the context of requiring some sort of action in the budget that would begin to address the unfairness of motor insurance premiums?</p></speech>

On the question of whether we had a response or an indication from the Minister that the Government would backdate to take account of the 2012 cuts, we have not seen that.  The position seems to be that while the Government acknowledges that there are anomalies created by the averaging system, and we would say they are much more than anomalies, these would be addressed by the total contributions approach which the Department hopes to roll out in 2020 or 2021.  Many members would have been affected by the 2012 cuts.  When they write to the Minister or a Deputy writes on their behalf, that is the response that comes back.  The problem with that response is that even if that resolved the issue, people are losing income for three years - assuming it comes out in 2020; second, we are not clear what the total contributions approach will look like.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar has been quite clear about saying that there would be winners and losers from the move to that system.</p> <p>  In the medium to long-term future of the State pension, how the total contributions approach is calculated and how it will work and how it will be effective is important, but we do not see any move to try to reverse these cuts.  Raising the issue with the budget scrutiny committee is part of our campaign to try to get that issue addressed.</p> <p>  In 2013 about 94% to 95% of people over 70 years got a medical card.  I know that by 2015 that had dropped to 80% coverage, which is a pretty substantial decrease.  To pick up on two points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, the medical card limits do not rise with the rise in the State pension, so that in the past number of years, there have been two increases in the State pension, a &euro;5 increase delivered in March and a &euro;3 increase delivered in the preceding year.  If a person had a gross income of &euro;495 and was just under the medical card limit, the State pension increases push the person over the limit and one could potentially lose the medical card on that basis, unless one was to apply for a discretionary card.  If the Deputy spoke to some of our members who were in poor health, and told them one could have an extra &euro;5 income or a medical card, the majority of those in poor health would want the medical card.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#F00400"><p>It is something that has come up.  I would not have described it as widespread, but when we are talking about the pension increase we have had members raise it.  We are in the middle of our budget meetings with members but we have not had very many come to us and say that they have lost the medical card, but a number have said to us that they are very conscious that they are quite close to the limit, so they ask can we work on increasing the limit because it is getting closer to their income level.</p> <p>  To be fair, the Department has been better about the issuing of discretionary medical cards in the past six to 12 months.  That is certainly our experience.  There is an issue around people who are experiencing multiple morbidities, perhaps they have mental health problems and other difficulties and may not be able to engage in the process.  Many people may not necessarily know that discretionary medical cards are available and if they do they must go through an application process and they can often need support and assistance to do so.  We would suspect that there are people in the community who could get a discretionary medical card but cannot.</p> <p>  On the question of car insurance, this is an issue that the Deputy and I have discussed before, the real challenge is for older people in rural communities, because without a public transport system they are entirely dependent on their own ability to drive or on family members.  We have dealt with members who have had very substantial increases, ranging from 30% to 50% increases in their car insurance premiums.  It typically seems to happen when one goes from 64 to 65 years or from 69 to 70 years and one moves into a different category.  These are issues we have raised with the finance committee when they were working on car insurance.  In terms of how it might impact or affect the budget, one of the arguments we make is the reason we need the increases in incomes supports that Ms Naomi Feely has articulated is because of the increase in costs that older people are facing.  That can be an issue of car insurance or private health insurance, as many older people see private health insurance as an absolute basic requirement because they are unwilling to trust the public system.  When we argue for an increase in income supports, we are arguing for it not just because we believe it is necessary but because we believe it is necessary to meet rising costs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017051700002#F00600"><p>The priorities that  Ms Naomi Feely referenced were the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and the State pension.  Separating that out from the 2012 cuts, we are hoping for an increase of &euro;5 in the weekly State pension rate; we want to increase the living alone allowance to approximately &euro;11 - we have not finalised that figure but we are looking at the Vincentians figures of around &euro;11 and we still have to finalise our proposal on the fuel allowance.  We will finalise our figures before the end of June and they will be distributed to members.</p> <p>  I think it is important to take a moment to make this point on the State pension.  Ireland is one of very few countries in the European Union that has no system for how the State pension is increased.</p><p>If one looks at Britain, for example, there is the triple-lock mechanism where its state pension increases every year on the basis of the consumer price index on average earnings of 2.5%.  I am not necessarily saying that we should take that system but it is an example of the kind of systems that are out there.  Almost every other European country has some sort of system, whether it is measured by GDP or by average earnings, or a formula or combination of the two.  I believe that Ireland is one of only two or three EU countries that have no formula and the figure is decided on through a budgetary process.</p><p> One of the arguments put forward by Age Action is that the national pensions framework, published in 2010, sets out that the State pension should be 35% of average earnings at the top rate.  This would mean a State pension of around &euro;249 based on CSO figures for average earnings in the first quarter of 2017.  We are currently at approximately &euro;238 and a &euro;5 increase would move us in that direction.  That is one of the reasons we would argue for it.  The 35% as identified by the Government in 2010 was to keep people out of poverty and the State pension is the single most important tool we have to keep pensioner poverty down.</p></speech>

I presume that some of the members of Age Action are public sector pensioners.  What is Mr. Moran's opinion on the moves being mooted, as I and many workers and unions see it, and on the talk of further eroding public service pensions? There is talk of increases being linked only to inflation rather than to half of career-end earnings or the average earnings, which was the first phase of attacking those pensioners.  Has Mr. Moran any thoughts on that subject?</p> <p>  It may be a controversial area to get into from Mr. Moran's point of view but there is a school of thought around improving the pensions for low and middle-income pensioners and for ordinary pensioners on the State pension, which is to do something about the huge tax breaks for the very wealthy on their private pension contributions.  They get very nice pensions at the end of it and a huge proportion of the tax breaks available for this area actually go to that cohort.  If we began to look at that measure then we could use the money to increase the level of the State pension.  Does Mr. Moran have views on that debate?</p> <p>  I will move on to my last question.  I know that Mr. Moran spoke of home-care packages and the increasing demographic pressure to provide for our growing, older population.  Mr. Moran said he would rather start with a vision on what it is we want for people and then afterwards talk about how we would pay for it.  I believe this is the right starting point but we on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight must consider how to pay for it.  I agree that we must start with the vision but we also need to think about how to pay.  The unions have been pushing, quite rightly, on the whole issue of employers' PRSI and the very low levels of employers' PRSI being paid in the State compared to the rest of the European Union.  I believe it is fairly indisputable and is just a fact.  Calculations have been done that show if Ireland moved anywhere close to the average EU PRSI contributions, a huge pot of money would accrue from that.  It would actually begin to generate the sorts of revenues we need to deal with the problems and needs of an ageing population.  Perhaps Mr. Moran would comment on some of those suggestions.</p></speech>

I shall take some of the Deputy's points and I will consider the issue of private pensions first.</p> <p>  When we talk about the State pension in Ireland the figure of &euro;7 billion is generally used as the spend on the State pension, which is absolutely accurate.  We actually spend around &euro;9.5 billion in pensions because the private pensions tax breaks, as calculated by Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins, amount to &euro;2.5 billion.  When we consider the figure of &euro;9.5 billion spent on pension supports for older people there is a very strong argument to look at that &euro;2.5 billion and ask ourselves if we are getting the best value if our objective is a fair and sustainable State pension system that keeps people out of poverty.</p> <p>  One of the aspects of the national pensions framework that has always interested me is that the measures that will be unpleasant for pensioners, such as increasing the retirement age, have been delivered whereas some of the other measures were not delivered, such as the State pension being 35% of average earnings.  The framework also suggested changing the private pension supports from 41% to 33% which would save a substantial sum of money that could be invested in the State pension system.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is that we are very conscious of the amount of money spent on private pensions.  We do not have a problem with the State providing an incentive for people to take out private pensions.  It could be part of the solution to people having a guaranteed and decent retirement income.  We believe, however, that the people who benefit the most from private pensions are not necessarily those who need the benefit.</p> <p>  On PRSI, Age Action has identified that at 10.75% employers' PRSI is one of the lowest in Europe.  One of the issues that will come up is if employers'  PRSI is to be increased then what is it paying for? In delivering a sustainable pension increase, generally speaking there is broad agreement that part of the solution would be a need to increase PRSI rates at some point in the next three to five years, whatever that figure might be.  Some people may argue for a substantial PRSI increase and to leave the retirement age as it is.  Others may see it as part of a suite, which might include an increased retirement age.  The issue is also being looked at in the context of home care provision.</p> <p>  One of the arguments around how we could pay for home care is an increase in PRSI rates. This could be a way of doing it.  When we consider the Health Research Board's recent research that looked at home care systems in Germany, Sweden and Scotland - I want to say the Netherlands also but I could possibly be wrong on that - one of the systems of payment used by those countries is a version of long-term social insurance contributions specifically designed and set aside for home care.  In Ireland, the model of that would be an increase in PRSI designed to pay for home care supports.  Age Action's attitude to this is if we are to increase PRSI to pay for home care, does this make it more difficult to increase PRSI to pay for a sustainable State pension if that is something we need to do? Can we do both of those things?</p> <p>  We are genuinely entering into the consultation on home care with an open mind around financing.  We want to see more evidence and more of the arguments that will be put forward.</p> <p>  With regard to public sector pensions, as an organisation we would typically focus on the State pension and this is where most of our efforts go.  This is the area with the highest numbers of pensioners who are dependent on State transfers, especially at the lowest income rates.  We would certainly be uncomfortable with measures around public sector pensions that could end up driving people into poverty.  Our focus, however, would generally be around the State pension.</p></speech>

One of the points made was on people who may have taken time out of the State, particularly those who emigrated around the 1980s when people were out of work here.  This is a critical issue.  It might appear to be outside the remit of this committee but it is about planning for an ageing population and not just thinking about the circumstances of older people today.  We must also think about those of us who are in our 30s and 40s and what is needed to ensure that, as we age, we have a very positive experience of ageing and that Ireland is a good place in which to grow old.  This brings us back to the national positive ageing strategy and while it is not within the remit of this committee, the financing and funding of health, pensions, transport supports and enabling people to stay in their own homes is really critical and must be looked at also.  It is an important point to make.  What happens when we have more people who have taken time out from the workforce here and who may have given less of a contribution in Ireland?</p><p>That should be taken into consideration.  There is no point worrying on the day it happens that we suddenly have all these people.  We need to plan for it now.</p></speech>

The report compiled by Maureen Bassett, Towards A Fair State Pension for Women Pensioners, was very helpful.  When I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on 21 February 2017, he indicated that he would give this committee a remit to examine the recommendations made by Age Action Ireland.  I apologise for missing the start of the meeting.</p> <p>The witnesses made two fundamental recommendations.  The first is that the 2012 changes should be reversed and backdated, at least until there is a move to a total contributions assessment approach.  The Taoiseach could not tell me what level of savings the Government made each year from 2012 as a result of the changes.  Perhaps the witnesses know what the net cost would be, were this committee to recommend restoration of the relevant pre-2012 pension arrangements.  It is an emotive issue.  On 21 February I quoted a female constituent of mine who pointed out to me that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, said on several occasions that there are winners and there are losers.  He may discover the truth of that statement in the weeks to come.  Thousands of constituents are very bitter that they have lost the &euro;3,500 indicated by the witnesses' carefully-produced figures.  What would the net cost be were the committee to accept that first recommendation?</p></speech>

Age Action Ireland was very pleased that the issue was referred to this committee.  The information we have received from the Department and in responses to parliamentary questions indicates that savings in the first year following the changes was &euro;10 million and increased by &euro;10 million each year thereafter.  If the committee were to reverse the changes and go back to the four bands that were originally in place there would be a cost of approximately &euro;60 million in 2017.  It would cost an additional &euro;10 million for each year it were to be maintained.  If the payment were backdated, there would be a cumulative cost of approximately &euro;200 million, bearing in mind the yearly &euro;10 million increase.</p></speech>

The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar has repeated that backdating the scheme will involve a very substantial cost, although I am unaware of the timeframe on which he has based that calculation.  Today's witnesses have reiterated that there would be a substantial cost were the homemaker's scheme to be backdated.</p></speech>

Age Action Ireland and the National Women's Council of Ireland, which is supportive of this initiative, see 1973 as the preferred year to which the scheme should be backdated.  A cost of &euro;290 million for this has been indicated to us but it is unclear to what year the scheme has been backdated in the calculation carried out to reach that figure.</p></speech>

That was before PRSI was brought in.  It was an important gesture.  There are precedents for the committee to backdate the homemaker's scheme.</p></speech>

It is very important to recognise the contribution made by men and women, predominantly women, who were carers.  They were not collecting a salary and paying stamps but they were raising families and many of them gave up good jobs to do so.  For them not to receive any credit or recognition for that from the pension system is unfair.  They may not have made PRSI contributions but they made a contribution to this country and society, which deserves to be recognised.</p></speech>

The narrowing of population numbers in statistics as one ascends age bands is familiar to all.  Many Members have attended funerals of people who were in their 50s or early 60s when they died, be they friends, friends of colleagues or otherwise.  Is there any research on the issue of people who did not reach retirement but had made a contribution?</p></speech>

That group made a number of recommendations to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  It also recommended that training and supports be provided to enable older workers to remain in employment or to assist people to return to employment.  That report contained some good recommendations that could be usefully pursued.</p></speech>

The Social Insurance Fund is in surplus once again and provides a huge chunk of social protection spending every year.  Was an increase in employers' PRSI important?  There was a stage during the recession when there was a deficit in the Social Insurance Fund and we want to avoid a repeat of that.  We should be considering additional support we can give to older citizens in particular.  Do the witnesses perceive the Social Insurance Fund as being of particular importance?  How can the State encourage workers to take out supplementary pensions?  It would be helpful to this committee if more citizens were to have supplementary income streams along with the State pension.</p></speech>

It is hoped to publish it in the third quarter of 2017.  It will provide an insight into the funds available not just at present but for the next ten years and the demands which are going to be placed on the Social Insurance Fund.  It may not be within the remit of this committee but it would be useful if the Oireachtas were to pay close attention to the audit because it will inform decisions in regard to the State pension over the next five to ten years.</p><p>It is very important in that context. </p><p> In terms of supports to encourage people to enter into private pensions, one of the interesting points that the Department is considering is a new mandatory second-tier pension universal retirement savings scheme.  The Minister for Social Protection intends to publish an action plan for pensions before the end of June.  It will set out the pension reforms that he would like to see in the first, second and third tiers.  The mandatory pension may be similar to the system that has been introduced in Britain.  Certainly, we would have no principled objections to that.  We would be a little bit concerned about its potential to undermine the State pension system.  We know one of the models that the Department has discussed and considered is a mandatory pension scheme where everybody is required to make a 2% contribution.  That means the employee and employer make a 2% contribution and, potentially, the State, whether in the form of a tax break or a direct payment, makes a 2% contribution.  That might help build up a private pension pot but a question will arise if one needs to approach the employer or State to get money to support the State pension.  The initiative might be more challenging because there is an opportunity cost.  The money that could have been used for the option is gone because it is supporting the new proposal.</p><p> There is also an issue with who runs the mandatory pension scheme.  Is it run by private pension companies?  If so, are there fees?  What is their profit margin?  </p><p> In terms of the work that Government can do now, we suggest some sort of private pension incentive that bears in mind the points that I made in response to queries by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Also, the Government could support younger workers to get on board.  It would be helpful to provide younger workers with more information and encouragement.  It is really important that the Government considers introducing a universal retirement savings scheme.  When the Department declares the model, and if that is adapted, then it will be a huge change in Irish pension policy.  While it could be a positive and sensible change, we need to ensure that it is introduced in a way that does not undermine the existing State pension.  </p></speech>

In the Schedule to the Minerals Development Act 1940, dolomite and dolomitic limestone were listed as substances to be regarded as minerals within the meaning of the Act.  During the development of the general scheme of the Bill, this reference was considered to require clarification and an examination of how best to define &quot;dolomitic limestone&quot; took place.  This was a difficult technical proposition.  The formula appearing under the definition of &quot;minerals&quot; in section 2 was arrived at following discussion and consultation.  During the Seanad debate on the Bill, however, Senators raised a number of concerns regarding the practical application of the definitions &quot;dolomite&quot; and &quot;dolomitic limestone&quot;.  In addition, a number of Deputies, including the Vice Chairman, Deputy Lawless, and Deputies Cahill, Stanley, Sherlock and Mattie McGrath, reiterated these concerns on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  My officials have advised me that the practical difficulty of establishing whether a deposit contains dolomitic limestone is such that it would be best to remove dolomitic limestone from the list of substances which are regarded as minerals for the purpose of the Bill.  I am advised that the mineral dolomite does not present the same technical difficulties and that there is no reason this substance, which is of higher in-use value than ordinary limestone, should not continue to be regarded as a mineral under the Bill.</p></speech>

When we change Governments, Departments are changed all over the place.  The current arrangement is very fractured.  There are Ministers with several different pieces in their titles after the most recent change.  Departments have been chopped and changed to such an extent that it is creating administrative difficulties.  Last week, it created difficulties again during Question Time in the D&aacute;il in respect of the hot potato of An Post.  I ask the Minister of State to take that point back to his line Minister, the Cabinet and departmental officials.  I can see how one might change "energy" to "climate action" from one Government to the next.  I can see the sense in that because that is where things are at now.  However, when one starts moving big sections of one Department to another, carving Departments up and appointing Ministers across several briefs, it is a headache from a Government, Opposition and, I am sure, Civil Service point of view.  It does not help the functioning of Government or the D&aacute;il.  While I say that in a helpful way, I will support the amendment.  The Minister of State might just take the point back.</p></speech>

However, I took part in the discussions on the programme for Government through which the need for a Department to cover rural and regional affairs and a Department to cover housing was identified.</p><p>That necessitated some of the change that did happen.  Climate action and climate change have come to the fore in recent years and it was considered that the previous Department which had responsibility for local government and the environment was too large and had too many issues to deal with.  That was part of the reason but I accept that it does not always make for good governance, certainly at the initial stages when Departments change.  The functions within the Departments are reflected in the name changes that are part of the amendment.</p></speech>

The existing licensee whose interest is in, let us say, minerals A, B and C, has, in effect, a standing statement of interest over other minerals in the area of his or her licence.  In the event that a new and different applicant applies for let us say, minerals D, E and F, the sitting licensee is entitled to be notified of the new application and afforded the opportunity to submit a competing application within a specified period.  However, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, it is not considered appropriate that the identity of the minerals applied for by the new applicant be revealed to the existing licensee.  The amendment proposed corrects an error in the existing text which would have required the Minister to notify the existing licensee of the additional minerals applied for in the new application.</p></speech>

Joint venture agreements are commercial arrangements between licensees and other potential investors to allow access to further funds for exploration.  Typically, the incoming joint venture partner earns by funding or undertaking further exploration and if the project continues, they will be assigned a portion of the licensee's rights and obligations.  It has always been Government policy to encourage joint venture agreements in order to maximise potential further discoveries.  However, nothing in any such agreement can supersede or supplant the Minister's right to reduce the liabilities of the licensee.  Nevertheless, it is considered appropriate that the Minister is aware of the agreement in advance and that officials will be able to advise the licensee on provisions in the agreement that may present difficulties in the future.  As originally drafted, the section did not allow for advance scrutiny of joint venture agreements. Unless the joint venture results in an assignment, which can only take place with the written consent of the Minister under seal, the licensee will continue to be responsible for all obligations under the licence, notwithstanding any other agreement entered into by the licensee with third parties.</p></speech>

If damage was caused to local infrastructure by a quarry or other large development, that would have to be dealt with.  Those receiving prospecting licences must have insurance and must indemnify the Minister.  Under new rules for new mines, a remediation fund will be built into the application so that any remediation costs will be provided for.  That was not always the case.  Section 49 provides that the licensee is not liable for damage caused by a former licence-holder unless the subsequent licence is a renewal.</p></speech>

In other words, the Minister would not have the exclusive right to work them.  The provision was originally intended as enabling the efficient development of small-scale State owned mineral deposits.  </p> <p>  On Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad, Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of Sinn F&eacute;in opposed section 82 on the grounds that he did not wish to see privatisation of State mineral assets, no matter how small.  He considered it would be better for such minerals to be vested in the Minister and for a mining licence to be required for their development.</p> <p>  On Report Stage in the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, accepted an Opposition amendment to delete section 82.  However, for procedural reasons in the Seanad, the amendment fell.  The proposed Government amendment now effects the deletion of section 82. </p></speech>

There are a number of legacy sites around the country from before the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the introduction of the 1964 planning permission system.  I have come across this in my capacity both as a Member of the Oireachtas and previously as a local authority member.  These historic sites tend to cause difficulties for environmental protection primarily, for waste management, for roads planning and for proper planning and sustainable development of local authority areas throughout the country.  There is always the environmental risk and hazard of having a site lying unidentified, whether near to a road, area of natural beauty or anywhere else in proximity to major residential areas.  The intention behind this amendment is to produce a register.  I am aware the EPA has a register of 1977 to 1997 sites, and I welcome the Minister of State's opinion on it.  I believe there may already be a similar register in existence.  The intention behind it is to compile such a register in order that these may be identified and work may begin on a remediation process at a later stage.  The first step is to identify what sites exist and begin that register.  That is the idea behind the amendment.  I welcome any comments on it before we proceed.</p></speech>

In 2006, following incidents at active mine sites in Spain and Romania, the European Union introduced Directive 2006/21/EC on the management of waste from extractive industries.  Article 20 of the directive requires member states to produce an inventory of closed mine waste facilities.  The directive was transposed into Irish law by SI 566 of 2009, also known as the Waste Management (Management of Waste From the Extractive Industries) Regulations 2009.  Section 20 of the 2009 regulations provides that the EPA &ldquo;shall ensure that an inventory of closed waste facilities, including abandoned waste facilities, which cause serious negative environmental impacts or have the potential of becoming in the medium or short term a serious threat to human health or the environment is drawn up and periodically updated.  Such an inventory, to be made available to the public, shall be carried out by 1 May 2012&rdquo;.</p><p>In response to this requirement, a comprehensive historic mine site inventory was undertaken by the EPA, the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, and the exploration and mining division of my Department, which carried out surveys and analyses of mine sites.  The work completed was published and includes drawings, maps and diagrams of each of the closed mine sites.  The report of the study, entitled Historic Mine Sites - Inventory and Risk Classification, was produced in 2009 and has resulted in the most comprehensive inventory of closed mine sites in Ireland.  Geochemical site investigations were carried out at each mine site, consisting of analyses of solid waste, surface water, groundwater, stream sediments and soil.  There is a detailed review of the geochemistry of each mine site studied for this project.  The report classifies the sites that present the greatest threat to human and animal health and the environment.</p><p>The project initially located 220 mine sites located throughout the country from which there has been extraction of minerals using the GSI databases.  Of these, 128 sites were screened and 110 individual mines sites were identified for inclusion in the historic mine sites study.  In the Historic Mine Sites - Inventory and Risk Classification study, 27 historic mine sites and districts were assessed using a source-pathway-receptor conceptual model and were then scored and assigned to one of five classes.  Three mine sites - Silvermines, Tynagh and Avoca - were scored as the highest risk, class 1.  This report is available on the EPA website, specifically <i>www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/land/mines/</i>.  Given the existing requirement in Irish law for the EPA to maintain a list of mine waste sites and the implementation and publication of the Historic Mine Sites - Inventory and Risk Classification study, the Deputy's objectives have, in essence, already been achieved.  As such, it is not proposed to accept the current amendment.</p><p>I note in the amendment that the Deputy specifies 1977.  I think the EPA report goes back further than 1977, so in effect what the Deputy has asked for has already been done.  I am not sure if he has had a chance to look at that copy of the report, but it is quite comprehensive and very informative.  It is a historical source of information as well.</p></speech>

His officials hosted a very useful session yesterday evening where we had a chance to discuss and understand this.  The reason I mentioned 1977 on the amendment was because I am aware of a lacuna between 1977 and 1997, where certain sites were not recorded properly for whatever historical reasons.  It is an anomaly in the system.  The year 1964 is a key date, with the advent of planning permission.  This is something I have come across where sites, especially pre-1964 sites, are often unidentified or local knowledge may suggest their existence but there is not an accurate register.  It is very welcome that such a register has been compiled.  I believe it goes back to time immemorial.  I had a chance to review the report overnight, and it certainly seems to make sense.</p></speech>

The Minister of State says that there is no cut-off time for how far it can go back.  It can be pre-1977, or it can be pre-1964, even before planning permission was required.

It empowers the Minister to designate an area as a rehabilitation area and allows for the adoption of a rehabilitation plan and for persons other than the Minister to exercise the functions of a rehabilitation authority.  Section 135 permits the Minister to delegate the functions of the rehabilitation authority to a person, a local authority or the EPA under such terms as the Minister considers appropriate.  Since the Bill was published, responsibility for the EPA has transferred to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment; therefore, the requirement under subsection (2) for the Minister to seek the written agreement of the now Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government before authorising the EPA to act as a rehabilitation authority is no longer appropriate.  Amendment No. 27 reflects this transfer of functions.</p><p>Section 135(3) requires the rehabilitation authority to indemnify the Minister and the State in the exercise of its functions as a rehabilitation authority.  Amendment No. 29 amends subsection (3) to exclude local authorities and the EPA from the obligation to indemnify the Minister and the State as they are emanations of the State.</p></speech>

During this period of consultation, members of the public and other interested parties shall be free to submit their views on this report.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment seeks to achieve a degree of reuse of abandoned mines.  I have had conversations with SFI research centres and iCRAG and read various research reports on the issue.  It seems that many abandoned sites may contain slag heaps or unnecessary or unwanted materials which formerly would have been considered as waste.  Many of these materials have potential economic value, especially rare earth minerals which are extremely valuable and used in electronic devices such as the iPhone.  There are other opportunities also.  In France old mines have become vineyards because the soil and the detritus have advantages in producing wine.  The older the <i>terril</i>the more likely it is to encourage fermentation and growth.  That might not be ideal in the Irish climate, but other options could be pursued or at least investigated.  What was thrown to one side in the past may have the opportunity to become useful again.</p><p>The intention of the amendment is not to pass judgment on whether it is possible but to invite the EPA to perform a study to investigate the potential and report back in two years.  There may be opportunities to remediate some mines along the way.  We could take a mine that was abandoned and not tidied up in the most environmentally efficient fashion and repurpose it to extract new value or close it properly.  Any reactivity on abandoned mine sites should be subject to community consultation.  To this end, the amendment would allow for a six-month consultation process before any such action would be taken.  I hope the Minister and members will support the amendment as it potentially offers a new lease of life, as well as supporting the circular economy.  Rather than taking, using and disposing, we would reduce, reuse and recycle, which is at the heart of what the committee is trying to do.</p></speech>

I very much concur with the general intent behind it.  As I understand it, it is to encourage industry and the Government to focus on whatever opportunities there may be to extract minerals from existing mine waste at abandoned mine sites, thus supporting the concept of the circular economy.  Under existing minerals legislation, State mining leases require the lessee to fully work minerals under the lease terms.  The modern mines at Navan, Lisheen and Galmoy are and were better equipped to extract the full mineral potential of the mine material than older mine sites.</p><p>There is some industry interest in the reworking of mine waste on legacy mine sites, but it is at an early stage and will be driven by the economic potential.  In 2015 the Geological Survey of Ireland commissioned a short-call project entitled, An Economic Assessment of Irish Mining Waste, which was undertaken by Aurum Exploration Services.  The project aimed to analyse samples from mine waste sites across Ireland, with the emphasis on their economic potential.  A total of nine districts from the historical mine sites project were selected, namely, Abbeytown, Avoca, Caim, Clare, Donegal, Glendalough, Gortdrum, Silvermines and Tynagh.  Avoca returned the most positive results, particularly the spoil heaps in which elevated gold, silver, copper and rare earth elements were detected.  The study recommended further analysis of waste dumps at Avoca.  Unfortunately, the majority of historical mine sites sampled were reported to have no economic value.</p><p>The provisions of the Bill facilitate the potential reuse of abandoned mines and associated waste.  The definition of minerals in section 2 includes &quot;all substances, including scheduled minerals, that occur naturally in or on land, or that occur in extractive waste&quot;.  The primary responsibility for mineral resources development lies with my Department rather than the EPA <i>per se</i>.  While I cannot accept the amendment, as drafted, perhaps further engagement on this issue in advance of Report Stage might be merited.</p></speech>

I must declare that we did not find anything but it was good fun.  On that river there has also been an historic issue of pollution coming from the old mine sites.  There was a certain amount of investment in recent years in remediation but could the Minister of State provide any update?  Is the river still particularly polluted from the old mine tailings or have many of the issues been addressed?</p></speech>

Deputies Stanley and Lawless spoke on it.  I wish to offer my apologises because I was unable to be there.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, moved that motion.</p><p>In essence these amendments propose a ban on primary mercury mining, thus facilitating Ireland's ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.  The convention, agreed and adopted in 2013, is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury.  The convention focuses on a global and ubiquitous metal that, while naturally occurring, has broad uses in everyday objects and is released to the atmosphere, soil and water from a variety of sources.</p><p>Controlling the human sources of releases of mercury throughout its lifecycle has been a key factor in shaping the provisions under the convention.  The provisions of the Minamata convention include: a ban on new primary mercury mines; the phasing-out of existing ones; the phase-out and phase-down of mercury use in a number of products and processes; control measures on emissions to air and on releases to land and water; and the regulation of the informal sector of small-scale gold mining.  The convention also addresses interim storage of mercury and its disposal once it becomes waste, sites contaminated by mercury as well as broader health issues.  Ireland officially signed the convention in October 2013 at the diplomatic conference in Kumamoto, Japan.</p><p>The purpose of these amendments is to insert a new Part 8 that will effect a ban on primary mercury mining in Irish law.  This amounts to implementing one of a number of actions necessary to allow Ireland to ratify the convention in 2017.</p><p>The new section 224 provides definitions for a number of terms used throughout this new Part 8, such as &quot;mercury&quot;, &quot;mercury compound&quot; and &quot;primary mercury mining&quot;, which is defined as mining in which the principal material sought is mercury.  These terms reflect what is proposed for in the convention.</p><p>Section 226 provides that the Minister may not grant a licence in respect of prospecting for mercury or for undertaking primary mercury mining.  Moreover, it precludes the Minister from undertaking such activities.</p><p>Section 225 makes it clear that the holder of a prospecting or retention licence will continue to be allowed to search for traces of mercury where the purpose of such exploration is to assist in the identification of other minerals.  In addition, the use of mercury or mercury compounds for laboratory scale research continues to be permitted.</p><p>Section 227 proposes that a person who prospects for mercury commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine, currently up to &euro;5,000, or on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000.</p><p>Where the Minister authorises a person to mine any minerals or ores, such authorisation shall not permit extraction of mercury as a primary product or extraction of ores of mercury for the purposes of production of primary mercury.</p><p>Extraction of trace quantities of mercury in the course of extraction of other minerals, ores or compounds will continue to be permissible provided the purpose of the extraction is not to produce mercury in metal or concentrate for sale or export.  Such traces would be regarded as contaminants to be removed during the processing of the ore.</p><p>Section 228 proposes that a person who carries out primary mercury mining commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000.</p><p>The proposed amendment to the Long Title is intended to reflect that the Bill will include provisions in respect of the Minamata convention.</p></speech>

This may require the bringing of a Government amendment on Report Stage.  In essence, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is not legally required to consult the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport with respect to the safety of navigation and sea pollution.  The purpose of the amendment would be to rectify this position.</p></speech>

A question arose relating to exploration at sea and whether it would apply.</p> <p>  My question is more specific.  An example might arise in the Irish Sea.  Let us suppose there was a seam of coal in a sub-sea area and someone was looking to extract it by various means.  This might not necessarily involve a mine.  One could use steam to gasify it or use other mechanisms.</p> <p>  In our discussions yesterday, we were considering onshore mining exclusively.  An offshore coal seam might be extractable using unconventional methods that would not amount to fracking but could perhaps be steam-based recovery.</p><p>How would such a prospect be regulated?  Is it a petroleum prospect licence or a mining licence or do we in any cases issue mining licences out in our sea waters?</p></speech>

It is not a hypothetical question, there is apparently a coal seam out in the Irish Sea which has been considered for a long time.</p> <p>  I do not think we should be doing any exploration for any fossil fuels any more.  We have to put an end to all our offshore exploration for fuels from a climate perspective but that is a real prospect as I understand.  So would that prospect be regulated under this legislation?</p></speech>

I do not know if there is any example where fracking offshore is possible - it would seem to be technically impossible - but if there were an offshore fracking development, would that also effectively be a mining licence application or would it be a petroleum licence?</p></speech>

I advise members that Standing Orders 93(3) of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and 79(2) of Seanad &Eacute;ireann state that in the unavoidable absence of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman shall perform the duties devolved and exercise the authority conferred upon the Chairman by Standing Orders.  I, therefore, propose that, as Vice Chairman of the committee, I chair this meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Apologies have also been received from Senator Denis Landy.</p> <p>  Members are requested that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are switched off completely, or switched to airplane safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  It is not sufficient for members just to put their phones on silent mode as this will maintain the level of interference with the broadcasting system.  I propose we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters before returning to public session.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I wish to read into the record that at our meeting of 3 May 2017, during our deliberations in public session on petition No.P00034/16 from Mr. Joseph O'Shea entitled, Lack of Appeals Opportunity for Pension Assessment, one of the recommendations read into the record was to ask the Department of Justice and Equality to correspond with the petitioner, outlining the policy element of the petition.  However, the recommendation should have stated that the Department correspond with the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The first petition for consideration is petition No. P00023/16<b></b>from<b></b>Mr. Norman Wilson, entitled, Acknowledgement of, and response to, correspondence by government ministers.  We agree to the recommendation and to forward a copy of the responses from the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00003/17 from Mr. Brian Houlihan, entitled, Public consultation on the feasibility of developing a hemp industry.  It is agreed that we correspond with the Department and request a timeline for its examination of the issue of growing hemp commercially in Ireland as soon as it is available, that we request that the committee be updated on any progress and that we forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner.  The petition will remain open and the secretariat will request an update from the Department within three months.  We also have the additional suggestion from Deputy Mitchell that we seek input from the Department of Health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant stakeholders on the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00009/17 from Mr. Daniel Hutson, entitled, Assigning mandatory community service to people claiming job seeker's allowance at minimum wage rate or greater.  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and to close the petition.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p>The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00011/17, from Ms Pauline Bleach, entitled, To re-route the Leinster Orbital north of Navan away from the Tara and Br&uacute; Na B&oacute;inne archaeological landscapes and to create a legally binding mechanism to allow early intervention in the case of large infrastructure affecting areas of national importance.  The committee has considered the response from the Department of Transport, Sport and Tourism in relation to its position and it is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the petitioner and to close the petition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017051700002#E00400"><p>I would like to comment on the Leinster orbital route.  We need early action and to see the route finalised, as urged by the National Transport Authority.  It is regrettable that capital funding has not been provided for the provision of this route, which will be a key piece of infrastructure around many towns and counties.  The fact no funding has been provided in the plan up to 2035 is most regrettable.  I will seek that this key piece of infrastructure is progressed.  The petition mentions the Hill of Tara and Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  One could not build a wendy house in Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, such are the stringent planing guidelines, and I should know, having worked on many Meath county development plans.  The protections that are in place for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne are extensive, and rightly so.</p><p>The protection of lives is equally important.  The Slane bypass is still mired in controversy and there has been lack of funding and of planning decisions.  Many people have been killed on that deadly bridge and yet we are not able to provide that crucial infrastructure.  Infrastructure, such as the Leinster orbital route, is critical.  It is misleading to mention places like Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and the Hill of Tara in this context.  I know the Hill of Tara very well because I live only a few miles away.  I spend most weekends on the Hill of Tara with my children, and spent most weekends there as a child.  It is an intrinsic part of the lives of Meath people and I am privileged to live beside it.  When I stand on the Mound of the Hostages most weekends with my kids and I look across the Tara valley, one can barely see the M3, such was the manner in which it was constructed, and yet that road was mired in planning controversy for over ten years by people who would not know how to find the Hill of Tara.  Pat Kenny broadcast a radio show from the Hill of Tara while the road was being built three and a half miles away, giving people the impression that this infrastructure was going through the hill.  It is wrong to paint a picture that national monuments are somehow in danger, it is misleading and it needs to be tackled.</p><p> This references the fact that, archaeologically, the M3 cost taxpayers &euro;740 million more than the contractors were paid to build it.  This was because of misinformation.  When it comes to the Hill of Tara, more archaeological finds were actually discovered because of the work in the surrounding area.  These are now preserved in our National Museum because of the sensitive manner in which the work was handled.  We need to see action on the Leinster orbital route so that towns such as Drogheda, Navan and Naas can realise their full potential, create the counterbalance that is needed to this congested city and allow our regional towns to grow in a sustainable manner.  I want to see this project happen sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017051700002#A00500"><p>On behalf of HIQA, I thank the committee for the invitation to address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs this morning.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Eva Boyle, who is an inspector manager in HIQA's children's team.</p> <p>  HIQA was established ten years ago today to improve health and social care services for the people of Ireland.  Our role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.  HIQA has a statutory responsibility for monitoring and inspecting children's social services.  These include children's statutory residential centres, special care units, child protection services and Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  We are authorised by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs under section 69 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended by section 26 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011, to inspect foster care services provided by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, and by private providers and to report on our findings to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  We also have statutory responsibility for monitoring foster care services against the national standards for foster care, published by the then Department of Health and Children in 2003. </p> <p>  HIQA began its monitoring programme of statutory foster care services in Ireland in 2007.  By the end of 2016, all of the 17 foster care service areas in the country had been inspected.  In 2014, we commenced a monitoring programme of private foster care providers in Ireland and had inspected all of these services by the end of 2016.  The majority of children in the care of the State live with foster carers.  At the end of 2016, Tusla reported that there were 6,258 children in the care of the State.  Of those, 5,817 were in foster care and living either with relatives or with general carers.</p> <p>  Fostering services depend on families and individuals in the community who are willing to share their homes and lives with children and young people whose parents are unable to care for them on either a short or long-term basis.  A child comes into the care of the State when it is assessed that he or she is at risk and requires care or protection or both.  Tusla is responsible for the child and the foster parents do not have guardianship.  When a child is placed in foster care, maintaining links with his or her own family is very important.  The child's parents should be involved as much as possible and, as appropriate, should be kept fully informed of how the child is getting on.  The child should see his or her family as much as possible.  Even though he or she may live with another family, the child's identity and name is always his or her own. </p> <p>  Foster care services are provided by Tusla and six private foster care providers.  At the end of 2016, Tusla reported that of the children living in foster homes 5,456 or 94% were in Tusla placements, while 361 or 6% were in private foster care placements.   Children can be placed in foster care either voluntarily, when a parent or family consents to the child being cared for by Tusla or by court order or both, when a judge decides that it is in the best interests of the child to be placed in the care of Tusla.</p> <p>  When a child is placed in foster care, the national standards for foster care set out that the child should be assigned a social worker to monitor his or her growth and development and ensure that his or her best interests are considered at all times.  It is important to note that at the end of the fourth quarter in 2016, Tusla reported that 465 children in foster care had not been allocated a social worker.</p> <p>  Tusla is required by law to make a decision on the type of fostering that is most suitable for the child based on the child's needs and circumstances.  There are two different types of fostering.  Short-term fostering lasts from one week to a couple of months, whereas long-term fostering involves the child being cared for by a foster family for a number of years and sometimes until the child reaches  adulthood. </p> <p>  Foster care in Ireland is governed by the Child Care Act 1991 and two sets of regulations that govern the placement of children in foster care and the placement of children with relatives.  In addition, the national standards for foster care provide a framework to ensure that children in foster care receive the best possible care.</p><p> HIQA inspects the practices and procedures of public and private foster care providers under the two sets of foster care regulations and monitors against the national standards for foster care.  There is, however, no regulation of foster care.  Although HIQA can inspect services and report its findings publicly, it does not have the legal remit to take action when it uncovers examples of poor or unsafe provision.  I repeat that there is no regulation of foster care and that HIQA only fulfils a monitoring role.  Its only recourse when it uncovers risk is to escalate the situation to Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p><p> HIQA carried out a total of 22 inspections of statutory foster care services between January 2012 and December 2016.  A number of key themes emerged from these inspections.  Many foster carers made a concerted effort to provide a child-centred service and to ensure the well-being of the children living with them.  Family contact was supported by foster carers and social workers, in line with the children's care plans.  Some areas for improvement were identified during inspections, including that it was not always possible to match children with suitable foster carers which resulted in some placements subsequently breaking down.  In addition, we found cases where sibling groups were not being placed together and where children were placed with foster carers who lived away from their local community.  Generally, we found that children received good quality care from foster carers and that the majority of children lived in safe, homely environments with caring foster carers.  </p><p> Children were largely positive about their social workers.  However, some children were frequently reassigned new social workers, which had a negative impact as it meant that the children had to build new relationships each time.  As I mentioned, at the end of 2016 some 8% of children in foster care had not been allocated a social worker to support them.  This meant that some children went unsupervised in their placements, with no social worker monitoring their care, progress or safety.  </p><p> Tusla tries to keep children in foster care living within their families - this is known as relative foster care - or at least in their local communities.  However, this is only possible when adequate resources are available.  In the majority of service areas there were insufficient numbers of foster carers which resulted in some children being placed in overcrowded settings with carers who did not have the skills to take care of them.  This contributed to unplanned placement endings and multiple placements, with little stability for the child.  There were delays in the assessment and approval of a number of relative foster carers who had children placed with them.  In 2016 this issue was escalated to Tusla in three of the four statutory inspections completed.  Furthermore, the level of support provided for foster carers across statutory foster care services required improvement. </p><p> Significant safeguarding and child protection risks were identified in two statutory foster care services during 2016, namely, in the midlands and Dublin south central.  These risks related to ineffective safeguarding practices to promote children&rsquo;s safety, including Garda vetting of all staff prior to commencing work for the service; and poor management of allegations made against foster carers.  Where significant risks were identified during inspections, they were escalated by our team to Tusla for immediate action.  Furthermore, there were inadequate systems in place to provide for oversight of allegations made by children in care against foster carers.  Foster care committees were not always informed of child welfare concerns or child protection allegations.  Unfortunately, this has been a recurring finding since 2013. </p><p> All of the foster care services inspected during 2016 needed to improve their governance and management systems, including risk management and oversight of care practices.  The midlands and Dublin south central foster care services were found to be operating with significant risk, including poor accountability arrangements; ineffective management systems for risk management and staff supervision; and inadequate oversight of care practices.  Furthermore, lack of service planning has been an ongoing finding in the majority of inspections. </p><p> Inspections have consistently identified vacant posts, particularly for social workers, and difficulties in the retention of the existing skilled workforce within foster care services.  In addition, a significant number of managerial posts are temporary positions.  All of this has had an impact on Tusla&rsquo;s ability to meet the demands placed on the effective provision of foster care services.  Risk management systems varied and were in the early stages of development in some areas.  Oversight and monitoring systems varied and some service areas had monitoring officers, while others did not.  Inspections identified some oversight mechanisms, for example, file audits and audits of supervision of staff, but they were consistently not completed. </p><p> With the exception of emergency out-of-hours placements, Tusla did not have service level agreements in place with private foster care agencies.  While inspectors found agreements in place which related to the placement of individual children, they were not sufficient to ensure effective oversight of the overall quality, safety or effectiveness of the service being purchased.  This finding underlines the key role played by the funder in ensuring good quality services and, in the opinion of HIQA, lends weight to the argument in favour of a model of commissioning.  The absence of an integrated information system within Tusla impacted on the capacity of managers to collate, manage and share information to support effective decision-making and promote continual improvement within the service.</p><p> As I mentioned, HIQA began its inspections of private foster care services in Ireland in 2014 and had completed all of them by the end of 2016.  The overall findings of these inspections showed that the majority of services were well run and resourced, with good supports in place for children and carers.  Safe care practice was found and children were generally content and settled in their placements.  However, two of the six services were not managed to an adequate standard and this was reflected in the quality of training for staff and foster carers, support and supervision of carers and, ultimately, the stability of placements for children.  As a result, some children experienced multiple placement breakdowns and unplanned placement endings. </p><p> Significant safeguarding and child protection risks were identified in one private foster care service last year.  The risks related to ineffective safeguarding practices to promote children&rsquo;s safety, including Garda vetting of all staff prior to commencing work for the service; and poor management of allegations made against foster carers.  Again, where significant risks were identified during inspections, they were escalated to Tusla for immediate attention.</p><p> In the light of our findings between 2013 and 2016, we decided to focus our monitoring activity on the assessment, approval, review, supervision and support of foster carers in 2017.  This year we have commenced a thematic inspection of Tusla foster care services and completed fieldwork in six inspections to date, in Dublin south east-Wicklow, Cork, Louth-Meath, the mid-west, Sligo-Leitrim-west Cavan and Dublin north.  In all cases escalation procedures were followed and assurances sought from Tusla in respect of all of the inspections.  While the reports on the inspections have yet to be published, it is clear that although there were examples of good and some very good practice, some of the issues identified between 2013 and 2016 remain.  They include insufficient safeguarding measures such as the absence of up-to-date Garda vetting, poor training, significant delays in the assessment and approval of relative carers and the risk of inappropriate placements owing to an insufficient number of foster care families. </p><p> I have provided an overview of HIQA&rsquo;s inspection and monitoring role in the provision of foster care services.  While there are many examples of good and very good practice in both statutory and private foster care services, some significant areas for improvement remain, particularly in the assessment and approval of foster carers, the management of allegations against foster carers and the governance and oversight of care practices.</p><p>That said, our experience over the past ten years in the overall regulation of health and social care services shows that regulation itself is a driver of quality and safety.  Regulation affords protection to both vulnerable adults and children, and contributes to assuring a better quality of life for all using regulated services.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us here this morning.  We would be happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

This, I suppose, came on the back of reading the report on Dublin South Central, which is my home area, and being shocked by it.</p> <p>  I have several points.  Ms Dunnion's report is comprehensive, but there are some aspects of foster care I would not necessarily understand and I ask her to bear with me.  I have been trying to match a grandmother with two young babies via Tusla since last September.  There does not seem to be recognition of an infant's growth each day and an urgency in trying to get the foster placement with the family so that these infants have a family nurturing environment to go to.  That is not within Ms Dunnion's remit, but that is one case.  Babies can be six months old or eight months old in foster care when there is a willing grandmother sitting back waiting to embrace them, bring them up and rear them while her daughter gets her life on track.  It is important that they maintain links.  Sometimes it seems to the detriment of the child but in most cases, it is not.  It is for the betterment of the growth of the child.  Some 94% of the placements are with Tusla and 6% are in private placements.  Ms Dunnion might explain the private placements and explain the resources that are put into private versus Tusla placements and if the private placements are causing more concern than the Tusla placements, albeit they account for only 6%.</p> <p>  On regulation, would HIQA be able for and welcome regulation to strengthen HIQA's remit and provide more safeguards for children?  What resources would go into that and what would HIQA need to expand to ensure that?</p> <p>  The report, in any case the Dublin South Central one that I read comprehensively, is not explained away by understaffing.  I understand understaffing causes burnout and chaos in the services throughout health, and obviously, social care as well, but there seems to be some lack of leadership, whatever way one wants to put it.</p> <p>  What happens when HIQA escalates those significant risks to Tusla?  Do they get immediate attention, and if so, what immediate attention do they get?  As a member of the committee attending meetings for the past year, I note these issues have come up and they seem to get it so wrong repeatedly.  We need to protect the children who we are meant to be caring for.</p></speech>

She informed me of matters I did not know about.  I am so grateful for HIQA and for the role that it plays in society.</p> <p>  First, the fundamental piece that struck me is how serious this is.  Ms Dunnion highlighted that the areas that need to be looked at are the assessment of foster carers and management of allegations - those were two issues.  I am finding that difficult to accept because I am thinking that the most fundamental issue is that HIQA must see if this foster care is suitable.  That is the number one priority because if it is not, there should be no child going to them.  The second issue of the management of potential allegations smacks of the concern as to whether this child could be suffering for a long time before anything is done.  That terrifies me.</p> <p>  Third, HIQA's lack of autonomy as an organisation frightens me also.  Ms Dunnion states that HIQA has no legal remit, that all it can do is escalate issues or speed them along.  That makes me very frightened of the future for our children.  If that is all HIQA can do, if it has no autonomy and it puts that request or problem in the hands of Tusla, what in God's name will happen then?  I am sorry about my roundabout way of putting all this but I would like Ms Dunnion's comments about what I have said.</p> <p>  What is the timeframe here?  What is the timeframe for a child who is in trouble at the hands of a foster carer or whoever before that child is seen to and sorted?</p></speech>

It is, as Senator Freeman stated, scary, but it also would make one very angry.  HIQA has a reputation that it can go in and potentially close down organisations that are not operating to standard, and yet we have a situation where 465 children have no assigned social worker and nothing can be done about it.  I wonder where HIQA sees the accountability.  Has HIQA advocated for a legal remit in that regard?  Is that something it would welcome?  Is it something we as a committee can try and look at?</p> <p>  In regard to the number of complaints, Ms Dunnion stated all HIQA can do is escalate them to Tusla.  How many serious situations have been escalated to it?  Of those, how many have been addressed or what happens once it is escalated?</p> <p>  Ms Dunnion stated that from 2014 HIQA was assessing private care.  I wonder why it was only from 2014 and what was happening prior to that.</p></speech>

Reading the reports yesterday in advance of the meeting, I found the different ones alarming, the worst being, I suppose, that with regard to the midlands with 20 of the 26 needing improvement and six with significant risk, but also the area of concern to Senator Devine, with five with significant risk and 20 out of the 26 requiring improvement.  I note the others as well, for example, Donegal with 16 out of 26 requiring improvement and Cavan-Monaghan with 18 out of 26 requiring improvement.  All of them are alarming and it is not only in one part of the country that is affected.  There is also what Ms Dunnion told us today, for example, that there are 465 children with no social worker allocated at the end of 2016.  We want to see what can be done about it.  Clearly, it is a situation that cannot be tolerated.  These are some of the most vulnerable children.</p> <p>  The other aspect, that would worry me and probably worries the Chairman, is that we need more foster parents and they need to be assured that they will be adequately supported when they are doing this important work.</p> <p>  What Ms Dunnion is asking us, first, is that there needs to be regulation.  She referred to the fact that there is no regulation.  The other questions that others have asked are around what happens when HIQA alerts Tusla to risk to children.  The lack of vetting is a big part of that.  Does HIQA monitor what happens after that?  Can it monitor and ensure that something happens to ensure that children are protected?</p> <p>  The other issue concerns the question of staffing.  Ms Dunnion stated that there is an issue around temporary management posts and risk management being underdeveloped.</p><p>Perhaps the witnesses will tell the committee what we should be recommending in terms of what needs to be done because it is absolutely clear that the current situation is putting children significantly at risk and especially the most vulnerable children. </p></speech>

I ask Mary Dunnion in her response to elaborate a little on the regulation by giving members an example of a comparative area that already has that regulation, so we could be more definitive in our pursuit of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017051700002#D00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I will share them with my colleague, Ms Eva Boyle, who will deal with the questions specific to the reports as she was one of the leaders in the inspection teams in that regard.</p> <p>  I will go back to the question in the context of regulation.  HIQA has a legal remit and the only services we formally regulate are older persons and disability services.  We regulate those services through a statutory instrument with the regulations determined by the Government.  The standards against which we monitor are mandated by the Minister for Health or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, depending on which area is being referred to.</p> <p>  HIQA has been regulating for ten years and I genuinely believe - we have the evidence to support this - that regulation is a significant contributor to improving quality of care and safety for vulnerable people.  The difference between where we are with children's services and with regulated services is that within a regulated service, one has powers.  The powers allow us to ensure that an action happens because the regulated entity is licensed and registered to deliver that service, which is dependent upon them being compliant with the regulations.  It also gives us instant powers when we come across significant risk.  These powers are such that we can go as far as prosecution, we can close the service if we feel it is so unsafe or we can impose conditions that the service must put in place.  These fundamentally are the differences.</p> <p>  The best example is probably the most recent one of disability, which actually concerns disability for both adults and children.  Because that is covered, there is regulation in respect of the disability service for children and we can see evidence of an improvement in the lives of very vulnerable people in institutions.  The Act refers to the institutions where these people have been for long periods of time.  During our inspections we have spoken with approximately 10,000 vulnerable people and they have begun to articulate how things have started to improve.  Regulation is a significant contributor to that.</p> <p>  There is, however, a limitation in that it is not and should not be the regulator's job to deliver the service.  The responsibility of delivery rests with the provider of the service and this must always be the case.  This is why we forever talk of the importance of governance and management.  Where one has good services, there is good leadership and a good framework that is always watching to make sure it is safe.  This is a really critical piece and this is why we emphasise it.</p> <p>  We believe such regulation should be in place in children's services.  Children's residential services are due to come under the remit of regulation in a legal framework in January 2018.  We are working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and have a workforce plan with the Department of Health in that regard.  That will, hopefully, happen in this timeframe.  We feel this is a really good step.  We also feel that foster care services should be regulated.  The safety net of regulation does not mean that one can walk away and say the service is 100% safe; terrible things will always happen.  It is worrying to see the same themes reoccurring between 2013 and 2016 and this is why, right through our health and social care services, we see it as a challenge to learn from our mistakes, to investigate them in a timely manner, to learn from them and to make sure the learning is spread right across the service.  This remains a challenge.</p> <p>  HIQA is very much in favour of the regulation of foster care services and would certainly present to the committee our desire for this.  I shall put it into context.  Children's services have 14 inspectors.  The Deputy asked why HIQA was not in private care services.  We have 14 inspectors and a total staff of 16 in children's services for all the areas we referred to.  We did 48 inspections in 2016, we met more than 600 children, their families and people who work in the services.  That is the reality of the resources in HIQA around which we must plan our services and inspections.</p> <p>  In foster care, however, what we have learned is why we are taking a new approach this year.  This may answer some of the questions asked by the Deputy.  If we can make sure that foster carers are assessed, trained and supported and that nobody works on the assumption that because they were good at the start they are still good three or four years later - then we would see this as a very fruitful approach to take now.  This is why we have changed to the thematic we mentioned our review.  </p> <p>  With regard to understaffing, there is a resource issue.  There is no point in us saying that there is not a resource issue.  The resource issue is in respect of both social workers and the numbers of foster carers.  There are not enough foster carers and this is imperative.   Fostering is such a marvellous thing to do as a service to provide for children.  There is an imperative that Tusla and other agencies make sure that foster care is an attractive option and that if a person is going to become a foster carer, he or she is assured that he or she will be supported, will have the proper training and will know there is a monitoring of the service he or she is providing.  We see gaps in that provision currently.  It would be foolish and wrong of us to say there is no resource issue.  There are not enough social workers within the service currently and that is definite.</p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about Tusla.  There is a huge concern about the information systems, or the lack of them, within Tusla.  If we go, for example, into a regional area for foster care services, one office will have an IT system and another will have a paper-based system.  The actual transfer of information is stymied before it begins.  It is very difficult to deliver an effective service with that kind of system in place.</p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleague, I will refer to the issue of escalating risk about which everybody, quite rightly, is hugely concerned.  As an assurance to the committee, when our teams go into any area where there is an immediate risk, we do not leave unless that immediate risk is addressed.  That is the key principle from where we are coming.  Thereafter, we go into a formal escalation process where we put our concerns in writing, along with a timeframe of when Tusla must reply to us and with the timeframe we set out who is the accountable person for the action.  We, of course, inspect.  Where we see a risk we will always go back to make sure it has been mitigated.</p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Eva Boyle, will now cover some of the specific areas of the two sets of questions and the most recent foster care reports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eva Boyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017051700002#D00400"><p>I thank Ms Dunnion.  I will start with Senator Devine's queries.  On family placements, our finding over the years is that Tusla does endeavour to go to the child's family as the first port of call to explore placement options for children in foster care.  We have found, however, that there is often a delay post finding somebody.  There is a preliminary process that takes place first to establish whether, on an emergency basis, a child can be placed with a relative.  There is a delay, however, between that process being finalised and the relative foster carer getting final approval from the area placement committee so they are fully approved as a relative foster placement.  This is an issue we have escalated throughout 2016 in Dublin south central and the midlands.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the difference between statutory and private foster care organisations.  Every child who comes in to the care of the State is the responsibility of Tusla.</p><p>Tusla has its own fostering service in all its 17 service areas.  In addition, there are six private companies which recruit foster carers and assess them.  In order for the foster carers to be approved, their assessment report goes in front of a Tusla foster care committee for approval.  The children who are placed in the private organisations remain the responsibility of Tusla and, according to our standards, should have a Tusla social worker to look after the child's interests, but the foster carer in the private company will have a social worker, a link worker, from the private company to look after their interests.  The issue we have raised time and again in our reports is that there are agreements relating to individual children and their care but there is no overall service level agreement between Tusla and those organisations to have an ongoing formal monitoring process.</p><p> Senator Freeman raised the issue of allegations and the safety of children.  That has been a significant risk we have escalated to Tusla for three of the statutory inspections.  One of the issues we have identified in two of the areas has been a confused approach in that there has not been one common policy document in place for staff to use, so that the staff are very clear in terms of the process they follow.  Tusla has managed that and has recently formulated an interim protocol relating to the management of allegations against foster carers, so that is progress.</p><p> We have found there have been some delays in respect of allegations by children against foster carers being investigated.  There are numerous reasons for this.  Some of these are the structures that are in place in individual areas relating to investigation.  When we have found risk, however, we have always looked for a safety plan to ensure children are safe prior to us leaving, and post inspection we follow that up in writing to make sure allegations have been assessed and followed through on, but it is certainly an area of concern.</p><p> Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about more foster carers being required.  It is certainly our view that foster carers need to be encouraged and feel that it is a safe place, that they will be well supported but also supervised, because that is important in terms of the child's safety but also for the foster carers.</p><p> In terms of our inspection activity for 2017, we recognise the importance of the assessment process being key to ensure the right people are coming into fostering and also that they will go through a process where they fully understand the responsibilities that are in place.  If people are thoroughly assessed, the likelihood is that there will be less breakdown.  We need more foster carers to be attracted into fostering because we need a pool of foster carers in order that when a child comes into the system, we know that if he or she has a disability, for example, we have a foster carer or a pool of foster carers who have the skills, experience and training to be able to meet the needs of the child.  Certainly, it is an area that needs further development in terms of bringing more foster carers into the system.</p></speech>

In the first instance, it should be recognised that the role of foster carers is vital.  Generally, foster carers are motivated by very noble and selfless reasons.  The system would collapse without foster carers, but nonetheless the report is quite frightening and worrying in many respects, in particular the fact there is no official regulation of foster care and that complaints or child protection concerns were not always passed on to the foster care committees.  That is of particular concern.  Much of the problem seems to come back to staffing, in particular in terms of Tusla.  I refer to the support service annual review we received from the Irish Foster Care Association.  One of the primary concerns foster carers flagged to the association is the lack of correspondence from social workers.  It was said that many carers detailed ongoing difficulties relating to the inconsistency and unreliability of communication routes.  For example, many stated that they need to phone or email several times to get a response.  In some instances, individuals have reported that despite regular ongoing attempts to contact the relevant professional, some have been left without a response for many months.  That is a very significant weakness in the entire system.  My question is to what extent the very obvious weaknesses, gaps and challenges that exist in ensuring the quality of foster care is at the highest level, and whether we can be confident it is at the highest level, are driven by the lack of regulation and the lack of staff and resources.  Which is the more significant weakness or difficulty with the system?</p></speech>

Many of the questions have been answered.  Reference was made to the formalisation of overall regulation as opposed to regulation per child.  Do the witnesses believe that regulation is required per child and overall, or would overall be sufficient?  We want regulation and to protect children as best we can, but we do not want to overburden the system with bureaucracy which we see right across the public service, because that stifles service delivery.</p> <p>  It was said that some foster carers were frequently assigned social workers.  Why was that the case?  It was also mentioned that there was distance between siblings.  What was the longest distance?  Were they in the next parish?  I come from a rural area.  One case related to the midlands.  Were the siblings miles apart?  I would welcome some statistics in this regard.  Also, what distance were the children from their original locality?</p> <p>  It was stated that efforts are being made to attract more foster carers into the system.  From the analysis that has been done, what can we do to get more foster carers to sign up?</p></speech>

It was a very open and frank discussion.  It is probably one of the most sobering presentations we have had.  I have been observing progress accordingly as the reports have been produced and since I became spokesperson on children.  The first report of which I became aware was the annual report from June 2016 and that is where I will start.  It stated that in the course of 2015 the children's team received 175 notifications that alerted the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to potential risks to the health, safety and well-being of the residents.  Of a total of 72 notifications related to allegations of abuse, 29 of those allegations related to abuse by relatives, 19 related to allegations of abuse by care staff or professionals, and 17 related to allegations of peer to peer abuse.  The document is very well put together.  If I have learnt anything this morning it is that, first, Garda vetting is not working; second, there are not enough social care workers, which we have known for some time; and three, there are not enough HIQA staff members either.  Will Ms Dunnion elaborate on what happens when an item is presented to her at an inspection concerning a significant risk?  An unannounced visit was carried out on a special care unit last year where a child was missing.  What happens in such a case?  What happens in cases where significant risk is identified, as that is of the most serious concern?</p><p>HIQA was visiting the foster care services in November, including Care Visions.  I refer to a significant risk regarding the safety and protection of children.  We have another one as well.  There were two of them, actually, regarding significant risk to service delivery and child protection.  That was down in the midlands.  HIQA was in the midlands, which is why we are here.  There is the significant risk and the safeguarding.  That was huge because there were at least four to five significant risks in that report.  Where significant risks are identified, where is the communication?  Where is the repeat investigation?  What is the timeline for that?  It is the most crucial thing.  I look at 2015 and those 72 allegations.  Where are we with them at this moment in time?</p></speech>

The witnesses said HIQA had a monitoring role rather than an enforcement role.  HIQA referred to potential enforcement powers such as closing a service or taking legal action.  What enforcement powers would HIQA like to have?  What would assist it in its role and move it from the monitoring status it has?</p> <p>  I am also interested in what Tusla is saying to HIQA when HIQA inspects a service and finds problems.  When HIQA investigates a hospital, the management might say there are difficulties because of X, Y, or Z.  What is Tusla saying when HIQA finds problems with its service, besides referring to the lack of social workers, which is fairly well publicised?  One of the issues there is that we do not have enough college places and cannot churn them out fast enough.  There is definitely demand from students who want to do those courses, but that is a different issue.  What does Tusla say it needs?</p> <p>  Ms Dunnion touched on the cumbersome process to become a foster carer.  What are the barriers?  What puts people off?  What do we need to do to encourage more people to take on the role?</p> <p>  Ms Dunnion said that where HIQA finds a significant risk, it ensures a safety plan is put in place.  What is a safety plan?  What does it look like?  Is there a timeframe and are there certain things that need to be completed in that plan?  Does HIQA reinspect to see if the plan has been completed?</p> <p>  How does HIQA find out about problems?  Do people report them or is it through random inspections?  Is it possible that HIQA is only seeing part of the picture and that the figures and statistics we have are only those things HIQA has found?  Could there be a wider issue?</p> <p>  Is there or should there be ongoing training and updating of skills and knowledge for foster carers?  Would it be appropriate to have an annual conference or an update every three or four years for carers on the latest standards?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017051700002#F00300"><p>I ask the witnesses to clarify what is meant by a model of commissioning as recommended in the opening statement.  It is a pleasure to have a meeting like this where the witnesses come in with solutions.  It is very easy to identify problems, but HIQA is recommending solutions, which is very heartening for us as a committee.  It means we can see a step we can take forward.  I ask if there is anything we can do as a committee to provide justice in respect of the appalling litany of tragedy in this area by shining a light on it.  I thank Senator Devine in that regard and the witnesses for attending.  If we can push for regulation in this area and demand it happens today before tomorrow, it is to do the very least we owe to those who are in the system today and who were let down by it so appallingly in the past.</p> <p>  HIQA has really identified the gaping hole in the foster care system.  The fact that service level agreements are not in place is beyond belief.  Foster carers in Cork deal with south Lee and north Lee and there are major differences.  Within one county there are major differences between two sectors.  Very different dynamics are at play in how they are managed and organised.  We have a big issue from a management point of view for Tusla.  HIQA has pointed to that clearly here.</p> <p>  Something I am particularly interested in is the private service.  Have the witnesses noticed any difference in standards in private services versus those provided by Tusla?  I understand that Tusla has a role in private services and I understand the differences.  I refer to the 6% of private providers.  Is there a difference in the allocation of social workers?  There are over 500 children without social workers.  Is there a larger number of such children in private care versus public care?  Are the standards different?  Anecdotally, foster parents I have spoken to say the range of services is better with private providers.  It is claimed but I cannot say it authoritatively.  Has HIQA seen more proactive training for foster carers on the private side?</p> <p>  I saw a briefing document from the Minister during the week referring to me as having something of an obsession with value for money.  My issue in talking about that is on how we are spending the money we spend.  I want to see a child-centred value for money.  As a committee, we must remember that we spend some &euro;660 million on these services annually for the care of 6,000 children.  It is valid to ask if we are getting child-centred value for money as such.  From looking at the private operators, what are HIQA's views on child-centred value for money?  We are spending a great deal of money through these providers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017051700002#F00400"><p>It is fair to say there is a resource issue.  However, a lack of resources is not a total determinant of a poor service.  As we find in all our reports and inspections, what is important is what a child experiences and receives from the person looking after him or her.  The people in charge must ensure and have controls in place to see that this happens.  It is that circle which makes it work.  While there may sometimes be a lack of resources, the importance of which I would not underestimate, I re-emphasise the importance of ensuring that the experience of a child as determined by those who deliver the service is monitored by those who have the responsibility of oversight.  That is where we see significant gaps and where we talk about leadership management and governance as a particular requirement and focus.</p> <p>  When we talk about formal regulation, which Deputy Neville asked about, we would never be regulating the individual child.  Regulation of foster care services, which we hope happens, means looking at the system in place to ensure that the child is being placed in a timely manner, that foster carers have been assessed as to their competence and confidence to be a foster carer and that controls are in place so the carer receives adequate training and obtains information in a timely manner.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, there should be a proper communication system.  There should be proper recruitment processes and if someone leaves the foster care service, there should be a capacity to analyse why and what we can learn from it.  It is about looking at the totality of arrangements in place to ensure there is a safe service.  As such, one is never going down to the individual child, albeit one will engage with the individual child because that is who will tell one the story.  What one is looking at in regulation is what system is in place to ensure this happens.</p> <p>  That brings us on to the point that the risk with regulation is that it can stop being dynamic.  The model of regulation is determined by the legislators.  Good evidence of this is in disability and older person services where there is a regulatory model determined by a building and the care.  As such, it is the designated centre and the care.  However, we advocate that the regulatory model should be about the service.  That would allow a different approach to be taken to regulation which is based more on cost-benefit.  It would allow providers to be more dynamic in the services they provide.</p><p>We welcome regulation but we see that it must be dynamic and changing and we ask that legislators take account of this in their thinking about regulation.</p><p> Garda vetting should not be a problem.  The system has been streamlined.  Several years ago, it was difficult for any employer to get timely Garda vetting in respect of a prospective employee.  It now takes, in essence, two weeks, so there is no issue with people being Garda vetted.  What really concerns me is the thought process to the effect that it is not seen as one of the single easiest pieces to ensure safeguarding for vulnerable people.  The safeguarding is the process but it is not high on the agenda of a manager or employer to ensure that employees have Garda vetting.  We have seen this right across social services, not only in children's services.  I can happily report that there has been a sea change, to which, I believe, regulation has contributed.  When we carry out an inspection and discover people without Garda vetting, the employer must take them off the roster.  If they are caring for the most vulnerable of people, they must have Garda vetting.  Faced with such a risk, requiring the employer to take the relevant employees off a roster is one of the actions we might take.</p></speech>

The legislative framework has been there for new employees since the start of the year.  It has been very worrying to find action has not been taken on it, especially when the process has been so streamlined for it to happen.</p> <p>  Before I hand over to Ms Boyle to discuss some specifics, I will deal with the Chairman's comments on commissioning.  We see commissioning as an area of exploration, and the Chairman alluded to it in a service level agreement.  That is part of commissioning.  The term "commissioning" is sometimes regarded unfavourably because of its record in other jurisdictions and because it has been associated with high costs.  However, what we are talking about is an accountability framework.  If the State purchases a service - it does not matter whether it purchases child protection services, services for older people or health care services - that service is purchased from the public purse.  What we have not seen is the responsibility both for the purchaser and the provider, and we see that as a dual responsibility.  If one is handing over millions from the public purse to a body to provide a service, one should check that the service is being provided at a level commensurate with the cost of the purchase.  Those controls need to be in place, and that is what we talk about in the context of an accountability framework.  It can stretch out much further in the sense that there are cases, which we have identified in our presentation, where there has not been good service planning.  That is part of an accountability framework.  One begins to question what the needs of foster carers are, how many we anticipate that we will need over the next number of years, how many children we anticipate will require foster care and what our planning is, not only for now, but also for the next number of years.  This is all encompassed in an accountability framework, or a commissioning model.  Work has been done on this, and we can send papers on commissioning to the committee, although they were not done by HIQA.  This is where the service level agreement comes into play because that would become a component of it.  For the information of the committee, the HSE has done quite a good piece of work on commissioning.  We will do some work with the HSE in that context, particularly on disability and health care.  Perhaps Tusla will move in that direction as well - we do not know - but that is what we are talking about.</p> <p>  I now hand over to Ms Boyle to discuss some of the specific questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.467" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eva Boyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017051700002#G01400"><p>I thank Deputy Neville for his question.  He queried the distances children are placed away from their local communities.  It very much varies.  There are scenarios in which children are in the nearest town or village but others in which they are perhaps a few hundred miles away from their families of origin.  We find that Tusla staff endeavour to make sure the child has regular contact, where appropriate, with his or her family, and a lot of time and resources have gone into those arrangements to ensure that happens.</p> <p>  I will come back to the issue of the notifications that Deputy Rabbitte raised.</p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers queried what Tusla says when HIQA finds problems with a service, other than raising resource issues with us.  Tusla is very clear that it is starting a number of new processes regarding monitoring and quality assurance.  We have seen the start of some of those processes in individual areas and would reference some of those new management systems being in place but they are at a very early stage of implementation throughout the country.</p> <p>  The barriers to becoming a foster carer are varied.  They can be societal.  A greater number of women and men are working full-time outside the family home, and there are challenges there in terms of arrangements for individuals.  That is just a personal observation rather than something that has come up through the course of inspection.  However, the majority of foster carers tell us that they are well supported.  When they do not have link workers, they find that difficult.  They occasionally experience delays in staff getting back to them and they find that frustrating.  Due to the fact that they care for children, they need someone at the end of the phone to be able to answer to their questions.  Service consistency is something foster carers highlight as important to them.  They wish to be well supported and to be supervised so that they can run matters by their link workers.  They might ask whether they are doing something right or ask for a little help with something.  These are things they identify and, in turn, they are essential elements in attracting more people into fostering.</p> <p>  A safety plan is a basic plan whereby measures to keep a child safe are laid down.  A practical example would be a child not having contact with a person against whom an allegation of abuse has been made.  That would be at a very basic level.  It may be that they have supervised contact, but it is a written plan that is laid down so that everyone caring for this child knows how to keep him or her safe.  The plan should also be reviewed so that it does not stay the same.  If there has been an investigation and no risk is found, the plan should be amended to reflect that it is now safe for the child in a certain situation or with a certain individual.  We have mixed experiences of finding these.  There is often a plan in place but it is not always written down.  On occasions when we find that there is no safety plan, we would go to a manager while we are on site and ask what the plan is to keep the child safe.  We make sure that there is a definite plan before we leave.</p> <p>  Regarding how HIQA knows about problems, information comes to us in a number of ways.  We receive unsolicited information from members of the public who telephone us.  This could consist of concerns; sometimes we receive compliments about a service.  We also get some information from Tusla in the form of published statistics and we examine those figures regularly.  We risk-rate that information and make decisions about our monitoring and what follow-up we need to carry out as a result of the information.</p> <p>  The area of foster care training requires ongoing development.  Most foster carers are given a range of training options but those options are dependent on the areas in which they are based.</p><p>That has improved in recent years.  Foster carers who commence training generally receive a comprehensive foundation training package outlining expectations in terms of children meeting with their birth families, expectations in terms of foster carers' own families, safeguarding and so on.  Children often have emotional needs and they may have a disability or educational needs and foster carers may therefore have additional training needs.  At times, there are shortcomings in regard to those specific needs being met.  There are training plans for foster carers in all areas.  The training plans vary in terms of quality of content and what they offer for foster carers.</p><p> In regard to Deputy Jim Daly's queries on the 6% of placements that are in the private sector, the standard of service provision in the private sector varies.  It is similar to the fact that children in some areas of the country have access to a range of services through the HSE and have no problem accessing those services.  Some private organisations have professionals such as psychologists employed on a sessional or full-time basis which gives ease of access to children under their care.  Foster carers in private agencies often tell us that a link person from the agency is available to them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that that is a motivating factor for the carers deciding to go with that particular agency.</p><p> I have not done an analysis in respect of value for money and therefore cannot comment on it.</p></speech>

We ensure that protocol has been followed so that everything within that process has been followed up in terms of looking for the child and that meetings are happening at the appropriate level.  Depending on how long a child is missing, the case escalates within both Tusla and the Garda.  That is our routine when a child is missing from the service.</p></speech>

What I have heard could be summed up as "dysfunctional".  The current situation is absolutely unacceptable in the context of the protection of our vulnerable children.  There is something rotten in it and there is something that vulnerable children we are meant to protect have to revisit again and again and again.  The term "care erosion" comes to mind.  I am interested in the relationship between HIQA and Tusla.  I encountered a defensive attitude when I recently asked Tusla to take a clinical view in the assessment of a child, knowing that it involves the whole family or neighbourhood.  There is a problem in terms of resources and culture.  Does the witness believe Tusla is so dogged, weary of fire-fighting and under-resourced that it has developed a defensive culture that does not allow emotional care and attachment to its job of getting in, signing, sealing and delivering?  Does the witness find there is a barrier to her being there when she meets with Tusla?</p></speech>

That would be a type of licensing of foster care services.  It would look at the fundamental structures that the service has in place to ensure a safe foster care service.  That is the baseline.  In terms of enforcement powers, the least attractive is to close a service.  That is not where one wants to aim.  It is desirable that, where risk is identified, there is an immediate action to respond to it and there is a statutory power to ensure that that happens.  There are different models which can be used.  It can be stipulated that service can only be provided on conditions.  That is the type of area that would be considered in that context.</p><p>It is our experience that many children have fared extremely well in services spanning child protection, foster care, residential care and detention because that is the spectrum of areas that we monitor.  Any dealings we have had with Tusla have been positive.  There is always a healthy tension between a regulator and the people who provide a service.  That is just the nature of regulation.  HIQA has had a healthy engagement with Tusla.  It has responded where we have identified risk.  We recognise that Tusla is on a journey, that it has not existed long and it has a number of processes in place, and Ms Boyle alluded to some of them.  We identify risk and escalate it, accordingly.  We have a positive working relationship with Tusla.</p><p> In the context of Garda vetting, we are talking about where employees or the first group have not been Garda vetted.  We have insisted that Garda vetting is secured before people can continue.  In cases of foster care, we ensure that arrangements are in place to ensure that foster carers have completed their Garda vetting.  We have seen an improvement in the situation across our regulatory fields.  It was an area of significant concern to us when it was not evident that it was a process. </p></speech>

HIQA has clearly conveyed those messages and highlighted many other deficiencies here today.  We sincerely thank HIQA for monitoring the services that are provided to the most vulnerable citizens in society.  We look forward to making progress on the area of regulation and engaging with HIQA again.

We will look at some themes and specific areas for consideration, including disability and disabling conditions throughout the life course; response to planned anticipation of full inclusion; creating an enabling community; public services other than those of health - whether they are a hindrance or a help; and whether budget 2018 matters.</p><p>On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Dr. Shari McDaid and Ms Caroline McGuigan, CEO of Suicide or Survive, appearing on behalf of Mental Health Reform; Ms Kathryn O'Shea and Ms Sarah Lennon of Inclusion Ireland; Mr. Brian O'Donnell and Mr. Christy Lynch of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies; and Ms Kathleen O'Meara and Mr, Brendan Lennon of the Not for Profit Business Association. </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement they make to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We have four separate submissions.  There is a long submission from the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies so I ask its representatives to summarise rather than present the full submission.  I now call on Dr. McDaid to make her opening statement on behalf of Mental Health Reform.</p></speech>

I will speak to Mental Health Reform's position and Caroline will speak to the issues from her own personal experience.</p> <p>  Mental health is a huge issue for our country and for our well-being but our response is neither adequate to the need nor proportionate to the scale.  We will speak to just two aspects of this challenge today, namely, civil rights and mental health services.  Mental health difficulties are one third of the disease burden in Europe.  By 2030, mental health difficulties are expected to be the largest contributor.  The cost of poor mental health in Ireland has been estimated at 2% of GNP.  This represents more than twice the cost of being overweight and obesity.  However, these figures are a superficial yardstick.  We are here today to talk about people in crisis, for whom support is inadequate and unacceptably lacking.</p></speech>

I am a trained psychotherapist, a trained advocate and, most important, I am a mother of a 19-year-old boy, Conor, who was born when I was attending psychiatric services.  I am also the mother of a 16-year-old girl, Amy, born years later when I was attending Trinity College.</p> <p>  People can learn to manage their mental health and lead full and meaningful lives.  Every single one of us has mental health and we will have dips in our mental health because we are human beings, but how we treat people in the different stages of their mental dip has a massive impact on their distress, their experience and their recovery.</p> <p>  I once read a heartbreaking Irish survey in which 40% of people said someone like me should not have children, and we need to turn that around.  At a time in my life when I lay in a bed having attempted suicide, when I died and was brought back to life, my husband was encouraged to sign me in.</p><p>I am grateful he had enough love and understanding to know that to sign me in involuntarily would have had a massive negative impact on my recovery.</p><p> Mental health can be and is messy, but by being educated and informed I can, like everybody else present, manage life and crisis, but it requires all of us to work together.</p></speech>

It is clearly contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Mental Health Act 2001 is simply out of line with the UNCRPD.  In March 2015, a Government-appointed expert group made 165 recommendations for reform.  Only one recommendation has been enacted.</p> <p>  The Mental Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill passed Second Stage on 2 May and is now before the committee.  It strengthens the rights of people when in hospital for mental health treatment.  We advocate that the committee prioritise this Bill in this session.  We ask members to ensure that the Government delivers the comprehensive legislation required to reform the mental health civil law by the end of this year and to verify the promised timeline.</p> <p>  People in emotional distress face unacceptable gaps in services.  Out-of-hours support from the HSE's mental health services is uneven and inadequate.  This year again we have closure of some child and adolescent mental health services to new referrals due to lack of staff.  There is undercapacity in primary care mental health supports and there are waiting lists for counselling services in third level education.</p> <p>  The Government's meagre allocation of just &euro;15 million towards implementing A Vision for Change in 2017 fails to meet the clear commitment in the confidence and supply arrangement to fully implement the policy.  It is time the Government was held to account for this commitment.  Today we ask the committee to urgently prioritise consideration of the Mental Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2017 and ensure it returns to the D&aacute;il for Report and Final Stages before the summer recess; to seek real clarity from the HSE on expenditure to date of the 2017 allocation of &euro;15 million in development funding and on any unspent funding from previous years; to call the Department of Health and the HSE together, before the summer recess, to account together on the funding required in 2018 to deliver on the confidence and supply arrangement commitment to full implementation of A Vision for Change, including the deficit accrued from this year's shortfall in allocation; and to establish with the Department of Health the timeframe and the process for the review of A Vision for Change</p> <p>  People with mental health difficulties depend on the committee's actions and on its advocacy.  I thank the committee for its consideration.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the committee.  Inclusion Ireland is a national, rights-based advocacy organisation that works to promote the rights of people with an intellectual disability.  Our work is underpinned by the values of dignity, inclusion, social justice, democracy and autonomy.</p> <p>  Health and well-being matter.  The United Nations recognises the relevance of happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world, and the importance of their recognition in public policy objectives.   Research shows that adults with a disability experience multiple quality-of-life challenges, including poor health, mental distress and housing problems and it is clear that Ireland must improve.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities offers us a way to address the challenges and our presentation today focuses on three of the UNCRPD articles, all of which are relevant to this particular committee, namely, Article 25 on health, Article 12 on equal recognition before the law and Article 19 on living independently and community inclusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Lennon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#D00500"><p>I echo the thanks from Inclusion Ireland for the invitation to speak here today.  As Ms O'Shea has already said, it is really important that the committee is addressing not only of the issue health, but also the issue of well-being.  If we take well-being as a byword for happiness, we can understand why people with disabilities wish to move away from the idea of a medical or charitable model to a model that is embedded in human rights and equality.  The convention offers us an opportunity to do that in Ireland.  While it does not create any new rights, as is routinely said, it was designed as a response to the unique barriers that our society throws up for persons with disabilities in accessing their rights.  We will look at only three of its 50 articles today.  Any one of them might have been relevant, but we will keep it to three in the interests of brevity.</p> <p>  Article 25 relating to health requires that state parties provide persons with disabilities the same range, quality and standard of free or affordable health care and programmes as other persons.  Through research we know that people with disabilities have a lower uptake of health promotion and screening services such as cervical and breast cancer screening.  Disabled women may find health screening information inaccessible or may not have the support they need to make appointments.  Information on these services should be provided in a range of accessible formats for all persons with disabilities.  Issues relating to health inequality become even more important as people get older.  The Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, reported that people with disabilities were much more likely to experience social exclusion and loneliness and three times more likely than the general population to experience depression as they age.  Additionally, older adults with disabilities were more likely to experience vision and mobility challenges, chronic constipation, higher prevalence rate for falls, higher incidence of mental health and emotional health issues and a much higher incidence of poly-pharmacy, that is, using five or more medications.  People living in congregational settings, institutions and community group homes were more likely to feel socially excluded.  Inclusion Ireland believes that health and social care services should plan for the appropriate supports needed in the future.  They should use the data available to put those plans in place for people as they age.  These supports should be person-centred to protect against social exclusion and loneliness particularly for those in or leaving institutional settings </p> <p>  Article 12, which is focused on equal status, is often described as the beating heart of the convention.  It is concerned with equal recognition before the law, which is central to accessing all sorts of services, including health services and is critical for well-being.  Equal status in Ireland has been taken to mean supported decision making and having a choice on how to spend money, where to live and living in the community.  Instead, in Ireland we retain the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 on our Statute Book.  Under that Act, people can be made lunatics and idiots by law.  Until the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 in full and with it a supported approach to decision making, we retain that status-based approach.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act introduces modern infrastructure for supporting people to make decisions or in some limited circumstances to have decisions made for them but in accordance with their will and preference.  Budget 2018 must include appropriate resources for the decision support service, DSS, within the Mental Health Commission.  It has taken almost two years since the enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act for the recruitment of a director of the DSS to begin.  Once appointed he or she must be given the resources to carry out his or her important functions, including developing codes of practice.  Self-advocates and experts through experience must be consulted in developing those codes of practice.  Budget 2018 must also provide funding for the education of individuals, their families and members of the public.</p> <p>  Article 19 on community living requires state parties to recognise the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community.  A recent comment by the CRPD committee said institutions create isolation, lack of control, lack of choice, rigidity and a paternalistic approach.  As we sit here today, 2,580 persons remain in residential institutions in Ireland in spite of their planned closure by 2018, as set out in the report, Time to Move On from Congregated Settings.  The programme for Government targets a move of one third of residents by 2021, a figure most likely to be reached by the deaths of residents.  Ireland must accelerate the process of de-congregation and de-institutionalisation while ensuring that persons with disabilities receive individualised supports in the community.</p> <p>  The UN convention reaffirms the right of people with disabilities to health and social supports in the community, rather than segregation.  Ireland must commit to and resource a personalised budget system.  We are currently undergoing a task force process.  It is essential that we come out of that with a tangible system for people to have personalised services.  In the United Kingdom direct payments have improved independence, well-being and quality of life.</p><p>The CRPD committee has said that state parties should ensure the personalisation of support, including personal budgets.</p><p> I thank the committee again for the opportunity to raise these issues relating to both health and well-being.  They are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and its potential impact.  The convention has the potential to change radically how we think about the rights of persons with disabilities and how, as a society, we interact with each other.  It is to our shame that Ireland is the last EU country to ratify.  We are among the last 15 in the world to do so.  We know from the experience in other countries that ratification has accelerated reforms.  The progress has been slow in Ireland.  We urge the State to ratify as soon as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.525" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and fellow members of the committee.  I am very happy to accept the invitation of the committee.  I will be brief.<br/><br/>The National Federation of Voluntary Bodies is the national umbrella organisation of non-governmental service providers who provide services to people with intellectual disability and autism.  In all, we have 60 member organisations which between them account for 85% of direct service provision to people with intellectual disability and autism in the State.<br/><br/>Statutory responsibility for the provision of services rests with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It discharges that responsibility by engaging with voluntary organisations on a service arrangement basis.<br/><br/>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides us with a clear framework to focus on the ways in which Government and society must ensure participation restrictions are identified, addressed and removed, and thereby people with disabilities can be afforded their human right to live inclusive lives in the community as fully active and participating citizens.  The convention enshrines the principles of respect for the inherent dignity and individual autonomy of persons with disabilities, respect for difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of human diversity in humanity.  The convention recognises the value of existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities.<br/><br/>I will touch briefly on ways in which the principles of the convention are relevant at all stages of the life course of an individual with a disability, but first I want to share with the members a very brief outline of the life story of one person as an embodiment of the potential that the full ratification and implementation of the convention would bring.  At the national federation, we work closely with a self-advocate, Martin Dooher.  Martin has an intellectual disability, health difficulties and uses a wheelchair.  He has given his permission for us to share his story with the members today.  When Martin was a child, his parents were told, as was the practice of the day, that the best option for his life and that of his family was for him to live in an institution, and so he was moved from Ballina, County Mayo, to live in a congregated setting in Cork at the age of nine.  For a number of years he lived in various institutions, none of which was close to his family, and in his 20s he began living in bungalows on congregated settings lands, followed by group homes in the community, and then an apartment that belonged to the service provider.  Finally, at the age of 65, just before Christmas last year, Martin became a tenant in his own apartment, which he secured through mainstream social housing and with the supports he needs in place from the supported independent living programme with the service provider that supports him, namely, the Brothers of Charity services.<br/><br/>For Martin, the universal good things in life - living where he chooses, with security of tenure, maximising his potential for independent living with supports in place as required - have become a reality.  He is enabled to make valued contributions in the wider life of the community as an advocate, a neighbour, a pet owner, a friend and an uncle.  He can have his family come to stay in his own home.  These things happen when the services and supports that are offered are tailored to the individual choice and needs of the person, with the various Departments taking up their appropriate roles.  For Martin, his housing is provided by an approved housing body through the local authority, while supports are in place via a voluntary service provider funded by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Fundamentally, the natural supports that come about through being part of a community are growing and developing.<br/><br/><b></b>As we move through the life cycle, the range of Departments that have significant responsibility for maintaining the vision of life lived to its full potential in line with the UN convention grows.  As children reach school age, for instance,<b></b>the national federation warmly welcomes the implementation of a new policy for allocation of special needs teaching resources in mainstream school settings, which will come into effect in autumn 2017, as a wonderful example of the potential of Departments to influence positive change.  The focus of this policy moves from a deficit-based approach that provided resources based on the diagnosis of a child to a system based on the profiled educational needs of each school.  This will address the unfairness that existed in the previous system, whereby many parents were struggling to access assessments to quality for educational resources, which had a particularly negative impact on children from disadvantaged areas.<br/><br/>Similarly, as young people move into the transition from school to post-school options, the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities provides a framework which must be implemented to ensure a range of Departments meet their responsibilities to enhance inclusion and develop the potential of individuals to access work, and that of employers to recognise the value of people with disabilities as employees.  The 2011 census provides stark evidence of the extent to which people with disabilities are much less likely to have employment than other people of working age, something that is even more acute for people with intellectual disabilities.  The national federation strongly advocates for the implementation of the comprehensive employment strategy through cross-departmental collaboration to ensure current barriers to employment are removed in order that the vision of the strategy, that is, that people with disabilities are supported to maximise their potential and enabled to have jobs, earn a living, and make a contribution, is fully realised in line with the State responsibilities set out in Article 27 of the convention.<br/><br/>Article 19 of the convention unequivocally recognises &quot;the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others&quot;, and places responsibility on states to take:</p><blockquote>[E]ffective and appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of this right and their full inclusion and participation in the community, including by ensuring that:<br /><br />(a) Persons with disabilities have the opportunity to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement.</blockquote> <p>Very positive work has taken place under the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016, which is a joint strategy of the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government<font color="#4181C0">, </font>to mainstream the assessment and allocation of housing resources to meet the needs of people with disabilities.<font color="#4181C0"> </font>Under the strategy, pathways for people with disabilities to access mainstream housing options through funding schemes such as the capital assistance scheme, the capital advanced leasing facility and the housing assistance payment, HAP, have been improved, and housing and disability steering groups have been established at local authority level to ensure an ongoing cross-sectoral focus on the meeting of the housing needs of people with disabilities.<br/><br/>However, at this time there are very significant barriers which mean that many people are not enabled to access the opportunity to live in community settings in line with the convention.  There has been a lack of provision of funding for residential supports in the community over the past eight years which means that even with the mainstreaming of housing options, the funding for the supports to enable people to take up these options is severely limited.  The numbers of people with disabilities requiring support and the increased age of carers is leading to built-up emerging need.  In just one of our member organisations, for example, 285 people are living in their childhood home, with family support, in which the primary carer is over 71 years of age, and 98 of whom are over 80 years of age.  Additionally, in this one service provider organisation, there are 205 carers in the 61 to 70 age range, and these represent significant emerging need for residential support to come, which needs to be planned for now.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that what is required as a matter of urgency is a commitment by Government to a multi-annual investment programme commencing with budget 2018.  We have clear evidence that accessing the human rights set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to live in the community, to be seen as a contributing member of society and to reach one's full potential is transformative in the life of people who have had the opportunity to do so already.  We look forward to the day when all citizens with disabilities in this State are given the opportunity to reach their full potential and access their rights as set out in the convention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.529" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathleen O'Meara" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#F00100"><p>We thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here today and we commend it on its consideration of the issues which are raised by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in the area of health and well-being.  The Not for Profit Business Association represents some of the largest providers of services to people with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities.  The members of the association work to effect positive change in the lives of the 40,000 people who use our services.  We believe that ratification and, more importantly, implementation of the convention will enshrine the equal rights of people with disabilities to live in a way and in a place of their choosing.  It is incumbent on Government, public services, service providers and society as a whole to make this aspiration a reality.</p> <p>  Prior to its adoption in 2007, Ireland showed great leadership in negotiating the convention, which has been well recorded.  However, a decade later, we have not been so pioneering.  Ireland, as was stated already by my colleagues, is the last country in Europe to ratify the UNCRPD.  There are actions required prior to ratification but the process has so far has been characterised by delays.  Some progress is being made with the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 going through the Oireachtas, although large parts of this legislation remain unpublished, the enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  Some progress is being made.  Ratification is dependent on enactment rather than on commencement of legislation and on the development of laws rather than the achievement of quality-of-life improvements for people with disabilities in Ireland.</p> <p>  In the past ten years, austerity has impacted significantly on public services, particularly health services and social protection.  The UNCRPD requires states to recognise that people with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination.  This is an area where no new law is needed but where Ireland falls short in terms of provision for people with disabilities.  People with disabilities are not sick but they are more likely to suffer ill-health.  Census 2011 found that just 16.5% of people with a disability indicated they had very good health compared to 66.9% of those without a disability.  Almost 11% of people with disabilities indicated that their health was bad or very bad in stark contrast to just 0.1% of those with no disability.  Many things contribute to poorer health outcomes for people with disabilities such as poverty, inappropriate housing, difficulty accessing transport, lack of employment and education.  People with disabilities are disproportionately impacted upon by cuts in health spending and by waiting lists and delays.  Low incomes mean that they do not have the ability to mitigate the impact of these delays by buying services, which is par for the course for other members of the population.  Low disposable income and increased costs of living also limit people&rsquo;s ability to look after their health and well-being through things such as purchasing good, healthy food, activities to maintain good mental health and social activities.</p> <p>  Things that the rest of us take for granted can be major barriers to accessing appropriate health care and supports for well-being for people with disabilities.  I will give some examples.  A lack of access to information and advice in a format and manner that suits the person's needs, such as access to an Irish Sign Language interpreter, limits the control individuals have over their own health.  A lack of hoists and access in GP surgeries often unnecessarily escalates minor conditions to hospital admission.  A lack of modern legislation to support autonomous decision-making has often excluded people with disabilities from decisions about their health.  The enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will change the law but we need to change the culture through greater health literacy and emphasis on self-management.  There is a lack of equality when it comes to enabling people with disabilities to access screening, health promotion and sexual and reproductive health services.  A lack of appropriate personal assistant, PA, supports makes it difficult for people with physical disabilities to go about their daily activities or access health services.  There are also inconsistencies in access to PA supports within the hospital system.  A lack of appropriate housing leads to inappropriate placement of younger people with disabilities in nursing homes and limits their independence, choice and social integration which impacts on their health and well-being. </p> <p>  The United Nations convention does not open a locked door to greater equality and better services.  That is not what it does.  That door is already open to us.  Nothing says that we need to wait for ratification to take steps to make Ireland a far better and fairer place to live for people with disabilities.  Investment in better access to health services for people with disabilities needs to be a priority now for budget 2018.  Equality-proofing all public investment would ensure that Government spending always promotes inclusion.</p> <p>  Following ratification, Ireland&rsquo;s record will come under review by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It will be the real experiences of people on the ground that will count rather than the list of legislation in place.  People with disabilities are the greatest users of health services but are the least provided for.  Practical change is needed in addition to legislative change if Ireland is to achieve both the word and the spirit of the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

Sorry, Ms O'Meara.  I thought I would get through a meeting without misnaming somebody but I have not.  We will open the discussion for observations from our members.  We will take them in groups of three.  If the witnesses make a note of the questions, we can deal with them as they arise.  Our first three contributors are Deputy O'Reilly, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and Senator Colm Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#F00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the evidence they provided.  I have a number of questions.  The first is to the witnesses from Mental Health Reform.  Ms McGuigan started by saying that she is a mam, which is a good way to start and an indication of how personal the story is to her.  As part of the maternity strategy, we are supposed to be employing more perinatal psychiatrists.  There is an absolute dearth of mental health help for pregnant women and new mothers.  From Ms McGuigan's own experience, she might be able to tell us about how important that kind of intervention is because it is an area that is very often overlooked.  We tend to refer to it as the after baby blues but it is not that; it is a form of depression and is something that needs to be addressed.  In her statement, she asked the committee to get the Department to put in place a timeframe for the review of A Vision for Change.  We all know that the recommendations in A Vision for Change have not been implemented.  Ms McGuigan refers to the fact that they are in the confidence-and-supply agreement but so are a great many other things that are not happening.  If Ms McGuigan was to guide those discussions in terms of how the review might take place, what are we looking for?  A Vision for Change is 11 years old so it is a ten-year strategy that is already a year out of date.  If we were going to try to make up that ground, does Ms McGuigan have any suggestions that might guide those discussions?</p> <p>  I am interested to know the view of all our guests on the delay in ratifying the UNCRPD and their view of the potential adverse effects of the delay in implementing European disability legislation such as the European Accessibility Act, which is under negotiation.  I am conscious we are already behind.  We have a huge amount of ground to make up.  While we have fallen behind, the European Union is moving ahead.</p><p>We are going to need to play a significant amount of catch-up.  If the accessibility Act is passed, do the witnesses believe we are prepared for its requirements?  What impact will delaying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, have on that?</p><p> The European disability strategy 2010 to 2020 seeks to ensure the equal participation in life of all citizens with disabilities, the same as any other citizen.  How are we going to shape up in respect of achieving the goals of this strategy?  Can we do so without ratifying the UNCRPD?  Ms O'Meara was saying that there is a lot we can do.  Do the witnesses think that not ratifying the UNCRPD is a handy excuse for doing nothing?  Is there scope for us to do much that we are not doing?  Can the witnesses point us in the right direction?  When we ask questions, we are often told that after we ratify a convention it will be like turning on a tap.  I suspect it will not be like that.  Judging by the witnesses' nods, they have the same suspicion.</p></speech>

Ms Lennon was talking about health screening for people with a disability, and suggested providing information in more accessible formats.  Could she give us more detail and maybe a few suggestions on that?</p> <p>  My other questions have to do with the ratification of the convention.  I have been the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on disability since roughly this time last year and I am green in the face from trying to get the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath to go ahead with ratification.  The witnesses do not find it acceptable either, of course.  Do they have any other suggestions for getting this to move a bit faster?  Is there anything they or I can be doing?</p> <p>  The convention does not specifically define disability or persons with disabilities.  However, it provides for the abolition of certain laws and regulations.  Do the witnesses believe that these recommendations are viable and transparent, given that the terms have not been defined from the outset?  Would we run into difficulties because of this?  The convention would have to be monitored nationally and internationally.  Do the witnesses think that the State is adequately prepared to comply with its terms, specifically with the requirement for periodic reporting?  The convention does not introduce any new human rights, but provides clarity on what is already there.  While no change can be made to the convention now, do the witnesses see any way around this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#G00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and all the work of their various organisations in giving support to people with disabilities.  In his presentation, Mr. Brian O'Donnell referred to the education system.  One of the issues I have come across over the past few months is the difference between the primary and secondary education systems.  While there are a lot of supports at primary school, we are running into difficulty at second level.  The same degree of support is not there.  What is Mr. O'Donnell's experience of that issue?  Is there a deficit in the second level sector, or coming from the Department?</p> <p>  I presume all the organisations represented here will have experience of trying to get a policy change that has been made at national level implemented at local level.  There can be resistance to bringing about such change.  The witnesses might outline their own difficulties with that.  I have come across it quite a bit with a number of organisations, both the health services and local authorities.  Even though the policy clearly sets out what road we are going down, implementing it is extremely slow and difficult.  For example, we built a brand new facility costing &euro;15 million, and because it was going to bring about some change, we could not get people to move into it for a period of eight or nine months.  There was a stand-off over how it would be managed.  How can we work more comprehensively with people to get a faster implementation of national policy?</p> <p>  I also want to touch on the role of disability officers in local authorities.  Every local authority seems to have a different interpretation of that role.  Some believe the disability officer identifies changes that are needed for access to public buildings.  Others believe he or she is a reference point for people with disabilities, to help them deal with any issue, whether it be a matter of housing, access to services or access to public buildings.  That is my understanding of the role.  In Cork, however, I had to refer a number of cases to the Ombudsman because there was a lack of action by a local authority in dealing with disability issues.  There was one case in which the parents of a child with intellectual and physical disabilities had received a letter from the local authority in July 2008 that their house needed to be adapted.  It was a local authority house.  Six years later, no work had been done.  Only after the Ombudsman became involved was work done.  I do not think anyone should have to go to that stage.  The child had severe disability and had to be taken out of bed every morning to be looked after, and was being tube-fed.  The parents were providing the care at home.  Another State agency was providing housing that was inappropriate.  What are the views of the witnesses on how to make the role of disability officers in local authorities more effective?  I have raised the matter with the National Disability Authority and have made a number of freedom of information requests to individual local authorities.  How can we ensure that the role of the disability officer is fully recognised and that people with disabilities know to contact them in respect of providing services and making changes that are needed?</p></speech>

As I outlined in my presentation, our federation very much welcomes the implementation of the new policy for the allocation of special needs teaching resources in mainstream school settings, which will take effect in the autumn of this year.  That policy moves away from the need for parents to seek out assessments in order to qualify for educational resources.  Instead, the school is profiled in terms of the teaching resources it requires, which is welcome.  In respect of secondary schools, the federation welcomes the increase in the number of special needs assistants that have been put in place over past years.</p><p>That is a welcome development.  However, it is still far from perfect.  My colleague, Mr. Christy Lynch, is chief executive of KARE, which is a patron of schools.  Mr. Lynch will deal with the practical difficulties KARE encounters as a patron of schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Christy Lynch" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#H00200"><p>I thank Deputies for the opportunity to be here.  I will make a general point that arises from a number of the questions on the convention.  Another point relates to special schools.  In the past, most children with intellectual disabilities went to special schools.  Thankfully, that has changed over the years.  Special schools remain national schools even though children stay there up to the age of 18 years.  They follow the national school curriculum up to the age of 18 years.  There has always been a view that that the national curriculum is fine when it comes to intellectual disability.  Of course it is not fine.  A child with intellectual disability should transition, like any other child, from primary to secondary level.</p> <p>  Let us consider the history of inclusive education in this country.  Much progress has been made and much good work has been done over the years.  We should acknowledge that.  However, it was very much focused on primary schools.  Issues have arisen when we come to secondary school.  This is not an excuse not to do it; we should absolutely promote full inclusion at second level.  At second level children are not with one teacher but with seven or eight teachers rotating throughout the school.  I was deputy chairperson of the National Council for Special Education twice.  Therefore, I know this was one of the issues the council was considering at the time.  Secondary schools, like national schools, when this issue arose, were resistant.  They made arguments about how they would be unable to do it, how children would not cope and how there was too much change in the day.  We know from the evidence that is simply not true.  We simply need to provide the levels of support that children require to be able to fully participate at second level.</p> <p>  I am not currently involved with the National Council for Special Education but I believe it might be useful for the committee to ask the council to comment on the issue in respect of the progress made in the area.</p> <p>  I will offer some general points on the questions.  The convention is a paradigm shift in the area of disability.  It is a completely different lens through which we will approach the disability issue.  It amounts to moving away from medical models and models generally towards full participation and equality and rights.  It is a foundation for us to build on.  There are many things that we have done well but it is a foundation that we can build on.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the question of delay.  I maintain that we have excellent policy in this country.  I do a good deal of international work.  I was involved in putting some of the policy together.  We looked to Australia, Canada, USA and anywhere we could find best practice examples to incorporate into the policy in Ireland.  However, we did it at a time of absolute austerity.  The riders that kept coming on the policy all held that it must be budget neutral.  The fact is that people's rights and respecting people's rights is not always budget neutral.  People with disabilities have paid too big a price.  The convention and the ratification of the convention would represent a statement by Government to the effect that it is committed to it and that it will do it.</p> <p>  One of the arguments for why we have taken so long &ndash; I have heard this from previous Ministers &ndash; was that when we ratify it we will take our responsibilities seriously as a State and commit to it.  What that means is that we put up our money and start to identify the areas and the questions being asked with regard to how we catch up.  There are areas where we have done well but there are other areas where we need to catch up.  We cannot do that on a budget neutral basis.</p> <p>  The question of whether we need to ratify it has been raised.  We do not and we have not done so thus far.  We could start and we should start in budget 2018.  Whenever we ratify the convention &ndash; I hope it will be soon &ndash; at least some of the work will have started and will be under way.  That would be worth doing.</p> <p>  The difficulty with grey policy &ndash; I am quoting my mother here &ndash; is that paper never refuses ink.  We can write anything down and ratify the convention and clap ourselves on the back for doing it.  However, as my colleague pointed out, unless we follow through by implementing the provisions and putting in place the mechanisms to monitor how we are moving it forward, then there is no point.  We should not rely on the UN committee.  It is great that the committee is in place but we should really take responsibility for our citizens and put right the wrongs of the past.</p> <p>  I will go back to the paradigm shift.  This relates to some of the points made.  The point about disability officers is a good example.  The paradigm shift requires all Departments to revisit the way they address the issue of their responsibilities for people with disabilities.  What is the role of county councils?  That question was raised by the Senator.  The county councils should take responsibility for what county councillors are responsible for.  They should do that in a way that respects the rights of people with disabilities, because councils have responsibilities.</p> <p>  I was involved in putting together the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  We worked with seven Departments.  The burning question from every Department was: "Who owns this?"  What was behind that question?  The view was there was a need to lay it on another body and walk away from it such that each Department would not have to do anything.</p> <p>  The convention does not work that way.  It cuts across every aspect of life for people with disabilities, and so it should, because disability affects every aspect of life for citizens with disabilities.  The only way we are going to get this right is for everyone in the State to contribute.  The Government needs to lead by example.  I would encourage the committee to take this back to the Cabinet table and inform the Government that this is a Cabinet issue.  It is for the whole of Government.  Whenever we get to ratifying or implementing it, we need a whole-of-Government response.  Each Department needs to take responsibility for this, take it seriously and implement it.  However, we will be unable to do that unless we get back a multi-annual investment programme to put some money behind it.</p> <p>  The convention recognises that all countries are coming from different starting points.  We may be one of the last to ratify the convention, but we are far ahead of many countries in terms of what we have done thus far.  We still have work to do.  My colleague, Professor Gerard Quinn, often says that Rome was not built in a day, but that Rome was built.  We will have to identify where we are in that process and what we need to do.  Most important, we need to identify how we are going to fund it to put the wrongs of the past right for people with disabilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Lennon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#H00300"><p>I propose to talk about delay, readiness and what can be done in the meantime.  The delay is sending a message.  Recently, the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities said that notwithstanding the fact that we have not ratified the convention, life is still better for people with disabilities in Ireland than in many countries that have ratified it.  The answer to that is to call on him to prove it.  Let us consider the globe.  Here is the list of countries: Bhutan, Cameroon, Chad, Fiji, Kurdistan, Lebanon, Libya, Monaco, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, Tonga, USA, Uzbekistan and Ireland.  That is it.  Everyone else has ratified the convention.  They are sending a different message from the message Ireland is sending.</p> <p>  We are contradicting ourselves in terms of our readiness.  We have taken a decade to get to the point where we have now clearly signalled our intent to ratify the convention with what we call declarations and reservations.  We are not going to ratify the convention entirely anyway.  We could have done that a decade ago.  We could have put in declarations and reservations ten years ago while getting on with the ratification of the convention in the meantime.</p> <p>  Last week, we had the pleasure of receiving a delegate from Malta at Inclusion Ireland.  Rhoda Garland was her name.  She works with a disabled persons organisation in Malta.  She spoke about the experience of the Maltese.  She said that before ratification many people with disabilities did not have a good experience but that ratification had kick-started considerable progress.  Malta ratified first and started reforming laws and legislation after that.  At that stage Malta had a framework within which to work.  The country sought guidance and expertise from other countries about their experiences.  She spoke with our self-advocates in Inclusion Ireland.  They asked whether they should write to the Minister to suggest that Ireland should ratify the convention.  She said "No", but continued that they should write to the Minister and insist that we ratify it.  That was a useful way to look at it.</p> <p>  I mentioned that we are going to put in a reservation.  This lends itself to the question around the accessibility policy and whether we are ready for it.  It is our intention &ndash; we have said as much clearly &ndash; to put in a reservation relating to reasonable accommodation.  In essence, we are going to have different levels of reasonable accommodation depending on who we are talking about.  Public employers, for example, providers of public services have a certain standard that applies.  This is called the disproportionate burden.  However, there is a nominal cost for private services.  In essence, it depends on who a person is or what service the person is receiving.  If it is a public service, a person will be accommodated to a certain level.  However, if it is a private service, the service level will be different.  That is not consistent with the UN convention and that is not the experience in most other countries.</p> <p>  We have said it is a constitutional barrier.</p><p>Something Inclusion Ireland has sought, and it would be fantastic if this committee could do it, is the publication of the legal advice which says there is a constitutional barrier to that.  If there is a constitutional barrier, we should examine ways around it.  We are probably tired of referendums but if something could be put in place, such as a funding scheme, to allow private services to reach the higher standard without impeding their private property rights, it would be a practical thing to do in the meantime and would not cost a great deal of money.</p><p> Another thing we could do in the interim is borrow from the Maltese model.  Malta invested in self-advocacy.  It trained self-advocates and worked with people with lived experience of disability.  Malta has employed the model that we are proposing, where people with disabilities are involved in the monitoring.  Once the convention was ratified those self-advocates were ready to begin the monitoring aspect.  That is a practical thing we can do ahead of ratification.</p><p> I was asked a specific question about health screening.  We can do several things.  Obviously, alternative formats that are easy to read and using videos and Braille are important.  Another practical course would be for the Minister for Health to publish a public sector duty obligation, that is, what the Department of Health intends to do and setting out a plan for all of the health screenings and health services and what alternative formats the Minister would like his Department to employ.  That is something he is required to do under the Irish human rights and equality Act.</p><p> A study was carried out in 2009 on screening for breast cancer in post-menopausal women.  That study found that one four people in the sample did not receive breast screening.  They were invited and a number of them attended.  Of those who did attend, 16% could not be screened for various reasons including fear, discomfort, distress and what was described as an inability to co-operate.  The study was putting the blame a little on the participants rather than, perhaps, on the process.  One issue that emerged strongly was consent to the treatment.  Again, the issue of consent is huge while the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act is not in place.  That study found that people with more profound intellectual disabilities were no less likely to develop breast cancer but were less likely to receive the screening.  It is an irresistible mandate for us to fully commence the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act without further delay.</p><p> In terms of there being no new rights under the convention, we work a great deal with self-advocates and they are not looking for new rights.  They are looking for the same as everybody else - a job, a family, a roof over their heads and to belong.  They come up against unique barriers.  People with disabilities do not need new rights, but they need us to respond to their unique barriers.  At present, without ratifying the convention we are letting them down.</p></speech>

I will respond to Deputy O'Reilly.  The adverse impact of the delay is primarily on people.  The Deputy might have seen the demonstration here about a month ago.  There was a very good turnout for that.  It could have been greater if people were able to travel and so forth.  It gave an indication of how people feel.  This delay is telling them, in effect, that they are not important.  I will not go so far as to say second class citizens, but they are not being treated the same as everybody else.  Let us face it, there is already much evidence of that.  When the Government says that it is committed to ratifying the convention, that it will do so by the end of 2016 or so and it still has not happened, how are they expected to feel about it?  One of the main adverse impacts is on the people themselves.</p> <p>  What difference would it make?  It does not open a locked door.  However, I point to what my colleagues have mentioned, that ratification represents a real shift to a rights-based approach, rather than a charitable approach.  It embeds it strongly there.  The legal changes taking place in the legislative programme that must accompany the ratification make a difference.  There is the right to health.  That is a huge one in health today.  There is also housing.  How many people with disabilities wish to live in their own home?  Many do, but they do not get to do that.  Yes, there is a housing crisis across the country but people with disabilities are at the bottom of the list for access to housing.  There is the right to employment.  The rate of employment among people with disabilities is very low.  Again, they are at the bottom of the list.  There is much to be done in that area.</p> <p>  One of the big issues is accountability and the UN committee to which the Government must report on what it has and has not done.  As we know, we are not great at accountability in this country and sometimes a body outside the country is required to hold the Government to account.  That is very welcome as part of the ratification.</p></speech>

The role of those disability officers, or access officers as they are called, is determined under the Disability Act.  Their role is to facilitate people with disabilities to access the service of that public provider.  It is not necessarily to get involved in making decisions about the priority of the individual case but to ensure that the person gets access.  The issue is that many public bodies have no access officers in place.  In fact, the HSE has only begun doing that work in the last two years.  It had to train up to 500 people in that role.  That is a considerable piece of work but the fact that it only started nine or ten years after the Act is not understandable.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on Deputy O'Reilly's query about the delay on the UNCRPD, the European Accessibility Act and the role of that Act.  I am not too familiar with the European Accessibility Act but I am more familiar with some of the changes that European law and directives have caused.  One of them that is quite significant for the deaf or hard of hearing, and I am familiar with that area, is that in a month or two months, a new text relay service is due to be introduced.  It will allow people who cannot make voice calls, that is, people who cannot hear or people who cannot speak, make calls in real time via a relay operator.  That is being introduced by order of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the regulator of telecommunications providers.  It is doing so on foot of an EU directive of some years ago.  It is an improvement in accessibility that is being driven by EU law.</p> <p>  The other nice aspect to it is that it is a form of paradigm and cultural shift we need.  The cost of the service is nominally the burden of the telecommunications providers.  In fact, however, they will pass it on to their customers.  The person who uses the service pays the normal rate for making the telephone call or transaction, but all of the customers of telecommunications providers will share the cost of providing that service.  The paradigm shift is that this is not a cost that a particular sector or budget bears, but is distributed among all of us.  It is an ultimate example of mainstreaming, where everybody does not have equal access.  Equal access to a telephone is no good to a deaf person but they have equivalent access to the facility.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline McGuigan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#J00800"><p>I was thinking about it after Deputy O'Reilly asked the question and referred to having more psychiatrists in maternity hospitals.</p><p>I have worked for many years with people who have gone through challenging mental health difficulties but they are no different from anyone here today because we are all human beings and we all have our ups and downs.  I do not feel that more psychiatrists in maternity hospitals would be of particular benefit, but people's mindset, attitude and culture need to change.  I had Conor when I was attending the psychiatric services and the assumptions that are made are unbelievable.  A woman who goes into hospital to have a baby brings a record with her and is categorised and spoken to differently.  It is fascinating to watch.  We need a whole-hospital approach, and for everybody working in a maternity hospital to have the right attitude and mindset.  For example, people should not make assumptions nor believe they know what is best for someone else.  They should sit down and ask people what is best for them because people know themselves best.</p><p> It is horrible to go to a place when one has a psychiatric record.  I had one for eight years and it is very instructive to read what people say about someone.  If staff have a particular belief system which they carry into the workplace, it needs to be challenged.  People should also be upskilled.  I am entitled to a choice.  If I want to talk to a nurse, a doctor, a psychiatrist or a psychologist I should be allowed to.  When I was in psychiatric services, there were some nice people and there were others who should not have been working there.  One of my biggest relationships was with Connie, who worked in the kitchen.  She had not done her masters in psychiatry but she connected and that what it is all about.</p><p> Psychiatry has a very paternalistic approach and people make assumptions that because one has suffered with mental health or has other challenges, one needs a psychiatrist.  One may need a good friend or a nice nurse.  While advocacy is important, one should not make assumptions about a person who has come far enough in life to be admitted to a hospital to have a child.  It is about listening and about giving people a choice.  If they happen to want a psychiatrist, that is good.  The latter is not, however, the only choice and it is not for everybody.</p></speech>

A review of A Vision for Change needs to keep the good parts and we need to continue the implementation of its good parts while addressing its significant gaps.  A Vision for Change does not mention gender even once in its hundreds of pages.  It is out of step with the mental health policy we need, which would recognise that there are particular issues for women, men, the LGBT community and everybody else.</p> <p>  A Vision for Change is also not very helpful in the area of dual diagnosis with an addiction or substance misuse issue.  It speaks very lightly around the issue of cultural sensitivity to mental health services and does not suggest what this should look like.  We have had a lot of conversations about gaps in mental health services but we have huge undercapacity in our primary care system in the context of mental health and that is partly because A Vision for Change did not get specific enough about what primary care for mental health should look like.  In the absence of such a policy, what happens?  The service provider goes off and does their own thing, or nothing.  The HSE responds to criticism but without a policy basis and it may not even respond where a particular focus is not placed on an area.</p> <p>  We need an updating of A Vision for Change.  It needs to be a consultative process and to happen quickly.  The document specified that a review should happen between seven and ten years after the policy has been published but we are now in the 11th year since A Vision for Change was published so we are overdue.  We are looking for the continued implementation of A Vision for Change but also a fairly rapid and pragmatic review which involves consultation with people to address the gaps.</p> <p>  It is not just the policy that needs to be reviewed.  The mechanism for implementation must also be reviewed.  The HSE has been reconfigured numerous times during the lifetime of A Vision for Change and it is being restructured again at the highest management level.  Those of us in mental health reform fought hard for a senior manager in the health service to be designated as responsible for mental health, the national director for mental health whom we now have.  However, we are now going to lose that role as it will be combined into a number of other areas.  Historically, mental health has persistently suffered from being the Cinderella in the wider health system and it is still under-invested in terms of the overall health budget, with just 6% of that budget going towards mental health care.  Mental health has to be visible in the new structures of the HSE and in what comes after the HSE, if we every get beyond it.  It has to be designated as having its own space.  We are at risk of going backwards to a stage where mental health was not particularly visible and was a soft touch for savings when savings were needed.</p></speech>

Services are the middlemen so Government should be talking to us and people with disabilities to get the true picture of what it is like out there.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony said that there is no clear definition in the convention of what a disability is.  We should focus on a clear definition of what it is to be a human being as that would be much more beneficial.  We still suffer from a misunderstanding that people with disabilities are, somehow, a different type of person and unless we get that basic piece right, we will never get the right conversations going.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke spoke about education and there is a real problem here.  It is not just about education but a lack of purpose in the HSE and the whole service industry.  I wonder if it is the intention that people be educated to get work and live independently or is this just a holding ground and people are educated until they are 18 and then moved into rehabilitative training, RT, or day services?  What is the purpose of this?  People with disabilities are the objects of these systems and not the subjects and this is a big problem.</p> <p>  There is great policy out there but it is not being implemented.  Government designs the policy and passes on the contracts to middlemen for services but it is not happening.  Why is it not happening?  Do we need to sign the UNCRPD?  Probably not.  We are not denied rights in legislation - we are just not granted them.</p><p>One could say we could assume a right, but good luck with that.  It will take a lot of resources but we need to decide.  One must be accountable at the end of the day.  It is not about another sector in society.  I often wonder why everybody from the Government is not represented here because disabilities affect, or should affect, all Departments and not just the health sector.  If we do not move it out of the health sector, we will not be able to implement the intention behind the convention either.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and am enlivened by the fact that a number of people have spoken from their own experience.  I refer to Ms McGuigan and Ms O'Shea, and a man who is not present, Mr. Martin Dooher, and people from Ballina to Cork.  That is important.  Ms O'Shea came back to that point.  It is important to hear from people.  You had an experience recently, a Chathaoirligh, in the AV room of listening to the stories of a number of people, which is important.  A couple of things struck me.  Ms McGuigan made an observation that one might need one of those nice nurses so Nurse Ratchet need not apply any more.  It is so important to meet someone who can listen to one in any situation.  The question was asked why do we not have everybody from the Government here.  That encapsulates where some of this needs to go after today.</p> <p>  Mr. Lynch mentioned education.  We have had references to housing, poverty, education, transport, communication, loneliness, social exclusion, the congregated settings, PAs and people in nursing homes.  It is very important that we find a way.  My colleagues and I cannot deal comprehensively with the very solid submissions that have been made that have knitted a lot of things together.  That might be something we as a committee need to think about and come back to the issue of other Departments.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on mental health reform.  What is the understanding of witnesses about the extent of social exclusion for people living with mental health difficulties?  The next question is related.  The witnesses mentioned a lot of very practical things that need to happen in the health space.  Could they name even two other Departments or areas of the public service that need to get their act together in order to make a critical and complementary improvement to people with mental health needs?</p> <p>  I have a couple of other questions which I will not direct at anyone in particular.  This is a provocative question.  In the past, have we given too much responsibility to the Department of Health for the lives of people with disabilities or has the Department in a sense, just picked up stuff it should not have picked up that rightly belongs elsewhere?</p> <p>  Community living and making that work was clear across the various submissions.  I wish to go beyond the area of health, although witnesses can mention things in that regard as well.  What actions in other public service domains would help to move people back into their rightful space in their communities and keep them there?  They are the specific questions.  I have many others but I will not get into them as I would be here all day.  We need to find a way to tidy up the loose ends.  A richness and synergy was evident in the presentations today that I have not seen come across too often.  We must find a way to go beyond this stage.  We will have some other discussions next week.  I again thank all the witnesses.</p></speech>

Would someone like to refer to personalised budgets and how they might be progressed?  From my experience in general practice, parents and patients have expressed the view that they could get much better value for money.  They said if they looked after their own budget they could choose their own services and have services delivered much more conveniently and cost effectively.</p> <p>  I have encountered problems where adolescents transitioned to adulthood and there was a lack of respite services available to them or there was difficulty in accessing respite services.  When we were discussing the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the D&aacute;il, not all the provisions of the Act were available to us.  We were told they would be delivered on Committee Stage.  One of the areas concerned accommodation.  Mr. Lennon referred to that issue but perhaps he could outline it again.</p> <p>  I also have a question for Dr. McDaid.  There were 172 recommendations in the review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  We dealt with one a few weeks ago in respect of Deputy Browne's Bill.  Could Dr. McDaid indicate three of the priority issues among the 172?</p></speech>

We did not get a chance in our very brief opening statement to look at the whole area of social exclusion - or let us say social inclusion - of people who have experience of a mental health difficulty.</p> <p>  We talk about people who have experience of a mental health difficulty because just having had a diagnosis of a mental health issue can result in social exclusion.  It can result in a different ability to get a job and different opportunities for getting work so there is a risk right away, long before it might be a disabling condition never mind if it is an ongoing condition.  Let us be honest - if one has a diagnosis of something like schizophrenia and one tries to get a job, one will be very hard-pressed to find an employer who will be completely open to employing one, once one discloses the diagnosis.  That has to change radically.  People who have a mental health diagnosis have an equal right to work in this country but that right is not fulfilled despite the anti-discrimination legislation we have.</p> <p>  About half of people who are on disability allowances say their primary disability is a mental health difficulty.  The extent of difficulties in terms of poverty and social exclusion &ndash; essentially living outside the norms of society &ndash; is widespread among people who have a disabling mental health condition.  About 80% are not working, about half want to work and there is not really any good reason that people with a mental health difficulty should not be able to participate.  As for what could be done, to begin with, the Department of Social Protection could make it much easier for people to risk taking up work if they are on disability and be able to know with absolute confidence that they can get back on benefits without any worry.</p><p>Some would say that they should be able to retain their benefits while they try work and then go back onto benefits if it does not work out, because mental health difficulties are episodic and the stress and strain of trying work after many years out of work itself can precipitate a potential relapse.  We need to be able to have a much more flexible benefits system, one that provides people with the real reassurance that they can try numerous times to get a job and that if it does not work out they have the absolute assurance that they can have their full benefits back.  </p><p> The area of housing is absolutely key to recovery from a mental health difficulty.  It is very hard to recover from a mental health difficulty when one is in an unstable housing situation.  We also know that there is a high proportion of people in long-stay psychiatric units who are there because there is a housing need.  They do not need to be in a psychiatric unit but they need a place to live.  It happens that they end up in a psychiatric unit and then there is difficulty in getting them housing.  The housing crisis has a direct impact on people's ability to avail of their rights to autonomy and dignity and living independently in the community.  There are specific things that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment can do.  We have asked it, along with the Department of Health, to look at funding tenancy sustainment support for people who are living in the community with a severe mental health difficulty and who need that type of support.  They do not necessarily need a nurse to visit them regularly but they do need someone to be in touch regularly to make sure that they are able to maintain their housing situation and help to broker any issues that arise.  That needs to be progressed.  It has been discussed for quite some time.  It needs to be implemented. </p><p> The education system is key to preventing mental health difficulties by teaching children at a very, very young age, from the first years of primary school up, how to cope with their emotions and conflict and stress and how to look after their mental health and reach out for help when they are feeling that they cannot cope.  The Department of Education and Skills is making some good steps in that regard.  We have seen attempts to implement a junior cycle curriculum which has mental health as a core subject matter.  Schools are being supported to do that.  However, we have to see it feature in every school.  It must be the ambition that every child has that kind of exposure to mental health awareness and education on how to look after themselves from early childhood.  That makes it everybody's business, and the school system is a key starting point for that.  </p><p> I was asked what could be done regarding some of the recommendations about the Mental Health Act beyond what is in the amendment Bill.  One of the key recommendations is advanced directives.  It is really not tolerable that people who have a mental health diagnosis and who end up in hospital because of that cannot set out in writing the things that they want or do not want when they are in hospital and have that respected and know for sure that, by law, it will be respected.  That is the situation we have.  It is clearly discriminatory under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill as it stands does not rectify that.  It needs to be rectified.  There are also issues in terms of children aged 16 and 17 who under the Mental Health (Amendment) Act are not allowed to have a voice in consenting to their own treatment.  Unlike physical health care decisions there is a different age of consent in the Mental Health (Amendment) Act of 18 years old.  That is also discriminatory.  </p><p> We feel that it is very important to introduce a statutory right to advocacy.  Every person who has to be in hospital for mental health treatment should have a right to access an advocate who can help to support them and make sure that their voice is heard in the process of treatment decision-making and admission decision-making as well.</p></speech>

The Senator asked whether we have relied too much on health.  We absolutely have, without question.  We understand the reason for that, because if we look back at the history of disability it comes out of the medical model.  While those of us in the sector would like to think that we are out of the medical model we absolutely are not.  It is still alive and well in the country and plays out in all kinds of ways in the lives of people with disabilities.</p> <p>  To give an example, without naming names, I stood not far from this room and spoke to a Government Minister a while ago about the area that that Minister has absolute responsibility for and he said that I should speak to the Minister for Health.  I did not have to talk to the Minister for Health.  I went to a meeting with the Department of Social Protection with the Irish Association of Supported Employment, which is the only national body dedicated to the employment of people with disabilities.  I was the founder so I am biased, but employment has been mentioned by everybody.  It was seeking funding for a core grant to keep their core staff in place.  It did not get it and so it had to let its core staff go.  It was told to go and talk to the HSE.  I said that I deal with the HSE every day in my job as a service provider and asked why I would ask the health service to fund the employment of people with disabilities.  It makes absolutely no sense.  The medical model is alive and well, and to answer Senator Dolan's question, yes, we have relied too heavily on health.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked if it might make a difference if the two things came together.  I ran the national project on congregated settings and therefore wrote the report.  The Department that I met most regularly while we were doing that was the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I remember going into a room and saying that we should add 4,200 people to the housing waiting list because that is how many are living in institutional settings who need to move out.  We are way behind on the implementation of that report.  The debate at the time was whether we recommend a five-year implementation or a ten-year implementation.  In good Irish fashion we went for a seven-year implementation.  That would mean that next year it would be completed.  It is far from being completed, and as a colleague has said, a target - which is a very, very low target in terms of this programme for Government - will be reached not because we have done a great job but because people pass away.  It is a bad indictment on all of us if that is our commitment to this issue.</p> <p>  Why, when we have the largest social housing budget in the history of the State, is the health service putting &euro;20 million per year into providing housing to move people out of congregated settings?  We badly need that funding in other areas.  There has been no capital funding for New Directions, which is the day service policy, for many years, and for all kinds of things that the health service is responsible for.  The answer is because of the lack of commitment in one Department which is responsible for housing to dedicate the required amount of money.  They have dedicated some money and it has improved a little, but I do not understand why health is funding housing.  It is not the responsibility of the Department of Health.  The money is badly needed within the health budget.  Please do not take from that that I am suggesting that the budget be removed.  I am answering Senator Dolan's question about what could help.  There is no point in providing the housing if the support and staffing for people to live in the housing, the supports they need to live their lives, are not also provided.  That is one example, and there are many others, that will come together. </p> <p>  On the question of personalised budgets I am actually chairing the task force established by Government on that issue.  It is great that there is a commitment in the programme to getting this done.  When the Minister asked me to do it I said that the issue had been talked to death.  We had been talking about individualised and personalised budgets for 20 years.  The task force is working very hard and there are many people involved.  We have every intention of meeting the deadline, which is to bring recommendations back to the Minister by the end of this year, and our work plan is on the Department's website for anyone who wants to see it.  One of the challenges here is the level of expectation.  There are people who think that it is as simple as getting the money and providing better value, and other people who think it is too complicated.  It is taxpayers' money.  We are trying to find a middle ground which gives people much more choice and much more control, but also to balance the governance requirement.</p><p>We all know that governance is a big issue, and rightly so, but it has to be proportionate.  If I get a personalised budget of &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 versus one of &euro;250,000, then the governance of that should be proportionate.</p><p> The other question is adequacy.  We are looking and have looked all over the world.  I am not sure that giving me a personalised budget to live my life, instead of giving it to a service provider, when it is not enough money for either, goes very far.  Speaking personally, I have told the group that if, ultimately, we come up with a system of personalised budgets that forces individuals back into what might be described as traditional services, we will have done a very poor job.  Hopefully, that will not be the case.</p><p> The final question, which is very important, relates to respite services.  I encourage the committee to look back at whatever small allocations have been made to disabilities over those years.  They will find that almost all of it went to progressing children's services, for therapy - and we need more of that - and the other area which was focused on was school leavers - again, we have to provide for young people coming out of school into adult services - but nothing else.  We have repeated the mistakes we made in the 1980s.  I understand the situation that the country was in but there was no investment in respite care and we have allowed the waiting list for residential care for people with disabilities to grow and grow.  A father contacted me yesterday.  He was at his wits' end after spending two years going round the houses to Deputies and all kinds of people.  He is a lone parent and has a profoundly handicapped son and is at the end of his tether.  I had to tell him that unless he was in an absolute emergency, he did not have a hope because there is no budget, not even for emergencies, but emergencies have to be dealt with.  The knock-on effect of that, to answer the question, is there have been no new respite services.  It is common sense.  More children are being born every year, they are coming into the system, adults are living longer - thankfully - partly due to better provision and health care and so on, and with no expansion of the respite services, the numbers are continually growing, and whatever the number of places, the numbers trying to use them are growing all the time.</p><p> As providers, we all see families in crisis who are not getting anything like the level of respite they need.  We know they will become the emergencies.  A vicious circle operates here because there is no planning for emergencies, which brings me back to the need for multi-annual investment programmes in order that we can plan.  Because there is no planning for residential services, emergencies happen.  I am chairing a respite review committee at the moment in CHO 7.  One provider has five respite beds blocked.  The reason is because people came into respite, they cannot go home and there is nothing else.  The lack of planning in residential services has a direct bearing on respite.  The reason the federation is calling for a multi-annual investment programme is that there is no point in only dealing with school leavers.  It is going back to the convention, it is talking about all aspects of people's lives.  We have got to put up the money to take this seriously and correct the wrongs of the past and put right the fact that people with disabilities have paid too high a price through the austerity years.  This is well documented.  I have heard Senator John Dolan speak about it on many occasions.  It is a fact; it is not someone's opinion.  There is an onus on us to address the needs of some of the most vulnerable people in our society and so many parents, and not all of them are older parents.  The parent I was talking to would not fall into the older category but he struggles every day and is being pushed from pillar to post.  This has to stop and the only way that will stop is if we plan properly and invest properly. </p></speech>

Through our community engagement we hear a lot about the need for respite and people in crisis.  The question we have about it is why are we talking about respite at all?  Why are we using that language and why are we talking about respite as a break?  What it comes back to is that we must always have regard to the vision the convention sets out for us, which is of individuals with disabilities living their own lives, as the rest of us tend to do when we grow up.  We leave home, we found our own family and we live in our own house in the community.  If we are talking in the language of respite, burden and crisis, we are doing something very badly wrong from the start.  That is not to suggest for a moment that people are not experiencing crisis situations, but if we just put respite places in place without looking at why we are having this conversation, then we will be stuck in a perpetual cycle.</p> <p>  On health and the Department of Health and whether it just picked it up, it comes back to a lot of public services being provided by the Department of Health or through the religious orders.  With disability services, there is both.  If we are talking about a medical model, we are also talking about a charity model.  A consultation is going on as part of the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and, speaking from memory, the Departments involved are Health, Social Protection, Education and Skills along with the HSE.  The critical Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is not involved in this consultation.  Why are we having a consultation on employment strategies without the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation being involved?  It goes back to the fact that we are not serious about this.  We are not genuinely trying to create workplace environments for disabled people, we are talking about how we rehabilitate people so that they are ready to go to work.  </p> <p>  On community living, it is not just about bricks and mortar, although in Ireland bricks and mortar is a pretty big problem.  It is not just about being there and being in the community, it is about community inclusion.  The work of the task force is ongoing and we wait, I almost said with trepidation but anticipation is probably the right word.  There would be very little point in us designing a personal budgets model if it simply allows people the choice they would have had anyway.  That point has been well made but it is worth reiterating.  One thing for which Inclusion Ireland has asked repeatedly was for service providers to sign up to having between 8% and 15% of their budgets, which are provided by the HSE through a service level agreement, to be ring-fenced for individualised and community based models of supports.  In 2015, 22 service providers did so.  What we were looking for was the buy-in.  More than that, Inclusion Ireland would like to see is an independent commissioning agency in order that where services are being commissioned, that would be done on an independent basis.  </p> <p>  I refer to the Disabilities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill as the mopping-up Bill, as it has the bits and pieces that we have identified that we need to do before we can ratify the convention.  There are lots of problems with it but one critical issue ,which was raised here, pertains to "reasonable accommodation", which is a pretty central part of the convention.  It is regrettable that we have said that we will enter a reservation.  We have said that essentially, we will allow people with disabilities to be reasonably accommodated in certain places.  If it is school we may allow them to bring in a service dog, we might allow them to have some sort of support but if they are accessing a private service, unless it only has a nominal cost to the service provider, they are not entitled to it, that is, that discrimination does not take place unless it is simply a nominal cost.  That is not the standard of the convention.  The convention asks us to reach a disproportionate burden standard.  The point is being made that there is a constitutional right to private property with which the State cannot interfere.   Inclusion Ireland does not believe that is necessarily true.  There is obviously a constitutional right but it can be overcome in the public interest.  We can make a compulsory purchase order for land, if we think it is in the public interest, and we would like to see some vision and leadership from the Government on this issue and to say that it is clearly in the public interest for all services, whether private or public, should be subject to reasonable accommodation provision.  That is something that is in the public interest.  The other thing, which I will touch on briefly although I could talk about it for a while, is that this Bill is from the Department of Justice and Equality but part of it has been given to the Department of Health to develop the deprivation of liberty safeguards.  There has been no consultation on that part of the Bill.  It is proposed that those provisions will be put forward at Committee Stage with no consultation and that is completely inappropriate and wrong.</p><p>The deprivation of liberty is a serious matter.  These are people who are<i>de facto</i>being deprived of their liberty, that is not in the legal sense; I am talking about people who are in institutional care or nursing home care who are monitored 24 hours per day, who are scrutinised and observed and who are not free to leave, by any reasonable measurement.  They are being deprived of their liberty.  Ireland has no safeguards in place for when a person lacks the capacity to choose.  It is wrong to proceed to Committee Stage on this very serious issue without any meaningful consultation and this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I agree totally with Ms Lennon's comments on this and around the other missing pieces of the Bill.  It is by no means a complete piece of legislation.  The feeling is that it was produced under pressure and while the pressure was the right pressure, the Bill is by no means complete.  The removal of the term "unsound mind", for instance, is not provided for in the Bill and we hope this will be rectified and corrected when the Bill returns for consideration.</p> <p>  On the issue of whether we have given over too much responsibility I believe Senator Dolan was, obviously, bouncing a soft ball to us.  I totally agree with my colleagues' comments in this regard.</p> <p>  Reference was made to personalised budgets and respite for adults.  I shall rely a little bit on some anecdotal stories.  A colleague of mine has said that personalised budgets would never happen because the HSE will not give up control of the money.  That is all I will say on this.  It has to happen because at the core is independence and choice.  At the core is transfer of power to the person and this is critically important, apart from the point made by the Chairman on value for money.  It has to happen but there is a road yet to travel on this issue.</p> <p>  With regard to respite for adults, a few weeks ago a story came my way about elderly parents with a son who has an intellectual disability.  He had lived all his life with his parents, both of whom are in their older years and who, unfortunately and at nearly the same time, had fallen ill.  It left a situation where the son, in his 40s who had always lived at home cared for by his parents, could have lived independently with support but the only place for him was a nursing home.   He went into a nursing home where he lives with people who are much older than him and who are not like him.  It is not his family home anymore and he is surrounded by people who are dying.  It is an entirely inappropriate situation for him and is, in many ways, inhuman to do that to someone.  It is, however, not that unusual.  This is why Rehab is looking at the potential to develop respite places.  I do not mean respite for four or five years, I mean respite for a short period of time and how it could actually be provided as part of the services we make available.</p></speech>

We have heard how there are efforts to remove people from congregated settings who have spent all their lives in them yet we have the same organisation, the HSE, being comfortable with allowing people go in to residential facilities who had never been in them and who possibly do not need to be in them.</p></speech>

When we consider, on the one hand, the individual who has a disability as having equal rights as a citizen and on the other hand we consider carers' needs they are two separate issues.  I am not sure that the same service provider can meet the needs correctly.  It is almost a divided loyalty in some ways.  One is either trying to support the individual who has a disability and separately to support the carers who have needs.  These two aspects need to be kept very separate for the purposes of clarity.</p></speech>

My brief within Leinster House is on mental health, about which I am very passionate.  I worry about one or two things but first I congratulate the witnesses on their honesty and frankness.  We need to know these things so we can react.  It aggrieves me why disability issues always have to come under the HSE and Senator Dolan touched on this.  These people are not sick people and the matter is about equality.  This is my beef, regardless of who is in power.  Governments have a responsibility to treat everybody equally and they do not.  In my own experience in the mental health side of things people who are labelled, for example, as disabled, should never be labelled in that way.  It stigmatises them straight away and puts them under pressure.  When a person is not getting equality it is bound to affect his or her mental health.  I shall give the committee a perfect, simple example of this.  Some years ago in my town we repaired and put down some new footpaths.  We did our research beforehand.  We had not realised the difficulties until we received a submission from a wheelchair user, who was related to me, and he gave his rendition of how difficult it was for him to go from one side of the town to the other and to do simple things like crossing the road to the post office.  When we got the information back it was amazing.  The project went on to win a mobility award.  My point is that the honesty of the witnesses does not go unheard; we do take things back.  I have learned so much just from listening to the representatives today.  I must congratulate them, but my biggest gripe - and my own personal view - is that the HSE should have nothing to do with disability services.  There is a convention on human rights for people with disabilities and there are other laws that should be implemented.  I wish the representatives the very best of luck.  I shall return and do my homework to see what I can do in order to be of benefit to them.  I congratulate them on their work.</p></speech>

I did not get them all but I got 50%, which is a reasonable enough innings in this business.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations, the combination of which is an all-round addressing of the issues affecting people who have special needs and who have a disability.  I thank the witnesses for their work in the field over the years.</p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland's name speaks for itself.  Inclusion is a very important word in the context of people who have a disability, whatever the disability may be.  It is always of great benefit to them to feel they are being included as opposed to feeling another response.  Notwithstanding the difficulties the State had to face over the past eight years, it was a really awful problem.  There were no resources, no matter where one came from.  At every corner there was somebody tugging at resources that had diminished and gone down the drain.  It was an appalling situation and all credit is due to the organisations that cover disability, voluntary and statutory, for managing to come through that awful period.  They were not unscathed but they survived it and that is important.</p> <p>  My colleague raised the question about young people in nursing homes.  This continues to be the case and I do not know why.  Some of us have concerns around decongregation.  We know from previous experience that decongregation works well, in theory, as long as one has an alternative place and there are sufficient resources for the location to meet the developmental needs of the people going there.  Those developmental needs vary considerable, depending on the age of the people and their abilities to fend for themselves to become self-sufficient.</p><p>I have always held the view that any person, whether he or she is able-bodied or has a disability, has a contribution to make to the economic and social well-being of the community.  People do this by being provided with the facilities to use their own resources in terms of participation and involvement.  I strongly support the concept of enabling people to participate.  All the groups here have done that all along.  Maximising the potential of the individual to the best of his or her ability is the simple, short answer.  As long as it remains the objective, it will succeed.</p><p> I am a little concerned about decongregation.  Different people may have various reasons for supporting it.  What this committee has expressed concerns about in the past is the fact that organisations appear to be distancing themselves from participation in the provision of accommodation in congregated settings.  A number of them appear to be that way inclined.  I do not want to go too much into detail lest I set off a scare but, as the Chairman knows, we have addressed the issue previously.  There is some evidence to suggest that the removal of some service providers will leave a void that cannot be filled in its entirety in the normal course of events through the provision of alternatives.  I am still concerned about it.  Decongregation took place many years ago in the bigger mental hospitals and it did not work to the extent we thought it would because some people, who had been institutionalised over a long number of years, found it difficult to adapt to the new settings.  The necessary supports to enable them to adapt to those settings were not in place.  It is the same as discharging from hospital a person who was injured as a result of an accident or who had a mental breakdown before he or she is ready to go back into the community and cater for himself or herself again.  I would like to be reassured on that point.  I am not so happy about what happened in the 1980s when people were displaced from the mental institutions.  We agreed that those institutions were not suitable places; they were appalling.  There were young kids in similar situations along with much older people.  They were appalling places.  When we set out to improve their situation and their conditions, we need to do it in a methodical way that is fully supportive and takes account of all the possibilities that may arise in the event of that change taking place.  Concerns have been expressed in the House by many people from all over the country.  It is not the concept of decongregation we are concerned about but its effect on the individual.</p></speech>

I could talk about it all day but the committee does not have all day.  I managed the national project on moving on from congregated settings.  I am the author of the report.  I have a fair level of knowledge.  It is clearly a burning issue for a number of Members of the House, not only those on the committee.  If the committee wants me to come back at some point in that capacity, I would be happy to do that.  I am now chairing the task force and I will come back to a comment that was made on it.  If one takes personalised budgets as an example and goes looking at the data and the evidence, there are examples but we do not have what I would call a robust body of empirical data and evidence.  We have lots of examples of successes and it is definitely something that should be and will be available to people.  That is in contrast to the congregated settings report which contains four decades of data and evidence of different things people have tried.  I am not giving my opinion here.  The evidence is when it is done properly, the effect on quality of life of moving people into community-based services, in keeping with Article 19 of the Convention, is much better on every measure.  The measure of success of our efforts to decongregate our institutions should not be how many people left and went through the gates; it should be the level of community connectedness of the individuals after they have moved into the community.  We should ask what their quality of life is.  We have to get it down to the impact on individuals.  We have lots of success stories of people who have moved in recent years and who have transformed their lives because it was done well.  My colleague alluded to one of them.  Having been involved in it, people talk to me about examples where it has not been done well and families were not fully involved.  If one reads the report, a lot of time and effort was taken to give guidance on how to do it well.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  With regard to personalised budgets, there was a comment made to the effect that the HSE will never give up control.  My response to that is this is not a HSE committee.  It is not a HSE task force.  There are, from memory, two people out of 50 involved.  It is a commitment in the programme of this Government.  We have been given a task, which we will deliver on.  The Government will decide whether to implement the recommendations of the task force.  The job of the HSE, the last time I checked, was to execute the policy Government signs off on.  I have spoken directly to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I have spoken a lot to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I assure the committee that there is an absolute commitment on the part of both to get this done and to do it well.  The one thing they keep stressing is that there should be more choice and more control for people with disabilities.  We need to do that.</p> <p>  I agree with what has been said on the issue of carers.  As we are a provider, my staff often ask who our primary customer is.  Is it the adult with an intellectual disability?  With the passing of the capacity legislation, it will become a bigger issue for providers.  One of the issues is if mom - it is often mom, but it can be mom or dad - is sitting there saying "I do not want this to happen," but a 25 year old or 30 year old man or woman is saying "This is my life and I want you to support me to do this."  We have those challenges today and they will be accentuated in many ways when the capacity legislation is commenced.</p> <p>  I will link the nursing home issue back to congregated settings.  I am working from memory but I think we have a recommendation in the report, which was published in 2011, that the issue should be looked at.  When I started doing the work, I met the Health Research Board, HRB, to look at where the congregated settings were and who was within scope.  The project was to look at people with intellectual and physical disabilities.  Of the 4,200 people, only about 300 had physical disabilities.  When I looked at the list in the HRB, I was quite shocked because there were one or two people in nursing homes the length and breadth of the country who were young and had particular conditions.  They were there because there was nowhere else and not because it is where they should be or what they needed.  It is an indictment of all of us.  It was 2008 when we started the work.  Almost ten years later it is still an issue that needs to be addressed.  It is one that has been around for an awful long time and something needs to be done about it.  Perhaps it is something the committee could address.</p></speech>

On the decongregation issue, I hear exactly what the Deputy is saying.  It is not new.  As a major provider and an organisation working on decongregation every day of the week, we hear what the Deputy is saying.  I reiterate what has already been said.  What is success?  Success is for the person.  It is where the person is happy, fully expressed in their life and fully part of the community.  It cannot be done quickly and it should not be done quickly.  It has to be done with full consultation with everybody involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Lennon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051700002#P00500"><p>I will respond to Deputy Buckley's comment on the impact of making footpaths accessible in his local town and how that improved not just the health but the general quality of life and well-being of some individuals.  If we do not have a real understanding and a paradigm and cultural shift right across Government on these things, it will not work.  When the footpath gets broken and is not repaired by the local authority, it cannot be used.</p><p>If the Garda allows people to park on the footpath, it will not be of any use.  If the State continues to block progress, as was recently done in regard to Robert Sinnott, a blind man, it will not work.  Mr. Sinnott brought a case to the High Court, the judgment in which was delivered at the end of March.  He asked to be allowed vote in secret and without the assistance of a polling officer.  That would be a relatively simple and inexpensive measure to implement.  It is directly referenced in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  The case went on for several years.  Three days before the final hearing in the High Court, the Minister introduced regulations to allow blind people to vote in secret without the assistance of a polling officer.  That was only done where the Minister and the Attorney General, who was a co-defendant, were facing the abyss.</p><p> The same thing is being done if we are saying that we are committed to the UNCRPD but are only looking at issues at the last moment or trying to cut back on commitments in new legislation that would be consistent with the UNCRPD such as the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill which is currently before the Seanad.  A provision in the original Bill that would allow deaf people to access private services, such as those that were earlier discussed, is being ripped out even though it is totally consistent with the provisions of the UNCRPD to enhance the health and well-being of all citizens, including those with disabilities, by allowing them to participate and removing barriers, a step which would ultimately negate the need for a definition of disability and a label of disability.</p></speech>

It is very important to me that he recognised what it takes for someone to come in and talk from a personal point of view.  It is not for the faint-hearted and there are not many people who will do it.  I understand why.  His comment meant a huge amount to me.</p> <p>  When one has lived through some of the issues we are discussing today, it is a different ball game.  Deputy Durkan talked about transition and coming out of institutions.  To add to what Dr. McDaid said, we know that connection, meaning and purpose are safety factors in life.  If we go back to basics - which I find works well for me in life because otherwise I get a little lost but can find my way again - about exclusion, work and education, all Departments have to be involved.  It is not rocket science.  Common sense tends to leave the building from time to time, and I mean all buildings, not just this one.  That is what worked for me and got me back on track.  It took me a long time to get back into the workplace.  That in itself is a whole journey.</p> <p>  I was very struck by what Ms O'Shea said about listening to the voices of different people and about money and recovery.  It was so heartfelt.  We need to drive our own recovery.  We need to remember that, as human beings, we are capable of that and we will choose the supports that we need around us.  </p> <p>  Dr. McDaid mentioned advance directives in discussion with the Chairman.  I feel very passionately about these.  I work every day.  I am very blessed and privileged to work with people who are going through tough times.  There are families, fathers, mothers or brothers or sisters.  I ask people what they feel when they are well.  They know themselves best and therefore I ask them what their triggers in life are and what action plans they can put in place.  Imagine if every one of us, including doctors, nurses, mothers and fathers all had that type of plan.  It would take the burden of taking responsibility for other people off many of us.  I do not want anyone to take responsibility for me.  I will do that and tap into support as needed.  </p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan that the closure of the dreadful psychiatric services was horrific as it gave nobody a pathway to connect back into society.  If a person has meaning and purpose in life he or she has a far better chance of having good mental health, relationships, a job and being able to manage his or her bills.  To tell people simply to leave institutions in which for many years they had been told what to do does not work.  We have the answers.  I mean this in the most respectful way: it is not that complicated.  We need to listen to people who are going through it.</p></speech>

He epitomises all that we have talked about here through the course of his life.  As a young child, he lived in a congregated setting and through his life went through all the transitions and now at 65 years of age has his own tenancy and is living in a community.  He epitomises much of what we are talking about in terms of ratification of the UNCRPD because he is living a very fulfilled life and is very actively involved in his community.  It is worth repeating his story because he is an inspiration for others to follow and is an exemplar of a success story in his lived experience.</p></speech>

It is dangerous but it cannot be an ideology.  He has asked for reassurance.  There is much we can do but we cannot reassure about everything because there is risk to living in the community.  Every one of us experiences risk on a daily basis but there is a huge dignity to that risk.  In some ways, the unpleasant aspects of the community have to be part of a development process for people, albeit we have to remember that there are people who have been in institutional care for 40, 50, 60 years or more to whom we have a huge responsibility.  That is an important point.  We have contributed to their disability and we have to remember our responsibility to them.</p> <p>  The UNCRPD defines an institution as promoting isolation, segregation, lack of control, lack of choice, rigidity, identical activities and being under authority and paternalism.  In terms of risk and reassurance, if that is the alternative, then how bad can the community be?  Statistics show that 150 people moved out in 2015, 27 of whom went to nursing homes.  Some 53% moved in with four or more people and only 9%, or about 14 people, moved into their own accommodation.</p> <p>  Although I do not want to throw the cat among the pigeons and we still have work to do in terms of the 2,600 people still in an institution today, the next conversation we need to have is in the context of group homes and houses where four or five people live with people who they did not necessarily choose to live with or who are not their family.  I mean family in the broadest sense, including people who might want to start a family or have a partner of their own.  The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has defined a smaller group home as an institution if it fits the definition of one.  It is not about how many people reside there.  We spoke about ten people or more for a congregated setting in Ireland but the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is very clear that it does not matter how many people live in the property, rather, if it meets its definition of an institution then that is what it is.  We need to bear in mind that as we move past congregated settings, the use of community group homes will have to come under scrutiny.</p></speech>

One reason we need to review A Vision for Change is that we need to recognise the substantial role that families play in supporting people to live independently in the community and to describe that role and the supports that families need to fulfil that role.  That also means that we need to understand more about the role that local community groups play in supporting people's recovery and value, to quantify that role and make sure that it is specified as clearly as we have specified the numbers of psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists and psychologists that we need.  That is one aspect of it.</p> <p>  The only other thing I want to say about the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is that the biggest difficulty that this country has had is in implementing things.  If the UNCRPD is ratified, the real challenge will be to implement its aspirations and to implement what it means.  That means having clear plans for implementation.  We have had a roadmap to ratification, but we actually need a roadmap for implementation.  We have a starting point.  We were supposed to have an updated implementation plan for the national disability strategy, which is sadly not visible, though many of us have been involved in inputting into what we hope it will look like.  There is an urgent need to publish the implementation plan for the UNCRPD, to resource that implementation plan and have dedicated capacity to drive the implementation of the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

That was about people with disabilities who have their own homes, but because they do not have the supports they need to get out of those houses, they are effectively not able to live the life that they need to and to participate and do all of the things that the convention talks about.  I think the number is important and we deliberated long and hard about putting the number at no more than four.  I always say the strapline for the report is no more than four.  One can argue whether it should be five or three, but we went with no more than four.  I am giving evidence here in the form of empirical data.  The reason for that - going back to the UNCRPD definition of institution - is that when one goes to five, six, seven or eight, the chances of meeting the criteria outlined increase.  The number is very important.  What we say in the report is that we should be looking at all kinds of things, but if there is going to be shared living, people should choose who they live with, as the convention says, but there should never be more than four people in one shared living arrangement.  We should not allow people to cluster housing, for example, to have two four-bedroom houses side-by-side.  There are very good reasons that recommendation is in the report.</p></speech>

I know all the members of the group here are conscious of the case of a person, usually a woman, who cares for a child with particular needs, sometimes quite profound needs, at home with help from respite and occasional residential care.  As life goes on, the burden becomes greater and the fear of what happens afterwards becomes greater as well.  Somebody mentioned to me recently that she has spent half of her life caring - nothing else - and attempting to work at the same time.  There comes a time, if the burden becomes so great, when the person loses heart.  If that person loses heart, then the State has to pick up the entire responsibility.  I want to try to emphasise the need for increased respite or week-long or weekend - whichever is more appropriate - respite care so that the person concerned in dealing with the caring to such an extent that he or she has done can live even half a life independently.  That person may need to do so anyway to earn a living, because there may be other siblings.</p></speech>

It is very much in support of what Deputy Durkan is saying.  It is a new phenomenon.  As we all live longer, the carers are living longer, but many are in crisis situations.  I very much support the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

Our offices have done considerable work on preparing contributions around amendments.  It would be really helpful if we could get this stuff a bit earlier than 8.50 a.m., ten minutes before the meeting.</p></speech>

As Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality, I only had sight of the list of disallowed amendments in the five minutes preceding the commencement of today's meeting.  I echo Deputy Daly's appeal to the Bills Office to ensure that decisions regarding amendments are distributed as early as possible.  Perhaps even the grouping list could be made available more speedily so that members would know exactly where amendments relate to each other.  Does the Minister of State wish to comment on this point?</p></speech>

We got notice of it at the same time as members last night so it is done independently by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They make those decisions.  Obviously, if we had received them earlier, it would save us a pile of work as well.  I spent a lot of time last night going through these amendments and preparing discussion points so it would be helpful but, obviously, there is a lot of pressure on people.  I certainly agree that it would be useful if was done a bit earlier but that is the way it is and the way it has been for quite a while.</p></speech>

There is no need for me to convince members of the importance of this Bill and the very real difference the enhancements of the rights of victims contained in this Bill would make to the experience of victims in the criminal justice process.</p><p>Deputies were already aware of this as was evident from the contributions that there was support from all parties in the House when it was introduced.</p><p> We are proposing 29 amendments on Committee Stage, many of which aim to clarify and simplify the Bill's text or correct drafting errors.  Several more substantive amendments address the issues raised by victims' rights groups and other interested bodies.  Many of these address issues also addressed by Opposition amendments.</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring forward several amendments but we are not in a position to do so today.  Several amendments will be required to section 26, addressing amendments to the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  These are mainly technical amendments required to take account of changes made to the Act by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality also intends to introduce amendments on restorative justice on Report Stage.  I will discuss this in more detail when we discuss other amendments on that issue.</p><p> I fully appreciate Deputies want to make this Bill as beneficial and effective as possible.  For my part, I am open to take on board their issues and concerns and work with them to improve the Bill.  I am looking forward to this engagement.  We are all more or less on the same page from the amendments I have seen.</p></speech>

These include the arrest of a person, the charging of a person and the release on bail or remand in custody of a person.  The amendments retain all of these factors.</p><p>Amendment No. 33 also adds an additional factor concerning any bail conditions which relate to the list of significant developments which a victim is entitled to receive.  While it is likely bail conditions will be included in the existing text which provides for information relating to the release of a person or the bail of a person, the amendment will make this explicit.</p></speech>

They are to ensure that when restorative justice is provided, it will only take place in circumstances where safeguards are respected.</p><p>The reasons given for the absence of restorative justice in the Bill were that the services are not available nationwide and there is no statutory basis for the services.  I do not think either of these reasons is good enough to leave it out of this legislation.  Restorative justice is an incredibly valuable process for both the victim and for the perpetrator.  Obviously, the victim is given a chance to confront somebody who has committed a crime which many have found incredibly empowering.  For the perpetrator, it can be a first step in understanding the damage of what they have done.</p><p>Many of the NGOs, non-governmental organisations, in the area have commented on this and have actively argued for its inclusion in the legislation.  Article 4 of the victims' directive already states that victims must be informed on first contact with the Garda of the available restorative justice services.  Article 12 provides that member states shall take measures to safeguard the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, from intimidation and from retaliation when providing any restorative justice services.</p><p>That is what is in the grouping of amendments.  I will not read it.  The Deputy and the Minister of State have read it.  There are a number of safeguards.  I gave an example on Second Stage where a judge recommended restorative justice in wholly inappropriate circumstances where a victim of child sex abuse was asked by a judge if she wanted to engage in restorative justice with the perpetrator.  The perpetrator had not accepted the facts of the case and had not accepted the guilty verdict, and was not in any place to engage.  Obviously, the person was put on the spot.</p><p> It is important to have the provision, but we need to have safeguards, which is the purpose of this grouping of amendments.</p></speech>

The main purpose of the legislation is to transpose the directive.  The directive has a definition of restorative justice.  That is why the right of access to information on restorative justice and the right to safeguards on the use of restorative justice should be included in the Bill.  I note that a reference to restorative justice was included in the scheme of the Bill and I believe it should be included in the legislation.</p></speech>

I fully agree that such provision is necessary and I assure Deputies that I intend to make provision for the rights of victims who participate in restorative justice practices in the Bill.  I regret that I have not been able to bring forward these amendments today.  As I informed the House on Second Stage, there are legal issues regarding the most appropriate text for the provision, given the non-statutory nature of restorative justice practices available in the State.  I have just recently received preliminary advices from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.</p> <p>  I am happy to inform the committee that a provision, not dissimilar from those proposed in the amendments before us, will be possible.  Ensuring that the specific wording of the provision does not interfere with or prevent the operation of existing restorative justice services is very important, as is protecting the provisions from legal challenge.  I ask Deputies to give me the time to bring forward amendments that will meet these aims.</p> <p>  Legal advice has also suggested that specific provision should be made for the rights of victims engaging in restorative justice practices in the case of child offenders.  The Children Act 2001 provides for a role for victims in the administration of cautions and in family conferences under the juvenile diversion programme.  Deputies will appreciate that care needs to be taken to ensure an appropriate balance between the rights of victims and the rights of child offenders in these circumstances.  Amendments to provide the necessary changes to the Children Act are under consideration, in consultation with the Garda, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Young Person's Probation Service.  I assure Deputies that the necessary amendments will be brought forward during progress of the Bill. </p></speech>

It also clarifies that it is the specific needs identified, and not just the fact that protection needs have been identified, that must be considered.</p><p>Amendment No. 113 inserts a new subsection into section 18, setting out the special measures available to a victim during criminal proceedings.  The purpose of the amendment is to clearly identify what is meant by special measures during criminal proceedings as some of these measures, such as the exclusion of the public and the restriction on the questioning of a victim on his or her private life, are in this Bill and others are in the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  The approach is in keeping with section 16 concerning special measures during investigations.  The new subsection will be numbered subsection (1) which will involve designating the existing section 18, as subsection (2).</p><p>As a consequence, amendment No. 8 amends the definition of &quot;special measure&quot; in section 2, to refer to the measures set out in section 18.</p><p>The amendments do not alter the substance of the section.</p></speech>

It gives the definition contained in recital 19 that a person would be considered a victim regardless of whether an offender is identified, apprehended, prosecuted and so on.  The purpose is to ensure that the services for victims provided for in the Bill would not be dependent on a victim making a formal complaint or an offender being prosecuted or convicted.</p><p>This is particularly important when we consider the Garda Inspectorate reports on sexual violence.  There have been repeated instances of garda&iacute; being called out to a domestic violence situation and things being said such as, &quot;Ah sure, there's two of them in it&quot; or &quot;Don't annoy him.  He won't come back.&quot;  Those comments are wholly inappropriate.  It is like saying, &quot;Move on - nothing to see here&quot;, and then serious assaults being committed after that and great difficulty in the victim making a statement.</p><p>Having this wording in the Bill would place an obligation on garda&iacute; and also give supports to victims.  The Garda Inspectorate reports refer to other unsolved cases of sexual assault where victims were subjected to pressure from garda&iacute; to either make a statement or drop it, in which case they would not be beneficiaries of the Bill even though they are clearly victims.  This is about giving them the support they clearly need and specifying that in a manner as provided for the directive.</p></speech>

There is a concern that unless somebody can prove that an offence was committed against them, they might not qualify within the definition of victim.  That would be very unfair to a person who was on O'Connell Street last night and beaten over the head.  Even if nobody was ever apprehended, that person is as much a victim as somebody who is able to identify the offender.  I am conscious that it should not be opened up to such an extent that nearly everyone is covered by the definition of victim, but we need an amendment to ensure it is not simply limited to the conviction of an individual of an offence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#D00100"><p>I thank the Deputies for tabling the amendment.  I understand what the Deputies are seeking to achieve but I do not believe that the amendment is either necessary or represents an effective manner of achieving the desired end.  I will explain why.</p><p>In the first instance, it is necessary to state clearly the<i>de facto</i>position in the Bill.  There is nothing in the definition of &quot;victim&quot; to suggest in any way that an offender might have to be identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted for a person to be a victim for the purposes of the Bill.  In fact, it is clear that in many circumstances, for example, at first contact before a complaint has even been made, it would be impossible for an offender to have been apprehended or prosecuted.  Moreover, there is no suggestion that the relationship between the victim and the offender could have any bearing on whether a person is a victim.</p><p>Why put it in?  Is it to be sure?  There are two reasons.  The first is that a single definition of &quot;victim&quot; is used throughout the Bill for clarity and consistency.  As such, that definition must be appropriate to all the provisions where the word is used.  Many provisions in the Bill specifically require that certain conditions, which are excluded in the amendment, are met.  For a victim to receive information on the charging, remand or trial of an accused, it is necessary for an offender to be identified and prosecuted.  For a victim to receive information from the Prison Service, it is necessary for an offender to have been convicted of an offence.  For a garda to conduct an assessment and take into account the particular vulnerability of a victim of violence in a close relationship, he or she must have regard to the relationship between the victim and the offender.</p><p>The intention seems to be to amend the definition of &quot;victim&quot; to apply it regardless of all these factors.  In the case of many provisions throughout the Bill that would create contradictions in its application.</p><p>There is a benefit to maintaining the definition exactly as it is in the directive to ensure any future judgment of the European Court of Justice will directly apply to our national legislation.  The definition in the Bill has been drafted to ensure that any person who has suffered any harm as a result of a criminal offence is a victim and is, therefore, entitled to avail of rights under the Bill.</p><p>For the information of Deputy O'Callaghan, the Government amendment to section 4 will address to some extent the general concerns raised.  That amendment is broader in nature and will ensure that a victim need only assert that he or she has been a victim of an offence and suffered harm.  No proof is required.  It is all on the side of the victim in this case.  A victim need only say that he or she is a victim.  That is covered in section 4.</p></speech>

Previously, we included this definition in the general scheme of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill.  It was recommended by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that the definition, as we have amended it, should be included to clarify the situation.</p> <p>  I understand the point made by the Minister of State to the effect that there has to be parity of access to information.  However, if the perpetrator has not been prosecuted, then there is no court case to which the relevant person would be entitled to information.  Therefore, it does not really matter that we specify it.  Clearly, the information in question does not exist, so no one would be required to give it to the person in question.  Given that the organisation is the Government's human rights watchdog, I tend to favour keeping it.  I do not see it as being messy.  It is present in recital 19 to the victims directive.  It has been included previously.  The IHREC has recommended that it should be included.</p></speech>

We are all seeking the same objective.  My concerns relates to the definition.  It is rather narrow.  I am unsure whether the Minister of State is prepared to look at it before Report Stage.

One people say they are victims, then they are victims under the legislation.  It is a consistent definition used throughout the Bill.</p><p>It is in the recital of the directive rather than the main text for the reasons stated.  In fact, the definition in the Bill is wide; it is not narrow at all.  It does not need to be qualified in any way because it already encompasses what the Deputies have said.  It is already there.  I would be concerned that the amendment would have the effect of narrowing down the definition rather than widening it.  There is no need for it.  We can look at it again on Report Stage, if necessary.  We can reflect on it again.</p></speech>

It is on page 8.  By qualifying the definition we run the risk that an interpretation could be made at a later stage that is in conflict with the section.  We would be narrowing it.  The purpose of the amendment is to broaden the definition or ensure that the definition is as broad as possible.  I would have thought that we would achieve the opposite by inserting qualifications.  At a certain point, they could be used to narrow the definition.  If the Minister of State is willing to look at it again, that is grand.  I would caution on that point.</p></speech>

Part of the problem is that some of the organisations we have referenced have highlighted the point in respect of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being called out to an incident and not treating it as an offence.  The concern or follow-on is that they might not understand the obligation in terms of giving the information, support and protection that we are providing in the Bill.  They may take the view that only two people are involved and that, therefore, it is not an offence.  However, specifying it might get over that problem.  Anyway, if the Minister of State is looking at it for Report Stage, we can reconsider it then.</p></speech>

There is no problem there.  Obviously, we will take on board anything Deputies have to say with respect to revisiting or going back to this on Report Stage.</p> <p>  I am keen to make this point.  All a victim has to do is to say: "I am a victim of an offence and I have suffered harm."  Once a person says that, then the supports have to kick in.  That is the thrust, genesis or essence of the Bill.  A "victim" means a person who has suffered harm.  Once a person says that he or she has suffered harm, then the supports kick in.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 10 clarifies the point.  The idea is to have consistency throughout.  It is already in the Bill.  It is implied and embedded.  We do not need to expand or qualify it in any way.  Certainly, Chairman, we will examine it on Report Stage.  If it helps, we will certainly examine it again and come back to it.</p></speech>

We have to put it on record.  We are being prevented from broadening the protection that is in place for victims of crime where other State agencies or statutory organisations are involved.  We were trying to do precisely that with this group of amendments and the definition of the competent or investigating authority.  That has been ruled out of order because of costs.</p><p>I appeal to the Government to look at that prior to Report Stage.  It was strongly suggested by the Victims Rights Alliance that, in the context of other entities such as the Health and Safety Authority, it might bring us much closer to implementing the victims directive, which is what we are supposed to do, and have a positive effect on victims in cases where crimes are being investigated by other statutory bodies like Tusla.</p><p> The term "competent authority", which is used in the directive, is broader in meaning than that of "law enforcement authority".  That is what we are seeking to do.  It was not supposed to be just confined to law enforcement authorities, it was supposed to be broader.  We are looking for any statutory authority which has the power to investigate and prosecute criminal offences to fall within the definition of a "competent authority" if it deals with victims who are people - natural persons and so on.  I think it would be very positive.  Not including those organisations prevents victims from accessing information from those organisations in a more timely and appropriate manner.  I am making an appeal to the effect that the Government might include it in light of the fact that we are prevented from doing so.</p></speech>

The amendment says that.  The Minister of State is right.  That is what it is but organisations like HIQA and the Health and Safety Authority have those powers.  There are probably not loads of cases, although there might be.  There are plenty of cases where the victim is a person.  They are out there.  It would bring us much more in line with the directive were we to broaden the definition because it is broader in the directive.  The European Commission justice guidelines talk about how the term "competent authority" is broader than that of "law enforcement authority".  Those guidelines refer to how the competent authorities acting in the criminal proceedings under the directive are determined by national law.  The guidelines say that this does not exclude, for example, customs or border agencies if they have the status of law enforcement authorities.  There are a number of agencies that have power in criminal cases and they should be included.</p></speech>

The amendment removes the general limitation on the application of the Act in respect of criminal proceedings that are instituted before the commencement of the Act.  I am satisfied that the very few provisions in the Bill which if applied to existing criminal proceedings could potentially compromise those proceedings are adequately safeguarded by an interests of justice test within those proceedings.  The second change is the inclusion of a new subsection (2), which provides that it will not be necessary to prove that an offence was committed or that harm was suffered in order for the legislation to apply.  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that it is sufficient for a victim to assert that he or she has been the victim of an offence and has suffered harm to avail of the rights provided and no proof will be necessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 139 amends section 26 to assert the same proviso into the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 to ensure that a prosecutor will not have to prove any elements of the offence or the harm suffered as part of an application for special measures on behalf of a victim.  Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 are consequential amendments required to amend the shoulder note and numbering in section 26.</p></speech>

The directive came into effect in Ireland in 2015, even though we have not enacted the legislation to give effect to it.  While it should not be retrospective, limiting the rights of victims so that it only applies to criminal proceedings initiated after the Bill comes into force means that victims who are currently in the criminal justice system will be prevented from exercising their rights.  In that sense, it probably creates a two-tier system of criminal justice and could be in breach of the victims directive given that the latter applies to all victims, not just those whose cases were initiated after a certain date.  It would be a bit unfair that some victims would have access to supports that would minimise the risk of secondary victimisation, including testimony aids, victim impact statements and special protection measures, but others would not.  I seek to remove the section to ensure that a two-tier system does not exist.</p> <p>  In terms of people looking for information and the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan about historical cases and information from the DPP as to why a decision was taken not to proceed with a criminal prosecution, there are people out there whose lives have been ruined by unanswered questions as to why a prosecution did not take place.  Some people carry this burden for a very long time.  I would have no problem with them getting that information and the DPP providing it.  There should be transparency.</p><p>The lack of transparency in the DPP's office is something that people find difficult to take.  It has revictimised many people who have not received answers about horrendous crimes committed against family members, including death.</p></speech>

She is opposed to section 4 in its entirety, but many of her objections will be met by my amendment.  The Deputy also opposes the provision that limits the Bill's application as regards information on a decision to end an investigation, not to bring a prosecution or to deal with a person other than by a trial.  From a practical perspective, to make all historical criminal investigations subject to the provisions of this Bill would be administratively and operationally impossible.  In many cases, the relevant information would not be available or maintained in a manner that would meet the requirements of the Bill, as it would never have been envisaged at the time of the investigation.  Reviews of historical decisions not to proceed with prosecutions would also generally be pointless and reversing such decisions would not be possible.  That is not the intention of the EU directive anyway and would be an ineffective use of the valuable resources of the Garda and DPP in particular.  I hope that the Deputy will be satisfied that the revised section 4 meets many of the concerns that she has voiced.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 14 is simple and was proposed on the advice of Rape Crisis Network Ireland to provide more detail of the kinds of support that victims should be informed of on first contact with the authorities for the avoidance of doubt.  The Minister of State will surely say that garda&iacute; would specify medical supports, appropriate specialist services, psychological supports and alternative accommodation, and maybe they would, but maybe they would not.  Some garda&iacute; might not consider alternative accommodation to be a necessary support.  Some might not be aware of the full benefit of, for example, recommending to someone counselling services and other psychological supports.  I see no harm in including this provision.  The organisations at the coalface believe that it would be an addition.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 28 has been ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 30 concerns referrals to appropriate support services.  The rationale for this is that section 6(8) provides that a "member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission... may, where a victim consents, arrange for the victim to be referred to a service" whereas the victims directive refers to "shall".  The directive also refers to victims having access to confidential victim support services and so on in accordance with their needs.  The amendment's reference to "an appropriate and/or specialist service" is an attempt to bring us into line with the victims directive such that garda&iacute; shall arrange a referral to services.  This is about tightening up definitions.</p></speech>

As they stated, this group contains a number of objectives on the provision of victim support services.  I will go through each amendment in turn.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 elaborate on what support services are to be included in the term "services" by including some types of service but not others.  This might be ill advised.  The term "services providing support for victims" is well enough understood in practice in the criminal justice system and among garda&iacute; in particular not to require further elaboration.  It also has the benefit of being broad enough to encompass new types of service that may emerge in future.  To define in law what is envisaged by these services could also lead to one or more specialist services falling outside the definition, with potential challenges to their future funding as victim services.</p> <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality funds 58 services for victims of crime.  Among the services provided are information, emotional support, referral to other services, counselling, accompaniment to courts, Garda stations and sexual assault treatment units.</p><p>Tusla also provides funding to a wide range of domestic violence services, domestic violence refuges and sexual violence services.  Domestic violence victims can be referred on to housing authorities in appropriate circumstances.  Services are provided to victims of general crime, families of homicide victims, tourist victims, child victims, victims of domestic and sexual violence, adult victims of childhood sexual abuse and victims of abuse in medical settings.  Services are provided by phone and text, face to face, one to one and in groups.  It is also to be anticipated in the future that some services using online methods will be developed.</p><p> I am of the view that there is a real risk, in specifying a few particular services from among the wide range of victim supports available, that we are creating a hierarchy of services which may impact the services which are prioritised for inclusion in information material and advice and, indeed, in funding.</p><p> The EU directive requires member states to facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services.  This is implemented in the current legislation in section 6(1)(a), by requiring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Garda Ombudsman Commission, on first contact with a victim, to offer every victim information on services providing support for victims of crime.</p><p> The purpose of section 6(8) is to enable a victim, with their consent, to be referred to a victim support service.  This will happen regularly and at all times of the day or night, for example where a victim who has been recently raped is in contact with police.  In that case, the police will usually bring the victim to a sexual assault treatment unit.  In that unit, medical staff will care medically for the victim and may take forensic evidence, which will be given to the Garda.  The Garda will offer to phone a rape crisis centre on behalf of the victim, with the victim's consent, and to have a volunteer meet the victim at the medical unit to provide emotional and practical support.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 require referrals to appropriate or specialist services.  As I have already outlined, in circumstances where a victim is directly referred to a support service, that referral is to the specific specialist service, such as the sexual assault treatment unit or rape crisis services the victim requires. </p></speech>

He is suggesting that by specifying medical support, appropriate specialist services, including psychological support services and alternative accommodation, we could be leaving out other services.  However, that is not the intention and nor would it be the outcome of the amendment.  It refers to "services providing for victims, including where relevant" so it does not exclude any other service.  It states that we need to include, where relevant, the medical support and appropriate specialist services, including psychological support.  The wording in Article 4.1(a) of the directive is, "where relevant, basic information about access to medical support, any specialist support, including psychological support and alternative accommodation".  The wording of the amendment comes from the wording of the directive itself.  The amendment does not exclude any other supports that could be available to the victim.</p></speech>

This amendment is necessary precisely because those at the coalface are not referring people to, or making them aware of, some of the services that exist.  If we are serious about consultation we have to deal with the viewpoints of people who deal with victims on a daily basis, particularly the most vulnerable victims of sexual violence.  Their experience suggests that this amendment should be included.  Our amendment to change "may" to "shall" has been ruled out of order.  Only the Minister can do that but the directive is very clear on the matter.  It states that member states shall ensure that victims, in accordance with their needs, have access to these types of support services.  The word "shall" has to be there, even if we cannot put it in.  The fact that we mention some supports does not mean others are excluded and appropriate specialist services are incredibly important, because this puts the onus back on garda&iacute;.  It would be inappropriate to refer a victim of domestic violence to a psychotherapist or to refuse to refer somebody but the Act, as currently constructed, could allow for both of these.  It leaves a gap and we should close that gap.  We should take the advice of those who work with the most vulnerable victims in this area</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Daly that by including the reference to appropriate specialist services, we are actually following the letter of the directive.  I do not think it is a huge request to include that provision as we are not excluding any services that may be provided.  We are recognising that, in certain cases, specialist services may be needed.</p></speech>

The classic problem for people in these vulnerable scenarios is that they do not get the level of services across the multifaceted arrangement that exists.  Typically, the problem is that they have no legislative framework to support their needs.  An argument can always be made that prescribing certain services excludes the others but we could amend it to include "other services as appropriate".  If we exclude what I believe is a reasoned amendment it will not give full effect to what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

The garda&iacute; are not, in the main, qualified to identify a specialist medical service.  I would imagine a victim would go to a GP who would make the decision.  I cannot accept asking a garda of any rank, who does not have medical qualifications, to identify a specialist to whom the victim of an offence should go.  Garda&iacute; are not qualified to do that but they can refer a victim to a GP, who would be qualified to decide.  The interpretation of something in legislation is very important and I am concerned about asking a garda to identify a medical specialist, that is, a consultant in a particular field.</p></speech>

It is often provided in booklet form.  It would be very difficult to provide all of the detailed information encompassed by the amendment in booklet form.  Where a victim has first contact with the Garda or the Ombudsman Commission, he or she should offered information relating services providing support for victims, the procedure of making a complaint, circumstances where any inquiries by a victim relating to a complaint which he or she has made may be addressed and so on.   The phrase "services providing support for victims" is broad enough to cover one's GP, one's hospital or whatever else is required.  However, if specialist services are mentioned, a different level of information would be required.  I urge caution on that point.</p></speech>

The amendment does not say that.  It includes, for example, services providing alternative accommodation.  Article 8(2) of the victims directive says that we shall facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services.  The implication of the word "shall" in that section of the directive has not yet been discussed here.  Leaving that aside, an example of first contact with an appropriate specialist service could be a women's refuge in a case of domestic violence.  Psychological support could include having contact details for local counsellors who deal with trauma, rape, sexual violence, assault and so on.  That is a specialist service and it would not be needed by every victim.  It is not just about medical specialist services, it is about appropriate specialist services.  Article 8(1) of the directive states that member states shall ensure victims, in accordance with their needs and the level of harm, have access to confidential victim support services.  The wording of the directive is tailored to take account of degrees of need and suggests the types involved.  This is required in order to provide guidance to the Garda because, sadly, people who go to it now do not always feel that they receive enough support in those areas.  The amendment aims to clear that up.  The Minister of State is over-complicating the matter.  This amendment can reasonably be accommodated .  It is appropriate that, in light of their experience currently, victims would be facilitated in getting that support on first contact.</p></speech>

We cannot do that sufficiently unless we take our lead from the directive.  Section 4(1)(a) of the directive details the type of support victims should be informed of on first contact and mentions "where relevant, basic information about access to medical support, any specialist support, including psychological support, and alternative accommodation".  If we are serious about transposing the directive into law then we need to look to the wording of the directive.</p></speech>

However, the amendment could be kept as it stands if the words &quot;in consultation with&quot; were added and if it read:</p><blockquote>... shall offer the victim information relating to the following:<br /><br />(a) services providing supports for victims, including, where relevant ...</blockquote> <p>A GP could be consulted by the Garda in that regard.  Failure to accept the amendment would undermine potential services.  It is important that we provide it in a legislative form because &quot;services providing support for victims&quot; is too general a phrase.  People in the scenario under discussion often fall victim to very general items of legislation which prevent them from taking action.  If the Minister of State's concern is that some garda&iacute; are not qualified to make assessments of need, the amendment could be changed further to provide for a qualified person to triage the victim and assess what relevant services are needed.  However, the Minister of State's concern is not an argument for undermining the amendment that has been put forward.</p></speech>

Section 6(8) provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, shall, where the victim consents, arrange for the victim to be referred to a service which provides support for victims.  That is a different provision.  This discussion concerns giving information.  I do not want to divide the committee on this issue if it can be avoided so I am prepared to re-examine the matter and also to take on board what Deputy Jack Chambers said.  I do not want to put an unworkable provision in place but I appreciate what Deputies have said.  We can re-examine it on Report Stage, if that will satisfy Deputies, at which point we can attempt to phrase it in such a way that it will not be impossible to operate.  I am willing to discuss the matter and, if possible, bring forward a solution on Report Stage.</p></speech>

That is compounding a pain and hurt that is already inflicted.  The earliest possible first responders here, that is, garda&iacute;, are in a position to set in train the particular supports necessary and to which others would respond.  The earliest possible response is the preferred one by far.  Relevant cases came to mind while I listened to Deputies articulate their positions, with which I can easily empathise.  Do Deputies Clare Daly or Jonathan O'Brien wish to respond to the Minister of State?</p></speech>

However, in the spirit of new politics, the Minister of State should take on board Deputy Clare Daly's amendment as it is worded and then if he wishes to change it on Report Stage and consider it further, he can do so.  All members would be open to further amendments.  It is important to do that.  It would send a message that we recognise that, on first contact, victims may , as a result of the crime committed against them, be affected in ways for which they need services that would not be sufficiently covered by the phrase "services providing support for victims".  It does not tally with what the directive is trying to achieve.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board Deputy Clare Daly's amendment and if he then wishes to consider the matter further before Report Stage, we will all be willing to do that.  The Bill must also go to the Seanad.</p></speech>

It is not my amendment, it was suggested by Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  It aims to cater for particularly traumatised victims who are probably the first people that will hopefully benefit from this legislation if we get it right.  I accept that the Minister of State will consider the matter before Report Stage.  If, however, we were to pass the amendment now, the onus would really be on him to change it on Report Stage if he so wished.  The amendment is better in its current format.  Can we not just keep it?  The level of engagement by NGOs and so on in respect of this Bill has been immense.  Although, in the context of new politics, agreeing to nothing is not good either.  We could agree it now and then if the Minister of State or his officials need to change it on Report Stage, we will not stand in the way of it by demanding that that wording be retained.  I will press the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

Article 3(2) of the directive states "Member States shall ensure that communications with victims are given in simple and accessible language, orally or in writing."  We have to take people's individual circumstances into account.  In the case of somebody with limited reading ability, for example, written documentation will not be of any use.  Conversely, a deaf person may like to receive information in writing rather than receiving it orally.  My amendment provides for choice being given to the victim as to the format in which he or she receives information. </p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 22 provides that the investigating authority should have regard to the level of understanding of the victim, but the decision is the authority's.  I have put it the other way around.  I am not sure the Garda should be the deciding party as it might not be able to adequately assess the comprehension of the victim.  As a garda might simply think the victim probably is able to read it or whatever, the choice should be given to the victim.</p></speech>

As the other speakers have said, the intention is to tailor the information towards what the victim can understand and how he or she can properly access it.  Deputy Daly's point is well made.  At the very least, there needs to be mutual agreement as to the format of the communication rather than an assumption that could undermine the victim's ability to receive information.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I am of the view that the phrase "as soon as practicable" imposes exactly the same obligations on the authorities as the phrase "without unnecessary delay".  The phrase "as soon as practicable" is preferred in the Bill as it frequently occurs in the Statute Book anyway in similar contexts, whereas "without unnecessary delay" is not to my knowledge used in the Statute Book in comparable circumstances at all.  We should stick to what has been tried and tested over the decades.</p> <p>  I understand the rationale behind amendment No. 21 and agree in principle that the means of providing the information should be chosen by the victim.  However, there may be practical obstacles to its implementation.  At first contact, information is most likely to be provided through a specially designed victims information booklet and it may not be feasible for all of the detailed information contained in that booklet to be given orally.  Another example would be if the booklet was not available in the desired language at the time and place of first contact, in which case providing an electronic copy might be the only option.</p><p>I am happy to consider the matter and to consult with the relevant agencies to see if a suitable amendment can be included to ensure the victim's preference is followed unless it is not possible to do so.  There is something in it, so let us have a look at that one again and see where we are with it.</p><p> On amendment No. 22, that issue is already provided for in section 21 of the Bill.  Section 21 explicitly requires all bodies with obligations under this Bill to ensure that all communications with victims are in simple and accessible language and take into account the personal characteristics of the victim, including any disability which may affect his or her ability to understand or be understood.  That is already covered in section 21 of the Bill.  </p></speech>

If we are saying that we are working to try to give the victim the choice, then we need to do that work.  I am slightly concerned that the Minister of State said the information would be given if possible.  There should not be a situation where the information is not available in an accessible format.  I am trying to envisage a scenario whereby that information would not be available.  It would be pretty serious if we could not give a choice of the type of information, for example, a choice between information being given orally or in writing.  I do not have a particular problem with providing information by electronic means if the person has a computer.  If the Minister of State will look at it again to try to reinforce the choice element we will withdraw the amendment in today's spirit of goodwill, but it is a key point so I am little bit worried about why the information would not be there.</p></speech>

It was in the hope that the Minister of State would look at this amendment.  It is important that if one looks at section 6(4) which states: &quot;a victim may be accompanied by a person or persons of his or her choice, including his or her legal representative, when contacting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Ombudsman Commission for the first time in respect of an alleged offence&quot; one then goes forward to section 6(5) which states: &quot;Where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, reasonably believes that the presence of a person referred to in subsection (4), including a legal representative, would be contrary to the best interests of the victim or would prejudice any investigation or criminal proceedings regarding the alleged offence, the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, may require that the person absent himself or herself prior to the member or officer concerned engaging further with the victim.&quot;  </p><p>We ask the Minister of State to include the additional section proposed by our amendment which states that where that does happen, and where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Ombudsman Commission makes a request as referred to in section 6(5), that a victim would be given reasonable opportunity to make alternative arrangements for somebody to accompany him or her, where the substitution of the individual by another suitable person would answer the concerns of the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the commission.  That is important because if somebody goes to make a complaint and, for whatever reason, the garda or the officer of the commission decides that an accompanying person should absent himself or herself in the best interests of the victim, the victim should be given an opportunity to seek somebody else to accompany him or her in making that complaint.  </p><p>We wish to include this section to make it very clear that if that does happen the victim would be given reasonable opportunity to make such an alternative arrangement.  That follows through to amendments Nos. 64 and 75.  It follows through the sections of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.772" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#K01000"><p>We are all trying to achieve the same thing in the three different groups of amendments.  Perhaps we are doing so in slightly different ways and we may have to throw everything into the pot to come up with a compromise by Report Stage.  I am not sure.  In terms of amendment No. 24 and the alternative support person, Articles 3(3) and 20(c) of the directive provide that the victim may be accompanied by a person of their choice on first contact, including legal representation, but that the garda or the Ombudsman Commission can object if they believe it is not in the victim's best interest or if it would prejudice an investigation.  If we are talking about circumstances where a victim's support person can be asked to leave, that could potentially leave the victim in a very vulnerable situation.  I am trying to give the victim the opportunity to choose the alternative in those circumstances.  The guidelines produced by the Directorate-Generale Justice on this directive state on page 42:</p><blockquote>Only in exceptional circumstances should the possibility to be accompanied by a person of the victim&rsquo;s choice be limited, and then only in relation to a specific person. If this happens, the victim should be able to choose another person.</blockquote> <p>It would be really bizarre for us to make legislative provisions for a support person or a solicitor on point of first contact, but then to leave a hole for that right to be taken away without an appeal.  I know Deputies O'Brien and O'Callaghan are trying to do the same thing.  With regard to Deputy O'Brien's amendment I am a little bit concerned that, based on the wording, it might be left open to the garda&iacute; to refuse the second person.  Perhaps it is not.  If we are talking about the garda&iacute; substituting a second person that could then be refused, the garda&iacute; might then continue like that so that the victim never gets an appropriate alternative person.  I wonder about that.</p><p>Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment explicitly states that the victim shall be given &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; to choose someone else if an investigator deems their first choice unsuitable.  Again, I am not sure.  I think our amendment is probably better on this issue.  We are all obviously trying to do the same thing.</p><p>Amendment No. 65 leaves no latitude in the legislation to allow the garda&iacute; to get someone to leave a room, or to leave a victim alone at any time, without the option of a replacement or an appeal.  That would be completely inappropriate as far as I am concerned.  Amendment No. 76 gives the victim the choice of an alternative person at the stage of interview and medical examination if the garda&iacute; rejected their first choice, which is not specified by the other amendments.  The rationale for that is really the same as that for the other two amendments.</p></speech>

We are all trying to achieve the same thing.  It will be interesting to see what the Minister of State has to say and to see how all three amendments can, perhaps, be put together to achieve the best outcome.  These amendments are proposed to give people that full support and a right to accompaniment at that acute stage.  It is for us all to come together on how to best legislate for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.774" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#K01200"><p>Again, I thank the Deputies for the amendments and the work and thought they have put into them.  These amendments aim to ensure that where a victim is accompanied either at first contact, when making a complaint or during an interview, and the Garda or officer of Ombudsman Commission excludes an accompanying person, that the victim is given the opportunity to arrange for an alternative person to accompany him or her.</p><p>I appreciate what the Deputies are aiming to achieve, but I do not see how these changes are necessary.  The amendments do not appear to appreciate that, in each instance, the victim is present of his or her own volition and the Garda or officer has no power to compel the victim to stay or continue with the contact, complaint or interview.  The victim is present in a voluntary capacity to get help and is not being charged with anything.  The victim is at all times free to come or go and make such arrangements as he or she wishes in respect of an alternative accompanying person.  If a victim wants someone else to come in, there is no difficulty with that.</p><p> The effect of the provisions allowing a victim to be accompanied is that they prevent the Garda from excluding an accompanying person without reasonable grounds.  The victim has, and continues to have, at all times a right to be accompanied at first contact when making a complaint or at interview.  These amendments have no actual effect other than by implication to suggest that the victim would somehow otherwise not be free to come or go or make such arrangements as he or she wished.</p><p> There is no difficulty whatsoever in a victim bringing in someone else to replace the person who has been excluded.  Obviously, garda&iacute; would have good reasons for excluding a person.  We can appreciate what those might be and they are for the good of the victim at all times.  The victim is free to come and go, is not under any charge or the like, can take a break at any time, etc.  There is no need for these amendments in that regard.  The Deputies might keep in mind that the victim is not under arrest or compelled to stay and can leave at any time that he or she wishes.  Victims can make any phone calls or bring in anyone else whom they want.  There is no difficulty in that regard.</p></speech>

Is the Minister of State saying that, when a victim makes a complaint, gives a statement and is interviewed by a garda, it is open to him or her to leave and find an alternative if the person who is with him or her is asked to leave during the interview stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.777" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#L00300"><p>It is a good point that the person is there of his or her own volition, but he or she is there to access support services.  We are making provision for the fact that victims are being provided with the legal right to have a person or solicitor present while accessing support.  When removing that right, there should be a fallback.  This is about choice for the victim.  I understand what the Minister of State is saying, but this is meant to ensure the spirit of the directive and that the victim's choice should only be removed in very limited and specific circumstances.  In a domestic violence situation, for example, we would understand garda&iacute; suspecting that a family member might be present in a coercive rather than supportive way, but there needs to be some protection if the victim has a solicitor whom the garda&iacute; do not like because he or she is perceived as being of a certain type or whatever.  While it is true that the victim can walk out and does not have to stay, we are designing this Bill in order that people can get support.  We want them to get that support.  We do not want them to walk out and leave.  This provision should be considered in some form.  I am not saying which of the three attempts achieves it, but we must do something that is different.</p></speech>

The victim has a right to leave in that scenario, but we must ensure he or she knows of the right to have someone present.  That should be incorporated in the text of the Bill.  As Deputy O'Brien mentioned, it is a multistage process, so it is important that victims get the chance throughout.  The initial stages might be fine, but a victim might need support at a later point in the interview or investigation.  Not to have that provision in the text on the basis that a victim can walk out does not give full support to the victim.  Whatever amendment is made, we need to provide that right for the victim.</p></speech>

Where certain crimes are involved, for example, domestic violence, garda&iacute; might be concerned that a family member who is accompanying the victim is coercing him or her in the complaint or during the interview stages, so I understand why garda&iacute; might ask that individual to leave.  However, if the person is a support worker from the Rape Crisis Centre or the person's legal representative, I do not understand why the garda&iacute; would ask that person to be removed.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline under what circumstances a legal representative who is accompanying a victim to make a complaint or during the interview stages could be asked to leave.  That would be helpful.</p> <p>  Even if there is good reason for that individual to be asked to leave, nowhere in the legislation is the victim required to be given the reason or rationale for that.  Will the Minister of State examine this matter for Report Stage?  It would probably be rare for a legal representative to absent himself or herself, but the victim should have the right to know why that individual was being asked to leave.  Given we are transposing a directive that is concerned with putting the victim at the centre of everything, it is only appropriate that if a victim makes a complaint and is accompanied by a support worker or legal representative who is then asked to leave, the victim has every right to know why, but nothing in the legislation entitles him or her to that information.  The Minister of State might comment on scenarios in which this might happen.</p></speech>

Obviously, it would depend on the nature of the offence and the criminal charge that might be laid later.  It is a subjective judgment that garda&iacute; must make.  They are doing it in the best interests of the victim.</p> <p>  I am concerned about a provision in the amendment, that being, "a victim shall be given reasonable opportunity to make alternative arrangements".  This implies that the victim is under a direction of the Garda or the ombudsman, but that is not the case.  Victims can take all the time they like to replace the persons accompanying them.  They can do it straight away.  It is up to them.  They are completely free to make any arrangement that they wish.</p></speech>

The victim can then leave and get an alternative to accompany them.  However, what if the victim does not know the reasons the legal representative was asked to leave?</p> <p>  I can understand where a family member could be asked to leave in, say, a case of domestic violence.

What would happen if the legal representative was a family member, for instance?  Provision has to be made for that.  A legal representative would be asked to leave if he or she was in some way involved in the offence or was putting some pressure on the individual, if the Garda felt it would be in the best interests of the victim that this particular person should not be in the interview and that it might be better if there was another person accompanying the victim.</p> <p>  It could be quite possible that the legal representative could be a family member.  The garda&iacute; involved might have some suspicion that the legal representative might be putting undue pressure on the victim by having a relationship of some sort.  We have to include the provision but it would be rare.  We have to include a legal representative in cases where he or she might be doing something that would not be in the best interests of the victim.</p> <p>  We are prepared to look at it again in respect of the replacement of the person who accompanies the victim.</p></speech>

In the majority of circumstances, that will not occur.  There could be the odd instance, however, where the accompanying person would have ulterior motives and putting undue pressure on the victim.  In that case, if the garda&iacute; see that occurring, they can ask the person to leave.  Arrangements can be made by the victim to have somebody else instead.</p> <p>  While it would be rare, it is all about safeguarding the victim.  It would be bizarre if there was a situation where a victim was making a complaint or giving information and the person sitting alongside them is in some way involved in, say, an alleged assault  or offence.  It involves cases where the victim cannot engage properly with the garda&iacute; by virtue of the accompanying person&rsquo;s very presence.  If the garda&iacute; involved see this, they can ask the person to stand aside and somebody else can be brought in.  There is no time limit.  The victim is completely free to make a phone call to get someone straight away or wait an hour, a day or a week.  It is only in cases where the garda&iacute; feel it is not in the best interests of the victim for the accompanying person to be there.  In rare cases it could be a legal representative.  We have to protect the victim in all instances and this is what this is about.</p></speech>

Where the accompanying person is asked to leave for good reason, we need to be mindful that in some cases it can take a lot of courage for the victim to take the initial step to make a complaint.  They may be slow to take the step again if they do leave.  There should be some sort of follow-up procedure with a victim who decides to leave because the accompanying person has been asked to absent him or herself.  If the victim then decides not to go any further, it is critical there should be some follow-up to give them every opportunity to make a complaint at a later date.  The onus should not be put back on the victim.  The victim may not have somebody else whom they trust or can turn to accompany them.  Will the Minister of State examine this follow-up provision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.791" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051700002#M00800"><p>We will certainly look at that.  It raises other issues, however, with respect to freedom of the victim to come and go and so forth.  On first contact, the victim gets all the information available with respect to support services, agencies and so on.  There are plenty of talented and experienced people available to assist a victim.</p> <p>  We have to work on the best interests of the victim.  If the accompanying person is not working in the best interests of the victim and the garda&iacute; see that, they have to be free to ask the person in question to leave.  It is then up to the victim to decide whether he or she wants to carry on or get somebody else to accompany them.  They are free to do that and the Garda will give all the help and assistance required.</p> <p>  I am certain the Garda would follow up to assist and support a victim if the victim wants it.  One cannot coerce a person to do something they do not want to do, however.  There is a balance involved.  A victim who comes forward is completely free to make his or her own arrangements.  It is only when the view is taken that the accompanying person is not acting in the best interests of the victim, that he or she would be asked to leave.  In rare instances, that could be a legal representative.  Accordingly, we have to make provision for that.</p></speech>

It may or may not be a legal person.  That is a good development.  I also agree there can be limited circumstances where a garda sees something is not right and the accompanying person is actually not supporting the victim and needs to intervene.  I have no problem with these parts of the provision.</p> <p>  My concern is in cases where a garda might have had some indirect involvement or knew some of the people involved and could block an alternative, putting the victim off from seeking support.  It is unlikely but the person should have the right to choose a replacement.</p></speech>

Whatever way that is worded in an amendment for Report Stage, it should happen because we will be leaving a procedural vacuum.  Of course, the Garda probably would, might and should to do this but if it is not in the law, the force does not have an obligation to do so.  Is the Minister of State aware of other legislation whereby there is a legal imposition on the Garda to offer a replacement or to give the victim a choice in that procedural context.  In respect of codifying the section, as has been agreed, if the Garda believes that a person should not have that legal representative with him or her, not imposing an obligation on the Garda to say that the victim can have that replacement could have unintended consequences for the victim if he or she was not aware of the legal position.  Regardless of how it is done, creating that procedural choice by means of incorporating the existing legislative mechanisms would be a welcome development.</p></speech>

First, we will look at making it compulsory for garda&iacute; to inform the victim of the right to have an alternative if somebody is excluded.  I think that is the genesis of what I am picking up here so we will look at that and come back on Report Stage.  Deputy Clare Daly made a point about the alternative.  There is a very slight risk that the alternative might also be a problem, for example, if it involved a family member and another family member was put in instead, so we must keep it open.</p> <p>  The legal capacity legislation has been passed.  It provides all kinds of supports for people with intellectual capacity difficulties.  That will kick in for those kind of supports, as the Chairman is aware because I am sure he dealt with that legislation in the past.  I think we are all on the same page here and the points made by members are well taken.  It comes down to informing the victim that he or she has a right to have an alternative person accompany them if the first person is excluded.  We all agree why a person might be excluded by the Garda if he or she is not acting in the best interests of the victim, so we are all on the same page.  We will look at that suggestion, as Deputies Clare Daly, Jack Chambers and O'Brien have requested.</p></speech>

The Minister may not be aware that an amendment to section 6(1)(a) has been agreed by the Minister of State.  This has knock-on effects throughout the legislation.  One of those effects relates to amendment No. 27 because the wording of this amendment is exactly the same as the amendment we have just agreed.  The Minister should be aware that the Minister of State has said that he is going to look at amending the amendment we just passed.  If that happens, there will be a knock-on effect but I am sure the Minister's officials will brief her on the importance of the amendment we passed earlier.</p></speech>

The Deputy could raise the matter with the Ceann Comhairle. The notification I circulated to members on their amendments was authored in the Bills Office, which takes decisions in these matters.  The proper process in terms of address is through the Ceann Comhairle.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien recorded his concerns regarding amendments that were ruled out of order, as did Deputy Clare Daly regarding earlier amendments.  The Deputies should follow up on the matter and seek substantive advice from the Ceann Comhairle as unfortunately this cannot be done in the committee.</p></speech>

We are all trying to address this issue in slightly different ways.  My amendment proposes to clarify this provision by providing that &quot;all relevant&quot; information be provided.  This relates to information that people need if they are to request, for example, a review of a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to proceed with a prosecution.</p><p>Another amendment in the group provides that &quot;sufficient&quot; information be provided.  While the word &quot;relevant&quot; is slightly subjective, the word &quot;sufficient&quot; is even more subjective.  The former would provide a strong ground on which to mount a challenge in cases where there may be a suspicion that all relevant information had not been supplied.  While the intention is that all information should be given, I do not believe this would be accepted by the DPP or Garda.  The inclusion of the word &quot;relevant&quot; improves the text.  The decision should rest with the victim rather than the investigating authority.  Rather than the investigating authority deciding what is relevant to a person's review, the victim should make that decision.  </p></speech>

Paragraph (c), which the amendment seeks to amend, relates to an investigation, which is the Garda part of the process.  The first part is an investigation by the Garda, after which one has a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether to institute criminal proceedings.  The relevant information needs to be provided to a victim to assist him or her in deciding whether he or she wants a review.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say.</p></speech>

The effect of amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 38 would be to require the Garda or Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to provide to a victim all relevant information relating to any significant development in investigation, regarding a decision to end an investigation and regarding a decision not to prosecute a person.  The concern in this regard is that this requirement would encompass the entire Garda, GSOC and DPP case files.  It may not be the Deputy's intention that the victim be provided with the entire case files relating to an offence, the amendments would present some difficulties.</p> <p>  The limitation on the provision of information in section 10 would ensure that much of the information could not be released as it would prejudice or preclude any future criminal proceedings.  This is one consideration but there are also privacy and data protection considerations and considerations in respect of the rights of witnesses and the accused.  The amendment could, therefore, be disproportionate to its aims if one were to end up in that scenario. </p> <p>  On amendment No. 36-----</p></speech>

I see what he is getting at.  It is very subjective and would require the Garda, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to know what information would, in any particular case, be sufficient for that particular victim to make a decision whether to request a review of the decision not to prosecute.  It is a subjective decision for them to make.  As the decision not to prosecute is what may be reviewed, a summary of the reasons on which the decision not to prosecute was made is probably the appropriate information to give to a victim in the circumstances and will provide a sufficient basis in the majority of cases to decide whether to seek a review.</p> <p>  Referring back to amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 38, the issue is with "all relevant information".  If it were "relevant information", we could come back on that.  Including the word "all" assumes all those details I am suggesting and could end up being problematic because they could prejudice criminal proceedings and could breach privacy and data protection.  We can come back to it on Report Stage if Deputy Daly wants to consider that.</p> <p>  I would be interested in Deputy O'Callaghan's views about the points I made about the subjective decision-making his amendment implies.  I do not have a huge difficulty with it, but just make that point.</p></speech>

By including "all relevant information", it presumes it is information that can lawfully be given and would not impede a prosecution or be too sensitive to be given out or whatever.  The word "information" on its own is just too loose.  This is about empowering the victim with as much relevant information as is possible in order for him or her to make informed decisions.  All the definitions and everything we are all saying have a degree of subjectivity.  I am just trying to narrow it and I am not sure I got the best bit.  If the Minister is happy with "relevant", I do not see why she would not be happy with "all relevant".  It is not all information.  It is just all relevant information.</p></speech>

This has been subject to huge debate.  Obviously, I agree with the principle of giving reasons and giving victims as much information as possible as to why a decision would be made not to prosecute.  The concern we have and that I have been advised is at issue here relates to the particular points made.  Perhaps we can address that more fully when we come back.  We may be able to find a form of words that addresses the points the Deputy is making about it being relevant but which does not trespass into the territory of making other criminal proceedings difficult or does not breach data protection or privacy rights of other people.  If she were willing to accept "relevant", we could probably live with that.</p></speech>

The existing text of section 7 on the provision of information provides that a victim shall receive, on request, information on a decision not to institute criminal proceedings.  There are two difficulties with this.  First, the words &quot;criminal proceedings&quot; have a different meaning in the directive, where they apply to the investigation and the court proceedings, from that understood in this jurisdiction, which could give rise to confusion.  Second, section 7 does not provide for a victim to receive information where a decision is made to prosecute but that prosecution does not proceed or is withdrawn.  Section 8, rather confusingly, refers to a review of decision not to institute or proceed with criminal proceedings.</p><p>Amendment 39 replaces the term &quot;institute criminal proceedings&quot; with &quot;prosecute a person&quot;, which is much clearer.  Amendment 40 inserts a new paragraph into section 7(2) to ensure a victim receives information on a decision not to proceed with or to withdraw a prosecution.  It is giving the information to the person in those circumstances.</p><p>Amendment 54 again replaces the term &quot;institute criminal proceedings&quot; with &quot;prosecute a person&quot;.  It also deletes the reference relating to a review of a decision not &quot;to proceed&quot; with a prosecution.  This is because the decision to end a prosecution is not suitable for review, as the decision itself cannot be reversed.</p></speech>

We are looking for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allow for a foreign police service in whose jurisdiction an alleged crime occurred, and where somebody in Ireland has told them about the crime.  I do not know why one would have the condition that the person must be resident in the State.  It is not clear.  The Minister does not speak of habitual residence, rather it is legal residence, which would exclude many people who are in Ireland for relatively lengthy periods.  It is also not clear if it means residence as defined in tax legislation or is it somebody with a valid visa or something else.  It would exclude people who are undocumented or people who are waiting for an asylum claim to be processed under section 12.  They would not be able to go the Garda about something that happened them in their own country and enable the Garda to refer it onwards.  I do not see why a person in Ireland must prove legal residency to have their rights vindicated as a victim.  I do not believe it is necessary and it should be easy enough to remove it from the proposed legislation. </p></speech>

They would be perfectly entitled to avail of the provisions under this Act.</p> <p>  Section 12 deals with offences occurring outside the State and I suspect - although I am interested to hear what the T&aacute;naiste has to say - the Department is concerned that since this part relates to offences committed in other member states, we could have, for example, an Italian living in Rome who has never been to Ireland - although it seems implausible - making a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about an offence that took place in Italy.  That could be the concern, otherwise it seems a bit unusual.  I am, however, interested in the Minister's comments in this regard.</p></speech>

He wants to extend the scope of section 12 which requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to forward a complaint received about an offence that occurred in another member state to any person who makes a complaint in this State rather than just residents of the State.  I should note that section 12 is not concerned with a person's residency status within the State but simply whether a person is resident or not.

The investigating authority, Director of Public Prosecutions, or the presiding judge, as the case may be, shall, when considering whether the victim would benefit from special measures during the course of any criminal proceedings relating to the alleged offence, have regard to the fact that specific protection needs have been identified under <i>section 14 </i>in relation to the victim concerned.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This involves letting judges know about special protection needs.  Section 14 provides for an assessment of a victim's special protection needs to be carried out and for that report to be compiled.  The amendment is saying that report should be provided to the presiding judge in the victim's case and the judge, along with the investigators and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, shall have regard to the special protection needs identified under section 14 during the course of the proceedings.  The reason for this is to assess whether the person has any special needs in the conduct of the court case.  The treatment of some victims of sexual violence in particular and how they have been dealt with in the courts has been a talking point because it has been incredibly problematic for people who have been re-traumatised by their treatment in court.  There should be no excuse for the judge not knowing how vulnerable a person is.  That should not in any way undermine the trial.  It does not invalidate the rights of the accused or anything like that.  It is just a matter of being aware of their vulnerability.  I feel quite strongly about this because judges' mishandling of cases of sexual violence have been well documented in the media and in some instances this has been arguably almost worse than the original offence.</p><p>Amendment No. 114 is similar to Deputy O'Callaghan's and Deputy O'Brien's amendments in this area.  It is pretty self-explanatory.  It proposes that victims of domestic or sexual crime can be accompanied by a support worker unless the court orders otherwise.  That is critical because they go through the legal process alone at a time when they are vulnerable.</p></speech>

While I have sympathy with what Deputy Daly says about the needs of the victim and how important it is that everyone is aware of them, I want to point out some of the consequences of this amendment.  The concerns about it are fairly fundamental.  If the assessment report were to be given to the judge, there would also be an obligation to disclose it to the defence.  The Bill has been drafted very carefully to ensure these assessment reports do not become part of the criminal proceedings to prevent disclosure to the defence and any possible cross-examination of the victim regarding their contents.</p><p>Assessments will frequently contain sensitive and confidential personal information regarding the victim and his or her personal circumstances, including vulnerabilities to victimisation and intimidation.  It would be very inappropriate for such information to be disclosed to the defence.  These amendments provide that assessments would have to be provided to every District Court judge.  Assessments may contain information on previous offences or orders relating to other previous conduct by the accused which pose a risk to the victim.  If the case were a summary case, this could be prejudicial to the rights of the accused as the judge would have been provided detailed information on the victim, the offender and the offence from the victim's perspective.  The Deputy can see that basic issues arise here which I am sure are not intended by the amendment.  I do not think it would be right to go down that route for the obvious reasons of all that information being given in a way that could be damaging.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 108, 109 and 114 provide a right for a victim to be accompanied in court by a support worker.  They mirror new provisions in the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 which make a similar provision for a victim of domestic violence to be accompanied in court when applying for a safety or barring order.  However, the provision is not required in respect of criminal offences.  While domestic violence proceedings are heard <i>in camera</i>, criminal proceedings are heard in public.  As such, the victim has an existing right to be accompanied by any person or persons he or she wishes to accompany him or her during court proceedings.</p><p>There are a range of provisions on the Statute Book which provide a power for the court to exclude the public or members of the public from criminal proceedings, including section 19 of this Bill.  Such provisions generally allow for a parent, relative or friend of the victim to remain in court where other members of the public have been excluded.  I am not aware of any concerns relating to the ongoing court accompaniment of victims of sexual offences by support workers, which the Department funds.  However, I will examine these provisions to ensure they are sufficient to ensure a support worker would also be allowed to remain in court with a victim in such circumstances.</p></speech>

She may be right that it may have consequences beyond what is intended here.  Also, in respect of people being accompanied, that is possible even in cases which are <i>in camera</i>.  I thought it might be of benefit to specify that on a statutory basis but nonetheless, in light of what the T&aacute;naiste says, I will withdraw amendment No. 109 and think about it for Report Stage.</p></speech>

There was no way that we want this information being handed over to the defence or anything like that.  The aim of the amendment is to tackle the re-traumatisation of victims, as a result of some of their experiences in some of our courts, because of the way in which the Judiciary run the courts.  I know the matter strays into other issues such as judicial counsels and all the rest.  The desire was that if the judge was aware of the needs of a person and how vulnerable he or she was then the room for some of the most appalling things that have happened in our courts to recur would probably be lessened.  I will withdraw my amendment for now and will consider how it might be dealt with on Report Stage.  I would like this matter dealt with then.  All of these amendments relate to how isolating the court experience can be for a victim who is, legally, present on his or her own.  Nobody is there for him or her.  In particular, cases of sexual violence and rape are very much more intimate and personal crimes and leave people feeling very vulnerable.  In such cases the victim should be accompanied.  I am aware that there is a provision that a victim can be accompanied but I do not see any harm in us specifying this aspect.  I shall withdraw my amendment and return to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The approach requires an individual assessment of each victim to establish what, if any, special measures might be needed to mitigate the impact of the investigation or court proceedings on the victim.</p><p>However, the directive never envisaged that every victim would have one or more special measures applied to him or her.  This was clear during the negotiation of the directive and in the choice of the term &ldquo;special measures&rdquo;, rather than a broader term such as &ldquo;victim measures&rdquo;.  </p><p> Every response in this area needs to be proportionate.  For example, our statutes already permit the video recording of evidence, in chief for children who have been victims of sexual crimes, in a special interview suite away from uniformed police officers, marked police cars and busy police stations.  This is entirely appropriate for a child victim of sexual abuse.  It would obviously be inappropriate and disruptive if somebody who was, for example, reporting the theft of a mobile phone were to be taken to an off-site interview suite.  I think that is obvious. </p><p> A general access to special measures would give rise to unreasonable delays for other victims who are clearly in need of special measures.  It would also be putting public money to a use for which, if one looks at it logically, it is not necessary.  It would be better to retain the entirely appropriate level of discretion in relation to the application of special measures generally, during court proceedings or investigations.</p></speech>

Not every victim will necessarily want all of these measures that would be available.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to somebody who has had a mobile phone stolen from them.  Under the legislation, that person is a victim.  They have suffered economic loss.  I appreciate the answer given.  We may return to it on Report Stage unless Deputy O'Brien wishes to pursue the matter.</p></speech>

That is very positive.</p><p>It has always been envisaged that the child&rsquo;s views would be considered in appointing such a person.  This person is intended to be a support to the child.  However, as concerns have been raised that this is not explicitly provided for, I am tabling this amendment which will ensure the child's views in respect of who he or she wants to accompany him or her will be taken into account.  That means that consultation with the child and the taking into account of the child's view would have a statutory basis.</p></speech>

I addressed a related query to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, when he was here regarding the capacity of the victim.  I see a situation here where I can address this matter again.  The Minister is talking about the views expressed by the child.  There are situations where, irrespective of the age of the individual, he or she is regarded as a child for life.  I am speaking of people with Down's syndrome or other such intellectual disabilities which affect their capacity to properly present.  It is all very well to refer to capacity legislation, but should there be reference to provision in respect of a situation where the victim is indeed someone of adult years but who nevertheless, because of their reduced ability, is unable or incapable of fully engaging on their own?  Accompaniment was the first question put to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  He did not address it satisfactorily from my perspective.  In respect of amendment No. 107, is this something the Minister feels is covered or does it require further address?</p></speech>

The issue is dealt with there in the sense that there is an obligation to take into account any capacity issues and respond to them appropriately when dealing with a person, in order that they understand it take into account any disability.  It comes under the section entitled "Communication, interpretation and translation".  That certainly deals with the issue of being sensitive to the personal characteristics of a person or any disability her or she may have.</p> <p>  The other point is that under the assessment of a victim, there is also a description of any requirements to be taken into account, which include the personal characteristics of the victim including his or her age, gender, health and so on.  I will not go through it all, but it deals with disability.  I can take the issue which the Chairman has raised and see whether there is a need for any further provision in respect of the obligation to communicate and whether we need to elaborate it any further in respect of the circumstances which he has described, or whether we feel that these two sections capture the Chairman's concerns.  I certainly believe it is there in a broad sense.  I think the Chairman's query is whether anything more specific is required to make sure that it happens and appropriate action is taken.</p></speech>

It is serious if evidence in court is being recorded, whether by the accused or any other person.  The issue needs to be examined.  However, like Deputy O'Brien, I will withdraw my amendment.</p></speech>

Order 67A, rule 3, of the Circuit Court rules and Order 12B, rule 3, of the District Court rules provide that the record of any criminal proceedings shall be made or cause to be made by a person appointed by the Courts Service.  The rules separately provide that unless otherwise authorised by the rules or by the court, no person other than the Courts Service or a person authorised by it on its behalf shall make any record of proceedings otherwise than by written or shorthand note.  Where persons are authorised by the court to record proceedings, it is done subject to and in accordance with any direction given by the court.  If there is a risk that persons in the court could seek to make an unauthorised recording, the courts may also rely on their inherent jurisdiction to regulate proceedings and prohibit the making of such a recording.  Further, under section 19 of the Bill, if a court is satisfied that there is a need to protect a victim from victimisation, intimidation or retaliation, the court may, on application of the prosecution, exclude the public or individuals from the court.</p></speech>

The amendment will ensure that any individual staff member or employee who may have been omitted from the list, or who is in the future appointed under a different statutory provision, will also benefit from the protection.  It also makes it clearer that the protection applies only to individuals and not to the office or agency to which they belong.</p></speech>

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has recommended the establishment of an ombudsman for the victims of crime and a complaints procedure and these are now urgent.  The other amendment deals with the training of people working within the justice system.  If we are not allowed to table these amendments, I would appeal to the Minister to do so.  They are in keeping with recital 62 of the victims' directive and the advice of all human rights advisory bodies.  The establishment of a human rights one-stop shop is urgent, particularly given that the commission for the support of victims of crime no longer exists.  All funding to these organisations is directed by the victims of crime office, which is a mad state of affairs.  The Victims' Rights Alliance, who have appeared before us on occasions over the past four years, have met with all ombudsman offices and they would be happy to team up with them to deal with the issue.  If we cannot deal with it, can the Government deal with it?</p></speech>

We are at a critical point in this country, and in Europe, on victims' rights and we are at a turning point with the implementation of the victims' directive.  I will examine the proposal but it would require a Government decision because it would involve significant resources.  It will be on the agenda in the medium term, if not in the immediate future, because these are significant issues.  The victims' directive means there needs to be a sea change in the attitudes to victims across the criminal justice system.  I will examine it but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to come back on it by Report Stage.  I will ask the Department to examine the implications and the submissions made by the human rights body and others.  I will also see if we can give some reassurance on the training issue.  It may not involve a statutory provision.  We are trying to ensure that victims are heard, their rights are guaranteed, their needs are identified and there are solutions.</p></speech>

Members will recall our discussion last week about the Coroners Bill 2015 and the failure of the Government to provide the money message for the Bill.  As Chairman, I undertook to take certain steps and I wish to update members now on the steps undertaken in the interim.</p> <p>  The first was to seek a meeting of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen through the offices of Deputy Jim Daly, who chairs the working group.  I made this request.  Deputy Daly and I did not have a meeting proper but we have since spoken.  This was superseded by the second course of action, namely, to arrange a meeting directly with the Ceann Comhairle.  This meeting took place last Wednesday.  It was also attended by the former clerk to our committee, Gina Long, representing the Bills Office; Elaine Gunn, representing the Business Committee, I understand; and the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l.  The upshot of this was that the Ceann Comhairle advised that he had corresponded on four Bills that had been presented for address by this committee - we knew he had done so because we were told after the event - and had sought an indication as to the money message being provided or not, as the case might be.  Despite this fact, almost a full month later - as of last Thursday, 11 May, the date of 12 April was long past - there was no reply to the Ceann Comhairle's letter.  I found this most extraordinary and the Ceann Comhairle concurs and intends taking up the matter.  The upshot of the meeting was that the Ceann Comhairle has sought a meeting with An Taoiseach for this week to be attended by the Ceann Comhairle; by me, as Chairman of the justice committee, which is the raising committee; and Deputy Jim Daly, as the chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  The letter was sent last Thursday.  It was drafted in my presence to be despatched shortly after the conclusion of our meeting.  I have no indication at present as to whether the meeting is being accommodated.  I will make further inquiries.</p> <p>  Those were the actions I undertook to take at the committee's request.  We have now brought the matter to a new plane.  Rather than addressing it as a stand-alone committee and in isolation, it will now be addressed in conjunction with Deputy Jim Daly, as the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen, and the Ceann Comhairle on behalf of the D&aacute;il and the system here.  That meeting is to take place with An Taoiseach.  As soon as we have that opportunity, we will be able to report back.  I spoke with Deputy Daly yesterday.  We have agreed that, whatever the outcome of the meeting, we will convene a meeting of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen to brief all committee Chairmen on the outworkings and upshot of our meeting with the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  The other actions to be taken concerned Deputy Clare Daly and the Minister and an exploration of the Minister's letter to me and the committee regarding her willingness to facilitate us in the period running up to the summer recess.  While my address was in broad brush strokes, Deputy Daly's was specific to her Bill, namely, the Coroners Bill, and I invite Deputy Daly to bring us up to date in this regard.</p></speech>

They expressed their intention to deal with this issue and expedite it before the summer.  This is a big ask and a very tight schedule but we agreed to work together to try to deliver it and report back to the committee to seek its co-operation in that regard as well.  In essence, the Minister undertook to ring me then, having made some investigation with the Office of the Attorney General and her own staff.  Some work has been done on it but basically, what is being talked about is that the Department would draft a new stand-alone Bill dealing with the provisions surrounding maternal deaths, specifically mandatory inquests for maternal deaths.  The Minister will go to Cabinet next week with a resolution.  I do not understand what that means, but the drafting is under way and will continue.  They do not expect this to take that long.  It will be quite a short Bill with perhaps about eight provisions.  The aim is that it would come before Cabinet the first week back after the recess, would be published that week and would reach Second Stage in the week of 21 June, Committee Stage the following week and Report Stage the week after.  Then an attempt will be made to expedite it through the Seanad.  That is a very tight schedule but they say they intend to work on it.  There may be hiccups.  I would be a little suspicious, not of the Minister but perhaps of the Department trying to restrict the definition of "maternal death".  We might not be happy about that and it might throw a spanner in the works.</p><p>In fairness, the team has been made available to us.  A member of the team has been liaising with staff in my office.  The Minister undertook to ring me and she did so yesterday.  She told me she had spoken to the Attorney General, and in response to my question as to whether the target of all Stages being passed by the summer was still achievable, her response was that it was but that everybody would have to be willing to engage.  Can Committee and Report Stages be taken together?</p></speech>

There is a real urgency to have the Bill passed before the summer recess.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste is committed to that but there is speculation that she may not be the Minister for Justice and Equality under the new Fine Gael leadership.  We do not know what is happening in that regard.  The point I am making is that we need to keep the pressure on the Department.  In saying that, I am in no way being derogatory to the Minister.  We need to keep the pressure on and, therefore, I would not fully abandon the proposal put forward last week.</p></speech>

Based on what has been said already, including by Deputy Clare Daly, progress has been made.  I have no doubt that the T&aacute;naiste wants to expedite the Bill but as we have seen in the past often that is not what happens.  I think a stick as well as a carrot is appropriate but we do not have to make any decisions about that now.  This select committee decides when to schedule legislation for Committee Stage.  The decision in that regard is not one for the Chairman but the committee as whole.  The proposals I put forward last week can be considered in due course.  Hopefully, we will not have to go there and the Government will ensure the Coroners Bill, in its new guise, will get to Committee Stage here as quickly as possible.  We need to put pressure on Government to do that.  The idea I put forward last week, in terms of putting pressure on the Government, is still a good idea.</p></speech>

When I have concluded my opening statement, Ms Burns, as RSA research manager, will explain the background to the research project, including how we came to the figures on alcohol related deaths, which might be of benefit to the committee.</p> <p>  The RSA mission is to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on Irish roads and to make them safer for all users.  This is our purpose.  It is what drives us and on what we base our positions.  We are not coerced or bounced into taking a view on proposals, such as this Bill, by Ministers, civil servants or vested interests.  We work off the data, the evidence professionally, scientifically and independently analysed.  Unapologetically, our mandate is only to make our roads safer for all road users.  It is important to state that the RSA&rsquo;s pre-crash report is a factual document.  In it, we have presented the evidence gathered by experts from numerous fields, including Garda investigators, forensic collision investigators, public service vehicle, PSV, inspectors, coroners, medical experts, as well as information from witnesses to the prior activity of those involved in the 867 fatal collisions.  The data have been compiled in line with best practice research standards.  There is no emotion in the report, just facts.</p> <p>  From our research, all the 250 drivers who consumed alcohol and were involved in a fatal collision were deemed culpable of causing the fatal collision due to their actions, as per the investigation.  That other contributory factors were also identified in many of these collisions is ancillary to the current debate.  Yes, in some cases speed was deemed to be a factor in addition to alcohol.  In some cases, fatigue was a factor in addition to alcohol.  After the consumption of alcohol, judgment is impaired and this will affect a driver&rsquo;s ability to choose the appropriate speed for the road and for the vehicle.  Feelings of fatigue are exacerbated, especially the day after a heavy night, even though alcohol levels may have dropped in the system.  Members will have heard the light-hearted jokes about the effect of alcohol on a person's self-awareness.  For example, after even one drink, jokes appear funnier, speaking louder is better, texts are sent to people which should not be sent, people convince themselves that they are not bad dancers and, alarmingly, they think it will be okay to drive home after a drink or two, but it will not.  Anyone who says different is lying.  Driving becomes impaired, just like all those other more innocent actions.  Collisions are complex events and result from a complex interplay of many behavioural and vehicle-infrastructural factors, and, ultimately physics and biology.  It is disingenuous to say there is no evidence to support that alcohol was a factor other than a presence in collisions where the toxicology showed levels of 51-80 mg.  It shows not only a lack of understanding of the effects of alcohol on the body or an unwillingness to accept the facts in the first instance, but also a lack of understanding of the cognitive skills required to complete the driving task safely.</p> <p>  According to the European Transport Safety Council alcohol, even in small quantities, immediately affects the brain.  Effects on the human body and behaviour range from anaesthesia after large amounts of alcohol to impairment of behavioural and cognitive capabilities after small doses.</p><p>Alcohol may also decrease motivation to comply with safety standards, which may result in an active search for dangerous situations such as competitive behaviour, or excessive speed, which we saw all too often in these files.  In general, all functions which are important in the safe operation of a motor vehicle can be affected by the levels of alcohol well below current legal limits operating in EU countries.  To give a practical example, the latest evidence shows that the relative risk of crash involvement starts to increase significantly from 40mg per 100ml.  Specifically, driving with a BAC of 50mg per 100ml increases the risk of a fatal crash by up to a factor of five. </p><p> This brings me to the critical point made by some that there is no justification for the introduction of an automatic disqualification of drivers at BAC levels of 51mg to 80mg, and that the RSA's pre-crash report provides no evidence that alcohol was a contributory factor in these collisions.  I categorically refute that.   The analysis in table 28 of the RSA's pre-crash report on alcohol, which the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, has presented in its statement, shows that eight drivers and motorcyclists involved in fatal collisions, for whom a blood alcohol reading was available, had a BAC between 51mg and 80mg.  A further 17 drivers and motorcyclists had a BAC below 50mg.  A total of 25 drivers and motorcyclists with a confirmed BAC between 21mg and 80mg were responsible, therefore, for killing themselves and-or others because they consumed alcohol.  Additional analysis conducted by the RSA, which is in table 1 and which was shared with the committee on 29 March 2017, showed that 35 people lost their lives and eight people were seriously injured as a result of these 25 drivers and motorcyclists choosing to drive while impaired at BAC levels of between 21mg and 80mg.  The VFI has attempted to downplay the value of the lives of these people, as well as the lives of their families, by reducing them to an insignificant statistic.  Presenting the figure of 1.3% is a selective use of the data in an attempt to undermine the impact of drinking and driving.  It is important to state that, of those killed in alcohol-related collisions where the driver or motorcyclist had a record of alcohol consumption, 12% were killed where the BAC of the driver or motorcyclist was between 21mg and 80mg, as confirmed in table 1.  Committee members can see those figures set out clearly.  Furthermore, more people are being killed and seriously injured due to drivers with a BAC of less than 80mg than we have outlined in the table.  This is because, in 11 cases, a positive breath test confirmed that the driver had consumed alcohol, and in a further 52 cases, there was strong evidence in the file that the driver had consumed alcohol but no toxicology report was available.  We had other evidence, and Ms Burns will explain that.  In addition, the RSA has not been in a position to conduct a comparable toxicology analysis of all road users involved in serious injury collisions.  We have only examined fatal collisions to date but we plan to examine serious collisions later.</p><p> The committee may ask whether this trend is continuing because we have all heard that drink-driving is a thing of the past.  We have proved in the pre-crash report on alcohol that drink-driving with a BAC of between 20mg and 80mg is killing, on average, seven to eight people per year.  If that is not evidence enough for some of the opponents to the proposed legislative change, the most current data to hand are further concrete evidence that there is a problem with this type of drink-driving in Ireland.  The Health Research Board, HRB, collected information on 2013 and 2014 road traffic fatalities from closed coroner files on behalf of the RSA in the context of the national drug-related death index, NDRDI.  A total of 49 deceased drivers had a confirmed measurement of alcohol for analysis, and seven drivers reported BAC values between 20mg and 80 mg.  This represents 14% of all drivers with a confirmed measurement of alcohol for analysis in 2013 and 2014.  That analysis does not include other people who were killed or injured in those crashes.  Provisional data supplied in advance of our appearance here for the period 1 January 2016 to 2 May 2017 show that of 246 drivers arrested at the scene of a crash - not detected at an MAT checkpoint or from observed behaviour - on suspicion of driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated, 38 drivers tested positive for alcohol at a BAC level between 20mg and 80mg or equivalent for breath or urine.  The 38 excludes drivers who were medially unfit to be tested, deceased or who left the scene of the crash.</p><p> The Garda also provided data to the RSA that shows each year over the period 2012 to 2016 an average of 573 drivers had a fixed penalty of &euro;200 and three penalty points imposed on them as a consequence of being found driving a vehicle in a public place while the concentrate of alcohol found to be in their systems was between 50mg and 80mg per 100ml of blood or equivalent in breath or urine.  That tells us this is continuing and even this year a significant number of drivers have been arrested with BACs at this level.  All this evidence confirms that we have a serious problem with alcohol consumption and driving at levels below 80mg and the current sanction is not working.  Intuitively, we know that a driver is less likely to get behind the wheel after drinking if he or she knows they might lose their licence rather than face a fine and penalty points.  It is much less of a risk.  We believe the Bill will have a strong deterrent effect on would-be drink drivers.</p><p> We know only too well the devastating impact on families and communities when just one driver makes the decision to drink and drive and this results in someone being killed or seriously injured.  We support the introduction of this Bill for all of these reasons.  We agree this Bill must be supported by enforcement to be most effective, and we are working with the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address this.  Over the years, Oireachtas Members have overwhelmingly supported measures initiated by RSA research to make our roads safer.  They have done so, despite opposition from those who today seek to misinterpret data which have been scientifically and independently analysed.  If their opposition had prevailed, I have no doubt more lives would have been lost on our roads, and without this legislation, more lives will be lost.  We believe that losing one's licence for three months for a confirmed BAC between 51mg and 80mg is a much more compelling deterrent for a driver considering whether to drink and drive compared to the current sanction of penalty points and a &euro;200 fine.  A public attitude survey of 1,000 adults conducted on behalf of the RSA in January 2017 showed that 91% of Irish adults support the introduction of a mandatory disqualification for drivers caught between 51mg and 100mg.  Many of those who support this state they believe disqualification should be for 12 months. </p><p> I feel compelled to clarify a final point, and make sure it is on the record, in reference to the submission by the VFI to the committee, in which it described their interpretation of our pre-crash report as "forensic".  The only valid interpretation of what happened in the fatal crashes outlined in this report was conducted by the investigating garda&iacute; who conducted the forensic collision investigations, the expert statements of medical experts, coroners, and witness statements.  Their conclusions are reflected in our report and the RSA has presented these facts.  The VFI's submission is not a forensic analysis of this report.  It is a vested interest and it is inappropriate to suggest that it represents "one side" of the debate.  The federation has conducted a disingenuous and selective interpretation of the report and it is not in full possession of all the facts in coming to its conclusion.  The report covers a period when the lowest number of road deaths were recorded in the State.  Since then, the situation has, sadly, deteriorated as has the number of people involved in alcohol-related crashes at these levels.</p><p> I hope that this committee, in concluding its pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, will accept the independent evidence that supports it, the integrity of the Road Safety Authority's work in fulfilling our mission, but, most importantly, will move us one step closer to a change in the law which will make our roads safer and ultimately save lives, prevent injuries and protect our local communities from further harm.</p></speech>

All the facts are backed up by the research we have conducted.  For the benefit of everyone in the room, I would like to explain the process involved in the conduct of the pre-crash study.  It is a unique study in Europe as not all our counterparts across Europe have the same access as we have to the fatal investigation files.  It is very valuable information for us.  We are an organisation that pride ourselves on the development of evidence-based interventions, and while we have access to collision data from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a daily basis giving us the update of the number of people killed on our roads every day, that is preliminary information.  The information held in the fatal investigation files is the Holy Grail.  It is the definitive outcome of the investigation and allows us to identify exactly what happened in these fatal collisions.  That is what is contained in this report.</p> <p>  Many questions were asked about various figures in the report.  To explain, this is not an ordinary report.  It is not based on a survey or on dry, secondary research.  People's lives are accounted for in the report.  I was closely involved in the commissioning of this study.  We commissioned two independent researchers to conduct the data collection for us.  We were granted access to the files in Garda headquarters in the Garda National Traffic Bureau.  I have also had an opportunity to look at these files.  A total of 867 files were analysed in the context of this five year study.  That represents 88% of all the fatal collisions that occurred over that five year period.</p> <p>  To explain what is contained in the files, there are a series of reports in them.  There is the report of the forensic collision investigator, which examines the road, the vehicle, whether skidding occurred, etc.  There are also a series of medical reports, including the coroner's report and the medical reports from the hospital if the person had been in hospital for a period.  There is also the vehicle inspector's report, which includes a forensic examination of the vehicle to see if there were any contributory factors.  There are also very detailed witness statements, which is helpful information as to what happened prior to the crash.  In the case of some of these files, for example, where we did not have a toxicology report, there may have been witness statements to the effect that a person had consumed alcohol over a period of hours before they drove.  There is a huge amount of detail in them.</p> <p>  The files were quite harrowing for our two researchers to review.  They referred to the files as boxes of death.  It was painstaking work that was emotionally draining and harrowing.  They were at pains to identify all the contributory factors to these collisions to help us understand exactly what caused them and, ultimately, to give us the information that would then allow us to say definitively what is causing them and how interventions can be best addressed to prevent further collisions on the roads.</p> <p>  That alcohol report is one of a series of reports.  Drink-driving is known as one of the key killer behaviours.  There are other killer behaviours.  We have reports on the other killer behaviours, such as speeding.  We focus on all the killer behaviours, and alcohol is one that has emerged particularly strongly from this study, being responsible for 38% of all collisions that have occurred over that five year period.  It is a very important piece of research.  We have used, and continue to use, the evidence in the development of all our interventions.</p></speech>

I thank them for their opening submissions and I agree with almost everything they said.  My belief is that we should have a zero tolerance approach to drink-driving.  We heard some outrageous statements about drink-driving in this committee in recent months.  The bottom line is that drink-driving is dangerous.  It is the root cause of many road deaths, and it should not be tolerated.</p> <p>  First, for the benefit of the committee, will the witnesses again highlight the reason we should have an automatic ban on those caught drink-driving with an alcohol blood level under 80 mg?  Second, Ms Murdock mentioned in her opening submission that driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 50 mg to 100 ml increased the risk of a fatal crash by a factor of five.  For the benefit of the committee, will she explain the seriousness of that and perhaps give an example?</p> <p>  I agree with Ms Murdock that we have a serious problem with alcohol consumption and driving at levels below 80 mg.  Some members of this committee seem to believe we do not have a problem.  We have a serious problem.  It is important that we realise that one life lost to drink-driving is one too many.  If the introduction of this legislation is to save the life of only one person, we will have done a good job.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe that more can be done to educate people on the real dangers of drink-driving?  Should we should consider introducing a programme at secondary school level to highlight the many dangers of drinking and driving?</p> <p>  Ms Murdock mentioned a public attitudes survey, which showed that 91% of Irish adults support the introduction of mandatory disqualification for drivers who are caught drink-driving with a blood alcohol level of between 51 mg and 100 mg.  Will she give the committee more insight into the survey, for example, the other questions that were asked and perhaps a brief outline of the demographics of the respondents?  Were they mainly rural or urban dwellers?</p></speech>

I will then revert to some of the other questions.  The Deputy asked why we believe that introducing this change in penalty, in terms of a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg to 80 mg, will save lives.  From the research we see that too many lives are being lost as a result of people who have consumed that level of alcohol and gone on to drive.  We have confirmed that at least seven to eight people a year are being killed.  We see that even at the roadside crashes.  In the past 16 months, a further 38 people were breathalysed at the scene of a crash and were deemed to have a blood alcohol level of between 21 mg and 80 mg.  People are still taking a chance.  There is a mixed message being given that it is acceptable to drink at that level and get away with an administrative fine.  It is clear that the deterrent is not working.</p> <p>  To use the analogy of where a deterrent becomes much more effective, when not having a national car test, NCT, certificate became a penalty point offence in December 2014, we saw an 87% increase in compliance as a consequence of that.  It is a very different offence, but attitudes and behaviours changed immediately.  We now have over 92% compliance in this regard.  That was as a result of changing the penalty.  We believe, and our research supports that belief, that changing the penalty is important because it is not enough of a deterrent at the moment.  People will be tempted to drive having had one or two drinks.  They may think they will not be detected.  We see too many people being arrested with blood alcohol levels of between 80 mg and 100 mg.  Too many people are getting six months' disqualification.</p><p>Clearly, we are confusing people out there.  This is an anomaly and it is causing deaths on the roads.  There should be a mandatory ban for those who are caught drinking and driving, which is what this is.  There is no other way to describe it.  That is why the measure is necessary.  The deterrent in place at the moment is not working and people are prepared to take chances.  We must change those attitudes.  The second question was on the research.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.1160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1331" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#E00300"><p>It is really for people listening to the programme this morning.  There is no problem repeating it because it is so important.  Zero tolerance is the only way.  I have been involved in football all my life and I have a family.  The morning after is the issue.  I have children of my own.  People going to work the next day after having a few drinks the night before do not realise they are over the limit.  If we can save just one life, it is worth it.  It is a matter of continuing to educate people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.1161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Velma Burns" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#E00400"><p>Absolutely.  The research on alcohol and driving is extensive and consistent.  A huge number of studies have been conducted in the USA, which is the most authoritative source of such studies.  Much of the research we have quoted on crash risk comes from the US studies.  An analysis of 117 studies shows that they are all very consistent in their findings.  They show that any amount of alcohol impairs driving, including levels below the current legal limit of 50 mg.  The research shows that one's likelihood of having a crash doubles at 40 mg and that one is five or six times more likely to crash with a blood-alcohol level of 80 mg.  Interestingly, much of the research shows that young drivers are much more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol, which is a very relevant finding given that young drivers are the highest risk group for fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.  Because they have that lack of experience, studies show they are much more vulnerable to collisions when they consume alcohol.  In many cases, the error made may be a small one.  However, a small error can have devastating consequences as I have seen in the individual files and cases I have looked at.  It can be a split second lack of concentration which leads one to deviate from one's lane or to lose control on a bend.  Whereas it might be something one could rectify if one were not under the influence of alcohol, when one is, even at the lower levels, one's judgment is impaired.  We all know that and Ms Murdock set out some examples to which we can all relate.</p> <p>  Impairment is much more devastating when one is behind the wheel.  Driving is a very complex task and one's judgment is impaired when one consumes alcohol as is one's ability to maintain one's lane and to choose the appropriate speed.  The research has also shown that one is more likely to take risks.  Our study shows that half of the drivers who had consumed alcohol and were involved in fatal collisions chose not to wear a seat belt.  That is a much higher incidence than we have seen in our observational studies or the other studies we have conducted.  Alcohol has a huge impact.  To give members a sense of how we know that, many of the studies that prove it have been done in simulators.  Those who saw the "Prime Time" programme recently may remember the subject being asked to drive in a driving simulator having consumed a certain amount of alcohol.  A subject's reading is measured and his or her performance is monitored and measured according to key actions like maintaining lane position, choosing the appropriate speed for the road, negotiating bends and other driving tasks.  It is scientific.</p></speech>

Should we introduce a programme in secondary schools?  I am a firm believer that prevention is the best cure.  I was educated at the young age of 12 in my local school, which is why I became a pioneer at that age.  I do not have a problem with alcohol.  As I said earlier, I train football teams every month.  However, people have to realise the damage alcohol can do.  It is very important given the increasing levels of consumption among young people to introduce a programme in secondary schools to educate people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.1163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#E00600"><p>That is a really valid point.  We recognise that contrary to the myth that this is an older person's issue, we are seeing a real emerging trend that the group showing the greatest propensity to drink and drive and who have admitted to taking alcohol and driven in the last 12 months is those aged under 24.  As such, we have taken the immediate measure of introducing a new module in the driver theory test from October 2016 which relates completely to questions on alcohol, the law and driving.  While that is not enough, it is a start.  We are looking at what other educational material and interventions we need to make.  We have a junior cycle course which has been piloted in a couple of schools and we need to ensure that alcohol is covered as part of that.  One cannot pass a theory test now without answering at least two questions on alcohol and driving.  We intend to enhance that and to introduce more complex psychological questions because, as Ms. Burns said, we must get into the minds of these young people to determine why they think it is okay.  They may have a different perception about what drinking and driving is because they certainly have a different consumption levels to ourselves.  What was deemed a normal intake of alcohol many years ago is considerably less than is consumed now.  There is the whole issue of pre-drinks which perhaps leads people to go out thinking they have not been drinking.  It is therefore important to get the message to this new generation of drivers at an early stage.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick made a valid point about the morning after.  Some 10% of fatal crashes occurred the morning after.  Just because one thinks one has done the right thing the night before, one is still impaired.  As such, one is not doing the right thing.  One is still at a high risk of being involved in a serious crash the next day because one is still impaired.  It is either because one is falling asleep or one's judgment is just as impaired as it was due to the consumption level the night before.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses whose evidence and presentations have been compelling.  I find very little fault with what has been said.  For anyone with any bit of wisdom, drink driving is a bad news story.  We are all on the one side on this issue.  Certainly, my party takes a responsible view on it.</p><p> I have one or two queries.  Deputy Troy has raised a matter a number of times and hopes to engage with the witnesses, possibly even before the day is out.  How up to date are the figures and statistics that we are using?  Are they the latest figures?  If there is a glitch, why?  Does the RSA have more recent figures that we have not seen or heard of and, if so, why?  I ask these questions because, in the context of the recent Garda penalty points controversy, there is a question mark over many statistics that are in the public domain.  It would be important for us to know the status of the figures that the witnesses are offering us.</p><p> Despite the crackdowns and publicity as well as the Garda's large operation over Christmas, there seems to be a continual increase in the number of offences involving people driving under the influence.  Is there any solution to this and are other alternatives being considered?  While we would support all endeavours that were geared towards reducing road fatalities, one wonders whether the overall process is capable of succeeding.  Are there other views on how the issue might be addressed?</p><p> My only negative point relates to the hard words that have been spoken at this meeting about the Vintners Federation of Ireland, almost as if - certainly in the Minister's view - it is the big bad wolf.  To a certain extent, Ms Murdock has gone down that road as well.  Like all organisations, those in the Vintners Federation of Ireland are professionals who represent their members.  I have always found them to be professional and reasonable.  As every committee member will know from personal experience or anecdote, there is no more responsible person in any small community than the local publican, who is well aware of his or her responsibilities.  Publicans' concern for their customers is commendable.  Often, they are the first to spot problems with people's drinking.  I speak from personal experience.  They fill an important psychological role for people in isolated areas.  As such, it is not helpful that the Vintners Federation of Ireland should be conveyed as the big bad wolf in this story.  It has a role to play.</p></speech>

The figures that we referred to in our report relate to the 2008-12 period in which this comprehensive 18-month study was conducted.  It is an in-depth process and can only be conducted when we have a closed coroner's file and the case has been concluded.  Ms Burns mentioned that 88% of files from that period were available to us.  The remaining 12% were probably still ongoing.  They could have been complex cases, under a court ruling or not been adjudicated on by a coroner or court of law for whatever reason.</p> <p>  A process is ongoing in terms of the 2013-14 period.  Quite a number of 2013 files are still open.  In this country, it takes a long time to get a case from occurrence through to final adjudication.  We cannot assess files that are still under review.  We do not get to see them until a coroner is finished with them.  Ms Burns might elaborate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.1178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Velma Burns" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#F00300"><p>I will briefly explain our process for collecting data on 2013, 2014 and 2015 fatal collisions.  Data collection on 2015's fatal collisions is ongoing and almost complete.  We have an arrangement with the Health Research Board, which collects the data for us through the national drug-related death index, NDRDI, which Ms Murdock mentioned.  We have a preliminary report for 2013 and 2014 based on approximately 70% of cases that were closed at the time of data collection.  The results from the two studies are consistent with what we saw in our pre-crash study.  They show that 31% of fatalities in 2013 and 2014 had alcohol in the toxicology.  The only methodological difference with the pre-crash study is that we have only collected toxicology data on those road users who were killed.  For example, if a driver was killed because the other driver involved in the collision had consumed alcohol but the second driver survived, that toxicology information is not included in the study.  I am explaining this because the 31% figure is understating the problem slightly.  Our evidence for 2013 and 2014 is consistent with the data from the previous five years and show that alcohol remains a significant problem in fatal collisions.</p> <p>  We consider ourselves to be up to date in terms of the type of study that we are undertaking.  As Ms Murdock explained, it typically takes a year or two - sometimes even three or four, depending on the complexity of the collision - for the inquest to be held, the case to be closed and so on, so the file is not available to us immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-17a.1179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017051700002#F00400"><p>We have 100% confidence in the figures in our files.  There is no ambiguity about them.  They are independently reviewed by professional researchers.  They include all of the statements and reports from a multitude of experts, coroners, medical professionals, hospitals, forensic collision investigators and garda&iacute;.  This is not something that is left to chance.</p> <p>  Regarding the continuing increase in the number of people drinking and driving, Ireland has an issue with its relationship between alcohol and driving as well as with alcohol generally in society.  As a society, our relationship with alcohol needs to be addressed.  It spills onto the roads.</p> <p>  The Senator asked whether the battle was a lost cause.  Absolutely not.  We are still punching above our weight in terms of European performance on road safety, but we must emulate countries like Sweden and the UK, which have lower levels of drink driving.  There is no reason that we cannot change attitudes and behaviours.  Ireland has been successful in other areas of society.  For example, we have been tremendously accepting of the smoking ban.  No one would contemplate lighting up in a pub now, yet there is not the same stigmatisation of drinking before heading off to the car.  However, I fully believe that we will get there with the correct measures.  We can make inroads.  In line with typical years, 60 to 70 people were involved in alcohol-related crashes in 2016.  If we can make even a 20% or 30% dent in that and bring our 38% alcohol-related crash rate down to something more akin to the level of the UK and Sweden, which is 14%, we will potentially save lives.  We can and will do that.</p> <p>  We have a chart with us that we would be happy to share with the committee on the interventions of the past 15 years.  It tracks from when we introduced mandatory alcohol checkpoints to when we lowered the level from 80 mg to 50 mg as well as the various interventions in road safety that have resulted in Ireland moving from languishing in the middle of the EU 28 to being in the top 5% to 8%.  We will strive to improve on that year on year and can do so with the help of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  An increase can be disheartening.  To date this year, 59 people have been killed on our roads.  That is still too many, but it is ten fewer than last year.  The debate in itself and the focus on road safety are having an effect and changing behaviours.  We need to get this over the line and make further improvements.</p><p>The vintners are no shrinking violets.  As they alluded to lies and liars, they are well able to stand up for themselves.  They are not getting a hard deal.  They are a vested interest which represents a small cohort of pub owners and publicans in the drinks industry.  The Road Safety Authority represents all road users, men, women and children, and all of Ireland, not only rural Ireland.  Figures show that 81% of car crashes occur in rural Ireland and that 92% involve male drivers.  We have a responsibility to make the roads safe for all road users, not some of them.  People in rural Ireland are as entitled to safe roads as those in urban areas. </p><p> The bigger issue of rural isolation should not be considered a consequence of being afraid to drink and drive.  Many older people are afraid to drive at night because it is dark or they have lost confidence.  A complex range of other issues need to be dealt with in terms of rural transport.  The issue should not be concentrated on drink driving.  That is disingenuous to the people who do not drink.  Many people in rural areas, including many farmers, do not drink.  We do not have representation for a cohort of people.  The RSA seeks to ensure we represent all road users and, for that reason, we hope to get the Bill across the line.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about support for the Bill.  The survey to which I referred was in-depth and the demographics covered a cross-section of the country.  It was carried out across all four provinces.  The level of support for a mandatory ban in urban Ireland was 89%, but in rural Ireland, including Munster, it was 93%.  There was, therefore, a higher level of support in rural areas for a mandatory ban, which some people may find surprising.  Our survey of 1,000 people was very in-depth and involved face-to-face questioning.  It was not anonymous; it involved asking a series of questions about support for a mandatory ban, for how long a ban should apply and whether the respondent condoned having a drink before driving.  It is worrying that 25% of the people we surveyed admitted to having taken a drink before driving.  We have different surveys in which the number of people who admit to having taken a drink before driving varies.  That arises whenever there are confusing messages being sent that it is okay to drink at certain levels and that even if people are caught, they will get away with a small fine and a penalty points offence.  This message can lead to bad judgment, with people drifting into a higher level of consumption.  Once a person starts, judgment is affected.  Drinking to blood alcohol levels of between 50 mg and 80 mg is tacit acceptance of higher drink driving levels and more concentrated alcohol in the system.</p></speech>

In recent years we have consistently seen approximately one in ten drivers admit to drinking and driving.  I support the point Ms Murdock makes in that regard.</p> <p>  A question was asked about some of the other measures the Road Safety Authority was implementing to tackle the issue of drink driving.  We have a couple of other measures which are articulated in the Government's road safety strategy.  For example, we are looking at the introduction of alco-locks as a sanction for repeat offenders.  We are also looking at the introduction of rehabilitation programmes.  These measures are specifically targeted at high risk offenders and those who are consuming alcohol at higher levels.  This is a highly complex group and the issue is separate from that which we are discussing.  International research shows that it is difficult to change the behaviour of high risk offenders because in many cases alcohol dependence is involved.  As such, we are almost straying into the realm of public health. </p> <p>  The proposed Bill has the potential to be an easy win for us because it is easier to change the behaviour of motorists who take a chance by having a couple of drinks.  It is at lower blood alcohol levels of 80 mg, below which we believe we can save lives because the proposed measure would have a strong deterrent effect.  It makes a big difference for motorists who are considering getting behind the wheel after drinking two or three pints if they know that, instead of getting a couple of penalty points and a fine, they would potentially be put off the road for three months, which would change their ability to go about their daily lives and do their job.  This has a strong deterrent effect and we know from international research that licence withdrawal is a very effective measure in deterring drink driving.  The effectiveness of the proposal is substantiated by international research.  As Ms Murdock indicated, Sweden is a good example.  It has consistently had one of the best road safety records in Europe in recent years.  It has a lower drink driving limit than Ireland and a phased disqualification system which starts from a 30 mg blood alcohol level.  It is only one example of a country that is doing this.</p></speech>

Ms Murdock has made the important point that the purpose of the Road Safety Authority is to reduce the number of deaths on the roads.  As the delegates will be aware, the representatives of a number of lobby groups who appeared before the committee some weeks ago had a clear motive for opposing the proposed legislation.  It is important to distinguish the role of the RSA from that of lobby groups in so far as they have different reasons for holding their views.  Did the RSA initiate discussion of this matter with the Minister?  </p> <p>  Ms Murdock referred to enforcement.  Will she provide an update on the RSA's ongoing work with the Garda on enforcement?</p> <p>  Ms Murdock has noted that in 52 cases there was strong evidence on the file that the driver had consumed alcohol but specific toxicology results confirming the level were not available.  What was the reason for this? </p> <p>  I am curious as to whether the RSA has evidence to show that suspending drivers would reduce the number of casualties in road traffic accidents.  Is the suspension of drivers' licences the norm in other jurisdictions at the levels prescribed in the Bill or is Ireland the first country to propose this measure?  What evidence is available in other jurisdictions to support the proposal?</p></speech>

At that point, the Road Safety Authority supported outright disqualification at the lower level.  I will be straight up and say there was significant resistance to that proposal.  I forget the name of the Minister who was in charge as it was before my time.  However, we faced significant resistance in having the measure passed at the time.  A trade-off was made and an administrative fine introduced at the lower levels of blood alcohol.  This was done to get the Bill through in some shape or form.  Before the current Minister's tenure, it was the objective of the Road Safety Authority to lower the level to 50 mg outright and have a mandatory ban across the board.  However, we have to be practical.  A start was made.  When he took office, the Minister saw the devastation caused by drink driving, in particular, the big increase in the number of road traffic casualties in 2016.</p><p>The Minister decided to move forward with an amendment to the current Bill, to revert back and say that this is obviously not working and we need to change this to a mandatory ban rather than an administrative fine.  That is some of the background.  When this was talked about in the past, it was our objective and we made recommendations but one has to be practical when it comes to legislation.  It was saving some lives but it could go further and save more.  That is why we are here today and what the pre-scrutiny is about.</p><p> We have a lot more research to hand now.  In 2011 we did not have the in-depth study and the case would not have been as compelling.  Prior to the pre-crash survey, there was a perception that 15% of crashes were alcohol related, significantly less than what we have now proved.  The impetus may not have been there to do it.  We now have unequivocal evidence and it continues on from the research we are rolling out from 2013 to 2015, inclusive.  That is where we are today.</p><p> On the work we do with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we fully accept Garda resources have been depleted over recent years.  However, we are trying to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the files we have analysed to see the critical times of the day, the days of the week, the locations, the counties and the propensity of people drinking and driving, so that it can have more strategic Garda enforcement.  It has continuous programmes, especially over bank holiday weekends and holiday periods.  It has Operation Lockdown and Surround where it surrounds a town and makes sure all roads in and out are manned.  In recent times, there has been much anecdotal evidence that there has been a much more visible presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We fully accept that effective enforcement is required hand-in-hand with legislation but the legislation, the deterrent, has to be in force in the first place.</p><p> That is some of the work we are doing.  Ms Burns's team of researchers will go through the forensic files and the collision files to continue the work we have already done.  The Garda has two statisticians who work with our people to try to ensure we get the most comprehensive information.  We are receiving much more information from the Garda on seat-belt wearing, mobile phone use and licence classification, that is, whether they are unaccompanied learners or learner drivers, so we can try to identify the underlying causes of the crashes on our roads much more quickly.  The work going on is quite comprehensive.</p></speech>

Of the most recent class to graduate, I think 100 garda&iacute; have been temporarily assigned to traffic duties for a period of six to eight weeks, as an initiation.  They will not necessarily stay there but it is as a commitment to enhancing visibility.  It is a valid point and we will have to ensure there is a commitment to this, which is delivered on.

However, there was significant and strong evidence in the file that confirmed that alcohol was a factor in the collision.  That may come from, say, a garda opinion, a witness statement or other strong evidence in the file.  As I mentioned earlier, somebody might have said that he or she was with the person all afternoon, drinking in the pub and he had consumed a certain number of pints.  There was strong evidence in the file and each file was reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure that it was validly included as an alcohol-related collision.</p></speech>

The research shows that a licence withdrawal is particularly effective in certain circumstances, when coupled with very strong enforcement, that is critical.  The phrase often quoted in this context is that there must be certainty about the withdrawal and the licence must be withdrawn swiftly.  That is really important.  Another thing that emerges is that rehabilitation measures are very effective when coupled with licence withdrawal.  This Bill is supported by international research.</p> <p>  On other jurisdictions, I mentioned Sweden earlier as a case example.  In Sweden, there is phased processing whereby disqualification starts from 30 mg and the length of licence withdrawal depends on whether someone is at 30 mg or 40 mg.  Sweden is a best practice country.</p></speech>

It is just a fact that the files indicate that that was the level that was in their blood at the time.  Maybe it was a closer period, after they had taken that drink, that they were in that car and it was a higher concentration than the people who were in the next category of 51 mg to 80 mg.  They may have had a little bit more time for the alcohol to reduce.  No, sorry, I shall let our researcher answer the question.</p></speech>

It can very much depend on campaigns, like the one that was broadcast around Christmas.  The lack of an expectation of being caught, and that is where enforcement comes in, is a factor.

The initiative changed people's attitudes and there was absolutely no change in enforcement.  The enforcement levels were the same before the initiative was introduced as afterwards.

I do not dispute that the RSA has gathered evidence.  I think there are people who try to be responsible.  They would not want to stray into the area of putting themselves at risk of getting penalty points, let alone lose a licence.  The sanctions, not the level of alcohol present, are likely to change with this legislation.  With professional drivers it is 20 mg and that rises to 50 mg and the next category is 50 mg to 80 mg, which is what we have talked about here.</p> <p>  Some mouthwashes and hand sanitiser liquids, like those used in hospitals, contain alcohol.

We cannot have zero tolerance because there are other ways that alcohol can get into one's system other than consuming alcohol for social purposes or whatever.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the important element that people use different measures, especially at home.  We see different measures in everyday life.  The size of a scone nowadays is three times the size of a scone 20 years ago so things are all relative.</p> <p>  In terms of mouthwashes and such issues, that is a red herring.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety conducts the tests in its labs in UCD and caters for this aspect.  All of this aspect has been researched.  The margin of error is fully anticipated in terms of testing someone's sample.  Eating some sherry trifle will not put one over the limit.  </p> <p>  Ms Burns may come in on this but the morning-after effect is that many people are very fatigued but there is a small trace of alcohol.  This is what we are seeing in terms of contributing factors in alcohol-related crashes.  There are other reasons that alcohol has contributed to the result of a fatal or serious crash.  </p></speech>

We ask road users to be sensible.  We want them to know that if they get behind the wheel in the morning but had ten pints beforehand that they should do the maths.  For example, one of the messages that we have communicated previously was that it takes about an hour for a unit of alcohol to be processed by the body.  People need to exercise personal responsibility and use common sense to a certain extent.  It is a complicated science and we defer to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for the detail on this matter.</p></speech>

That may be the case but this small percentage of motorists have the potential to devastate many lives and communities, and we saw the result with Ciar&aacute;n Treacy being killed by a drink-driver.  One cannot negate such loss of life by saying it was a morning-after death because these lives are just as important.  In terms of the 1.3% of cases where alcohol was a factor at between 50 mg and 80 mg, those lives are every bit as important.  We cannot as a nation and a society allow the current situation to go on.  We cannot resist legislation just to protect people who break the law.  They are drink-drivers.</p><p>That is the first point we make.  It is not a change in levels.  We are not reducing the level of alcohol allowed, rather we are changing the deterrent and we should make no apology for doing so.  That is what is at play.  It is important to point out that we are dealing with people's lives and that we looked at the files.  Fathers, mothers and children are left behind.  It is a very important issue.</p></speech>

The figure in our report is that 5.6% of those killed were killed by drivers and motorcyclists who had a blood alcohol content of 51 mg to 80 mg.  The figure of 1.3% is irrelevant.

However, it is a valid point.  What it does do is undermine the confidence of the public in the potential of being stopped at a checkpoint.  We have to acknowledge that it has had a big impact on people who have been drinking and driving and I can only imagine the reaction of families who have lost members as a result of people drinking and driving.  They are probably asking what would have happened if they had not done so.  That is a normal reaction.  It is very important that we receive credible data from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purposes of our interventions.  We welcome the reviews and examination of this subject, but we do not want them to detract from the Bill which absolutely has the potential to save lives, regardless of other factors.  It is very important to state this is based on hard evidence from the files we have examined.  That is what we are bringing forward.  We are not bringing it forward on the basis of the number of breathalyser tests conducted.</p></speech>

The graph covering the period from 1997 to 2016 shows that many of the measures introduced have saved lives, which is very welcome.  I grew up at a time when drinking and driving was acceptable.  People did not stop because they could kill themselves or somebody else but because they might lose their licence or the cost of their insurance would increase.  The delegates are correct that there is a need for enforcement because if people think they can get away with something, they will try to do so.</p> <p>  Our job, as legislators, is to craft legislation and make sure it is fair.  I have dealt with many vested interests, including various health groups, the Catholic Church, the GAA, chambers of commerce, the IFA and residents' associations.  Certainly, I do not see vintners as a serious pressure group.  I have found them to be quite reasonable.  We all have a vested interest in what happens, including the Road Safety Authority which is interested in ensuring fewer people will be killed on the roads.  It is a personal, not a financial, interest.  A few times I have heard vintners being described as a vested interest.  Yes, they have a vested interest because they are businesspeople who are doing their best, but it is our job to try to be fair.</p> <p>  I am probably guilty of using a mobile phone and texting in the car.  I have a hands-free kit, but I use and look at Google maps while driving through the city.  In my heart and soul I know that is wrong and that I should pull in.  Does this mean that down the road, if we reduce the blood alcohol limit so low that it will save lives, we will effectively ban the use of mobile phones in cars because people are texting?  </p> <p>  As regards people who do not wear seat belts, we have a young child.  If I am sitting in the back of the car with her and she is crying, I am tempted to take her out of the seat, but I will not do so.  The delegates will understand where I am going.  We are tackling the issue of drink driving, rightly so, but will the Road Safety Authority eventually propose that the use of mobile phones in cars be banned, unless part of a hands-free kit?</p></speech>

As I stated, 60 to 70 lives a year are lost in crashes as a consequence of alcohol being a factor.  Use of a mobile phone is absolutely a factor in many crashes but not as many as alcohol and we have legislation in place to deal with the issue.  We are monitoring the position.  New legislation has been introduced in the United Kingdom to double the number of penalty points imposed.  We have other research reports covering speed, vehicles and alcohol and have one coming out on vulnerable road users which will cover the issue of use of mobile phones.  I must point out that the mobile phone element did not feature in the 867 fatal crashes to such an extent that it warrants this level of scrutiny and legislative consideration, but we will absolutely have it as part of our programme.  It is an offence to use a mobile phone in a car and many manufacturers are introducing technology to disable mobile phones.  We have an extensive programme under which we advise employers to adopt an engine on phone off policy.  Many crashes were the consequence of employers contacting employees by mobile phone to see what they were doing, but in this debate that is not relevant.  We will take whatever measures are required in time.</p> <p>  On ultimately ending up in a position where there will be zero tolerance, we have pointed out that consuming any amount of alcohol impairs driving.  We need to tackle the levels we see in our research because 78 lives a year are being lost.  That is what we are here to do.</p> <p>  On the vested interests, the Senator is absolutely right.  Vintners have a vested interest in selling more alcohol as otherwise pubs would go out of business.  We do not have a vested interest, rather we have a mandate to save lives and represent all road users.  That is what is different and why we will make interventions and propose legislation.  We have the support of the motor industry, the AA and victims' groups.  Many vested interest groups fully support this measure.  I would not go so far as to say we are a vested interest but that we have a mandate.</p></speech>

Sometimes people assume it is for financial reasons, but it can be for personal reasons.  However, we will not delve into the matter.</p><p>Is there any modern technology out there that would simply prevent someone from getting into a car and starting it?  Would that be a way forward?</p></speech>

Many countries in Europe have already rolled these out for those who have committed drink driving offences.  The alcohol interlock is installed in the car.  It is like a breathalyser.  The driver blows into the device and it is not possible to start the car unless he or she is confirmed as not having alcohol in his or her system.  We are doing a cost-benefit analysis of it and investigating its feasibility.</p></speech>

I do not know how serious it was.  He was driving a new Ford Fiesta, which has software installed which places an emergency call automatically when an accident happens.  The PSNI arrived on the scene and detected that the guy had taken alcohol and that the car had called the police on his behalf.  This eCall technology will become mandatory in all new vehicles coming out of Europe in 2018.  While we certainly do not want to rely on technology that calls the emergency services after a crash has happened, it is an indication of the prevalence of drink driving.</p> <p>  Many professional driving companies already have alcohol interlocks installed in their vehicles.  A bus company from Dundalk, I think, won the contract to supply transport for the 2012 Olympics as a consequence of having them in its coaches.  Certainly for public tendering purposes, many buyers of services are encouraging the use of the best technology available resulting in the safest drivers.  Having heavy goods vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles fitted with such devices would be very welcome.  They are a high risk group in that they carry more passengers and bigger loads, so they should be safer on the roads.</p></speech>

That is what we are about: educating road users on the impairment effect of alcohol.  That is why the proposed Bill is extremely important.  A deterrent as powerful as the loss of one's licence for three months will make road users think twice before drinking and driving, even at the lower level of two or three pints.  We believe that is critical.</p></speech>

The witnesses have made the point that the lower limit was the reason for the reduction in deaths.  Are the witnesses now putting the blame for the recent increase in deaths on the level of the threshold or the severity of the penalties?</p></speech>

We had got the low-hanging fruit up to 2011.  We have crystallised the real underlying reasons.  As I said earlier, we would have expected around 15% of crashes to be alcohol related.  We also must accept that in 2011 the number of cars on the road was declining.  We are seeing a big increase in employment and disposable income and a change in attitudes.  There is a whole new crop of young people coming out.  Drivers who are now 20 or 21 years old were only in their childhood or early teens in 2011.  The only road safety messages they heard were the safe cross code and what they got in primary school.</p> <p>  We need to change attitudes in exactly the same way as happened for the smoking ban, when zero tolerance was achieved.  We have an issue with alcohol in Ireland and it is creeping into all areas of society.  Road safety is just one element of it.  This is a measure that is needed to change attitudes and make drink driving completely unacceptable.  We have a massive cohort of young people who do not accept drinking and driving.  Unfortunately, there is a growing number who think it is okay.  While everybody does not drink and drive, there is a small number of people who do and, once they start, the problem becomes pervasive.</p></speech>

I am still confused by that evidence and I think it is undermining the witnesses' case.  If I felt one life could be saved by making whatever reduction, I would support it.  However, I have not heard conclusive evidence or explanation as to why there are more deaths between 21 mg and 50 mg.</p><p>The witness has mentioned more time and so on but if drivers are detected with levels of 35 mg or 40 mg and there have been more deaths as a result, that would offer proof but that bridge has not been crossed by the witnesses.

The Senator is almost asking us to predict why someone was not killed in a crash.  These lower levels are 20 mg to 50 mg.  Maybe the figures are higher because younger people or non-professional drivers were involved in the incidents and were more likely to crash.  We have not considered that data.  We have not considered the characteristics of those individuals compared with those with a higher level of 51 mg to 80 mg.  People were killed on the roads in incidents involving blood alcohol levels lower than 80 mg and our argument is that there should be no differentiation.  We should not be telling one group of drivers that it is okay to drink and drive at that level and another group that it is not okay.  It should not be okay for non-specified drivers to drink at that level if it is not okay for specified drivers.  When would the discrimination stop?

Nineteen people were killed as a result of a driver or motorcyclist who had consumed alcohol at a level of between 20 mg and 50 mg.  We have discussed the complexities of identifying one's alcohol level if one chooses to have a drink or two.  The difference in level could be marginal.  It is not possible for a layperson to calculate that he or she has had a certain amount of alcohol, a certain amount of time has passed since the alcohol was had and he or she now knows that his or her alcohol level is 49 mg or 51 mg.  There can be a fine line between being between those levels depending on all the factors mentioned by Ms Murdock such as one's metabolism, age and so on.  It is complex.  Our message has always been that people should never drink and drive.  Any amount of alcohol impairs driving.  This analysis shows that people are being killed by drivers who have consumed smaller amounts of alcohol.</p></speech>

I have been in pubs that are controlled places for people to drink.  The publicans have been caring, have brought people home and stopped people from getting into their cars.  The witnesses can blame the legislators in the Oireachtas rather than the vintners in respect of the issue of people drinking at house parties and getting below-cost alcohol.  Members, as legislators, have not sufficiently addressed that issue.  That is important.  I have no connection with anyone who owns a pub and have no vested interest in the drinks industry.  However, my philosophy is that in any debate nobody is 100% right and nobody is 100% wrong.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  It has been useful to tease out the issues this morning.

They have been sent in here to do a job.  I am sent in here by the public to do a job.  I do not represent vintners.  I am a publican and I have never hidden that.  I live in the pub.  The people I represent have told me that this is a crusade to further isolate people in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  On a previous occasion I attended a meeting of this committee, figures were produced which indicated between 2008 and 2012, inclusive, 35 people were killed in collisions in which alcohol levels of 20 mg to 80 mg were a factor.  I asked whether the figures involved cases such as a person walking on the footpath having had several drinks who is then struck by a car driven by a person who has taken no alcohol.  I want the details of the 35 incidents that were referred to.  I have not received the breakdown.  Do they involve incidents such as someone who had had a few drinks, chose to walk home and fell off the footpath, possibly on a dark road, and was then struck by a driver who had not been drinking?  Perhaps they involve a driver who had an alcohol level of between 20 mg and 80 mg and was minding his own business when some other person going out of his mind and doing 100 mph to 120 mph came across the road and hit him?  Was there an incident of a person going home after having one pint or with an alcohol level of between 20 mg and 80 mg who then hit black ice and that was the overriding factor in the incident?</p> <p>  I want a breakdown of those figures because the statistics indicated that 19 people were killed in collisions in which alcohol levels of 20 mg to 50 mg were a factor and 16 were killed in collisions involving drivers with alcohol levels of between 50 mg and 80 mg.  As Senator O'Mahony said, the argument put forward by the witnesses on the previous occasion is not helping their case.  There is no mention in the document given to members today of the exact figures that were referred to on the previous occasion the witnesses appeared before this committee.  I want the figures to be fairly presented and the witnesses to outline what were the real causes of the accidents.  Many people are killed while walking home.  Many people are killed on the roads while sober.  We need to get the breakdown of those figures because the public is not accepting that a fair argument is being presented to them. </p> <p>   The purpose of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is to save lives.  Members of Kerry County Council and Members of the Oireachtas who represent Kerry have highlighted locations where fatalities have been caused by poor road layouts.  A lady cycling a bicycle was killed a week ago at the top of the Upper Lewis Road in Killarney where one accesses the bypass.  I am not saying that the road layout was the cause of that accident but the design of that junction needs to be addressed.  We have been making representations for many years about places such as that or Glenflesk, where five people have been killed and the road camber is at the wrong angle in both directions.  Why is the RSA not doing something about that?</p><p>To get back to what this debate is about, I need the witnesses to bring the statistics and facts before us or to the D&aacute;il Chamber, if the Minister wishes to do that.  We need the breakdown of blame to be apportioned to the driver when he or she has between 20 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood and to categorically state that a driver with a certain level of alcohol in his or her blood was the cause of an accident or fatality.  To date, they have not done that.  I asked the same of the Minister when he sat over there a number of weeks ago.</p><p> Commercial and professional drivers who drive buses and lorries are effectively at a zero tolerance level of 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  People in rural Ireland with one vehicle, be it a van, jeep or small tractor, are categorised in the same way as that professional driver so they are at a zero tolerance level.  These people have been hit already and they only have one vehicle.  They would lose the van or jeep that they use to bring bags of meal or whatever during the day.  They use the same vehicle to go to town or a local village for a bit of socialising.  They are treated unfairly under our laws.  I asked the Minister to consider this in framing his Bill and to get rid of this unfair anomaly but he or the Department has chosen not to do so.  Why is that not being addressed in this Bill?</p><p> I want the witnesses to state categorically when a driver with between 20 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood was the cause of an accident.  To just say it is a factor is not good enough for me.</p></speech>

These numbers are very small.  I can tell the Deputy categorically that 25 drivers caused the deaths of 35 people at those low levels.  What I understand is that if the Deputy saw the names and files, he would support this Bill.  Is that what he is saying?  I will seek to see if I can provide more clarity on the personal data of those individuals.  As the chief executive of the Road Safety Authority, the Deputy can take it that from the research and extensive examination of the contributory causes, those drivers were deemed to be culpable.  We have files that are not included in those numbers that include pedestrians who fell on the road or were sleeping on the road.  They are not included in these numbers.  A significant number of pedestrians were killed in alcohol-related deaths at the much higher level of 200 mg per 100 ml of blood.  The numbers are very small and it would be completely irregular and inappropriate to give out information in a level of detail that could lead to those people being identified.  I can say the numbers categorically to the Deputy and I will seek to see if there is a way we can show him the information.  It is probably not permissible.  The only reason we got to do this was by keeping the identities of people private.  We have recognised researchers and we have done this to best practice.  We have protocols in place to permit us to do the research in the first place and we stuck to that protocol.  The people in these cases were deemed culpable and not the pedestrian.</p> <p>  With regard to the matter of van and jeep drivers, I will correct the Deputy.  They are subject to a commercial vehicle roadworthiness test but it is C and D class drivers who are professional drivers; they are the specified drivers at levels of 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  I can drive a jeep but I am not a specified driver.  What applies in this respect is the classification of one's licence, and whether one has a C or D licence.  They apply to vehicles that are 3.5 tonnes and heavier.  We should clarify that it is not an attack on rural Ireland but about making all roads safer for all users.  A jeep may be subject to a commercial vehicle test, the licence determines whether one is a specified driver.  A learner driver or a professional driver is a specified driver.  A driver is non-specified if he or she has passed the test with two years of subsequent experience, as long as that driver does not have a C or D class licence.</p></speech>

There was a forensic analysis of the file and the contributory factors were listed.  In some cases that might have been alcohol plus speed; in some cases it was alcohol and fatigue.  No percentage was apportioned.  However, we know and have mentioned on numerous occasions this morning that the scientific evidence is unequivocal that any amount of alcohol impairs driving.  Therefore, we can conclude that of the 35 people killed by drivers who had consumed alcohol leaving their level between 20 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, alcohol was a contributory factor in those collisions.  We have other reports where we have looked at speeding in particular.  International research indicates that motorists are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviour when they are under the influence of alcohol.  Therefore, they are more likely to speed, lose control on bends and fall asleep at the wheel.  There is a link between alcohol impairment when driving and other contributory factors.  There would only be a very small number of cases where alcohol would be found to be the only factor, as alcohol contributes to other risky behaviours on the road.  That is why there are multiple contributory factors in many of these collisions.</p></speech>

If we had the permission of the relatives of somebody killed as a result of a driver having 55 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood in his or her system, could the information be given out?  The levels of under 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood-----</p></speech>

Many members of families affected by road crashes have helped in our communication.  I know she would not mind me saying this but Ms Susan Gray lost her husband a number of years back as a consequences of someone who admitted taking two bottles of Miller beer.</p><p>That is exactly what we are talking about here.  We have them probably watching today and listening to the debate and they know all too well the impact on their lives and their communities of having lost their loved one as a result of somebody who thought it was okay to have a bottle or two of lager or whatever.  It just leads to all of the factors Ms Burns has outlined already.  I can imagine Deputy Danny Healy-Rae asking us to prove it to him.  Bar putting one's finger in the wound, I would be more than happy to have some of those people to come forward and say they have been victims of that type of road offence.  To bring it back to the current situation, the reality is that all they will be subject to is a penalty point endorsement and a &euro;200 fine.  That is the reality.  That is the offence and it is totally disproportionate to the consequences.  We must address that and we have an opportunity.</p><p> We hope we have covered all of the questions on the data.  We are open to take any further questions but we believe we have proven unequivocally that this measure will save lives and we seek the committee's support in moving it along with the Bill and endorsing it.  We can take satisfaction from the chart on the other measures that the Oireachtas has supported which have saved many lives over the years.  We will do the same with this measure as well.</p></speech>

If we could get this Bill through I believe there would be an immediate effect and we as the authority would immediately engage in an advertising campaign to educate people and ensure that everybody was aware of it.  It would have an immediate effect on driver behaviour.  I will go back to the small change in legislation for having a valid NCT.  Overnight, we saw there was an immediate effect.  In fact, it caused significant problems in the NCT network due to it trying to accommodate the demand by people to get their vehicles up to date.  Likewise, I believe that people will accept the change in this legislation and that there is no grey area &ndash; that they cannot drink and drive &ndash; and they will change their behaviour.</p></speech>

If one also subtracts the 20 mg to 50 mg bracket one is still looking at more than 80% of fatalities caused by other drink drivers.  Would it not be far more productive in terms of saving lives to focus on the 80%, the vast majority?  That is within the context of drink driving alone.  If we look at the overall road deaths we are looking at a far lower percentage in terms of deaths caused by drivers between 50 mg and 80 mg.  In no way do I say that any one life is less important than another.  Every one road fatality or serious injury is one too many.  I have said that here repeatedly, but would we not reap greater rewards from targeting the far higher percentages of deaths caused as a result of higher drink driving levels?  I do not hear Ms Murdock shouting from the rooftops that we do not have enough people in the traffic corps.</p></speech>

Today's debate is about the Bill.  Drink driving is a big issue in this country and I accept many lives lost are at levels above 80 mg.  Ms Burns already alluded to the fact that many of those issues are related to addiction and alcohol dependency.  That is a big societal problem for Ireland.  This is where it starts.</p> <p>  If we can stem the flow, especially in younger drivers, as new drivers are where the educational process starts.  Just because new drivers have a licence after two years and they are now 19 or 20 does not make them experienced drivers and we consider it is a big issue that they think it is okay to have a bottle or two.  If we tackle the 50 mg to 80 mg we remove the confusion and the temptation to have one or two drinks because people think they will be okay.  A significant number of people are arrested who are at the level of 80 mg to 100 mg.  A total of 400 people so far in 2016 were issued with six months' disqualification.  We believe that the impact at this level will cascade across all levels.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has left the room but I am sure he observes decision making in his own pub.  When one takes a drink or two, one's decision making changes.  One has heard the saying, "One for the ditch" and "Another one would not do any harm".  We have to stop the lax approach and the propensity to drink and drive and it has to be at this level.</p></speech>

There is no consistency in the argument.  That is why I am asking Ms Murdock these questions as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Could she be straight and say whether she considers this to be a stepping stone to 20 mg being the limit across the board?</p></speech>

If we introduce this measure it will have a demonstrable effect on the roads.  The drivers will be safer and it will cascade across the board.  We want a consistent message across the board that one cannot drink and drive.  We are not advocating zero tolerance at this point in time.  I do not suggest that is where we are going.</p></speech>

This is the only one in the drink driving category that one can escape with an administrative fine, so if we put in the mandatory ban, all drink driving offences will result in a mandatory ban.

There is a greater risk there and hence the zero tolerance.  For non-specified drivers it is an offence to drink and drive at 50 mg but at the moment one can escape with an administrative fine.  We are saying all drink driving offences should be classified the same and should result in a mandatory ban.  The fact that there are different categories of driver out there is based on risk and it is not a cop-out at all.</p></speech>

That has been something on which Professor Denis Cusack has already made a specific statement in his capacity as the coroner of Kildare County Coroner's Court.  It is not a factor.  It may be a presumption by people without the facts.  It is not an issue in these files and certainly has not been the contributory factor, and certainly not at those levels of alcohol.  A much higher level of alcohol would have been involved in those cases.</p></speech>

We have seen in other areas where there is not the penalty points option that the level of challenging in court is much higher.  Is it something that the witnesses anticipate will happen now as well in the 50 mg to 80 mg per 100 ml blood alcohol content category for non-specified drivers?  The point I am getting at here is that the time it takes for a person accused of drink-driving to come to court is already too long.  Will this not actually further delay the times for people who are accused to come to court?  At the moment, someone could have ten pints, drive home, be caught, be arrested, and drive away for months before coming into court.  I anticipate there will be more court challenges because the figures for court challenges are much higher where the penalty points option is absent.  That was not part of the regulatory impact assessment.  Do the witnesses anticipate that will have an effect?</p></speech>

In fact, it will reduce demand on courts if it acts as a deterrent, as we anticipate.  People will not engage in the activity in the first place, so they will not be issued with a mandatory ban.  Anybody already detected at 50 mg to 80 mg per 100 ml blood alcohol content is fully entitled to go to court to appeal that.  People still have the option to go to court as it stands to appeal that, so that is a draw on court resources-----</p></speech>

We have the third payment option coming in for many other traffic offences that will alleviate the pressure on courts and improve efficiencies in courts.  Some legislation will increase the demand on the courts service.  Other legislation that we are introducing later this year will improve efficiencies through the court.  This is not a valid argument.  This is about saving lives.  This is about standardising the offence of drink-driving by introducing a mandatory ban, and that is what we are here to discuss.</p></speech>

People do not want to lose their licences.  That is why they go to court to challenge these things.  The fact that people are afraid of losing their licences and end up having to go to court to challenge it proves in itself that this is a deterrent.  That indicates that this is valid.</p></speech>

Losing one's licence is losing one's licence.  The difference between the minimum period in court and the proposed change in the current legislation is three months.  It is an automatic three-month disqualification versus six months for a first offence.  My point is that there will be a far higher level of court challenges as a result of this change because people who face losing their licences will challenge that in court.  The risk is only three months of a difference.</p></speech>

My opinion is that it will deter people from drinking and driving in the first place.  Hence, they will not be stopped, will not be involved in crashes and will not be appearing in court.

Certainly, we see a number of people re-offending for different types of offences.  The difficulty we have establishing a trend is that after three years, one's penalty points are expunged.  We do not have information on people who received penalty points prior to 2014.  It is very difficult to say that.  There is also data protection.  One has one's penalty points but after three years they are expunged and there is no trend.</p></speech>

I furnished numerous examples to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, of systems from around the world.  The greatest number of alcohol-related deaths are caused by people who are well over the legal limit and well over the limit covered by this derogation.  Would it not, therefore, be the sensible thing for us to pursue placing alco-locks in every vehicle?  Would that not simply prevent the crimes from occurring in the first place?  Rather than look at those who are caught for offences, why do we not pursue that?  Why are we saying we are waiting for Europe to do it rather than to do it now ourselves?</p></speech>

There is a significant cost associated with rolling out an alcohol interlock programme.  They have been shown to be effective.  It is important to state that all of the research shows that drink drivers are a heterogenous group.  One cannot, therefore, have one solution for all drink drivers.  As I stated earlier, there are more complex issues going on with drink drivers who consume alcohol at the higher levels.  There is often a dependency issue.  They are a more difficult group in terms of changing their behaviour.  Research has shown that alcohol interlocks and rehabilitation programmes are very effective for the high risk offenders who are repeat drink driving and drink driving at higher levels.  We need tailored solutions for the range of behaviours.</p></speech>

The national fleet comprises 2.7 million vehicles.  I am not sure about the cost of an alcolock but I am sure it is in the hundreds of euro.  If we are talking about alcolocks, we are talking about mobile phone use and technology to prevent that.  We are also talking about technology to prevent someone moving a vehicle without seat belts being engaged.  All of those technologies do improve road safety and we welcome them.  Certainly, in a commercial environment, we welcome buyers of public services ensuring that contractors come with those things fitted.</p></speech>

We have our vehicle standards and are working with the EU on that.  We certainly welcome technological advancements.  For example, it should not be possible to get a vehicle without a mandatory seat belt alert in the rear of the car yet that has still not become mandatory.  We see 20% to 22% of people killed every year because they did not wear seat belts.  Yes, some of them have made that decision because they have taken alcohol but a small measure would be to have an alert to say that a person cannot drive without it.  People are innovative and will come up with ways of circumventing safety methods.</p></speech>

Taking that logic, could we not apply the same thing to speeding, which kills far more people on the roads?  We have the penalty points system at the moment and we have penalty points for speeding offences, which we know kill people.  The witnesses are saying we should not have a penalty points system for drink driving offences because we know drink driving kills people.  Why do we have a penalty points system for speeding?  Should we not apply the logic that if somebody is speeding, speeding kills people so we should disqualify that person for speeding?</p></speech>

There is a multitude of reasons a person can lose his or her licence.  Some of them relate to an accumulation of penalty points but that accumulation could be for multiple factors.  It could be for parking, speeding or other traffic offences.  There are quite a number of offences out there that accumulate penalty points.

They are the numbers of people who lose their licences for accumulating the total number of penalty points and data regarding people who are disqualified from driving for a single speeding offence, for example, if someone gets clocked driving up the motorway at 100 km/h, is taken to court and disqualified.  Could Ms Murdock give us the available figures?  It is important that we would have them because there is a strong feeling among members of the public that not enough is being done to tackle serious speeding, which is a major killer, and that people can do it far more often than drink driving.  I am not condoning any of them.  I am just talking about what the public perception is.  The public perception is that someone has a better chance of getting away with speeding than of getting away with drink driving.</p></speech>

It is not.  It is alcohol.  We will come back to the committee with those numbers but it has nothing to do with the alcohol Bill we are discussing here.  This is about saving 78 lives per year as a result of the drink driving level being between 50 mg to 80 mg.  We would be happy to look at further legislation in terms of speeding but we must be quite firm about what we are here to do today.  We are here to clarify questions about the pre-crash report on alcohol.  We have a very detailed report on speed and speed is also a killer behaviour that is combined with alcohol.  Members will see that in the report.  People make decisions as a result of drinking alcohol and also speed.  There is a lot of overlap whenever we talk about these killer behaviours.</p></speech>

The offence is an automatic disqualification for driving so dangerously that it warrants disqualification.  That is a separate issue.  Speeding offences involve different pieces of legislation.  Some could be driving causing death or driving dangerously but there is no specific offence where people drove so fast that they were disqualified.</p></speech>

That should be retrievable among the data.  It is important that the witnesses issue that information to the committee as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The chart is quite striking and what stands out is the establishment of the RSA in 2006 when the figures for road fatalities were well over 400 per annum.  Thankfully we have seen a serious reduction to 162 in 2015.  The figure went up last year, unfortunately.  The downward trend will, we hope, continue this year.  There is no room for any complacency.  I want to make the point that in the 30 years prior to the establishment of the RSA, there was a reduction of just one third in road fatalities.  Since then we have seen a huge reduction.  We never know who they are but there are hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people who are walking around today in Ireland who would not be here without the work of the RSA and the other State agencies tasked with reducing road fatalities and serious injuries.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the representatives and the RSA for the work and efforts in this area.</p></speech>
