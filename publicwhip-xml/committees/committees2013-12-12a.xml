Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.   I note that there are no matters arising from the minutes.  The minutes of yesterday's meeting will be before the committee at its meeting next week.  </p><p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since the meeting of Thursday, 27 November.  No. 3A is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 29 November 2013, from Dr. Ruaidhr&iacute; Neavyn, president of Waterford Institute of Technology, regarding further information requested at the meeting of 10 October.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 5 December 2013, from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, parliamentary and regulatory affairs division, HSE, on foot of further information requested at the meeting of 14 November.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3B is individual items of correspondence received.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 24 November 2013, from Ms Mary Farrell, Karinya, Johnstown Bridge, Enfield, regarding Headway (Ireland) Limited.  The correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to the HSE for a note on the issues raised.</p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence received on 27 November from an anonymous source regarding Stewarts Hospital in Palmerstown.  The correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to the HSE for a note on the issues raised.  </p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 21 November 2013, from Councillor Paudge Reck, Mulgannon, Wexford, regarding further correspondence related to County Wexford VEC.  The correspondence is to be noted and the committee will follow it up with Councillor Reck personally.  </p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 26 November 2013, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, regarding the Institute of Technology, Tralee.  The correspondence is to be noted.  </p><p>  No. 3B.5 is correspondence, dated 22 November 2013, from Ms Anne Nolan, Montenotte Park Residents Association, regarding concerns about the use of funds allocated for school buildings.  The correspondence is to be noted.  </p><p>  No. 3B.6 is correspondence, dated 3 December 2013, from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, parliamentary and regulatory affairs division, HSE, regarding St. Catherine's special school.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3B.7 is correspondence, dated 2 December 2013, from Mr. John O'Brien regarding an outline submission by the FCPS on the penalty points issue.  The correspondence is to be noted.  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has requested to make an oral submission to the committee.  We are scheduled to commence the examination of the penalty points issue on 23 January 2014.  We can use the material Mr. O'Brien has given to us as it is relevant to the issue of weaknesses in controls.  It will be a matter for the committee to invite him to make an oral submission once we have concluded the examination of the issue with the Accounting Officer.</p><p>  I want to return to No. 3B.5, correspondence, dated 22 November 2013, from Ms Anne Nolan, Montenotte Park Residents Association, regarding concerns about the use of funds allocated for school buildings.  There is a clear conflict between the residents association and the Department.  While the core issue is whether there is a need to build a school, the Committee of Public Accounts can only examine issues where the Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a report on an issue.  This matter warrants further investigation and the Comptroller and Auditor General is free to examine it in the context of his audit of the Appropriations Account of the Department of Education and Skills.  I will ask the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to examine the matter in more detail as it falls within its remit.</p><p>  No. 3B.8 is correspondence, dated 6 December 2013, from Mr. William Treacy regarding the lack of investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General of animal welfare issues.  The correspondence is to be noted.  </p><p>  No. 3B.9 (a-d) is correspondence received on 9 December from Mr. Lar Bradshaw regarding correspondence to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts further to meeting the Committee of Public Accounts on 26 June.  The correspondence is to be noted.  It is relevant to today&rsquo;s meeting.  It is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts to amend a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General who is entirely independent of the committee.  The committee will issue a report at the conclusion of its examination of the DDDA.  The issue raised by Mr. Bradshaw can be  dealt with in that report.  As regards the issue of the circulation of draft reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, again, given the independence of his office, the issue is not one for the committee.</p><p>  No. 3C is documents relating to today's meeting.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence received on 12 December from Mr. Paul Maloney, former chief executive officer of the Dublin Docklands Development Agency, regarding his opening statement which we will hear shortly.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting of 27 November.  No. 4.1 is the annual report and accounts 2011 of Leitrim County Enterprise Board.  There is a clear audit opinion in respect of all county enterprise boards.  Members can read the remainder of the reports that have been published.  The accounts are noted.</p><p>  No. 5 is the work programme which is on screen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200003#B01000"><p>Many issues were raised at the meeting with the Central Remedial Clinic.  I seek clarity on exactly where we will go from here in regard to the CRC.  I presume we will ask representatives of the Mater Hospital to attend next week's meeting, with representatives of the HSE.  On the absence of Mr. Conlon, considering that Mr. Kiely was forthcoming and decent enough to attend yesterday and considering that, from our discussions yesterday and the correspondence circulated by the HSE, we know the HSE had written to the CRC, of which Mr. Conlon was a board member, on more than 20 occasions, telling it not to proceed with his appointment, asking questions about his remuneration and pension, the lack of an open competition for the position and prior approval, I imagine Mr. Conlon's attendance is now more important than ever.  I want to know what we are doing about it.  Do we intend to formally encourage him to attend and request that he do so or are we intending to go down the compellability route?  I know that different views have been expressed by members and that every member is entitled to his or her view, but I reiterate that it is my view that the board of the CRC, in its totality, should resign with immediate effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200003#B01300"><p>I agree with virtually everything Deputy Simon Harris said, but I would go further and say we want to see Mr. Conlon.  He has said he is not coming.  I do think, therefore, that there is any point in asking him again to do so.  We should go straight for compellability powers and look to him to answer questions.  There are many questions about him to be answered, into which I will not go, and we should go to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to ask for these powers.  When we seek them, perhaps he might decide to come under the threat of their use, but we should go through with it and take that step because the Committee of Public Accounts cannot be treated in that way, as otherwise it would set a very bad precedent.  </p><p>  The entire board should resign.  Deputy Simon Harris has said representatives of the Mater Hospital should come.  Last night they issued a statement which goes some way towards explaining what was happening.  It does not explain it totally, but it goes some way towards explaining it.  However, we need clarity and to talk to them.  If the representatives of the HSE are coming next week and they are going to look at the Mater Hospital also, it would be appropriate to have representatives of the hospital here with them at the same time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200003#B01400"><p>I call Deputy Eoghan Murphy who will be followed by Deputies Kieran O'Donnell and Robert Dowds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200003#B01500"><p>In addition to that point, I also want to ask about managing our work programme.  We have to examine section 38 agencies and their compliancy.  While the CRC issue is extremely important and there are many more matters to be examined, we cannot let it dominate our investigation into section 38 agencies.  I am wondering if we need to open up a side track for the CRC, while keeping a focus on the other agencies that also have difficulties, as we know, arising from the audit report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200003#B01600"><p>I agree with Deputy Shane Ross that during the proceedings yesterday - at 1.44 p.m. to be precise - Mr. Conlon issued a statement which he directed towards the Committee of Public Accounts on foot of my questioning yesterday.  I made reference to the fact that he had been overpaid by a top-up payment of &euro;40,000 above the agreed salary level with the HSE and that I believed it should have been refunded to the CRC, rather than the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200004#C00200"><p>As the person with the closest contact with staff in parts of the CRC I agree with the previous speakers who have called for the resignation of the board.  It is really important in terms of the integrity of the CRC that it would happen as soon as possible.  I agree with the points made about the knock-on effect on the charity sector generally.</p><p>  I also agree that Mr. Conlon should be compelled to come before the committee as a witness.  I seek clarification in that regard because no one has yet been compelled to come before the committee.  I am aware that we are trying to get Mr. Merrigan to appear before the committee.  I would like some guidance as to what the situation is in that regard given that one has an implication for the other.  Once the committee has established the right to insist on people coming they are less likely to refuse to come when asked.</p><p>  I sent an e-mail to the PAC asking that other voluntary bodies such as Enable Ireland would be brought before the committee.  There is a need for a wider examination of how the voluntary bodies in the health sector are operating.  I wish to add my name to the list of members who will ask questions during the course of the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/988" speakername="&Aacute;ine Collins" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200004#C00300"><p>I agree with my colleagues.  If we are broadening the inquiry to section 38 agencies, could we also extend our remit to section 39 agencies which do similar work but they were reformed?  I understand the HSE is due before the committee next week.  Before then I would like to ask it what the position is with the interim CEO on foot of yesterday&rsquo;s discussion.  An interim CEO should be appointed immediately from outside the staff who were there, as was discussed yesterday.  I wish to put the HSE on notice that we require a response in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200004#C00400"><p>Next Thursday the Department of Health and the HSE will be before the committee.  After yesterday&rsquo;s meeting I asked Barry O&rsquo;Brien to ensure that someone who is knowledgeable about the entire matter on the HSE side would attend.  I suggest that we should ask for someone directly connected with the fund to come along as well.  Yesterday also, I asked Ms McGuinness for the report of today&rsquo;s meeting and an update on other matters that were discussed at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.  We can ask about the CEO again on Thursday.  The relevant witnesses will be present to provide further updates on yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Murphy, following that, we can decide on our work programme in terms of who else we will invite to attend.  Let us see the lists that are forthcoming and the information provided by the HSE and the Department of Health next Thursday and then we can decide specifically what we want to do.</p><p>  There is no report before us on section 39 organisations.  I feel strongly that having looked at the section 38 organisations there is a need to look at section 39 organisations as well.  We have to deal with that as a committee in order to bring in witnesses.  I am supportive of that proposal.</p><p>  The other matter that was discussed was in relation to Mr. Conlon.  I have been following his public comments.  I was not aware until Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell mentioned it that he had released a statement yesterday while the meeting was taking place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200004#C00500"><p>It was sent directly to the PAC secretariat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200004#C00600"><p>I did not see it until now.  I have just read it.  The clerk made a significant effort to have Mr. Conlon appear before the committee and we have no other option but to seek compellability.  We should immediately do so.  Deputy Dowds inquired about the compellability process.  As I understand it, we must apply to the CPP.  If it is the wish of the committee I will ask the clerk to do so today so that we would set the wheels in motion to make that happen as soon as possible because Mr. Conlon is doing untold damage to the sector by his megaphone diplomacy and refusing to appear before the PAC.  We will move immediately to secure compellability.  We will speak to our legal advisers about framing the letter and making the application.</p><p>  We have already applied for compellability in terms of the investigation on the SIPTU-HSE fund.  As I understand it, we have had no reply to date.  Is it two months since we made the application?</p></speech>

It is not good enough that the PAC would be stalled in its tracks by another committee of the House.  The CPP needs to deal with the application by the PAC for compellability relative to the SIPTU case and our new letter of application relating to Mr. Conlon.  I urge the CPP to give us a speedy response on the matter and to allow us to get on with our work.</p></speech>

Under its terms, guidelines were to be introduced to deal with the situation.  We do not wish to rush into compellability before the guidelines appear because we could end up in the courts.  That is the reason we are proceeding with caution in terms of our application on the SIPTU officials and Mr. Merrigan.  I will speak again to the CPP.  My understanding is that the guidelines are being legally tested as we speak and that they will be ready after Christmas.  That is what I was told.  My concern is that we do not end up offside.  That is the only issue that is delaying the matter.</p></speech>

I believe one of them was Deputy O'Donnell's question about the sale of that company, and they said they would give some of the information today.  Can we remind them about that?</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with the timeframe the Chairman outlined in terms of having the HSE and the Department of Health in next week but are we envisaging that we will have a programme of work then in January?  As the Chairman knows, this debacle is doing untold damage to the disability and the charity sectors and it would be helpful if we knew where we were going or will we still be talking about this in March?  Logistically, how will we do it?</p></speech>

When we narrow it down to the numbers we will know exactly what we need to do and we cannot do that until after the meeting today is reported on next Thursday.  We can make a decision at that stage.</p><p>  We have dealt with the work programme.  Our business for next week is as we outlined earlier.  We have a sub-group on Tuesday in regard to the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  On Thursday we will have the meeting, as we described earlier, and we will ask for the representatives of the Mater hospital and the others to come in.</p><p>  Mr. Maloney has been waiting since 10 a.m.  That is partially my fault and I want to apologise to him but before I ask him in I reiterate, on behalf of members, that people should continue to support the charities in terms of the support for the front-line services they offer.  While the Committee of Public Accounts in my opinion did an excellent job yesterday and will continue to force the types of reforms that are necessary to restore public confidence in that sector, it is important for them to have that support at this time of the year.</p></speech>

That is the reality of the situation on foot of the work done in the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday.  This is a collective group but for me it is about the people up and down the country who are fund-raising for charities, and the service users.

Similar issues were raised at the time in terms of people being reluctant to donate to the Irish Red Cross as a result of what was being discovered in our examinations but if I recall, one of the shortcomings we found at the time, and I believe it is in the report, is that the Charities Act had not been brought into force.  I would have to look at it again but I think we might have said something to the fact that this should be done.  In terms of what has happened in recent weeks and what will continue to be discovered over the next few weeks and months, that legislation must be proceeded with.</p></speech>

During the meeting yesterday we got numerous calls from RTE asking us to ensure mobile phones are switched off because it had a huge amount of interference as members were speaking.</p><p>  I advise the witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the House nor an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 163 that the committee should also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Paul Maloney, former chief executive officer of Dublin Docklands Development Authority, and Ms Eileen Quinlivan, acting chief executive officer of Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to introduce the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200005#D01800"><p>At previous meetings, I outlined the financial difficulties of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 2010, which was the first year in respect of which my office was required to carry out an audit of the authority&rsquo;s financial statements.  The report was compiled in that context, and chapter 2 outlines the nature of the financial difficulties.  Chapter 3 provides an overview of the authority&rsquo;s participation in a joint venture with private developers to buy and develop the Irish Glass Bottle Company site in Poolbeg, which was a key factor contributing to the authority&rsquo;s financial position.  The final chapter of the report gives an overview of the operation of the authority&rsquo;s planning function.  It also outlines the implications for the authority of losing the High Court case concerning the North Quay Investments Limited development in October 2008, and the subsequent revision of the authority&rsquo;s key planning processes.</p><p>  Given that the focus of today&rsquo;s meeting is the Irish Glass Bottle Company site joint venture, I will briefly mention the key findings in that regard.  On 25 October 2006, the authority and its partners in a joint venture company called Becbay Limited submitted a bid of &euro;412 million to acquire the Irish Glass Bottle Company site.  Other related expenses brought the total acquisition cost to &euro;431 million, of which &euro;291 million was bank borrowing.</p><p>  The authority provided equity and loan funding for the joint venture up front, and guaranteed the repayment of a share of the Becbay Limited loans, which were initially provided by Anglo Irish Bank.  Following a deal done with the National Asset Management Agency on 27 July 2011, the final cost to the authority of its involvement in the Irish Glass Bottle Company site venture was around &euro;52 million.</p><p>  During October 2006, the authority&rsquo;s management presented to the executive board of the authority an assessment of the level of investment, benefits and risks of the Irish Glass Bottle Company site project, but there is no evidence that a detailed analysis of those factors, commensurate with the scale of the proposed investment, was carried out.  Management advised the board that the property market in 2006 was overheated, but they nevertheless recommended the investment to achieve the authority&rsquo;s strategic objectives in Poolbeg.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maloney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200006#E00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee, for the invitation to this forum.  I thank you especially because for four years I have watched aghast as Niamh Brennan issued report after report on the DDDA without ever offering an opportunity for those involved to present their views or have a say.  These reports were leaked to RTE when only the Minister and Niamh Brennan had them in their possession, depriving all participants any natural justice in being able to defend themselves and creating overall the most negative one-sided destruction of the reputation of the DDDA and containing the most grievous accusations which have since been withdrawn or discredited.</p><p>  Therefore, from every perspective, I most welcome the stepping in of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The committee has commissioned a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which examines in depth all aspects of the DDDA's operations in a balanced, thorough and fair manner and, more importantly, from an independent perspective, and has invited me and other participants to come and be questioned, something I have been denied the past four years.  I most wholeheartedly relish this opportunity.  I was not obliged to accept this invitation as I am no longer an accountable officer and have not been for many years, but I am here of my own volition because I can no longer stand aside as so much misinformation and untruth have been printed about this deal.  I wanted to come here to truthfully and honestly tell you exactly what transpired and why.  As I had no institutional backing to come here, I want to thank Mr. McEnery, Mr. John Crawley in the authority and Arthur Cox for helping research the information for today.</p><p>  In the DDDA, what I experienced was a dedicated staff, a board committed to excellence and a community at one with what we were doing and aspiring to achieve - the total transformation of a run-down, derelict and disenfranchised area and community.  What we have achieved has not only been recognised nationally but has been highly respected internationally.</p><p>  It is said that the membership of the board by directors of Anglo Irish Bank contributed to the unfairly critical comments that the DDDA received.  If that is so, then I am here to tell you most truthfully that I never saw an act or comment or interference by an Anglo Irish Bank board member, or any director for that matter, that was not singly focused on what was within the code of conduct for the Docklands board and in the sole interests of the authority's objective.</p><p>  I have never experienced the private interests of board members being raised by members other than by leaving a board meeting if they believed there was a conflict of interest.  The truth is that Mr. Bradshaw, from whom you have directly heard, and his successor Mr. O'Connor, in my view, discharged their duties with utmost propriety and professionalism, and not a scintilla of evidence has ever been brought forward to suggest otherwise.</p><p>  That Ms Brennan was able to make such completely unsubstantiated accusations without asking either the board members who served on the board or a single member of the executive who witnessed the entire process for ten years, and without producing evidence, is highly regrettable and deplorable.  That the Committee of Public Accounts has rectified to a great extent this injustice through this fair and independent report and through its invitation to members to attend does not absolve the company of the lamentable lack of corporate governance in the Brennan report and commentary.</p><p>  I reiterate also that while undoubtedly mistakes were made, and I am here to acknowledge and take accountability for those myself, I and the executive also acted with total probity and transparency in all our dealings on the purchase of the IGB with one single objective in mind - the improvement of the economic and social conditions in the area.  I believe the files and records utterly reflect that transparency.</p><p>  First, let me reiterate that I regard the Comptroller and Auditor General's report as fair, independent and, more importantly, fact-based, and completely devoid of the incorrect and unsubstantiated conclusions that are in the Brennan report.  I want to deal with two critical aspects.  The statement I am about to make has never been published in any media or ever stated anywhere.  The report confirms that not one cent of taxpayers' money was ever received or spent by the DDDA, and the DDDA confirmed this to me last week - the Comptroller and Auditor General, of course, finished in 2010.  It confirmed to me that it will never request taxpayers' money at any time in the future.  It will close the authority and hand a significant sum back to the Exchequer.  Is there a single media outlet that has reported that?  It is my hope that the committee's report to the Oireachtas will dispel any notion that the DDDA lost taxpayers' money.</p><p>  Second, with regard to the IGB site or any other project, in the ten years since its inception the DDDA has never received Exchequer funds.  As a property company it made a profit of &euro;130 million, lost &euro;52 million on IGB site and made a net profit of &euro;30 million - a gain which it invested in Docklands.  There is a table in the written materials showing that.  Most of that investment generated &euro;2 billion in foreign direct investment.  Even after what happened with the IGB site, there was no bailout of the authority with taxpayers' money - misinformation that has been spread not by this committee but by others - and it has paid off its own debt with its own assets which it continues to sell today.  The Comptroller and Auditor General would not have been aware of this as it was not stated in the report, because it has been happening since then.  This may be compared to any other private property company.  The DDDA was set up by the former Ministers for the Environment and Finance, Deputies Howlin and Quinn - very properly, in my view, as a company that was independent of taxpayers - but it was a property company.  If any other company were in that position today, the country would be in a different place.</p><p>  Thankfully, the Comptroller and Auditor General specifies to this committee two instances in which taxpayers' money was lost, but not by the DDDA.  First of all - I thank the Chairman for stating this publicly - the failure to close a loophole in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 cost the State at least &euro;130 million.  In fact, in the last committee meeting with Mr. Bradshaw, the Comptroller and Auditor General raised that to a potential figure of &euro;275 million.  This was something that was highlighted by the Law Reform Commission and not acted upon.  As I said, I thank the Chairman for highlighting this.</p><p>  Second, we entered a loan arrangement with a private bank independent of public funds but a State decision in the form of a bank guarantee years later and the nationalisation of banks years later resulted in the loss to the taxpayer on the IGB site.  This was a decision that was completely outside the remit of the DDDA.  I will leave the judgment on the fairness of all this to others, because we are at this table without having lost taxpayers' funds, and the two instances above are not here.  This report was drafted and issued without me or any other member of the former board or executive - that is not a criticism - seeing it or having an opportunity to comment on it.  Therefore, I must ask your indulgence to inform the committee about two critical aspects of the report.</p><p>  In the statement on page 37, which has now been reiterated by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is stated that I personally, as chief executive, sent a letter to the Department of the Environment stating that we expected to pay only &euro;220 million for the IGB site.  That statement is totally untrue.  I was not the author of the letter; I did not see the letter before it was sent; I did not sign the letter.  I have the letter here; it is not my signature.  I have the legally based evidence to prove it.</p><p>  In preparation for this appearance, I was permitted access to the data room at Arthur Cox, which carried out full discovery on all DDDA correspondence.  This had recorded that the letter was produced and sent to only two persons on the executive without circulation to me.  That would be normal because in that case I had delegated it to a senior manager with 20 years' experience of dealing with the Department of the Environment.  This is very important, Chairman.  When the departmental official dealing with ministerial sanction responded, he circulated it only to the two officials who had sent it.  All of this is on a legal file.  When I saw the letter at a board meeting a week later, I immediately set about correcting its contents.  The statement that I am about to make now was not in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I brought the matter up at a board meeting and the official who wrote the letter corrected the sale price to &euro;375 million.</p></speech>

He is not obliged to so it is appreciated.  It must be noted we are talking about a series of events that took place seven years ago.  No doubt Mr. Maloney has been following the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts and how we have dealt with the subject to date.  He will have noted the various people who appeared before the committee, including, over the course of this year, former DDDA chairman Lar Bradshaw and the former representative of the Department, Ms Moylan.</p><p>  We have gone through a series of events that happened in the period from 2 October to 24 October.  I want to go through them today with Mr. Maloney because there are still some gaps in our knowledge that I want to try to fill.  In order that Mr. Maloney will have the relevant documentation, he should note we are talking about the two letters that issued to the Department on 2 October and 12 October, the board minutes of 3 October, 20 October and 24 October, and two reports that were issued in relation to Poolbeg.  One of the reports was in relation to the site, and it was circulated at the meeting on 3 October.  The second was in relation to the acquisition, and it was circulated on 20 October.</p></speech>

The council meeting, which was separate from the board, was a meeting with the local interest groups.  At that meeting it was suggested that the authority might involve itself in the Poolbeg site, is that correct?</p></speech>

As I said in my statement, that was done as the purchase of this site had been on the agenda for quite some time because the site beside it had been bid upon by the authority in 1997, before I joined.  The authority had failed to achieve that site.  It had always earmarked the purchase in this area and its master plan had earmarked this site as a development.  So my riding instructions were simply to do nothing but explore the possibility.</p></speech>

One was to purchase it ourselves.  I quickly looked at the independent valuation that had been completed and realised that was not possible.  The second way was to do it as a joint venture, which was in our Act and we had done it many times before.  I discussed with the chairman some names that I would approach.  The criteria for choosing those names were - was the developer trustworthy to deliver community gain; was the developer capable of dealing with one of the biggest sites in the city; and was the developer obviously interested in developing such a site?  Also, was the developer someone who had a renowned reputation for delivering high quality developments?  Those were my criteria and I came up with very few names that would fit them.</p></speech>

I said: "I have a second name to propose to you."  The reasons I proposed Bernard McNamara were fourfold.  I had just joined the authority so I had never met or heard of Mr. McNamara, other than through the media, but I had seen the records of my executive of the joint venture that we had already done in docklands with Mr. McNamara.  The first criteria I laid down were trust and development of the community, and he had delivered on both of those.  The second was capability - he was the biggest developer in Dublin.  The third one was exemplary developments; he had just finished the Shelbourne Hotel and that was highly lauded by many people as a great restoration.  So I felt I should put it to the chairman to possibly explore a deal with Mr. McNamara.  I felt confident.  I had ruled out so many others on those criteria, so I felt that was right.</p></speech>

For instance, they state, &ldquo;a developer who had indicated an intention to bid for this site&rdquo;.  Mr. Maloney approached Mr. McNamara because he thought he would be a good candidate to go into a joint venture with and informed Mr. Bradshaw of that.  Mr. Maloney then approached Mr. McNamara.  However, the way it is written in the minutes is that the developer had an intention to bid for the site of which the authority was aware and the developer would then welcome the involvement of the authority jointly in the tender.  Was Mr. Maloney aware that Mr. McNamara was interested in the site?</p></speech>

When I rang Mr. McNamara, whom I had never met or known, to tell him we were thinking of bidding for this site and we would like to explore the possibility of a joint venture, he told me he was already considering bidding for it.  He used the words &ldquo;I have been looking into that myself&rdquo;.  I worded that exactly as he had said to me so the board would be aware of it.</p></speech>

Mr. Maloney prepared a paper for the board on 2 October for the meeting on 3 October, which was held abroad.  In that paper, it was quite clear Mr. Maloney was making recommendations.  Conclusion 11.1 reads: &ldquo;Decision - the board has authorised the executive to approach a suitable developer in line with option B, the option being that the authority selects a developer of high calibre of the joint bid.&rdquo;  My point is that there was a conclusion and recommendation already in the paper.</p></speech>

What I had to do was to get authorisation from the board, which I had not received to that date, to explore the possibility - it is worded very carefully - &ldquo;to approach a suitable developer in line with option B&rdquo;.  I believe the Deputy will acknowledge it is not a decision to go with that developer.</p></speech>

We had our own RICS, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, professional surveyors in the authority who updated that valuation for the sub-committee, referred to earlier by the Deputy, of 5 October 2005 to do with the port&rsquo;s involvement.  We had a full valuation from an independent RICS valuer who put into that the entire parameters one would put into valuing a site.  It included everything from office investment, income, expenditure, acquisition costs, construction costs, cost of debt, etc.  We then asked our professional valuers to extrapolate three parameters, namely, plot ratio, the number of units per hectare and the comparability of sites selling in the area.  In my opening statement, I mentioned that sites had just sold for between &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million an acre while we were bidding &euro;20 million an acre.  I had a team comprising a barrister who had spent 20 years working with the authority on property engagement, a finance director who had done all the development with IGB, as well as advice from Goodbody and CBRE&rsquo;s valuation report.  In the minutes of 3 October, the Deputy will note we took informal advice from the market.</p><p>  Putting together all these parameters, I reported on 3 October that the site would vary between &euro;300 million to &euro;350 million in terms of the extrapolation of these parameters.  During Mr. Bradshaw&rsquo;s presentation, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated this was to become practice.  These parameters are not put in by some amateur method but into an expensive computer program, the Circle-Time RICS program, which we had on site because we had a full development team.  I was able to bring all of these criteria to the board that we were using and explain to it why it would vary.</p></speech>

This is the first time the board has heard that there is an interested developer which it can approach to go into a joint venture with.  A detailed paper is prepared for it relating to the development site of Poolbeg.  In paragraph 3.2 of the minutes, it states that after a careful consideration of the proposal and subject to being satisfied that the proposed involvement of the authority in the tender process and the future development of the site would not breach public procurement rules, the board agreed that the executive could open negotiations with the potential tender partner with a view to formulating a joint bid.

First, the authority had 20 years of doing joint ventures.  The entire Bord G&aacute;is site was developed that way.  Second, in order to parallel these while not committing the authority to a single commitment, which was very important, we were able to get the procurement advice.  It was our desire and final achievement to have that procurement advice before we committed the board of the authority to any decision.</p></speech>

It is just that there are a few documents around the same dates.  We are moving into the process of seeking ministerial sanction and it is quite important.

I had just joined the authority and asked Mr. Neil Mulcahy, who was director of property.  It was probably his suggestion to phone around and see what was happening in the market, which is very important.  We had worked with virtually all the property agents in the development of the Bord G&aacute;is site.  I had never worked with them and he was familiar with all of them.  I believed he phoned probably the top four or five.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maloney" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200011#K03000"><p>When we raised the issue at the board meeting of the 24th, Mr. Mulcahy made it clear that he put it in because it was the current formal independent evaluation for the authority.  The error I noticed - it was obvious that Ms Moylan also saw it as an error - was that the words "in the region of" should not have been used.  The word "excess" was used earlier in the letter and it should have been used in this context.  It was construed as an error because it simply used the book value.  It was also construed that it was in no way meant to be misleading to the Department because the e-mails are clear.  The e-mail that immediately came from the departmental official, which is not mentioned in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, referred to the process but did not mention the figure.  The e-mail was not sent to me because the official knew I was not involved.  The assistant secretary, who is a woman of the highest integrity and experience, has confirmed that she was not making a case to the Department or the Minister; she was looking for a borrowing requirement and the sanction to get involved with a joint venture.  This is her evidence.  Clearly I was not privy at the time but having read her evidence I am now privy to the matter.  That is the reason nobody corrected the letter between the 12th and the 24th, when Mr. Mulcahy and I raised it in order to draw her attention to it before ministerial sanction was issued.</p><p>  This is a critical factor.  It was not mentioned in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the Deputy will indulge me, I will explain why I am so exercised by the matter.  For three years, the media claimed that I wrote a letter.  There were suggestions of a lack of integrity or attempts to mislead.  There is no more formal legal record in any semi-State or State body than the minutes of the executive board's meetings.  One can have all the reports one wants but the minutes are the formal legal record and I draw the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General to them.  I do not want to cast aspersions against him but I have to pull this together.  The minutes state that we informed the highest official in the Department that the figure was wrong in advance of receiving ministerial sanction.</p><p>  I must also emphasise a second issue.  Ms Moylan has been very honourable and honest in this regard.  She was not only representing the Department on the board; she was also the person in the Department who was responsible for getting ministerial sanction.  I am here to correct any suggestion that I did not recognise I was informing the highest official formally and legally that the figure was wrong and must be corrected immediately.  The probity and integrity of everybody involved was never such that there was an intention to mislead.  This was a highly experienced team on both sides.  Ms Moylan clearly stated to the committee that she never saw it as a conflict.  She also said - and this is minuted - that she was the same official who was responsible for seeking that sanction.  She construed it as building a borrowing case rather than a business case.  I apologise for spending time on this issue but I had to make these comments.</p></speech>

Under the heading of "proposed site acquisition" the letter states that an evaluation prepared by the authority indicates that, at a reasonable density of commercial and residential development, the value of the site would be in the region of &euro;220 million.  It stated in respect of the financing requirements that, under this scenario, the joint venture partner would hold at least 51% of the equity, again at a cost of &euro;60 million and that the intention is that the remaining debt financing of approximately &euro;100 million required to complete the acquisition would be secured against the property to be acquired and arranged and borne by the JVC.  The significance of that statement is by that stage it had been proposed to set up a 50:50 partnership in the joint venture requiring &euro;120 million to be provided by the partners and a further &euro;100 million to be borrowed, for a total of &euro;220 million.  I have to disagree, therefore.  While the case was certainly in support of the application to extend the borrowing requirement, it was couched in terms of a venture priced at &euro;220 million.  That has to be the construction drawn from the letter sent on the 17th.</p></speech>

Having seen, between the 17th and the 20th, that the wrong figure was being used, we corrected it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated in his report - I am not casting aspersions - that we did not formally correct that with the Department.</p></speech>

We followed the papers that went right up the line.  There was a submission on 19 October 2006 to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Again, it was based on the same information and referred to the value of the site of approximately &euro;220 million.  The final recipient was r&uacute;na&iacute; Aire, and the secretary to the Minister marked it as follows: "Discussed with Minister.  He agreed in principle subject to [I think] approval of Minister for Finance as required."</p></speech>

I must continually say to Deputy Eoghan Murphy and this committee that we did not bid until 25 October.  Ministerial sanction did not issue until 24 October.  At 8 a.m. on 24 October I formally and legally informed the same departmental official that there was an error in the &euro;220 million and I corrected it.  We do not disagree.  I accept Mr. McCarthy's interim letters, but the final legal correction of the authority's position, and Mr. McCarthy refers to a letter from the Department, not the authority, took place at 8 a.m. on 24 October and the Minister's representative said the Minister would issue sanction later that day.  In front of this committee she has stated that she recollects and accepts that we corrected the figure on that date.  Mr. Bradshaw also said this to the committee.  We do not disagree.  From my representation I must give true evidence to this committee that I corrected it in advance of ministerial sanction and that is important to the integrity of me and my team.  The record I have with me shows that, and Mr. McCarthy does not disagree with paragraph 8.3 of that document of 24 October, does he?</p></speech>

I understand that to mean that the Department's sanction was based on those representations.  At the same time she was aware, as were all the other members of the board, that a considerably greater sum was being discussed.  That is the conflict of interest that any public servant may find themselves in.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Eoghan Murphy may have asked the question.  She said that no, she did not see it as a conflict because her role was to increase the borrowing, not make a business case.  Rather than delay the committee, I came here today to correct the statement in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which says the Department was not formally informed of the new figure in advance of ministerial sanction.  It was.  My timing, 8 a.m. on 24 October, meant that official had every opportunity to return to the Department, which she did, and correct it.  She honestly said she did not need to because, as Mr. McCarthy correctly said, the borrowing was no longer &euro;100 million but only &euro;50 million, so she did not feel we were exceeding our borrowing limits.</p></speech>

As somebody who has never been in a Department and came in from a completely different sector I had no idea how Department operated.  This person was on the board for many years.  I had been to the Department once or twice and she was clearly one of the highest ranking members there.  I assumed, and I think it was fair, that the issues of conflicts and procedures in the Department were all being dealt with while I was oblivious to them.  That is not just an assumption.  It was the position as I saw it on 24 October.</p></speech>

Paragraph 3.2 noted what this figure was based on and it was on that basis that the authority would make inquiries.  She did not say it there and I do not think it is fair for me to give my recollection at this stage because it was so long ago, but in answer to the Deputy's clear question, I want to give a clear answer, which Mr. Bradshaw also gave.  First, I had no doubt my formal notification to the second highest official in the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the circumstances had changed was clear and, second, it was not the first time.  At the meeting of 3 October valuations were being given of between &euro;300 million and &euro;400 million, at which the same person was present; therefore, I was quite comfortable that the Department knew, but I cannot comment on the internal workings of the Department because I was not privy to them.</p></speech>

There was a figure of &euro;240 million based on a 2005 CBRE valuation and that is sourced in the document of 20 October.  There is a valuation of &euro;250 million - a typo - in the minutes of the meeting of 24 October.  The next valuation is &euro;268 million, an internal figure mentioned in the document of 20 October, and then there is a figure of &euro;300 million based on the DDDA's internal figure, the source for which is the document dated 3 October.  We do not know why that was not referenced in the letter of 12 October.  We have a valuation of &euro;350 million based on the site sold in East Wall and the source is the document of 3 October, a figure of &euro;400 million based on the informal valuation by the letting agents, the source for which, again, is the document of 3 October.  There is then a valuation of &euro;430 million based on McNamara's work which is referenced in the minutes of the meeting of 24 October.  Finally, there is the valuation of &euro;412 million which was made officially by the CBRE after the bid was submitted.  There are nine or ten valuations, seven of which were calculated and discussed in a three week period.  How does Mr. Maloney explain the inconsistency?</p></speech>

I was telling the team, "We need to be certain of our valuations."  I was not going to accept one internal valuation and say, "Okay, guys, that's fine."  We were finding out new information all the time between 3 and 20 October and I told them to put in every parameter and run other valuations in the circle time programme with the professional valuer.  These are not inconsistent; they are developing a valuation based on these parameters changing.  I refer to the three parameters.  One was plot ratio - we were at a plot ratio of 3:1.  The plot ratio we had developed prior to 2005 was 3:1.  The plot ratio since in the STZ of Dublin City Council references extensively a ratio of 3:1; therefore, I believed then and I am certain now that it was a very reasonable valuation.  The second parameter was 247 units per hectare, the common standard, while the third was what was called "compared" pricing.  East Wall is mentioned but so is the site sold on south quay just previously for &euro;40 million an acre.  It is not stated here, but it is stated in our recent submissions.</p></speech>

I was of the view that we had simply been asking for approval of the loan of &euro;127 million, as she has confirmed, and the application to the Minister to become a joint venture partner.  In the code of conduct between the Minister and the authority issues such as the business case for site development and the commercial case for site development did not require ministerial approval.</p> <p>I was under that impression and, of course, it has been confirmed to me since.  I take exactly what the Deputy is saying and accountability for it.  It should not have been in the original letter to the Department that we were going to pay &euro;220 million for a site, but I have to reiterate I corrected it in time.</p></speech>

If the Deputy looks at that meeting, for the first time we were saying: "This is too high for us.  Our risk is too great and we will now reduce our take."  It was called mitigation of risk.  There were four ways in which we could mitigate risk, but the biggest way was to drop from 50% to 26%.  When I proposed this to our joint venture partners, I did not believe they would accept it.  I believed it was a deal breaker.  They accepted that they were going to take 74% of the risk; that really astonished me.</p></speech>

As my iterative valuations were increasing I realised we were no longer able to fund a 50% take and I proposed 26%.  Why?  We actually meant 25%, but in company law 26% gives one certain rights in the company; therefore, we settled on 26%.  Our joint venture partners were not happy, but they accepted it ultimately.  Then I was able to report to the board that we had mitigated the risk in 21 days down to 26%.  That is why it is in the board paper of the 20th.  Now board members were clear on two things.  First, we had mitigated the risk of valuation by sticking to our valuation, which was &euro;375 million - anything above it was their risk.  Second, the mitigation rate was 26%.  There was a third mitigation - the cap of &euro;35 million, to which I referred in my presentation, was now being placed on the guarantee or recourse loans.  Now we are coming to the fact that we do not want to have recourse to the full &euro;290 million in borrowings and we brought it back to &euro;100 million.  All of these risk factors with the team I had with me were coming into play.  They were not all my ideas - they were coming from everybody on the team - to mitigate our risk.</p></speech>

The authority was now a formal semi-State board with DoE representation.  It was the first time I had come across this.</p><p>  As regards the Deputy's very valid point, in a risk analysis - a SWOT, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, analsysis - that we presented probably on 3 October but certainly on the 20th we identified one of the risks.  We did not say this was a definitive statement that the property market had overheated and that was it.  It was one of the risks we were taking.  When we saw that risk, a definite risk, there were two ways of dealing with it.  One was not to take part and the second was to mitigate one's risk.  If one looks at the four measures since that statement which I now recall was on 3 October in the minutes, we were taking 49% or 50% of the site.  I mitigated that risk of a property market in four ways and to this day I stand over this.  Why?  We had made &euro;52 million profit in that year, 2005.  We were entering an agreement at 50%; we could not do this if it was an overheated property market.  What I had to ascertain with my team was how to draw down the risk in order that if the property market changed, we would be protected.  By reducing our borrowing to &euro;53 million, as it ultimately became, we were clearly within all the parameters of our ability to pay, without going near taxpayers.</p><p>  The second mitigation was we said the gearing was too high.  They wanted 90%, but we said, "No.  Get your equity in there.  Take it away from the banks and we want it at 70%."</p><p>  The third mitigation was we wanted to have a cap on recourse.  I believe this forced the banks to reduce it to only &euro;100 million.  In the case of a &euro;290 million loan, that was unheard of.</p><p>  The fourth mitigation was we wanted to ensure our valuations were at the limit to which the authority would go, which was &euro;307 million.  Between the 3rd - the statement - and 20th we had mitigated the risk as one would do in a SWOT analysis.  I believe if one looks at the figures, notwithstanding the collapse of the financial system and so on and NAMA, had we gone with a loan with Ulster Bank, for example, or RBS, which was the intention at the time - if the Deputy recalls, the first bank approached by Becbay was Ulster Bank or RBS - we would not have had further recourse to the taxpayer.  The recourse figure on the site was &euro;100 million, of which we were liable for 26%.  All of this was within our ability to deliver.</p></speech>

Ms Brennan attended a committee of the Oireachtas and, without a scintilla of evidence, referred to these conflicts.  One can have two types of conflict, perceived conflict and actual conflict, in regard to how they are dealt with in one's code of conduct.  Ms Brennan rode roughshod over corporate governance by saying, without a scintilla of evidence, that these perceived conflicts were suddenly actual conflicts.  I reject that.  The Deputy may have seen my opening statement and with his indulgence I will repeat it.  I never saw an act or omission, interference or any comment made by an Anglo Irish Bank board member or the other directors that, in my view as chief executive who came from outside the authority and from a State organisation, in any way interfered with the process.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct that there was a perceived conflict and everybody at the meeting acknowledged that, but they dealt with it.  All of them declared this to the Ministers involved, Deputies Howlin and Quinn, at the beginning.  It was also declared to the entire board.  It was stated at the board - I can only go on the evidence given to me - that neither director was involved in actual lending credit committees in their bank.  I must be honest, open and transparent in the way I do business, but I must also report how business is done.  It is my honest evidence that I never saw that conflict as being an actual conflict until the night before the 24th, when Mr. McNamara told me for the first time that he was switching from Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, to Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

By the way, what I am saying in evidence here, I have also placed in a legal affidavit before the court, when that was raised through a legal action, namely, that Mr. McNamara said he was switching to Anglo Irish Bank because the Ulster Bank issue was slow and there were only two days left.</p></speech>

We had operated from the 3rd to the 24th, almost, under the assumption that the bank was RBS.  I was satisfied that when Mr. Bradshaw reported this immediately at the meeting the next morning at 8, he was as surprised as I was.  I am certain he had no knowledge of it and that Mr. McNamara did so for the reasons he enunciated to me, which were that he was getting a more streamlined service from Anglo Irish Bank.  It would have been very common, in my knowledge of the time, for developers to approach three or four banks when seeking funding, because it is not just a question of funding, but the fee that banks charge.  Therefore, I was not surprised about his switching bank, but was surprised by the lateness of the hour in telling me.</p></speech>

Was I comfortable that the Anglo Irish Bank members of the board did not know about it?  I can only say honestly that I was comfortable with that.  Do I believe that Mr. McNamara did this because he was going to all the banks - he was developing on many sites - and this was the one from which he thought he would get the best deal?  That was my interpretation.  I can only tell the committee my evidence.</p></speech>

It was populated by some very significant players in the Irish and, arguably, the international financial system.  There were probably more Gordon Gekkos than Mother Teresas on it at the time.  Did Mr. Maloney find it to be an intimidating environment, an environment that was somewhat macho?  These were big players in the Irish banking system and Irish business.  Mr. Maloney and others on the board had a long track record of positive public service.  Did Mr. Maloney find himself in any way in thrall to Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, Lar Bradshaw and people like that?</p></speech>

First, I am not intimidated by that sort of a reputation and I did not know these people.  I only met them at board meetings.  Second, every paper that was brought to the board was done by the executive, independent of board members.  Mr. Bradshaw, or anybody else, never had an input into that.  Therefore, the executive came with independent professional advice.  Third, the way the board meetings were conducted, Mr. Bradshaw gave everybody, including the executive, who were not board members, the opportunity to make any comment or objection to whatever decision was being made on the basis of independent professional advice.</p><p>  I state clearly that every decision that was made in regard to the Irish Glass Bottle site came from the independent professional advice of an executive with 20 years experience.  There was no interference from outside, as can be seen in all of the board papers before the committee, not even a telephone call or a conversation.  The only conversation was the one I have reported to this committee and that was about who I should approach as a developer.  My suggestion - both suggestions - were agreed with and I want to be very clear on my evidence on that.</p></speech>

I want to check on some facts, but will keep my questions direct.  I am little confused regarding the valuation.  An independent valuation of the site was conducted in June 2005 by CB Richard Ellis Gunne.  That valuation was &euro;240 million.

Did no one on the board say the DDDA, before it did so,  should get an independent valuation done by outside consultants for that level of an investment?  Third, did Mr. Maloney advise the board that it should not proceed with this because the market was overheating?</p><p>  There is a lack of clarity regarding the decision-making process in this.  Letters were going out looking for a limit on borrowing that would not have been based around the &euro;375 million.  It would only have allowed the DDDA go to a limit of &euro;350 million.  The DDDA had no independent valuation.  It had letters going to the Department which were not signed by Mr. Maloney but were p.p. letters.  I contend that, ultimately, Mr. Maloney should have seen those letters as CEO.  That would be his responsibility.  He had various board meetings where there was no independent valuation.  Did anyone on the board say the DDDA needed an independent valuation and did Mr. Maloney advise that he had concerns about proceeding with this investment in an overheated market?</p></speech>

That simply looked for an increase in borrowing.  We were not saying, even to ourselves at that stage, what was going to be the bid price.  This was only 3 October.</p><p>  Second, as regards valuation, I take the Deputy's point exactly.  The independent valuation I had in June 2005, which would be extant to about October 2005 - it was about a year old - was, with professional surveyors on my team, quite easily extrapolated to the current circumstances.</p><p>  Third, the Deputy said the property market was falling in July.</p></speech>

I had implemented the cap.  Third, we had mitigated with the &euro;35 million cap on recourse.  I was satisfied, first, that the iterations we were doing with professional teams were satisfactory and, second, that the mitigation was in place.</p><p>  I should have said there was another independent valuation, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred, which I understand was done three weeks later by the same team, CBRE, which valued it at &euro;400 million.</p></speech>

However, if you are asking me with hindsight that when I read the ESRI reports, the Central Banks reports, the governance reports, the economic reports of 2006 - just look at them, not one of those national and international reports were giving me an indication of what was going to happen - so if you are asking me with the hindsight of that would I have done it, of course, not.  With hindsight, though - and I answer as honestly as I can  on the role I played for which I take full accountability and responsibility - I do not think there is something I did in those 20 days that I would have done differently.  I do not believe that because we mitigated our risk with the four factors that I alluded to.</p></speech>

That the DDDA was seeking to double its borrowing limit would clearly have indicated to me that the proposal was significant and unique, in terms of its content and size, for Dublin docklands.  Before the authority entered into the deal, it should have sought an independent valuation &ndash; if not one, perhaps two.  The independent valuations were based on June 2005 and, effectively, the period after the bid.  Is that correct?  Both were by the same company.  Things were clearly rushed but it was significant.  I ask Mr. Maloney to deal with my first point first, and then my second point.</p></speech>

The first question was on whether we were risking taxpayers&rsquo; money by investing &euro;52 million.  No, we were not.  We had just made &euro;130 million on our developments to that date.  We made &euro;52 million in 2006.  That is what our accounts showed.  Subsequently, we still had enormous assets which we continued to sell off.  To this very day, all of that has been paid back without any recourse to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

In Appendix B, on page 61, we draw attention to the fact that &euro;31 million in Exchequer funding was provided to the authority around 2000 to support a programme of capital investments in public amenity projects as part of the implementation of the authority's master plan.  The funding was drawn down between 2001 and 2007.  Between 2007 and 2009, the authority also received &euro;5.5 million in respect of site subsidy payments to Dublin City Council in respect of affordable housing.</p></speech>

The capital programmes we were applying to, such as those pertaining to public amenity development and social housing sites, were publicly available for everybody.  It was the Government&rsquo;s policy that any housing authority providing social housing was entitled to look for Government funding superficially for those programmes, not for the type of programme or project we are talking about here.

There were two independent valuations but we had professional surveyors extrapolating them.  They were trained and certified nationally by the RICS.  That is a very common and normal thing for property companies to do, and I stand over that.</p></speech>

This was an incredible, huge investment.  I contend that there was a need for an independent valuation to be sought by the board.  Looking back, does Mr. Maloney not feel this would have been reasonable?

I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s premise.  That we paid off all our debts without recourse to the taxpayer is a very significant issue, notwithstanding the Deputy&rsquo;s point on public gain, which I accept.  Second, I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that if we had had another valuation, it would, of course, be of great comfort to me sitting here today, but I must counter the point by saying, with all my professional experience, that I have no doubt that had we got a valuation three weeks in advance of what the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to, it would have been in excess of &euro;3.75 million.  It would have given comfort from a corporate governance perspective, which I absolutely accept, but it is my absolute contention that the figure would have been around that valuation.  Three weeks later, an independent company gave a valuation of &euro;412 million.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, this is an independent RICS valuation.</p></speech>

For example, there is one headline that says that staff and executives spent &euro;500,000 on DDDA credit cards.  I am only asking because sometimes these reports can lack full information.  I am not saying that this one does but I am just asking, because it was in the public domain, if Mr. Maloney can tell us what was happening there.  It specifically refers to a flight to Paris for the World Cup, large quantities of wine purchased for some board meetings, expenses relating to golf outings for board members, &euro;870 spent at a jeweller's shop and &euro;2,200 spent at another location.  All of these figures were in the public domain.  All of this information was put into the public domain.  That is what has caused an awful lot of concern, as to what was going on there at executive level, board level and with the staff.  The travel is something that was built up over a number of years, including Finland and Russia.  The purchase of caviar and wine in Russia was also mentioned in these reports.  There were further reports of the risk committee notes 2006 being missing and not being made available under FOI.  All of this was reported.  I am trying to establish Mr. Maloney's view on all of that, as CEO.  How did this happen?</p></speech>

To do so we had to compare ourselves to the best so we went to San Sebasti&aacute;n where the port was being moved and a docklands was being regenerated in the very same way.  It was a one or two-day trip there.</p><p>  However, there was certainly nothing about Russia or the World Cup.  I absolutely would not have sanctioned that.  I never went on what I would regard as a non-business trip and certainly not those distances.  I went to rugby matches at my own cost and I have never heard otherwise.  Certainly, there were board dinners and I cannot comment on what wine was purchased.  There was one board dinner a year and that is why I can only surmise that they are adding ten years of the authority's expenditure in that.

It might inform us as to the culture that existed in that organisation relative to the property development, and the attitude of the board relative to the general activity in the docklands area.  When I read the reports I have here, the statements would cover the period 2006 and 2007 when a staff outing cost &euro;2,503.  The figure was &euro;5,247 in 2007, all in restaurants.  It is hard to put that into context concerning the job Mr. Maloney was doing.  It talks about the use of five-star hotels, top notch restaurants and fine wines.  That is the type of information that informed the general public in later years.  As they become informed about this, in this way through FOI, it is up to the DDDA to counteract that story.  If it is true then let us get down to it and see why they are doing it, but Mr. Maloney is telling us that for that period of 2006 to 2009 none of this happened.</p></speech>

It also stated, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the Department was giving approval for the taking by the authority of a shareholding in a joint venture company.</p><p>  When Mr. Maloney met Mr. McNamara on 23 October, he brought Mr. Lar Bradshaw , the chairman, because he believed this was the biggest decision for the board to make.  The minutes state, &ldquo;The executive recommends that the authority should make a joint bid&rdquo;.  Earlier we discussed the meeting of 3 October when the executive recommended formal negotiations be opened on making a bid.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, one is not bidding on a valuation but beating other bidders.  These are public minutes and, under freedom of information legislation, they could have been a public document the next day.  Therefore, we had to be careful not to show anyone else what the exact bid would be.</p></speech>

He actually talked about a price that was greater than that - &euro;437 million.  It is at the bottom of that page.  We thought that was ludicrous and should not be done.  He then said he would bring it back to &euro;411 million.  These were his statements.  What we were bringing back to the board was that we stuck resolutely to &euro;375 million and he had moved from &euro;437 million down to &euro;411 million.  It was his choice why he picked &euro;411 million.  That is where the figure appeared from.</p></speech>

Therefore, when the board asked how he came up with &euro;437 million, we said he got it from own valuations, of which we did not have a copy at the time.  The board said that he could be allowed to increase it if he had information from those valuations, which we patently did not have in our valuation because it was &euro;375 million.  It was up to him to make that bid, which he ultimately did not do.  I presented the reasons that we were limiting it to &euro;375 million to him.  I think that caused him to rethink his valuations.</p></speech>

We are talking about a figure like &euro;437 million.  When Mr. Bradshaw was before us, he put it that 50% of a large number was the same as 25% of a small number so it was not really an issue in terms of what the board was entering into.  In respect of this particular deal in terms of the potential exposure which we touched upon briefly earlier, we had moved from a 49% share holding in a joint venture potentially worth &euro;220 million to a 26% share holding in a venture now worth around &euro;400 million - the final bill was &euro;411 million or &euro;412 million.  I will not put words in Mr. Bradshaw's mouth but he was saying that in terms of the borrowing facility, we were still dealing with the same amount of money that was needed.</p></speech>

Our borrowing is now down to &euro;50 million.  It is not the same.  It is considerably reduced.</p></speech>

In respect of the negatives, we had already been dealing for the previous 20 days with one joint venture leader, Mr. McNamara, and we were comfortable with that.  We were now being asked to deal with another investor about whom I knew nothing and, therefore, I had to consider the criteria I applied to the other investor before making a recommendation to the board.</p></speech>

I will address the issues the Deputy raised that might have raised the alarm with me.

Another developer was brought in at the last moment but we rejected that immediately.  There was no rushing.  There was no rushing in the 21 days of evaluation we did between 3 and 24 October.

Our net profit might have been &euro;52 million cash, but our profit to the State, community and area was multiples of that.  That is what we were interested in, not the cash profit.  If we had broken even on the site, which was not our intention, there would still have been enormous profit in what we gave to the community.  That is where we were coming from.</p></speech>

Mr. Maloney said he had been waiting four years so I want to give him the fullest opportunity to put everything on the record that he wants to.  Mr. Moloney discussed Mr. Derek Quinlan at the meeting of 2 November and again on 7 December, but this time in the context of Derek Quinlan being part of the consortium and lending having been arranged.  Was that the period of time in which the board agreed it would be acceptable based on the conditions regarding the authority's own shareholdings not being diluted?</p></speech>

It was in that period that the board found it acceptable.  I do not think the committee has the paper of 2 November.  It gave the positives and negatives of that, and the note reads: "Following discussion of all issues involved the board agreed they would have no objection to Bernard McNamara disposing of his 33%."  That followed an hour-long discussion.  However, the board was not prepared to agree to a dilution of its currently agreed 40% for directors.  This was crucial.  The board would agree to an increase in the number of directors, etc.  The board could see the value of a mitigation of risk, but we had already agreed the heads of terms which confirmed our community gain and planning issues, so Mr. Quinlan could not dilute those heads of terms.  The criteria we had set down were already set in stone.  That made the board more comfortable about Mr. Quinlan coming on board, because he could not have had an effect on our criteria as laid down in that multiple document.  However, he might have had an effect on the dilution of our 26%, which we resisted.</p></speech>

What happened?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.837" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maloney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121200024#X01700"><p>First, the cap was for a liability relating to a &euro;26 million recourse loan and two years of interest.  We paid a &euro;29 million recourse guarantee and we said we would pay two years interest and we stopped paying after two years interest.  The way it is presented in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, with which I disagree, it looks like the cap was on the investment the authority was making.  The investment was in two tranches: first, its liability for the loan, which was &euro;26 million plus interest and, second, the &euro;32 million in equity it put into the company.  That is clear in the shareholders agreement but the way it is worded and has been reported by some members of the press is that we had capped everything at &euro;35 million.  I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General in other parts of the report has clarified that but that is why I opened with those two sentences in my statement.</p><p>  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General is absolutely right that we set two years of paying interest because paragraph 3.4 of the shareholders agreement says that planning would take two years.  There was a limit placed on planning for two years because for every development if one buys, as in this case, an unplanned or unzoned site, one has a period after which one gets planning when the equity and value of the site changes and one creates value.  The intention, which is in the shareholders agreement, is that this value would be created after two years.  One then had two means of getting equity and paying interest.</p></speech>

We had that done.  When it came to the two years interest - the Comptroller and Auditor General is absolutely correct on this - we set a two year limit on paying that interest.  We did and we stopped because after the two years when planning would come, we would then create value or release equity.  There are two ways to do that.  The bank would accrue the interest and we would not pay until the final development was in place or the second method, which was discussed many times, was to start divesting ourselves of parcels because it was a huge 26-acre site.  That is why we set two years.</p><p>  It was never intended - and that is why we did not break that cap - that after two years, we would stop paying and someone else would pay our 26% of the interest because if that was the case, our two partners would have turned around and said: "We're paying 74% of our proportion.  You have a liability for your 26%."  We never divested ourselves of the ultimate liability although I totally acknowledge that the Comptroller and Auditor General has correctly written that is there but the other paragraphs have to be taken into account.</p><p>  I refer to a third paragraph in the shareholders agreement.  The reason the cap was put in is that any development costs - it costs several hundred million to develop a site of this magnitude - would only come from our partners.  The DDDA was setting a cap that would not involve itself in that, to which we also clearly adhered.  Deputy Murphy asked why we extended that for another two years.  Our liability was always there; we decided not to pay any further.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned correctly that we increased the liability over those two years to &euro;8.5 million.  We did not pay it.  I totally accept it is a liability based on the actual facts that we were always liable for 26% of our interest.  That is where that comes from.</p></speech>

I would like to make a few other points about what Mr. Maloney raised in his opening statement, one or two of which are tangential to the core issue we have been discussing.  I would like to draw the committee's attention to the financial position of the DDDA at the end of 2012.  I drew attention in my audit certificate to the dissolution of the authority, which is planned, and to a deferred pension funding asset being recognised in the financial statements as follows:<blockquote><br />I draw attention to note 16 to the financial statements and to the recognition as at 31 December 2012 of an asset of &euro;8.4 million in respect of deferred pension funding.</blockquote></p></speech>

Mr. Maloney has pointed out that the shareholder equity and loans that were provided and the interest paid amounted to just under &euro;44 million.  However, there was a more extended liability, as he outlined.  A settlement was done with NAMA and the result was that assets with a value of, I think, &euro;7.8 million were transferred to NAMA.  So to get the overall cost to the DDDA of the venture one has to add the two things together, which gives a figure of &euro;52 million.  So it is not inconsistent with what Mr. Maloney has presented.  I say this just in case there is any confusion about that.</p><p>  I would also like to draw attention to the heads of agreement, a paper which was presented to the executive board of the authority on 2 November.  It outlines the shareholdings or share distribution between the authority at 26% and the other partners at 74%.  It goes on to state:<blockquote>All rights, interests, liabilities, obligations, responsibilities and risks, and all costs incurred or losses shall, except as expressly agreed otherwise, be shared and borne in such proportions, provided always that the total recourse to the DDDA under any loans to the joint-venture company, guarantees or any account whatsoever in respect of the acquisition of the company or otherwise shall not in aggregate exceed &euro;35 million.</blockquote>This was considered by the board on that day.  That is the basis of our statement in the report that the authority believed at the time that it was giving approval for the signing of the shareholders' agreement that its financial commitment would be limited to &euro;35 million.  I certainly accept that the shareholders' agreement that actually was signed subsequently did extend that liability, but I am just drawing attention to that in the context of the records kept by the DDDA.</p></speech>

Why?  Because today it continues to sell what are increasingly valuable assets - they are highly sought after now.  What is happening in the docklands property market is quite extraordinary.  That final figure - next February we will know of that.  I believe it will not be a deficit, but I defer to the accounts in February of next year.</p></speech>

He correctly said he could not clarify anything with me in advance of this meeting.  I understand he could not.  Therefore, I went to the next source of all the information, the DDDA current director of finance.  I asked him to set down for me that table; he has done so.  I will submit the table.  It shows unequivocally that at the time of the shareholders' agreement - which is as the Comptroller and Auditor General stated - the financial commitments of the authority were twofold: one, the recourse funding cap of &euro;35 million - we both agree on that; and two, as he has in his document - I have asked him to confirm for me in writing and he has, and I asked him to confirm it in writing to the Comptroller and Auditor General and he said he would do so-----</p></speech>

That is not governance.  What the Committee of Public Accounts has shown to the media here is that the way to do it - I congratulate the Comptroller and Auditor General - is to obtain an independent report to get the facts - we might disagree on some of them, but it is independent - and then to bring everybody in and question them and have them be accountable.  This is the right way, in regard to the democratic functions of this State, to do it and I congratulate the committee on that.</p><p>  I only ask for the following.  Ms Brennan has said she will not appear before the committee before everybody else appears.  Here is a person who has had every chance to write every report and I am here before the committee.  Therefore, I would like to come back here when Ms Brennan appears so that I am here to correct the record, to ensure that my evidence is heard and to ensure that no further misinformation is given.</p><p>  Overall, I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and I thank the committee members for their patience today.  I think their questioning has been very fair and rightly rigorous.  I thank the Vice Chairman.</p></speech>

At a macro level it has cost the State &euro;52 million.  We may differ, but generally, from the evidence we have received, I feel there was lack of cohesion in decision making, independent property evaluation and proper due diligence.  Clearly, it was rushed.  However, the committee will continue to discuss the matter.  We will consider the DDDA's 2012 accounts on 6 February 2014.  I again thank Mr. Maloney for appearing before the committee.</p></speech>

The Bill addresses the situation where an under-funded defined benefit pension scheme winds up in deficit or elects to restructure.  At present it is possible that pensioners receive all or almost all of the pension fund while members who have contributed but not retired receive considerably less than expected.  The Bill will ensure a more equal distribution of assets in an under-funded defined benefit scheme when an insolvency restructuring occurs.  The measures will apply only in a limited set of circumstances and, therefore, to a small number of schemes.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and officials from her Department.  My intention is for the select sub-committee to conclude its consideration of Committee Stage of the Bill this morning.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

While I do not have a major problem with the content, when this Bill was published, it just dealt with pensions.  This seems to have been an afterthought based on a court case and I have not had the time to get legal opinion as to whether this fully complies with the court case finding in terms of appeals and the claimant or appellant having the right to submit additional documentation continuously and whether the appeal would be open.  It is a pity it was included in the Bill in this way and that we are being short-circuited in dealing with it.  As I said, the Bill was originally a pensions one.  Will the Minister give an outline as to where these sections came from?  Do they fully comply with or fully address the points which emerged in the recent court case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.900" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013121200003#B01500"><p>This arises in the context of a recent High Court case.  The social welfare system has a practice of appeals officers revising decisions in a particular set of circumstances.  There are approximately 2 million applications per year to the Department for a whole range of benefits.  When the appeals process has been exhausted but where circumstances have changed, the Department allows a fresh application in order to take account of the change of circumstances and the matter proceeds.  Until now that flexibility has been seen as an asset in allowing deciding officers and appeals officers to deal with differing circumstances but following the recent High Court ruling, the provisions relating to a change of circumstances are now considered problematic as they unintentionally remove finality from social welfare determinations that refused claims and they introduce considerable uncertainty into the system of social welfare decision-making as a consequence.</p><p>  It has been the practice in the Department that once a claim is refused and all review and appeals processes have been finalised, if the customers seeks a revised decision based on a change of circumstance, he or she is advised to make the fresh application.  The new claim is fully assessed in the light of all the circumstances.  In the context of the High Court decision, the Department would no longer be able to ask people to make a fresh claim but would have to reopen the claim, even if it was closed many years previously.  The purpose of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, are to address the issue but in a limited range of circumstances.  Specifically, section 3 amends the provision of section 301 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act which applied to the revision by a deciding officer of a previous decision of a deciding officer, an appeals officer or a designated person in regard to SWA.  Where the original decision was wrong and if new facts and evidence emerge, the customer will be able to seek a revised decision.  The amendment does not change that.  Where a claimant is in payment, it will be possible to revise the decision if circumstances change but where a person was refused a social welfare payment in the past and the circumstances change, the current channel is to make a fresh application so that the application can be fully considered in the light of the current circumstances and the amendment seeks to ensure that will be the practice in all cases.</p><p>  In light of the High Court decision, I have asked the officials in the Department to carry out a more wide-ranging review of the legislation on social welfare decisions.  If I need to address this subsequently in a future social welfare Bill, I will do so then.</p></speech>

I do not have a problem with it but I have a problem with the way this appeared and the rushed nature of this legislation.  If the circumstances of somebody who is refused social welfare change next week, he or she will make a fresh claim but if the circumstances changed a number of months ago but he or she had not managed to get a consultant's letter, which is one of the big problems currently, and if he or she had indicated that to the social welfare appeals office, can the appeal be held open, pending a consultant's letter ?  Does this, in any way, affect the process where a deciding officer has decided not to grant an application and somebody is entitled to a review or an appeal?  One of the problems is that people are not aware of the advantages of the review.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, people are better off doing a review than going to appeals, but with the improvements in technology, everybody has seen a very significant improvement in processing.  Having the right to make a fresh application for a change of circumstances is a valuable right and is the right thing to do in many cases.  With 2 million social welfare applications a year and the findings by the High Court of the gap in the law, this is simply an attempt to close the gap to ensure all the administrative procedures the Deputy has described can continue as well as providing for the fresh application.</p></speech>

In a press release which accompanied the publication of the legislation the Minister stated:<blockquote><br />Historic double insolvencies will not be covered by this legislation [that is the Waterford Crystal case, among others] but are covered by the Insolvency Directive.  This means that in those [past] cases, pensioners' entitlements will not be affected in any way and they will continue to receive 100% of their pensions.  However, as the Directive stipulates that workers should be protected to at least 49%, the State may use funds raised by the Pension Levy to explore options to resolve historic double insolvencies which failed to meet this requirement.</blockquote>Could the Minister elaborate on that?  Is she saying that in regard to historic double insolvencies, the levy will be used to top up what those pensioners may be adjudged entitled to under the European Union directive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.914" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013121200004#C01300"><p>First, in regard to Waterford Crystal, the point is that the Waterford Crystal case has been addressed by the European Court and the workers have won their case.  The applicants in the case have the matter before the Irish courts and the Irish courts are proceeding to address the matter.  The point is that the Waterford Crystal workers' situation is covered by the court judgment they received from the European courts.  This legislation addresses new cases that arise in the future.</p><p>  Second, in regard to funding the Waterford Crystal case and other cases in the future, the Minister for Finance announced in the budget that the levy of 0.6% is ending in 2014, as promised by the Government on the introduction of the levy, but he brought forward a provision for an additional levy of 0.15%, which he said could be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to address deficiencies in historic cases, of which the most outstanding and the largest is the Waterford Crystal case, and any others that arise in the future.  He stated subsequently that any such deficiencies would be met out of general funds.  That means that in terms of a funding mechanism and the 0.15% levy he specifically addressed in the context of 2014 and 2015, as he is the funding agency, I was pleased that there is a funding stream to provide for the pension entitlements of workers and members of pension schemes in the context of such cases.</p></speech>

The funding for the Waterford Crystal workers and other historic double insolvencies will not be accessed from the new levy but rather it will be done out of general funding.</p></speech>

The reason for that is because the OECD report on the Irish pension system highlighted an anomaly in Ireland.  It stated:<blockquote>Another weakness of Irish legislation is that it allows healthy sponsors to 'walk away' from DB pension plans, shutting them down, without creating a high-priority debt on the employer, as is the case in the United Kingdom.  Under the UK's &quot;debt upon employer obligation&quot;, the sponsor's debt (if the plan is underfunded) is determined by valuing the benefits on the basis that they are bought out in the full via  immediate annuities (for pensioners) or deferred annuities (for non-pensioners).</blockquote>There has been much debate outside this House on this issue, which appears to be becoming a trend.  Those of us in Ireland may be more exposed than others in that regard because while we have many large employers, they often become subsidiaries of an even bigger conglomerate.  Those conglomerates are quite healthy in the scale of things but their Irish subsidiary might not be as healthy or is, in their view, likely to become insolvent if the minimum funding standard for the pension fund is imposed in a case where it becomes insolvent.  There must be some liability on that employer or its parent company.  I am trying to ensure that in respect of the remaining the DB schemes in Ireland, which are down from 2,500 some years ago to 800, and that figure is likely to reduce further as many of those 800 schemes have been closed to new membership for a long time, the employer has the liability.  It must be remembered that the DB scheme is based on an employee, on taking up employment with a company, being promised in a contract that they will enjoy the benefits of a DB scheme.</p></speech>

As the law stands, a company which is financially healthy, or whose parent company is financially healthy, can simply allow a pension fund to run down and close it.  We propose that no company which is financially healthy should be allowed to close a defined benefit pension scheme under which people have legitimate expectations until that scheme is at least 90% funded.  I am open to suggestions about mechanisms to measure that, or who can determine that.  At that point if the company wants to close down the scheme that is fair enough, but people will at least be able to get most of what they have been led to expect they will get.</p></speech>

The legislation is deficient in the protection it gives to workers compared with those in other countries.  It lets the employers off the hook somewhat.  We should try to copperfasten the legislation so that it is not the pensioners or the State picking up the tab for a company that is incredibly profitable and could step up to the plate.  In the UK there is quite strong legislation which defines the legal onus on the company such that where it is viable it has an obligation to meet its pension promises to its workforce.</p><p>  Several of the big schemes here fall short of provision - for example, the IASS scheme, which is a cross-border scheme, has over 1,000 members in the UK who would expect as British citizens to get the same guarantees they would get in Britain.  Even the United States places a heavier onus on companies than we provide for in this scheme.  Membership of these schemes was often a condition of one&rsquo;s contract of employment and there was no opting out.  Employers must come up to the mark.  Many points have been made about the courts and others having considered this matter.  The Minister is aware of several schemes in which there have been disputes over who is responsible, or in respect of which companies with defined benefit schemes have tried to declare them as defined contribution schemes, or change the method of accounting.  The courts have adjudicated on the big airport schemes as defined benefit schemes.  The Minister is aware of the recent case involving Aer Lingus in the Commercial Court, which impacts on the company's attempt to reduce some of the capital allowances.  The judgment stated that there was a contingent liability in respect of the pension scheme.  This Bill does not fully deal with such a situation.</p><p>  It is interesting that, because of the changes in some of these companies, members of pension schemes such as that one were treated as public sector workers.  They were enabled to join the public sector transfer network scheme because Aer Lingus had been 100% State-owned and the State still owns 100% of the Dublin Airport Authority and Shannon Airport.  Workers could transfer their pensions under the public sector legislative rules into the public sector pension scheme.  I am not sure how this legislation affects that transfer facility.  While the onus may be implied, the Bill is too silent and we want to try to toughen it up on the employers&rsquo; responsibility.  Aer Lingus has almost &euro;1 billion in cash and a huge deferred pensioner body, and active membership and disputes continue.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

Very serious consideration was given during the deliberations on these issues in the past few years to imposing a statutory obligation on employers, which the amendments suggest.  Defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland are set up and maintained by employers on a voluntary basis.  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pensions, although scheme rules do and can place some level of obligation on them.  There are many good employers in this country which are very committed to meeting their obligations and the promises that they made on the pension fund, even in very difficult economic and financial circumstances.</p><p>  Most defined benefit pension schemes are established under a trust deed.  The rights, responsibilities and duties rest in trust law.  The OECD review stated:<blockquote>In considering these alternatives, it should be kept in mind that each of the national schemes and reforms discussed in this review was adopted in a specific national economic, social and political setting. There is no blueprint for reform which Ireland could take off-the-shelf and implement directly.</blockquote>Any solution has to fit our situation in Ireland and our law.  We considered very seriously the debt and employer issue, imposing a statutory obligation on employers to secure a minimum level of funding before a scheme could be wound up.  The Deputies have set out the advantages of a debt on the employer but there are also very strong arguments against the introduction of an employer obligation, given the uncertainties about the overall impact and the potential for unintended consequences.  This is the difficulty in the case of Irish law.</p><p>  Several industry experts have suggested that a statutory obligation on an employer has the potential to effectively eradicate the provision of private defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to companies operating in Ireland that may be part of much bigger multinational companies but that are relatively small in that overall context.  The biggest problem is that there could be a move to close down schemes completely as a way of mitigating and avoiding any debt for the employer.  That is the biggest risk factor.  In discussions on this matter, that has long been recognised as a specific problem for Ireland.  It is not a simple matter to bring it in.</p></speech>

A number of issues have emerged from what the Minister said.  The idea here is to ensure healthy companies live up to their commitments.  In defining healthy companies, we used in our amendment the wording from the OECD report, which pointed out that Ireland was out of sync with other countries.  Our amendment uses the OECD term "has positive net revenues".  We have to take into account the day-to-day running of the company.  We do not want a company to close, impose reduced hours or redundancies on a workforce or cut wages.  That is not the intention.  However, there is a commitment that needs to be lived up to and "positive net revenues" suggests there is a formula of words involved.</p><p>  This is not just an Irish issue.  The parent company could be in another EU member state and there is a responsibility across the EU on profitable companies not to use the current crisis as an excuse to get out of something which they deem to be a burden on them into the future.  We have seen companies examining how to get out of this.  I include the ESB in those companies that are examining how to put this liability off their balance sheet and change it to a defined contribution scheme or another pension scheme.  It is not attractive for a company to have a defined benefit scheme on their books if they are planning to be taken over, up for sale or whatever.</p><p>  I urge the Minister to look at this over the next week to see if a formula of words can be put into this Bill which ensures this liability is imposed on companies and they cannot walk away.  If there is no clear legal obligation preventing healthy employers from walking away, we will find over the next while that more of those 803 defined benefit schemes will see their employers, regardless of whether they are in financial strife, looking at how they can shirk that responsibility.  The people who are legally exposed when a defined benefit scheme becomes insolvent are the workers, the pensioners, and the State to some extent if both go south.  The workers and pensioners also include the deferred pensioners, who are not mentioned in this Bill.  It is to be hoped we will get an opportunity to deal specifically with that in one of these sections, because that is an area of concern.</p><p>  If this issue is not addressed, it will end up clogging up the industrial relations network, as it has done.  It also has the potential to increase the number of industrial disputes.  The most recent disputes in Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and the ESB were tied to a promise of a defined benefit scheme.  The disputes were not about increased wages, which happened in the past, or for better conditions of work, or for increased hours.  They were about ensuring the promise made to them in a contract of employment was honoured.  We are not addressing it when we address the pension scheme wind-ups, nor are we ensuring the remaining 800 defined benefit schemes are complied with while those companies have positive net revenues, as per my amendment and the OECD report.</p></speech>

A company which is in a perfectly healthy financial state can decide tomorrow morning, for whatever reason - it might be subject to a takeover or it might want a temporary boost to the share price if it is a quoted company - to wind up the defined benefit pension scheme.  I have received correspondence in the last week from somebody who paid into a defined benefit pension scheme for the past 30 years.  The company involved unilaterally decided to wind it up, even though the company is not winding itself up because it is perfectly solvent.</p></speech>

The first of these is the change in life expectancy we have seen in recent decades.  When pension funds were originally set up, people did not live very long after retirement.  Happily, people are now living for far longer, with most of them being far healthier in retirement.  The problem for employers is that the increased longevity of the employees to whom they made promises in good faith 30 years ago - it is important to remember that  many employers had very good intentions in this regard - is now giving rise to a serious issue in regard to affordability.  The second factor in the pensions crisis is the larger financial crisis, which saw Irish pensions hit by a perfect storm.  The schemes were in equities at the wrong time, when the equity market was collapsing - Deputy O'Dea is much more of an expert than I on the equities market - and proceeded to move into Government bonds at the wrong time.  It was a perfect storm whereby a range of issues and developments went against them.</p><p>  There is also the issue of FRS 17, which set much of this in motion.  The point I am making in regard to the regime in the United Kingdom is that notwithstanding the legislation we have talked about, there has been a huge move - to a far greater extent than in Ireland - away from defined benefit schemes and towards defined contribution schemes.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to the situation at Marks &amp;amp; Spencer.  My understand is that the company closed its defined benefit scheme to new entrants in 2004.  In fact, I understand that much of the dispute with employees in that instance related to changing work practices and most of them are in a defined contribution scheme.  That is the information we have from the Pensions Board, and it is not untypical.</p><p>  The Deputies are proposing in these amendments that a healthy sponsor should not be allowed to close a defined benefit scheme where that scheme is 90% funded.  However, in such cases, employees would effectively be almost 100% protected.  I absolutely accept the intention of these amendments, but they do not actually do very much in regard to the underfunded schemes  that employers are seeking to close.  The amendments apply to schemes that are, according to the definition in the amendments themselves, well funded, but those schemes are not the problem.  In fact, the schemes encompassed within the amendments will, by definition, be among the 50% of schemes which have met the funding standard of the Pensions Board.  In short, it is not the schemes that are 90% funded which should be causing us concern.</p><p>  There have been discussions recently on what might happen if everything were to collapse tomorrow, taking a risk and probability of 100% right here and now.  However, pension schemes, because they are based on life expectancies and so on, do not normally anticipate 100% risk in the here and now.  I understand where the Deputies are coming from with these amendments and it is a subject to which we will return.  In fact, we will have no option but to come back to the issue of how defined contribution schemes are invested.  That is not dealt with in this Bill but is a huge issue for younger people currently in employment.  For the reasons I have set out, I do not propose to accept the amendments.  I understand the Deputies' concerns and assure them that these matters are constantly up for review and discussion.  As I said, there is work to be done on defined contribution schemes, which apply to a large proportion of younger workers.</p></speech>

The legislation clearly defines the State's responsibility in cases of double insolvency and guarantees certain benefits to scheme members in such cases.  The guarantee in this regard is not adequate, but that is an issue for discussion under later amendments.  Our amendment No. 3 is seeking to do something analogous in terms of defining an employer's responsibility in cases where the scheme, but not he company itself, is in trouble.</p><p>  This provision is necessary because we have seen several examples of employers exploiting the grey area that exists in this regard.  Our intention is to ensure that such exploitation does not continue under the new legislation.  What we are discussing here are healthy companies which can afford to pay.  There are few, if any, new defined benefit schemes opening up, so these provisions could not be said to raise a deterrent in that regard.  As the Minister said, there was no statutory obligation on these companies to set up these schemes.  They engaged voluntarily in a commitment, often as part of the contract of employment with the members of this scheme.  That guarantee or promise was that workers who paid in over many years - often over a lifetime of work - would be guaranteed an outcome at the end of it.  Now, however, the rug is being pulled from under them in some cases.  To reiterate, we are talking about contractual obligations into which employers entered freely.</p><p>  We are not the only ones arguing this point.  The High Court stated in the Commercial Court case regarding Aer Lingus and the IAASS scheme that there was a clearly defined contingent liability on the company in regard to its pension commitments.  We are seeking to build that into the legislation.  The Pensions Board itself has adjudicated that FRS 17 does not replace the statutory obligation on the employer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.933" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013121200008#G00200"><p>Deputy Daly is saying she wants a deterrent.  The problem is whether the deterrent will incentivise companies to close their pension schemes.  Deputy Daly must be conscious of that.  She referred to a couple of State bodies, but they are less likely to wind up.  Incidentally, with regard to the ESB, I made it clear from the start that in respect of pensions legislation and the Pensions Board, the ESB scheme is a defined benefit scheme.  The issue people had was, "What if the scheme closed tomorrow?".  Well, what if Ireland closes down tomorrow?  Clearly, in a catastrophic situation where all of the risks and liabilities crystalise tomorrow, there are lots of promises with regard to many things, and not just pension schemes, which would not be able to be filled.  However, we were very clear that the ESB scheme is a defined benefit scheme.</p><p>  The Deputy spoke about it being part of the contract of employment and that employers entered it voluntarily.  It is important that she recognises that employers entered it voluntarily.  There are many employers who have never set up a pension scheme.  There are good employers, as it were, who did make those promises as part of the contract, but they encountered the problem of people living much longer and taking from the pension scheme.  Obviously, the contributions they made during their lifetime of working reflected what was considered appropriate at a much earlier point, in terms of funding the scheme for the longevity required.  Second, and this is a major issue across the world, the schemes' returns have been extremely disappointing.  However, for the last two years the ESB's returns have been extremely impressive and hopefully that will continue and the deficiency in the scheme, as is expected by the Pensions Board, will be addressed via the agreement the scheme made with the Pensions Board.</p><p>  On balance, I believe it is imprudent to seek to impose a direct employer liability in Irish law.  I appreciate the sentiments that are being expressed, but there must be proper regulation so that schemes invest in ways that provide returns which are sufficient to meet the promises that have been made.  That is the critical thing to do.  However, we will keep this under constant review as well as looking at the situation of people in DC schemes, many of which operate on their own in a context where it is very difficult in a small fund to call the market for 30 years hence into retirement.  In fact, one would have to be a very lucky investor, as Deputy O'Dea will know.</p></speech>

That is why we chose the words "positive net revenues".  The last line in my amendment deals with the parent company.  Increasingly, parent companies set up an Irish subsidiary using loans from the parent company.  When they decide to wind up, the first port of call for the liabilities is obviously the Revenue Commissioners, because they must pay off whatever debts they have to them, and then they turn to paying off the debt to the parent company.  The last port of call is often the workers, who might not get enhanced redundancy payments.  If there is a DB scheme, there is pressure to reduce the amounts or make wrong provision for the existing members and the deferred members.  The pensioners under existing law will get up to 100% of the fund that is in place.  Is there an EU directive on this and does it cover companies located in the European Union whose parent company is in the EU, to ensure they do not evade their responsibility in a member state, or is there a compensatory scheme in place similar to that which applies if a company closes in Ireland and relocates somewhere within the European Union?  I recall that when Dell closed there was a fund available to help retrain workers and so forth.</p></speech>

It should be considered.  It will probably take longer if it is not.  DB schemes are closing in Ireland at a very fast rate and, in fact, according to the OECD, the number of DC schemes is also reducing, which is interesting.  That might be due to the number of companies that have closed.  It is a dangerous time for pensions and workers in Ireland and we must ensure that existing members and, in particular, deferred members get their entitlement to money that was supposedly set aside for their retirement.  We will return to the matter of deferred members because it is a huge issue for them, as well as for existing members which the Bill is trying to deal with.</p><p>  I am pressing the amendment.  There must be something in the legislation to impose an obligation on healthy companies to continue to fund the DB scheme.  If they wish to close it for future entrants, that is a matter for themselves and their future workers.  If they wish to close it for existing members and pensioners, I caution against giving them that ability.  However, it is something they have already, but they would have to buy out their liability to the existing pensioners, deferred members and active members.  They must understand that they have that liability, come what may, and that if they will not honour it in Ireland, the State or the European Union will hound them to ensure that people get what they have set aside or what is supposed to have been set aside.  It is part of the workers' wages that is being set aside for these pensions.</p></speech>

I hope we will be able to afford that, from an economic perspective, in the not too distant future.  I envisage that employers, employees and the State, perhaps via taxation, would contribute to such a scheme.  Such a scheme has been built up over a period of time in countries with more progressive pension situations.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is right to suggest that much of this needs to be addressed on a pan-European basis.  Quite an amount of work was done in this regard during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  A number of improvements relating to the protection of workers' pension rights were agreed following approximately 15 years of debate back and forth among the various member states.  One such improvement relates to the pension status of people who go from one member state to another to work for a private company.  It has been agreed that they will be able to acquire vested rights after a certain period of employment.  If someone who has been working for a particular company for seven or eight years leaves that company - this applies to women, in particular - his or her pension entitlement goes with him or her.  The Irish Presidency succeeded in getting that across the line.  A vast amount of work was done by officials in the Department of Social Protection and the Pensions Board.  The IORP directives basically relate to regulation, funding standards, the quality of information, etc.  An amount of work has been done.  It is constantly on the EPSCO agenda when the various social welfare and employment Ministers meet.  There is still an awful lot to do.  Issues such as employer liability should be approached through something like European minimum standards.  That is a long way down the road, to be honest, although some work has been done.</p><p>  I assure Deputy Clare Daly that the rest of this legislation is about assisting companies with restructuring options with a view to improving the protection of the different parties involved, particularly the deferred and the active members.  As the Deputy suggested, some of them are extremely concerned that they are contributing to a pension fund whose fruits they might not enjoy.  That is one of the reasons we are passing this legislation.  That is the very positive part of the legislation.  I understand what Deputies would like to achieve.  I am afraid that, in terms of defined benefit schemes, the horse bolted a long time ago.  The number of defined benefit schemes declined by more than 1,200 - from over 2,200 to just over 1,000 - between 1997 and 2011.  As I have said, the number of defined benefit schemes in Ireland at present is approximately 800.  In 2007 and 2010, the then Government produced statements to the effect that it was going to sort all of this out.  Very little of that was ever reflected in law, however, partly because of the difficulties we have been discussing.  This is the first time the State has sought to address some of the issues.  However, we will not be in a position to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

We are discussing amendments Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 7 and 9 refer to deferred members.  Such members should be granted increased prominence in the priority order.  I am setting out the context in which deferred members should be granted such increased prominence.  In her e-mail the woman to whom I refer also states:<blockquote><br />I have not tried to screw the country.  I have worked hard all my life and I am continuing to pay my own way in a low-paid job with little or no pension because of years employed, although I am still funding this miserly pension.</blockquote>I am not going to read all of the other e-mails I received.  I will merely inform the Minister that those who wrote them are seeking to ensure they will have a right of audience when decisions are being made in the distribution of assets of defined benefit schemes in the event that such schemes are wound up.</p><p>  In the context of wind-ups, I have major issues with the Minister's proposed order of priority.  I am not opposed to it because it is better than that which obtains under the current system whereby existing pensioners, regardless of the incomes they are receiving - some of them are on gilt-edged pensions of over &euro;100,000 - take precedence over those who might have 40 or 45 years service and who might end up with nothing in such circumstances.  There is still this possibility under the model put forward by the Minister.</p><p>  I hounded the Minister for a number of weeks to publish the review of pension scheme wind-up priorities she had commissioned from Mercer.  The review is specific to the issue under discussion, but it had never been published.  It is a pity it had not previously been available to members because since its publication - I thank the Minister for circulating it on Friday last - it has allowed us to compare the new scheme with the existing one.  The latter is the case, despite the fact that Mercer did not review what was before it, rather it examined different options.  The option the Minister has put forward is quite close to one contained in the review.  This shows that there is some logic behind the moves she is making.  It is evident from the review that, in the context of the wind-up priorities she has chosen, she has shied away from the original proposals she made, either last year or the year before, to the effect that what would be introduced would be fairer.  Under the new scheme, some high-end pensions could continue to be protected and, despite having paid in for a number of years, some deferred and existing members could be left with very little.</p><p>  The Mercer review explores and simulates the outworkings of a range of hypothetical priority orders for two sample schemes.  The various priority orders fall into two categories, namely, a percentage plus a monetary cap and a floor plus a percentage, such that whatever happens there would be a minimum amount plus a percentage.  In my amendments I have put forward a model more akin to having a floor plus a percentage and a monetary cap.  This is to ensure every member of a scheme would benefit to the fullest extent.  The inclusion of a floor would ensure a minimum amount would be secured for all of those involved - existing pensioners, deferred members and existing members - and the cap would ensure active and deferred members would not be excluded from an earlier consideration in the distribution of assets.  I am seeking, therefore, to bring the latter into the priority order at an earlier stage.  With the inclusion of a cap, I am trying to avoid the shortcomings of the first option considered by Mercer for more mature schemes.  In the absence of a cap, a fund would run out of money before those who had yet to reach retirement age were considered.  The cap the Minister and others have proposed would be too high.</p></speech>

In essence we are trying to improve the situation for the lowest-paid pensioners in particular.  The Bill is concerned with securing benefits but that needs to be tilted in favour of the lower paid.  We must view this against the frightening backdrop of the fact that 80% of our pensioners depend on the State pension to provide the majority of their retirement income.  That is astounding and means the overwhelming majority of pensioners have an income of less than &euro;500 per week.  When one compares that to the very obscene pension pots that have been the subject of a lot of commentary recently, one cannot deny that a huge anomaly exists.  We must make provisions which protect lower earners and give people at least a minimum guaranteed income in retirement.  We can do more than this Bill provides for and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's amendments are an advance on the legislation as currently drafted.</p><p>  I do not want to repeat the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh but wish to deal with an issue which was discussed during the Second Stage debate, at which time the Minister indicated a willingness to examine it further.  It is an issue which is not directly linked to this Bill but rather to the principal Act of 2009, namely deferred members  being put on a par with active members, making them very vulnerable and exposed.  I appreciate that this legislation is attempting to give protection to the active group, which will give a subsequent protection to the deferred group of scheme members but-----</p></speech>

I know that situation is complicated by the fact that it is the existing pensioners who are now taking a hit in this legislation and they were not exposed previously.  It is a case of balancing interests, particularly in situations where schemes unravel, as with the IASS scheme, where the LRC sat down and discussed the pension scheme with groups of employees and came up with proposals which will have a devastating impact on deferred pensioners but that group did not have a voice at the negotiating table.  I do not know how that can be factored in to the legislation before us.  Is the solution, in terms of the priority order, putting the deferred pensioners on a par with the existing pensioners?  I do not know if that is the solution or whether it can be considered.  Perhaps the solution is to give deferred pensioners a right of audience when these matters are being negotiated.  Some of the proposals being put to deferred pensioners at the moment will see them experiencing a drop of up to 50% in their pension entitlements compared to their pension expectations.  That is an appalling situation for such people and they are being deprived of the right to have a say in the matter.  The Minister indicated earlier in the debate that this issue could be examined further.  I am not sure if we can deal with it now or on Report Stage but it must be taken into account here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.965" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013121200011#K00500"><p>I also have had representations from the Senior Citizens Parliament and representatives of deferred pensioners on this matter.  There seems to be a twofold problem here.  First, pensioners had a right of audience to the industrial relations machinery of the State up until the 1970s.  That right was removed on the basis that pensions in payment could not be reduced.  Of course, that has now changed as a result of the pension levy and it will also change as a result of this legislation.  Therefore, the question arises as to whether the right of audience should now be restored and there is a very strong case for such a restoration.  The second problem is that of the rights of deferred pensioners.  On the question of restructuring under this legislation, there seems to be a difference in the treatment of deferred pensioners as opposed to active pensioners but we will come to that later in the debate.</p><p>  I had intended to propose an amendment along the same lines as the one before us, not with the same figures necessarily but one which would make the legislation more progressive.  The objective was to hit the higher-paid pensioners harder and to offer more protection to those on lower pensions.  I published legislation some time ago in that vein.  The figures set out in Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's amendments would make the legislation more progressive than it currently is and for that reason, I will be supporting his amendments.</p></speech>

I appreciate what the Minister said about the Mercer report.  In terms of progressing this legislation, the Government suggested in regard to D&aacute;il reform that the heads of Bills would be published and we would have time to evaluate them and take counsel from groups which would be affected by their provisions, and in the case of this legislation some of them have managed to take the time in their busy schedules to get to grips with this highly complex Bill and submit their considerations.  It would have been appropriate for the Mercer report to have been published at that stage.  I am not sure if other Deputies have managed to look through it but it runs through a series of options and sets out the potential outcomes.  It does not does not run through the provisions in the Bill before us.  It is a useful tool in examining how various options could work and who would and would not benefit from them.</p><p>  For instance, the scheme I proposed is not set out in the report but it comes close to option 1A in it.  A range of options are set out and the Minister's proposal comes close to another option but it is not that exact option.  Therefore, the report would not have given us an insight into what the Government had been planning other than us running through figures in another way.  The Minister made her proposal prior to engaging with the Mercer report, which she examined but none of the options in it was the one she went with in the end.  The report was given to the Minister in January and we have been given it at the last minute.  If we had been given it earlier, we could have had a useful discussion on it to examine who exactly would benefit under a new priority order of distribution in the case of a defined benefit scheme being wound up, which is the eventuality with which we are dealing.</p><p>  The Minister said there are 803 defined benefit schemes, 400 of which are secure and there are no issues with them.  That leaves the other 50% with which there are a variety of issues and 20% of them with which there are major issues, which is a substantial number.  We do not know the scale of the membership of those 20% of schemes.  It could be the top 20% of those schemes but I do not believe it is as the ESB and other such groups have the big schemes which we have mentioned.  We do not know how many people are likely to be affected and that is the reason I welcome this legislation.  I am critical in some ways of it being rushed through but I welcome the fact it is being rushed in order that we have legislation in place to address the eventuality of a scheme being wound up in terms of the 160 schemes that are in danger of not reaching the required funding standard and ending up becoming insolvent and this process being triggered.  We do not know the figures involved, whether it is 10,000 active members with so many pensioners and deferred members.  It would have been useful to have those figures.  For the benefit of such members, we could have used the Mercer report to examine who would be most likely affected.  The majority of people who are members of this type of scheme might be entitled to very low pensions.  They may have been on a low income in the companies in which they were employed throughout their working lives.</p><p>  I could have a technical debate with the Minister on the merits of my proposals over hers but I am not inclined to do that because it would go over the heads of others.  All I will say is that I am adamant that the first priority at a minimum must be that every member of a scheme, in the event of it becoming insolvent, should have the required contributions to allow them to be entitled to the State contributory pension being bought on their behalf.  At a minimum they should have that entitlement and the pensioners already in a scheme should have a minimum benefit of &euro;12,000.  Those are the early priorities in this respect.  The others priorities are to ensure that as the fund is being is distributed, it is distributed on a more equal basis to the lower paid in those schemes.</p><p>  On the issue of the deferred members, the Minister said it would be difficult for them to be represented.  We have, through the trade union movement and other groups, a system of advocacy in many other areas of law.  We need to find some mechanism to address this and I will submit an amendment on Report Stage to allow for an advocate to be appointed or designated to represent the interests of deferred members.  An advocate such as the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament or another group could be specified at the behest of the Minister through regulation rather than being specified in the legislation.  The Minister, through regulation, could designate some group or groups - bearing in mind that groups form and disband - over time and that their duty and first responsibility would be to represent the deferred members in the regrettable event of a scheme being wound up or in the event of those members having to deal with the labour rights apparatus. </p></speech>

For example, in a submission to me, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament indicated that in many schemes, pensioners and their associations are denied access to scheme trustees and sponsoring employers, with no direct communication.  As I understand it from the submission of the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and others, up to the 1970s pensioners had a right of audience to the industrial relations machinery of the State, and following a successful pensioner case, the then Minister for labour affairs changed the law.  Could we go back to the position that applied before he changed the law, as the circumstances which resulted in him changing the law have changed again?</p></speech>

That is not really the issue, which is whether this is being improved enough and if the process is fair.  These are the issues we are grappling with, particularly as the work is being done at the expense of existing pensioners who, as of today, cannot have benefits touched.  These are the issues we are trying to balance.</p><p>  In that sense, it is the case that the issues highlighted to us with regard to deferred pensioners do not exactly fit with this Bill.  They have brought to light problems that exist for this group, whose position may be improved with the passing of this legislation but is still worse than it was before the 2009 Act was signed into law.  This is linked to the argument made about the fact that what the Minister termed "viable" arrangements are being discussed in many of these schemes.  For some of the groups involved, the viable arrangement to keep the scheme within the funding criteria is not viable at all.  Their interests are not being protected and these people see themselves as being disproportionately impacted by the mechanism put forward.  Discussions under way currently in the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme are under the auspices of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, so by virtue of the legislation they exclude existing pensioners and the deferred group from attendance.  Those discussions formulated a proposal resulting in some people having a loss of retirement income of up to 50%, which would be a devastating blow.  I can understand the logic that it may be difficult to mandate a consultation but these people are currently excluded because of legislation.  It should be about allowing people to participate when such a group can come together and have interests protected.  It is not about not being able to sign off on a process without tracking down every person in Lithuania who used to work here.</p><p>  For example, in the IASS there are more than 5,000 deferred members who are getting an astronomical hit.  Through social media and contacts they have formed a group and their voice should be heard in a balanced way.  These are similar to the points made by Deputy O'Dea regarding pensioners.  The three strands must be brought together in a crisis so as to balance interests.  That can only be done fairly when the three groups are represented.  I know the Minister has heard the point and she is suggesting it could be done by some sort of statutory instrument, guideline or something else in legislation.  Given that there is a legislative basis for these people being excluded, a reversal of that process may be the way out.  If a group of deferred pensioners wish to attend talks in the Labour Relations Commission, the unions representing the active members - their former colleagues and friends - will tell them to come in.  The difficulty would occur if they were prevented from attending.  The legislative proposal should be considered.  These people are outside of a company but we are not addressing the possibility of overturning the 2009 Act.  I can understand why that is so but the matter is now in the public domain and people feel it needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

This is pensions legislation and my remit is limited to that.  I have heard what Deputies O'Dea and Daly have said in that pensions are a key part of industrial relations issues for companies and workers.  From a pensions legislation perspective, I can send a copy of my note to people.  There are three types of members: pensioners, active members and deferred members.  All these must be notified by trustees of the different elements that I read into the record.</p><p>  This is an area in industrial relations legislation.  As we saw, companies and unions attend the Labour Relations Commission and try to thrash out a viable and sustainable scheme for the pension fund as part of considering the viability of a company.  I can certainly speak to my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, but I do not know if there has been any work done on that.  I will revert to the Deputies in that respect.  It would be dishonest to say it is part of the remit of this Bill, as it is not.</p><p>  Much of this issue centres on the quality of information available to people from trustees.  Considering the guidelines and legislation, I will work with the pensions regulators and the Pensions Ombudsman, who handles many individual cases where people feel there is a grievance or the pensions have not been calculated properly, in drawing up guidelines to see if there are ways in which we can improve the information available to the three categories of members.  On the positive side, this is the first time that deferred members' interests are being positively taken into account and being reflected in the legislation.</p><p>  At my request the Department held a very detailed review of all the issues raised in the Mercer report.  Some of the members of the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament were party to the consultation.  Many of the scenarios set out in the Mercer report were discussed by stakeholder representatives, including older people, the pensions industry, employers and trade unions.  The Mercer report entailed a detailed external review and the scenarios were presented in many cases to the stakeholders.  The clearest conclusion from all the exercises on consultation undertaken was the benefit of putting a notional floor in place to protect low pensions.  It was the clearest message that came to me and it is what I have tried to implement in this legislation.</p><p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has pointed out, as in the Mercer report we can all produce different scenarios but in the legislation we must opt for one.  I have made the case as to why the one I have adopted offers the most, especially in the context of the current difficult economic position.  It offers a floor of decency for existing pensioners and we hope the numbers restructuring will be small.</p></speech>

I will take amendment No. 13 as an example, but what I say about it applies to the other amendments.  The floor is &euro;12,000.  What the Minister has given people is &euro;12,000 worth of purchasing power today.  However, that might not be &euro;12,000 worth of purchasing power next year if there is 1% or 2% inflation.  It certainly will not be the case that &euro;12,000 will have the same purchasing power in five years time.  If we are protecting people to the extent of what they can purchase for &euro;12,000 this year, that should be indexed in line with inflation in order that they are protected for the same amount each year.  For example, someone in his or her 40s who is paying into a defined benefit pension scheme will not take much solace from the fact that he or she will be protected to the extent of &euro;12,000 a year when he or she is 65.  The sum of &euro;12,000 today might be worth an awful lot less in 20 years time when people reach the age of 65, and the amounts should be indexed to protect their value.</p></speech>

What I would have to do in this case is go back to Government if a situation such as that described by Deputy O&rsquo;Dea arose.  Currently, the median pension is &euro;11,000 and the floor of &euro;12,000 is above that.  I will undertake to go back to Government if that relationship changes over time.  Perhaps I am being an optimist but what I hope is that the need for the restructuring we have experienced due to the fall-out of recent years will not arise as urgently, as we are sorting out pensions.  I will go back to Government to undertake to revisit the floor of &euro;12,000 but I do not particularly see that it is terribly relevant to include it in the legislation.  I undertake to go back to Government because that would be a requirement.  If after this period of restructuring and resettlement there was another crisis, I would assume one have to again look at medians.  I hope that by then we would have a mandatory or auto-enrolment supplementary pension scheme in order that there would be other benchmarks to take into account as well.  That is the way I would prefer to do it.  I sympathise with the Deputy and understand what he is trying to achieve but it would be better done by returning to Government, as with an annual budget, to seek to review it in the context of the various data which affect pensions.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dea has suggested that the sums of money in the Bill be indexed linked or at the very least reviewed annually to ensure that the figure would not lose its impact over time.  They should be indexed linked or tied to the equivalent, the State contributory pension, which is what the Minister suggested as the equivalent.  Aligning it to the State contributory pension might allow it to roll over each year without the Minister having to review it on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  We are dealing with defined benefit schemes.  If the current trend continues, there will not be too many left in five or six years.  I am including the 120 schemes in the problem area.</p><p>  Is there a way of arriving at a formula of words with which the Minister would be happy to give effect to what is contained in Deputy O'Dea's amendments Nos. 16 and 17.</p><p>  It is important that the value of the all the figures in the legislation do not lose the effect over time.  The figures for the priority order are fine at present but let us remember that when I bought my house in 1994, it cost &euro;32,000.  Even in today's depressed housing market, that figure would go nowhere.  What we consider as a reasonable pension today might have a different value altogether in the space of ten or 15 years time.  Could we include in the definition section that all figures mentioned in this part of the legislation are index linked or at the very least that the lower figures should be tied to a realisable figure such as the State contributory pension, which is the nominal reason for the figure of &euro;12,000.</p></speech>

I am certainly happy to undertake that.  Any time a significant issues related to pensions arises, which is an important issue in society and the wider economy, I would normally bring it to Government.  I can certainly undertake to do so.</p><p>  There are two social welfare Bills each year, the budget Bill and what is often called the spring or summer social welfare Bill.  Both Bills give ample opportunity to revisit this particular issue should the need arise.  I am happy to give that undertaking.  I know the senior officials, who have greater longevity to use a pension term than the Ministers in the Department, would anticipate dealing with the policy in that way.  I would be happy to support that.  I give that undertaking publicly.</p></speech>

We believe it is unfair to ask defined contribution contributors to fund a guarantee that applies only to defined benefit schemes.  Ultimately, it is worse than this because as stated by the Minister when I raised this issue on Second Stage, the pension levy will be used to deal with double insolvency cases and has been allocated by the Minister for Finance for a variety of things, including the Exchequer.  It has been used in the past to support the jobs initiative.  We must be careful we are not engaging in double or treble accountancy such that the same money is not allocated on a number of occasions.</p><p>  It is unfair that people who are not part of a particular scheme should have to subsidise it in some way.  People should not be asked to pay for a scheme which would have been beneficial to those who were members of it.  While it may be that for the greater good somebody has to pick up the tab in the case of double insolvencies, we should look at putting in place a cap on the liability of the State in the case of double insolvencies because it is a private arrangement, albeit that the Government has the duty of control of regulation.</p><p>  I am still considering tabling an amendment in regard to putting a monetary cap on the amount for which the State would be liable in the case of double insolvency.  I am trying to come up with a formula of words in that regard.  In general, I agree with the thrust of this amendment.  It would be useful if what the pension levy will be used for were explicitly stated.</p></speech>

Revenue from the 0.15% levy which will apply in 2013 and 2014 as referenced in the budget will be used to fund the jobs initiative, including the reduced 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector, and to provide for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.  That is what was said by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement in relation to the introduction of the 0.15% levy.  The revenue arising to the Exchequer from the levy, as with most Exchequer revenues in Ireland, is not earmarked or hypothecated to any particular item of expenditure.  When devising a budget, revenue lines are available to fund particular costs.</p><p>  In regard to DB schemes and double insolvencies, agreement has been secured for certain liabilities to be met by the Exchequer.  I am not aware of any double insolvencies, which is when an employer and scheme go under, in the pipeline.  Under this legislation, the State's liability is being capped at 50%.  In the case of the Waterford Glass workers, whose case was adjudicated on by the European Court, as they made their original application in the Irish courts, they are now back in the High Court.  Obviously, this case has to be proceed.  I understand it is being done with some diligence but none the less these types of legal cases take time.</p><p>  In regard to the subject matter of the amendment, which provides that the levy shall not be applied to a defined contribution pension, levying or taxing is a policy matter for the Minister for Finance.  This is a decision of the Minister for Finance in the context of a number of liabilities which the State has, including the jobs initiative and, specifically, the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector.  I will draw the Deputy's concerns to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  There are a number of people who pay on a defined contribution basis.  There is a point in making provision for the type of collapses that are occasionally experienced.  Obviously defined contribution schemes are on a different basis.  The funder of last resort in cases such as Waterford Glass, which thankfully are rare and exceptional, is the State.  The State must resource such cases through the broad measures of taxation, levies and so on.</p></speech>

The legislation provides for such eventualities.  In the event of a double insolvency the legislation provides that people's defined benefit entitlements up to a maximum of 50% will be financed by a levy which is levied on pensioners, of which there are only two types, namely, members of defined benefit pension schemes and members of defined contribution pension schemes.  As this applies only to the former, members of defined contribution pension schemes believe they should not be paying the levy.  It will be of no benefit to them.</p></speech>

To some extent there may be an element of intergenerational solidarity because by and large the people in the defined-contribution schemes are younger on average than people in defined-benefit schemes because many defined-benefit schemes have been closed to new entrants for a significant period of time.  The only other example, I suppose, is the public service, which, in essence, is an unfunded defined-benefit scheme.</p></speech>

I have seen some documentation that people have received over the years.  While I do not cast any aspersions on the Minister or her Department, it would be easier to read Swahili.  I know lawyers are obliged to state things in a certain way and in order to cover themselves they must use certain phraseology, etc.  Having used all that exotic phraseology and legal terminology, surely it would not be beyond the wit of people, who manage pension schemes and do very well out of it as we will demonstrate in a moment, to put the thing in fairly simple language so that people can know approximately where they stand.</p></speech>

I am afraid, as the Deputy has mentioned, sometimes it is not only like looking into a bush, but like looking into a thicket, trying to make out the meaning of a pension statement.  The Deputy is correct in pointing out that the people in the pensions industry earn very handsome rewards for the work they do.</p><p>  The standard annual trustee report must show the: benefits payable at normal retirement age, assuming one stayed to this age, based on present salary and how benefits are calculated; benefits payable at normal retirement age, assuming one left service at the stated date and the method of calculation; how contributions are calculated; contributions paid to date and the amounts of any transfers received; and information on benefits from AVCs or funds transferred from another pension scheme or PRSA.  Those requirements already exist and I do not believe we need additional legal provision for it.  Lawyers would probably argue that this language is clear and people should be told everything.  I sometimes think that much of this information would be better in something like an info-graph because it is very complex.  There are further pages of notes which are even more impenetrable.  Often the most important things are in the notes.</p><p>  I hope that with the development of the governance structures on pensions in Ireland having the reports we had that we will be moving to this.  However, I do not believe it needs to be incorporated in legislation because the requirements for the information already exist.  We will certainly be encouraging the campaign for plain English, but that is a tough one to crack in pensions.</p></speech>

Having to look at three or four pieces of legislation going back to a principal Act can be very difficult and I have argued for consolidated Bills published with explanatory memoranda outlining deletions, etc.  With computers we could do it at the drop of a hat so that we could see what is being deleted and what is replacing it.  I have often used the example of the debate on the Nice treaty.  The former MEP, Jens-Peter Bonde, produced a version of the Nice treaty in which it was very easy to see what was being deleted and what was being added with space for notations.  If we moved towards that, it would make our job a little easier and it would also benefit those who are trying to figure out the intent of changes to legislation.</p><p>  In this case very complicated estimations are being made by trustees when sending out documentation.  Until recently I was not aware of the way in which annuities are used in one case and in another case actuarial values are used.  I know this is something the Mercer report suggested changing.  This is not the ideal time to move towards the change that would best benefit people and also give them an indication of where their pension was so that one is moving away from those who were active members where it is estimated on an actuarial basis and those who are coming into benefit where it is on an annuity basis.  There is a huge discrepancy between the two - approximately 20%.</p><p>  The Mercer report that the Minister circulated contains an entire page dealing with what it refers to as the transfer-value basis.  It is something that needs to be addressed.  It could be addressed in this legislation with a sunrise clause that it would not come into being until such the fund is in the black again.  That might be a way to address it.  However, we should certainly in the medium term have a single standard for estimation for trustees to outline the value of the fund, the number of active members, the number of people in receipt of the pension and everything else they need to comply with.  Using two different formulae coming up with different figures can cause confusion, especially for people who are trying to work it out for themselves.  They work out on what basis their annuity would be purchased or whatever, and then all of a sudden find it is 20% less because theirs was based on a different figure.  It needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The existing Pensions Board is working on a number of communications regarding information on pensions, some of which I expect to launch in February.  When the pensions council is established it will be given the specific remit of consumer interests.  As both Deputies have said, the paramount issue is communication with consumers in a language they can understand.  If that were possible, it would also become much easier to persuade people of the value of taking out a pension early on.  Part of people's reluctance to and disinterest in taking out a pension is finding the documentation so difficult to understand.</p></speech>

The Department's own study showed that someone who saved &euro;250 per month from the age of 35 could end up with a fund of &euro;200,000 after 30 years.  That would leave them with an annual pension of &euro;10,000 per year.  However, when one takes out the charges, the sum of &euro;200,000 is reduced by approximately &euro;62,000 and the pension is reduced from &euro;10,000 to &euro;6,900.  No one could argue that these intermediaries, managers, trustees or whatever are underpaid.  Having read the report to its fullest extent, I realise the complexity of the situation and that putting in a standard 1% may be somewhat simplistic, in view of how such items are priced and so on.  However, I reiterate that I tabled the amendment to draw attention to, and to revitalise the Minister's interest in, the issue. At the time the aforementioned report was discussed by members, the Minister indicated there would be follow-up in respect of dealing with those charges and perhaps she might outline what is happening in that regard.</p></speech>

In some ways, matters have moved on since and continue to do so.  I do not believe the charges being applied to such schemes have become any cheaper.  This is a small State at the edge of Europe and in some ways, the major insurance companies that deal with and invest pensions appear to believe they can charge people here more than is the case in their own home territories and this must be taken into account.  I am unsure about the 1% limit but one must try to ensure people's pension pots and investments are not being eaten away by administrative or other such charges..  In addition, I note that in some cases, the pension levy was passed on rather than being absorbed from the existing charges being levied.  In such cases, no hit was experienced by the pension industry that handles all these funds.  I would rather it had been passed on to those who were investing and who in recent years already have been hit with other increases, such as the universal social charge, changes in taxation and so on.  Such people have suffered an additional hit, rather than the industry itself reducing its charges.  It would be useful were some kind of message contained within this Bill, even though it only deals specifically with the times of single or double insolvencies.  It would be appropriate for a message to go out to the pension industry stating enough was enough and the industry needed to begin to row back on the charges being imposed.</p></speech>

On the precise item identified by Deputy O'Dea in his amendment, namely, the annual management charge, these are charges associated with the cost of fund management.  It does not take account of other charges incurred such as contribution charges, policy fees, exit penalties and other undisclosed costs.  The recommendation from the pension charges report I commissioned is to continue efforts to develop a single standard measure that would assess all costs and charges, thereby enabling easier comparisons to be made.  In some way, the debate on charges in Ireland has been extraordinarily muted because, particularly in respect of the provision of pensions for self-employed people, accountants or tax consultants are standing beside people's side and on the one hand, there is a potential tax liability while on the other hand, there is a pension plan to which they possibly will contribute.  In a way, people are focused on - of course the pension provider focuses on - the generosity of the tax reduction in such a way that in my experience, the charges get relegated to the small print.  One is told that one could pay, for example, &euro;50,000 in tax or, if one makes an appropriate investment in a pension fund, one's tax bill will fall by X amount.  Consequently, one is considering charges in the psychological context of one's likely tax bill minus one's saving on entering into the pension.  In that context, the management-type charges, commitment fees and so on, are relatively small compared with the tax relief.  I believe this is one of the problems.</p><p>  As I stated, when the new Pensions Council is under way, I will ask it specifically to consider this issue again.  I have also asked the Central Bank to examine some charges that were identified in the report in respect of re-brokering.  This is an area in which, particularly with small schemes, charges can be very high and it is important that this issue be dealt with.  However, simply because of the dominance of tax reliefs in the Irish pension cost scheme, charges unfortunately have a much lower profile.  In particular, for women and relatively low-paid workers accumulating, for example, a relatively modest personal retirement savings account, PRSA, of &euro;100,000, the charges could have a very heavy impact on it and people really do not see this impact until the very end when they have exited.  It is something that, as Minister, I keep under constant review.</p></speech>

This amendment is tied to the earlier discussion, when members went through its main points.  I believe one should ensure that no company, whether it is a subsidiary or a singular company, should renege on its responsibilities to its pensioners, whether they be active or future pensioners, if such a company has the capacity to pay.  In the earlier amendment, I was careful in my wording to specify companies with positive net revenues, which means one would not be threatening existing jobs and the associated pay and conditions.  In essence, if such companies are profitable or are making major returns to their parent company or are investing in future plants that are not tied to the existing workforce, this means they are in a positive revenue position and their responsibilities and commitments they made to the workers should be met.</p></speech>

It provides that in the event of a fund being restructured, there is a limit to the amount to which one can reduce certain people's benefits.  That is dealt with in the eighth paragraph of the new section 1B.  It states that the restrictions apply only to benefits payable from the scheme to or in respect of persons receiving benefits under the scheme or persons who have reached normal pensionable age.  Does that distinguish between existing active pensioners and deferred pensioners?  Does it confine the curtailment of or restriction on the trustees to people in receipt of pensions?  Does it mean, for example, that the benefit of an active pensioner can only be reduced by so much, whereas in the case of a deferred pension they can do what they like and there is no limit?  Is a distinction being created here between active and deferred pensioners?</p></speech>

It seems strange that in a single insolvency situation no element of the debt remains with the company.  It would seem in those circumstances that a company is allowed to wind up the scheme and essentially walk away from it.  That leaves the taxpayer to pick up the tab.  I do not understand why that debt does not remain with the company.  That is the most significant gap in this legislation.  It sets out how members will have to share the pain, but it allows companies to wash their hands of their responsibilities.  I am not sure if taxpayers realise this is what the Minister proposes to do.  It is not allowed in the United Kingdom.  Why on earth does the Minister propose to do it in this legislation?  I would be interested to hear the justification for it.  As far as I can see, this is a huge gap in the legislation but it needs to be closed by way of amendments similar to the ones proposed by my two colleagues.</p></speech>

Very few schemes have adjusted core benefits.  In some schemes, for instance, the pensions, including deferred ones, moved with how salaries moved in the company.  In a lot of restructuring cases, the sacrifice that has been made is to forgo some or all of those increases.  Those kind of changes would apply to deferred members because, in a certain sense, they are all pensioners of the company.  When deferred members come to get the pension, they will get it in the context of the restructured scheme.</p><p>  It does not happen to them at the moment because they are simply deferred.  What they may expect, however, will have changed because the pension entitlement, when a person becomes a pensioner, will have changed.  That is quite a popular way, just as workers negotiating a wage increase have decided that a percentage or all of the wage increase might well be devoted to plugging a deficiency in the scheme as a priority, or it might be shared 50:50.  These are the common stratagems that have been identified in restructuring.</p><p>  Active and deferred pensioners are treated the same, therefore, but the deferred people have not yet reached retirement age or their retirement entitlement for the purposes of the pension fund. </p><p>  As regards Deputy Shortall's comments, we had a detailed discussion on the earlier amendments concerning employer liability.  I said then that in drawing up the legislation, detailed consideration had been given to the arguments for and against employer liability.  On balance, the decision has been not to go with employer liability for a number of reasons.  One is that, in terms of unintended consequences, it may precipitate the closure of a number of schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1028" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1178" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013121200021#V00200"><p>That is not the rationale.  The Minister's explanation underlies the folly of taking a piecemeal approach to pension reform.  It is regrettable that this issue has not been addressed in a comprehensive and meaningful way.  As I stated previously, it is a case of passing the parcel between social protection and finance on this.  One cannot make changes in one area without them having a knock-on effect in other areas.  The type of arguments being put forward by the Minister, such as the danger of companies closing schemes and so on, is reminiscent of the arguments made against attempts to tax capital, namely, that it would flee the country.  Employers have responsibilities to their employees.  The State should be insisting that they honour those responsibilities.  If that needs underpinning in legislation that is what should be done.  The type of open situation that currently exists should not be allowed to continue.</p><p>  The Minister speaks about this as if it is some kind of grace and favour arrangement with employers.  Their failure to address a deficit in a scheme and the Government allowing them to walk away means that the risk is spread not between the employers and employees but with the remainder of the tax paying population.  Essentially, the Minister is allowing employers, even though they may have current or future the capacity to meet that deficit, to walk away from their responsibilities, if only moral responsibilities given the lack of statutory underpinning in this regard, leaving everybody else to pick up the tab.  That is an indefensible position to adopt.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not grasped this nettled and dealt with the problem.</p><p>  With regard to the overall proposals in this legislation, I am surprised that the overall benefit is not being capped.  The notional figure of &euro;60,000 is being used by Revenue in terms of what is regarded as a reasonable, and in many ways very generous, pension that would be subsidised by the State.  I cannot understand why this is not being capped in the context of this legislation, which again would help to spread the risk more evenly.  The Minister spoke about spreading the risk.  While that is what is being done employers are not being included in this regard.</p></speech>

The people who do not have any type of proper pension structure are typically people in low paid jobs, women and other people who have interrupted periods of employment for different reasons.  Most of them end up relying solely and exclusively on the State pension because their employment does not provide for a pension.  If we were to develop a national scheme of supplementary pension to which individual employees would contribute over their working lives, the State, possibly through taxation or other mechanisms, and the employer would achieve the goal in which most people are interested, in that people, particularly those who are less well off, would end up with some pension provision in excess of the State contributory retirement pension.  In comparison with other EU countries, payments in Ireland are at the higher end of the scale.  The current level of the State retirement pension at &euro;12,000 per annum is not a huge amount on which to retire.  I understand the Deputy has a different conclusion.  Having considered the matter, this would not be achieved through the introduction of an employer obligation.  I think the way to go is to develop the supplementary mandatory or auto-enrolment system.  Other countries have done this and in doing so have achieved vastly improved cover.  The reality in relation to defined pension schemes is that they have been in trouble for two decades now, in particular since the late 1980s when the accounting standards in relation to how pensions would be treated in accounts were changed dramatically.  This led to the changes that have been experienced.  </p><p>  In regard to the taxpayer liability, which is important, this applies in respect of a double insolvency, namely, where a company and pension become insolvent.  I would sincerely hope and expect that because in the past this has been a relatively rare event there will be no double insolvencies in the future.  The capping of benefits was discussed in the context of an earlier amendment.</p></speech>

Despite some statements to the contrary, in many cases people who qualify for an occupational pension might for one reason or another not be entitled to a State pension.  The trustees who administer these pension schemes have a great deal of power now.  When this legislation is passed they will be able to reduce pensions substantially.  The figures in the Mercer report indicate that some people who are receiving a fairly modest pension could suffer very substantial reductions in their income with negative consequences for their lifestyle as a result of a decision by trustees.</p><p>  When a viable scheme is being restructured the trustees have sole discretion in how to restructure it.  I accept that under Irish trust law trustees have certain obligations.  They have a fiduciary duty and an obligation to inform the people affected.  While they might have an obligation to inform them, they have no obligation to listen to them or take into account anything they say; it is solely a matter for the trustees to decide.</p><p>  I am proposing the introduction of an appeals body - it could be a section of the Pensions Board or whatever - to which aggrieved pensioners can appeal.  This would allow them to point out something that is unfair and hitting their section particularly hard - perhaps people higher up could take more of the pain or whatever.  All the talk about the right to consultation and the need to inform people is fine, but informing people about a <i>fait accompli</i> does not get us very far.  Trustees are obliged to inform people, but are not obliged to listen to them.  We need an appeals mechanism whereby a pensioner who feels aggrieved by a decision of the trustees can appeal his or her case.</p></speech>

I would go further and include the deferred members in such an appeal mechanism.  As a group, they may find themselves out of synch.  In some ways the trustees hold all the cards in these events.  For those without the representation of, for example, a union, it would be important to have some type of appeals mechanism to allow them to put their case if they feel they have been disproportionately impacted by a particular change.  I am not arguing that such an appeals mechanism should be outlined in full in the legislation at this stage, but that could be done by way of regulation.  I may table an amendment based on Deputy O'Dea's amendment to ensure that the appeals body would be established by regulation or suchlike.  It should outline the manner in which these people could be represented in such a process.  We do not want each individual pensioner or deferred member having to take a case to appeal.  It should be possible for them to be grouped together or, as we discussed earlier, have a representative group identified by the Minister or whatever.</p><p>  It is also in line with the proposals we made on representation for the deferred members to ensure their cases would be taken on board at an early stage when their changes are being discussed.  There would be less need for them to be included in an appeals mechanism if the deferred members were fully represented at an earlier stage, but there is no harm in having them there.  As the earlier amendments were not accepted, we should press this to ensure it is put in place.  Hopefully the mechanism would never need to be activated.  Simply having it would force the trustees to take greater account of it because they would know there would be a possibility of challenging them through an appeals mechanism and they would have to stand over it.  Therefore it would force them to ensure that any decisions they take are proportionate in respect of the various groups, the active members, the current and future pensioners.</p></speech>

First, the Department of Social Protection probably has the most extensive consultation process of almost any Department.  It could be argued at times that things might move a lot faster, were the Department to adopt the practices of other Government agencies by having limited consultation.  People from the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament, who were very welcome, were present for the entirety of the morning's proceedings.  In addition, I am unsure whether Deputy Shortall is aware of this, but the Department meets representatives of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament pretty constantly.  They are included as a matter of course in everything the Department organises in respect of pensions, including the extensive stakeholders' consultation that was undertaken at length with regard to this Bill.</p><p>  There is no denying that this is difficult legislation.  It is probable that no one present would ever have wished to have such legislation considered.  In the case of defined benefit schemes in the past, people simply did not live for as long, financial markets were far more stable and buying bonds and annuities was a far easier prospect.  However, all these things have changed in recent years.  Some have changed for the better, such as the increase in longevity.  However, I am happy to inform the Deputy that representatives of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament and of other pensioners were involved in all the stakeholder consultations, which were very detailed, on this Bill.  The Mercer study was commissioned and the information and scenario-setting that is set out in the Mercer report formed the basis for much of the discussions that took place at the consultations, a number of which I attended in part.  I am happy to confirm the people about whom the Deputy spoke were involved.  Moreover, my senior officials next week are meeting, as is regular, the secretary of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament to discuss in detail the parliament's ongoing issues.</p><p>  However, if we are to have a situation in which the interests of active and deferred members also are taken into account, one must carry out such a rebalancing in an appropriate way.  I explained earlier that the figure of &euro;12,000 was selected.  Figures within the industry had recommended a much lower floor - I believe &euro;6,000 was the figure most frequently suggested - but some suggestions were radically lower than that again.  The median pension to pensioners in defined benefit schemes is &euro;11,000 and the figure of &euro;12,000 is above that.  Consequently, it means that people on the median pension are fully protected by the floor.  In addition, people in defined benefit schemes in the private sector almost all have an entitlement to a State retirement pension, which brings values of a further &euro;12,000, which for most people brings the package up to &euro;24,000.  I had to hand a table in earlier discussions regarding people in the semi-State sector, who of course have been on a different rate of PRSI.  I refer, for instance, to people in the ESB scheme.  Incidentally, years ago, it was the case that people working in semi-State organisations, their representatives and the companies concerned did not particularly wish to be in the PRSI structure and this only changed after 1995.  However, for people paying class D contributions, in the case of those earning up to &euro;1,443 per week, the weekly PRSI contribution by the individual and the employer is 0.9% and 2.35%, respectively, giving a PRSI combined contribution of 3.25% per week.  As the full contributions are of 4% and 10.75%, respectively, or 14.75% in total, one is comparing contributions of 3.25% with contributions of 14.75%.</p><p>  However, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, what then happened in such schemes was that the pension on retirement was calculated having reference to an industrial pension in a private defined benefit scheme and then by reference to the calculation of what benefits would arise, had the employees been contributing to PRSI in full.  In effect, this is the reason one often finds that pension entitlements in semi-State employments are significantly higher than those in equivalent private sector entities.  People sometimes wrongly state they have much higher pensions because they think those individuals also might have the State retirement pension.  However, unless they are post-1995 employees, by and large they do not because they, their representatives and the companies were happy to be in PRSI class D.  Therefore, when one considers the &euro;12,000 floor and the &euro;12,000 State retirement pension, bringing it up to a total of &euro;24,000, I decided on balance that this was a fair point, given that the average industrial wage in Ireland is somewhere between &euro;34,000 and &euro;36,000.  In fact, if this rule applies to Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and if what they state happens to their salaries applies-----</p></speech>

I discussed this at length with Deputy O'Dea.  As the Deputy said, this is in regard to the industrial relations machinery.  The Department of Social Protection does not have any power regarding the industrial relations machinery, but I told Deputy O'Dea that I would take it up with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Employment because that is where the industrial relations machinery arises.</p></speech>

I intend tabling an amendment on employer liability and also on the need to introduce an upper limit.</p><p>  The Minister said she did not want to have to introduce this legislation.  She would not have to introduce it in the way she is doing it if the Government had dealt with the wider pensions issue in terms of the &euro;2.5 billion being spent on pension tax relief.  If she had gone ahead with the undertakings given on limiting that tax relief, we would not be in a situation where she is increasing the levy on pensions, which is hitting many private sector pensioners.  There were options available.  There is a big pot of money available and the issue is how that is shared out.  Unfortunately, the Government has not grasped the nettle in this regard and used that funding to redirect support from the State for pensions.  There is an opportunity to do that but, unfortunately, it has not been taken.</p></speech>

It is reforming legislation.  What I said is that I regret the difficulties pension funds have found themselves in over a protracted period going back to the late 1980s.</p></speech>

We are now in public session.  I advise members to turn off their mobile telephones while attending committee meetings.  Active mobile telephones interfere with the sound system and RT&Eacute; has informed us that it will not broadcast any part of a meeting where interference from mobile telephones has occurred.</p><p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Noel Coonan and Michael McCarthy.  Before we begin I wish to read into the record of the meeting an item of correspondence we have received.  It relates to the appearance of the Genealogical Society of Ireland and the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland at our meeting on 10 December 2013.  It is addressed to the Clerk to the Committee, dated 11 December 2013 and entitled &lsquo;Classification &amp;amp; Correction of Record&rsquo;.  It is from Mr. Michael Merrigan, General Secretary of the Genealogical Society of Ireland and it reads as follows:<blockquote>A Chl&eacute;irigh, a Chara,<br />At the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee held on Tuesday 10th December 2013 a reference was made to myself, Michael Merrigan, in the opening address by the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland (APGI) which was unfortunately and, no doubt, unintentionally, factually incorrect.<br />Therefore, I wish to clarify the matter in order that the record may be corrected in the interest of historical accuracy.<br />The reference to me acting as 'General Secretary' of the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations (CIGO) during the passage of the Statistics Bill through Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1993 is factually incorrect.<br />I was acting for and on behalf of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Genealogical Society, the forerunner of the Genealogical Society of Ireland, and no other genealogical organisations were involved.<br />Furthermore, in the interest of historical accuracy, please note that the Statistics Bill was signed into law on July 14th 1993 and that the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations (CIGO) was only established on July 9th 1994 at a meeting held at the Royal Marine Hotel, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Co. Dublin - almost exactly one year after the enactment of the Statistics Act, 1993.<br />I would be obliged if you could kindly read the above into the record of the Oireachtas Joint Committee for clarification and historical accuracy.<br />Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</blockquote>      Mise le meas,</p><p>      Michael Merrigan, MA, FGSI<blockquote>General Secretary<br />Genealogical Society of Ireland.</blockquote>  I propose that we note this correspondence and inform the Genealogical Society of Ireland that it has been read into the record of this meeting.  I propose that we forward a copy of this correspondence to the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland for its information as it concerns that organisation, that we notify the Genealogical Society of Ireland of this decision and notify the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland that the Genealogical Society of Ireland has been so notified.  Is this agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  As we do not have any itemised correspondence list for this meeting I propose that we include this item of correspondence for recording purposes in the correspondence list for our next meeting.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I welcome the following witnesses to the meeting: Ms Catr&iacute;ona Crowe, National Archives of Ireland; Ms Fiona Ross, director, Ms Colette O'Flaherty, keeper of archival collections, Mr. Gerard Long, assistant keeper of archival collections of the National Library of Ireland; and Mr. Kevin Lonergan, principal officer, Mr. Chris Flynn, principal officer, and Ms Orlagh Gleeson, assistant principal officer, Cultural and Art Institutions, at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.   I thank them all for their attendance here today.  I propose that we hear the witnesses in the order in which I have introduced them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>  This session will continue until 3.45 p.m. when we will suspend and we will resume at 4.15 p.m. with our second session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their  evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting. </p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before I call on the first witness I wish to make some comments.  As stated at our meeting on 10 December, genealogy and the search for one's origins have become a very important issue for many people in Ireland and elsewhere.  People want to know where they have come from and the origins of their families.  They want to know if their foreparent was a soldier, farmer or blacksmith, what part of Ireland he or she came from and what were the local conditions that encouraged or forced them to leave.  While many people engage in genealogical research as a personal hobby there is a very important role for the professional genealogist in providing research, information and Internet facilities.  The worldwide web in particular has an important role to play in facilitating people all over the world in accessing records in Ireland without leaving their homes.  While this makes it much easier for them to engage in such research it will also hopefully encourage them to visit Ireland at a later stage.</p><p>  I now call on Ms Catr&iacute;ona Crowe to address the committee.</p></speech>

Although it is not a specialist genealogical library, it is a major resource for Irish family history researchers.  The National Library of Ireland's mission is to collect, preserve, promote and make accessible the documentary and intellectual record of the life of Ireland and to contribute to the provision of access to the larger universe of recorded knowledge.  The library's extensive collections include printed manuscript and visual material - much of which is unique - from the archives of landed estates to the papers of major Irish writers, Gaelic manuscripts, collections relating to Irish national history and politics, books printed in Ireland and books of Irish interest published abroad, Irish newspapers, periodicals and official publications, photographs, prints, drawings and ephemera.</p><p>  In order to fulfil our statutory remit, we must also develop significant capacity for the ingest and preservation of what is referred to as born digital material, while continuing to develop our printed and manuscript collections and to manage our legacy collections.  We have begun to collect born digital material on a very small scale through the archiving of some websites and blogs.</p><p>  The library has provided a national genealogy advisory service for more than 20 years and has facilitated researchers at every level of research and assisted hundreds of thousands of researchers in making those all important links to past generations and to places where their ancestors lived.  For example, we welcomed over 7,000 visitors in the month of July 2013.  Most recently the library has hosted a lecture series on topics of interest to family history researchers.</p><p>  The Office of the Chief Herald has been part of the library since 1943 and is the heraldic authority for Ireland.  The office grants, confirms and records coats of arms to Irish citizens and persons of Irish descent around the world.  Its archives include heraldic manuscripts from the sixteenth century to the present day, documenting Cromwellian settlers in Ireland, as well as the Wild Geese emigr&eacute;s from Ireland, collections of wills and pedigree abstracts and other significant record types.</p><p>  All aspects of the library's collection management activity and service delivery have been affected by significant reductions in staffing and budget in recent years.  Our current staff component is 85 full-time equivalents and our employment control framework number is 75 staff.  Equivalent national libraries such as the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales have 324 staff and 300 staff, respectively.  The library has a significant storage requirement with currently less than 1% of the national collections preserved to international standards.  As a result, the remaining 99% are at risk through outdated and inadequate storage facilities.</p><p>  Following a government decision of 31 October 2012, the governance of the National Library of Ireland will change.  Legislation providing for this change will be presented to the Cabinet in the near future.  We will continue to make the case for additional resources and we will work to ensure that the library derives the greatest possible benefit from the technological developments which have transformed the library world.  The transformation programme currently in train at the national library will see the creation of a twenty-first century library capable of supporting the needs of both existing users and future generations.  The library's collections are a national resource but their potential can only be fully realised with appropriate planning and investment.  Delivering the widest possible access to these collections is central to our mission and we are completely committed to playing our part in the development of any national genealogical resource.</p></speech>

We will gather their statements with the ones that were made on Monday and with those we will hear from next group of people.  Mr. Lonergan from the Department made an important point about the indexes.  There has been an improvement whereby people can now go to one portal to search for records with the redesign of the www.irishgenealogy,ie website.  It is the right way to go, but it is the getting of the records, as opposed to the indexes, that is critical and that will be the game-changer.  Where does that fit in with the Department's the work programme?  Are discussions taking place between the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Social Protection on changes, perhaps legislative changes, that would result in that happening?  There is not the same control over church records that there is over public records, such as those held by the GRO.  Such a change would be a major improvement.  With the loss of the 19th century census records, census substitute records are obviously more important.  That was the main question I had.</p><p>  It was interesting to hear the staffing ratios in comparable countries.  There is a view that we have a bloated public service but those figures clearly demonstrate that we are probably underselling our cultural heritage by virtue of the fact that we are not investing in it to have sufficient staff to undertake imaginative projects and have sufficient trained personnel who would be familiar with the systems in place.  It was useful to hear that detail.  I would like to hear what the comparable position is with regard to the National Archives.  It would be useful to know the parameters in terms of what could be done.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late and not hearing the guests' presentations.  I was detained in the Seanad for a vote.  I wish to declare a potential conflict of interest.  I am the son of a member of the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland.  As director of the Abbey Theatre, I am also a member of the Council of National Cultural Institutions.  Therefore, I am a colleague of Ms Fiona Ross, director of the National Library.  The Abbey is funded indirectly and directly through the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Those are a myriad of potential conflicts of interest, but that will not stop me from making my comments or giving certain people a hard time.</p><p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Lonergan.  I wish to express major congratulations to the Department on the development of the <i>irishgenealogy.ie</i> website.  That is of tremendous benefit.  I have heard Ms Catr&iacute;ona Crowe say how important it is.  We also heard that at our previous briefings on Tuesday.  We must acknowledge the important contribution it will make, and the Minister is driving it.  I wanted to put that on the record.</p><p>  Under phase II of the policy, in terms of the macro issue, arising from what previous witnesses have said, there seems to be a creative tension between private organisations wanting and needing, quite rightly, to make money from genealogy and sustain jobs, and the issue of the availability of these records free of charge for citizens.  On Tuesday Mr. Donovan said that there should there should be no such tension in that everything should be free and available, and then people will be able to make money on that in any event.  He was very clear that there was no tension.  </p><p>  Without putting words in Mr. Lonergan's mouth, in the context of his phrase &quot;whether bodies should be able to levy a charge generated strong views,&quot; I would argue that phase 2 of the policy is not complete because, as Ms Catr&iacute;ona Crowe and previous witnesses mentioned, some particular records, including birth and death records, are not available free of charge.  The index might be available but the certificates are not available free of charge.  I would like clarification from the Department on whether that remains a stumbling block.  It would be fair to say that the more frank the members of this committee are, the better we can come up with our own understanding of this issue.</p><p>  I would like clarification from Mr. Lonergan with regard to the implementation of phase 1 of the policy whether everything is free in terms of Irish genealogy requests and particularly in the General Register Office, because in her presentation Ms Catr&iacute;ona Crowe stated - I do not want to put words in her mouth - that certificates up to 1914 should be made available free of charge.  She later made the assumption that some people have to make money on that also, which is not a problem.  The same applies to the Catholic parish records.  I would like clarification on that.</p><p>  I have a particular question for Ms Catr&iacute;ona Crowe because she did not mention the 1926 census.  That was a theme at the meeting on Tuesday.  This may sound like a leaving certificate question but I would like if she could outline, in order of importance, what she believes are the most important records that should be made available sequentially free of charge to citizens.  Where does the 1926 census come into that?  If there was an amendment to the Statistics Act changing the 100-year provision to 70 years, and people felt the 1926 census should be put online, what would be the implications of that in terms of resources?</p></speech>

Access to the full records is a matter for the General Register Office and we cannot speak on its behalf.  We will monitor how we get on with the indexes.  We will keep in touch with the General Register Office and enter into negotiations with it thereafter, but at this stage we cannot say where we are going in that regard.</p><p>  With regard to Senator Mac Conghail's question about pay-per-view facilities, the Department retains a preference for free access to online records, but we recognise, given the current economic climate, that it cannot be expected that resources to meet genealogical development will always be available from the State.  Accordingly, it may well be necessary to explore the potential for other models to secure revenue, including philanthropic support, commercial partnerships and concession contracts.  That is our position with regard to pay-per-view.</p></speech>

They are available free to access in person on Kildare Street and it is a long-held wish of ours, and part of Government policy, to make those available.  I confirm that those records in microfilm format are available free to access in person on Kildare Street and obviously it is a great wish of ours to make them available more freely.</p><p>  I welcome Deputy Catherine Murphy's comments on our staffing and storage issues.  The staffing issue has a major impact on our ability not just to do genealogy, which is a small subset of what the National Library does on a daily basis, but all of the other activities we do.  We see a great deal of scope for expanding all of our activities, with even modest additional staffing.  She spoke specifically about cataloguing.  If there are 70,000 boxes at the National Archives, I would hate to tell her how many there are at the National Library.  At the last count we reckoned there were about 10 million items in the National Library.  We have a lot of cataloguing to do.  The idea of coming up with more creative ways of solving that staffing issue through job schemes, etc., arose during the discussion on Tuesday.  We have looked to secure some support for that in the future, which is something we would love to examine.  I will ask my colleague Ms Colette O'Flaherty to deal with the storage issues in some detail.</p></speech>

That was a very valuable exercise in quantifying the existing storage needs and the future growth of our collections.  Much of our material is stored on site in Kildare Street.  We have some off-site storage and we also avail of commercial storage, but as the director said in her opening statement, very little of this storage meets international preservation standards.  We are keen to explore the opportunities that are available to ensure that does not continue to be the case in the future.  There was a major loss of material at the end of the decade we are now commemorating 100 years later, so there is a possible opportunity to redress that in this decade of commemorations, in terms of our national patrimony.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1095" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catr&iacute;ona Crowe" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121200007#F00300"><p>I will address Deputy Murphy's questions first.  I thank her for her interest in our staffing problems, which are considerable.   I echo what Ms Fiona Ross has said.  When we look at comparable institutions in countries of similar population size, such as Scotland or Denmark, we have a third and a quarter of their staffing levels, respectively.  We have always been badly under-resourced.  Things have improved slightly in recent years, which is surprising given the recession.  However, we are still way behind other comparable institutions in terms of what we need to catalogue our material.  For example, the chief secretary's office registered papers, which is the biggest single archive on 19th century Ireland anywhere in the world, is not catalogued.  We have begun the process of cataloguing it due to a bequest that we managed to secure from a philanthropic American gentleman, but the process is slow because it must be done properly.  If things are to be done correctly, it takes time.  We had two archivists working on that.  We lost one of them two years ago, we are losing the other at the end of this year and we have had to wait until now to get an interview process to fill those positions.  That is not satisfactory.</p><p>  We could certainly do with multiples of tens of staff to get working on all this, but where would we put them?  Our other big issue is space.  We are full.  We have three full repositories in Bishop Street, the Four Courts - the headquarters of the former Public Record Office - and at a quite expensive off-site storage facility to take the spillover from both of those buildings, and it does not make economic sense to spread things over three different places.  We have some grounds for hope that a decision will be taken to construct a new building on the Bishop Street site, where the warehouse is currently located, and that should solve our problems and allow us to bring everything together in one spot.  However, resources will have to be provided for that.  We will need staff to manage it.  Moving stuff around is murderously difficult and very labour-intensive.  We do not give up hope.  We know that we are struggling with very limited resources, but we still take great pride in the service we provide and we do our best.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about other responsibilities that we might have.  Our major responsibility is to make accessible the records of the Irish State.  That is what we are statutorily bound to do.  I focused on genealogy today, because that is the subject of the committee's hearings, but I could talk for hours and hours about all the other things we do in the National Archives which are equally important and sometimes more important than our genealogical services.</p><p>  We never had any exhibition space in the Bishop Street building.  We have created a number of travelling exhibitions, which are panels with digitised images of documents and other things on them.  We look with envy at the National Library's beautiful exhibition spaces, which they are so lucky to have.  They have done a wonderful job in converting the old Heraldic Museum into a spanking new exhibition space, with two terrific exhibitions this year.  We do online exhibitions.  The Deputy referred to our contextual material that accompanies the census, of which we are extremely proud, but the money ran out for that.  It costs about &euro;5,000 to provide a good dose of information about each county.  When money starts to flow again, we are hoping we can finish that off so that every county in Ireland will have a section with photographs and historical information on what is going on.  We did an exhibition this year on Ireland's entry into the European Union, which is currently travelling around the library system in Dublin, and we received a lot of praise for that.</p><p>  I will move on to Senator Mac Conghail's questions.  Our knowledge of the position regarding the 1926 census is that the Central Statistics Office is opposed to its early release.  We did a number of exercises because we thought that this was about data protection issues, as there could be people in the 1926 census who are still alive.  We worked out a way to redact those names, so that would not have been an issue.  I think it is more about the guarantee of confidentiality that was given in 1926.  There are worries about that.  There are respectable arguments on both sides of this debate, but I would ask the Department to elaborate a little more on it, since we are not the key player in the decision to release the material.  We would love to see it happen.  We think 90 years is more than sufficient for these records to remain closed, and it would be marvellous to be able to compare our last pre-Independence census with our first post-Independence census and examine the many changes which happened in that decade, to which Colette has just referred.  We do not see this as a possibility at the moment.  It is not on our radar.</p><p>  In terms of private sector versus public sector, things have changed quite significantly, as many of the private sector operators - certainly the two with whom we work, Eneclann and ancestry.com - have become very open to flexible partnerships, as committee members will have heard from Mr. Brian Donovan, with whom we work all the time on many things.  The basis of our strategy is that we are in partnership with them and the LDS to try to do time-limited exploitation.  That goes along with a bunch of what we call the crown jewels, which are the really special things, such as the Tithe Applotment books, that all go up for free.  To give Eneclann its due, it has now expanded the number of record series that it will allow us to put up for free without any intervening period of commercial exploitation.  We have done some very interesting work with ancestry.com and we hope to continue that.  We are open to partnership with anybody as long as it does not cost us any money.  That is basically the issue.  If we can enter into fruitful partnerships with any organisation, whether commercial or voluntary, we are very happy to do that.  I see that as being the future for practically everyone.</p><p>  The Senator asked a very important question about the sequence of important records that should be made available.  The Catholic parish records are gigantically important due to the tragic loss of records in 1922, including in particular the 1821, 1831, 1841 and 1851 censuses, which was a dreadful loss.  The Catholic parish registers are then centre stage as our major demographic record with names of people for the 19th century.  They are the only thing that comes close to replacing the loss in 1922.  I have made no secret of my desire to see these records available free of charge online, properly indexed and linked to an image.  That is the gold standard for genealogical websites.  We should be able to see an image to verify the transcription or the index that has led us to it.  Without that, I do not think we can be happy.</p><p>  The second thing is the GRO, and the Department has already informed the Senator what the situation is.  I stated in my submission that it would be marvellous if the certificates up to 1914 could be made available.  It would be fascinating if officials from the GRO could let us know exactly what is its revenue stream is for its genealogical records, as opposed to the current business of supplying birth certificates to people for passports and so on.  It has a thriving revenue stream.  It would be good to know what exactly it is earning from the genealogy side, and if there was a way of replacing that in some way so that the records could be made available for free.  If we had those two sets of records, along with what we have and will have, we would be in a very healthy position in respect of the rights of citizens and the diaspora to free access to our cultural heritage.</p></speech>

That is our asset - that there is such a diverse interest.  That was quite evident here on the last occasion.  We could find much common ground in the discussions.</p><p>  I agree with Senator Mac Conghail on the need to tease out any issues of tension which may exist in regard to the fee-or-no-fee issue.  That important matter was raised at Tuesday's hearings.  Mr. Michael Merrigan posed an interesting question: does it have to be either/or?  That might be a starting point for discussion, not necessarily today but in the future.  I welcome the clarification from Mr. Kevin Lonergan on that particular issue because it possibly is a move forward from where we were in the past.  I would even like to think it was not only the recession that brought about that change.  That in itself is important when there is a lack of funding.  It is also important to look at how we go forward.  If we want funding to develop particular amenities and if the funding is not there in the future, we must find ways of finding it.  That is something we should be able to tease out and discuss as well.</p><p>  I understand the concept of the hearings - perhaps it is Deputy Catherine Murphy who was responsible for them to some extent, and I congratulate her on that - is to get as many views as possible from the stakeholders, which is really a clinical word, or those who are interested, and then decide whether the committee can make a contribution to a national plan involving all the players in that way.  That is, perhaps, one of the questions I would pose today.  Can they see a process developing in which that may happen?  It is unnecessary, for instance, to have duplication, particularly if there is a cost involved in it.  We all must agree that the assets belong to the whole nation and, if they do, it should be possible to sit down and discuss it.</p><p>  I compliment the Department and the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, on the seminar that was held, which I believe was helpful.  It may not have reached a conclusion but, generally, such consultative processes do not reach a conclusion immediately.  At least we became more aware of exactly what strengths and, perhaps, weaknesses exist.  However, we also began to see considerable common ground.  I certainly did.  I saw it again on Tuesday here.  The Department should get the credit for taking that initiative.</p><p>  I would like to hear their views as to how that might go forward in the future.  Whatever - I use the term advisedly - "vested interests" are involved right across the board, there should be one common interest of doing what is best for our heritage, people and history.  That does not mean I believe one must lose autonomy.  I do not believe it should always be necessary to create a federal approach rather than a single unilateral approach.  That is something the committee might consider.</p><p>  I would like to hear views on how we might pool resources without necessarily diluting the identity of each of the players.  I put the same question yesterday.  I have seen other areas - for instance, in sport nationally - where that has been achieved.  I give only one example, and there are many more.</p><p>  There are a couple of milestones, and the one achieved by the Department was important.  Today is another milestone.  It would be a pity if we lost the opportunity and the potential that come out of this, and the word "compromise" need not even be part of it.  Perhaps Ms Crowe's point about partnership is a good one.  We must start in recognising each of the groups and the role they play, and then if we have to tease out the free or pay-per-view issue, that can be done as well.  There must be a formula and a forum for doing this, and I believe this is the first part of that forum.</p><p>  I would like to hear views coming back.  Do they see an opportunity?  The Department has already made the point and I understand it will work with anybody involved.  Ms Crowe has spoke about partnership and there seems to be something developing there that could be looked at more closely.  I do not even know the process for this committee in bringing that forward.  If that were to happen, we would be achieving something important in terms of what we are discussing here today.  I would like to hear views from each of the witnesses today.  Do they see opportunities not only for consultation but for meaningful engagement on the way forward?</p></speech>

There has been an ongoing process for many years in this area.  In Tuesday's session there were references to the Teehan report of 1998.  It gives those of us on this side of the table a heavy heart to think that we may have to begin a long process again.  I have met the family history foundation, the association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland, APGI, and all the other participants at the National Library.  Indeed, we have met our colleagues from the archives and the Department on many occasions.  We also had the session to which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred, approximately 18 months or two years ago, chaired by former Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon.  In many respects, the issues, challenges and items for discussions are well known and well socialised, and it is time for action and change.  I would like to make that point strongly.</p><p>  With regard to funding, one of the issues for us at the National Library is that we look at some of the relationships that the archives have developed with some of the commercial partners.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Flynn" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121200009#H00200"><p>Let me address a few of the issues that have arisen in my area specifically.  I am the desk officer for both the National Archives and the National Library of Ireland.  I take the criticism on staff numbers in both organisations and I must put up my hand and say it is a factor of the funding that is available to the Department overall.  There is a moratorium in place and we just have to soldier on with the numbers of staff permitted.  Despite the reduced number of staff, the staff in both the National Archives and the National Library of Ireland are doing tremendous work and they are still providing a good service to the public.</p><p>  A question was asked about the 1926 census.  The Minister has set up a working group comprising officials from the Department, the Central Statistics Office and the National Archives to examine the issues surrounding the census and the question of how the project can be advanced.  A number of issues arise, the first of which is the legal issue to which members have referred.  The Statistics Act has a 100-year rule and the CSO is not about to recommend a change in that regard.  Another issue concerns where the project might physically be carried out.  The 1926 census returns are not in the same condition as the returns for 1901 and 1911, on which Ms Crowe and I worked.  They are just the paper returns.  The 1901 and the 1911 results were put on microfilm and were much easier to digitise for that reason.  We have a spatial requirement.  The project must happen at the premises in Bishop Street because it is secure.  We would need staff to carry out the project, but not any old staff.  They would have to be relatively technically adept.  The working group is currently examining all these issues and will be making a recommendation to the Minister in the coming weeks.  Until this process is concluded, I will not be in a position to shed much more light on the issue.</p><p>  On the question of maximising the return from genealogical records, there is tremendous potential.  When we finished working on the 1901 and 1911 censuses and the material was put online, we certainly did not regard that as the end of the project, because the end involved finding a way to maximise interest abroad in the website and to use that website to get people to land here.  We have had discussions with Tourism Ireland and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport over recent years.  There are ideas on how the project could be carried out on the website.  We have a number of website links already and they will generate traffic in other directions.  We hope that can be developed to a more productive level.</p><p>  Digitisation is the other big problem we have in both institutions, apart from staffing.  We have no issue with commercial partnership if it works.  In Denmark, the authorities went to the market and got Google or another multinational company to agree to digitise many of the holdings in the Royal Danish Library.  The condition was that the contractor digitising the material got rights for either five or seven years.  Even with that condition attached, anyone seeking to see the material with a Danish IP address got the material free of charge.  The archive officials were able to maximise income from the Danish diaspora in the United States and elsewhere.  That is possibly one model that could be examined.  It would still give the Irish citizen the material online free of charge.  We are very keen to be involved in partnerships with the admittedly reduced resources at our disposal.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy mentioned storage.  In the past, many potential schemes were proposed for the National Archives building in Bishop Street.  We are now considering one we believe we can sell at ministerial and other levels.  We have recently had a cost-benefit analysis completed on it, and we hope that a new logical scheme to maximise the use of the space in the very large building in Bishop Street might proceed.  We will know in a few months.  There is so much wonderful material in the archives that an exhibition space must be a <i>sine qua non</i> and a priority.</p></speech>

I am not actually sure whether what are called the books of survey and distribution on the site have been digitised yet, but if not, it will certainly be done.  We have a set of those in our possession at the National Archives and are very happy to share them.  They provide the names of landholders in Ireland before 1641 and also in the 1680s.  They comprise the record of the massive transformations in land ownership that took place in the 17th century, the key century for changes in land ownership, particularly from the old Gaelic order to the new ascendency.  There are names in those records that one will not find anywhere else.  They are incredibly valuable genealogically and in terms of social and economic history.  This is an example of how we are quite happy to share our material with any project that creates a website that is free to access.  It gets the job done and the material is made available.  A link is created between our website and that of the project.  We must be as flexible as possible about this and ensure that anybody with a good idea is entertained.  For example, we are now entering the year that will commemorate the outbreak of the First World War.  There are plans for the State to hold various events, which I hope will be very innovative and interesting, to mark that anniversary.  The big event will be the Imperial War Museum&rsquo;s fabulous website called Lives of the First World War.  We have been engaged with the war museums for the past two years.  I am on the steering committee for that project.  We have given the museum authorities the entire database for the entire 1911 census, so people will be able to use it as one of the elements relating to the 250,000 combatants from Ireland, 30,000 of whom died.  We are very happy to engage in partnerships with anybody who will use the material in an innovative way as long as it is free to access, as this project will be.</p><p>  The first phase of a fantastic project that relates to both the decade of centenaries and genealogy - namely, the project on the military service pension files - will be launched very shortly.</p></speech>

I come to this more as a citizen member than as a genealogical expert.  My experience is that <i>irishgeneology.ie</i>, as well as the National Archives and National Library sites have always been excellent.  I have seen the impact of the reduction in staff, however, which affects waiting times for overseas visitors.  The staff are trying to do their best but we need to examine the impact such cuts are having.  We must also examine the fact that not everything can be stored at Bishop Street.  I have seen the frustration of people who have travelled a huge distance, yet need to return tomorrow which is sometimes impossible for them to do.  Alternatively, they may get a file tomorrow but find that they need something else and have to return on another day.  We are still in a climate of cuts, so are there any plans to limit hours?  Are there any further cuts we need to be aware of in preparing our report here?</p><p>  The CSO's 1926 census was mentioned and I hope we will be asking the CSO representatives in here.   There was a commitment in the programme for Government to release the 1926 census.  I do not accept the arguments for not doing so, because when people filed out that census there was no stay on releasing it for 100 years.  There are many good reasons for releasing the 1926 census, as Ms Crowe has outlined.</p></speech>

From my work on family history, I got very excited about digitising the Catholic parish records.  I have used the <i>rootsireland.ie</i> site but a link to images was mentioned.  We need that extra information but I am not always absolutely sure that it is the person I am looking for, since the information on that site is quite sparse at times.</p><p>  Are the National Archives and the National Library allowed to generate revenue?  We have been talking about free-to-access and bringing in companies but is there another way?  I imagine there is a big appetite for people to pay a nominal fee.  Why can we not have a model we could enter into with a company, such as Eneclann or Ancestry?  Many companies could be tendered to work with the National Archives or the National Library.  Are they allowed to generate revenue to support other areas?  </p><p>  What should our report seek concerning the church registers?  Having listened to the witnesses, they have gone around in circles, so we do not want to signpost them further around that circle again.  I would welcome it if the witnesses could tell us what needs to happen.</p></speech>

I wanted to put that on the record.</p><p>  It is obviously a great improvement that there is one central location for the website, but is that advertised?  People who do not know that is the official portal may not find it obvious to visit that site.  Are there any proposals to separate that out or advertise it?</p><p>  The project must be seen as an investment in terms of bringing in tourism.  We did not select the title from a purely economic viewpoint.  The value, however, has a number of different meanings.  The reduced VAT rate that will generate tourism is comparable in that we can see it is an investment that will bring a return.  At the same time the investment could be made in an entirely different way that would generate exactly the same thing but which may have a longer-term return on it.  Perhaps the witnesses could say something about that. </p><p>  I know the Catholic records are in the National Library but I found them difficult to go through.  One must get used to the different patterns of writing and some of them are in Latin.  Some of them were also kept in bad conditions, as one can see from the microfilms.  What are the challenges in digitising those records?  Is it about ownership or translating from that format to another?</p><p>  As regards philanthropy, is there much capacity or is the prospect being over-hyped?  The witnesses might tell us what part philanthropy plays in this regard. </p><p>  As regards costs, I may have got it wrong about the Valuation Office's records.  Will they go to the National Archives?  One must pay to consult council books and maps there and one also pays with the GRO.  I have never had a problem with paying because I did not want to consult 25 different Paddy O'Briens, but it can be expensive when one goes about it that way.  It is incredibly useful to be able to search for material online.</p><p>  When one considers the cost of travelling, a modest charge is not objectionable.  A point was made about the IP address.  A different way of approaching it would be for people to turn up in person to view material in the National Archives or the National Library.  I would be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say about that.  We are all interested in this topic, not just personally but in how we can see a timely progression.  The witnesses have been at it a lot longer than most of us. </p></speech>

The good news on the Catholic parish registers at the National Library is that we have made a digital copy of them, which we did for preservation and conservation reasons at a minimum so that there is a backup copy to the microfilm.  Microfilm is a 20th-century access format.  The format that should be used in the 21st century is digitised online content.</p><p>  To answer both questions at the same time, the digital images of Catholic parish registers are not indexed.  We have the images in a digital format but they need to be indexed and then put into a database.  In simple terms, what would make that happen is if a few members of staff - which I do not have - or an allocated number of staff could prioritise this project within the National Library.</p></speech>

However, there are many other issues about these registers, not least their safety.  The National Library collection is on microfilm made many years ago from the original volumes.  We do not know the conditions or state of these original volumes.  It must be borne in mind the Roman Catholic Church is a private organisation.  This issue will have to be resolved at a very high level in terms of the regular church-State talks that take place.  We urgently need to have a survey of Catholic parish registers across the country and their condition.  Do they need to be preserved differently?  I know in some dioceses they are well preserved but by no means in all.  Some of them could be in outhouses and sheds.</p><p>  Ms Ross and I visited the Episcopal Conference in Maynooth where we found ourselves with five bishops and a cardinal.  It was an interesting afternoon where we challenged them as to their responsibility for this major irreplaceable piece of our cultural heritage, pointing out it is a public good.  They were very receptive with one exception.  However, nothing has happened since.  I know the wheels of God grind slow but a year and a half is a long time to wait for some kind of a response on this.</p><p>  The Roman Catholic Church also has rights, as it sees it, when it comes to the microfilms in the National Library.  It may be that it would not be amenable to the desire to have them digitised and put online, either for money or no money.  In fact, the idea we might charge for them might be the red rag to the bull that might drive the whole project off the rails.  There has been no agreement from the church, as yet, that this can happen.</p><p>  There needs to be a commitment made by the church to the State as to what is to happen with the Catholic parish registers.  They are far too important to be left in private hands, whether it is the Irish Family History Foundation or the dioceses, unless they can give a guarantee that they will be preserved.  It must be remembered that the diocesan records the National Library has only go up to 1900.  What about the later 20th century cohort of records?  There are many complex problems with this matter which need to be resolved at a high level.</p><p>  I mentioned the public good.  I have no problem whatever with State agencies generating revenue.  There is no guarantee that any revenue generated by the National Library or the National Archives can be kept by them.  Instead, revenue might be swallowed up by the Central Fund and not be ring-fenced for projects in the National Archives.  Some years ago, in partnership with the Royal Irish Academy, the National Archives published a study on the 1911 census which has made tidy profits for us but we have been told we cannot keep them.  What is that all about?</p><p>  I believe our national cultural heritage is a public good and should be treated in that way.  I am delighted we do not charge for entry into our libraries and museums.  We do not want to get to the point that everything is subject to the philosophy of making money, that everything has to be revenue-generating.  If we had charged for the census online, we would not even have had a tenth of the users we have had and people would have thought it was mean-minded.  The goodwill we got from our citizens and the diaspora for making it available free has been priceless.</p></speech>

People come to Farmleigh regularly but we do not end up with them queuing up to give us vast pots money to spend on our cultural heritage.  It would be lovely if we did but it is not happening.  We were fortunate to get the bequest we did to deal with the registered papers of the Chief Secretary's Office.  A professor of French in California, who had never come to Ireland but had Irish relatives, left a good sum of money for heritage projects which we bid for and got.  However, that money is going to run out and we will have to mainstream this project because it is one of the most important collections we have.  The National Archives can apply to the Wellcome Trust for funding to catalogue, preserve and index our medical records.  Last year, for example, we took in the records of Grangegorman, a significant body of extraordinary material going back to the 1840s.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout referred to the problem where someone travels to the National Archives to look at some material only to discover it is in the Four Courts and they must wait a day for it to be retrieved from there.  There is nothing we can do about that until we can gather all our collections together under the one roof.  The economic common sense and customer service aspects of uniting our collections are obvious.</p></speech>

I am the finance director for Ancestry International and the rest of the delegation from <i>Ancestry.com</i> consists of Mr. Brad Argent, director for international content; Mr. Eric Booth, senior international marketing manager; and Ms Rhona Murray who is also from the international content side.</p><p>  As most members will be aware, <i>Ancestry.com</i> has been the global leader in the family history sector for over 20 years and brought an extensive and unique collection of over 12 billion historical records online and acquired over 2.7 million subscribers globally.  We have recently established our international headquarters in Dublin on Sir John Rogerson's Quay.  This represents an exciting new investment by the company in its international division and highlights its focus on long-term growth.  We have 75 employees in Dublin focused on functions which include accounting, financial planning and analysis, analytics, marketing, product development and member services and hope to grow this number further in the years ahead. </p><p>  I will turn to the opportunity for economic growth through Irish genealogy.  With The Gathering initiative concluding, we believe there is a unique opportunity to leverage its success by enabling the international family history community to reconnect with Ireland and utilise the genealogy sector as a stimulus for economic growth.  There is an Irish Diaspora of an estimated 80 million worldwide and we believe there are further opportunities to use the genealogical sector as the focal point for encouraging greater footfall towards Ireland.  As we have outlined in our written submission, to enable Ireland to leverage this fully, we need to focus on improving access to records online, as well as extending their reach both domestically and globally in order to ensure Ireland maximises the full potential of our genealogical heritage.  It is well known that a large number of Irish people emigrated to the United States.  <i>Ancestry.com</i> has a significant North American market that it can easily leverage to promote Irish genealogical heritage.  Providing for greater accessibility to these records both domestically and internationally will also drive employment opportunities both in public archives and repositories, as well as within commercial entities, to cater for the increased demand.  Collaborative content projects also enable us to overcome funding issues and generate a revenue stream which can help to alleviate potential resourcing demands on the State.  </p><p>  To be clear, <i>Ancestry.com</i> can help.  We concur with the recommendations presented earlier on Tuesday around the facilities of the General Register Office and revisiting the 100 year rule.  We also believe that to enable us as a sector to realise the benefits genealogy can provide and create the economic stimulus, a collaborative approach between all of the relevant parties is key to ensure we are developing a focused plan that can deliver in the short, medium and long term.  Experience tells us it would work.  We have seen at first-hand through our involvement in local projects such as the full digitisation of the Morpeth testimonial roll how improved access can act as a catalyst for international users to visit Ireland.  Recent press on President Ronald Reagan's great-great grandfather's signature on the pre-Famine roll is an obvious example.  Another perfect example is the growth of <i>Ancestry.com </i>in DNA testing for genealogical purposes.  Recent advances are providing an international audience with an ability to gain a more granular insight into their ethnicity, of which Ireland is a key region.  Coupled with increased access to vital records, this initial and often surprising first connection with the country of Ireland within one's ethnicity can provide more contextual reasons to create a meaningful connection with Ireland and, therefore, a reason to visit. </p><p>  While there are challenges to overcome, the genealogy sector provides the perfect platform to build on the success of The Gathering initiative and ensure a sustained stimulus for economic growth through tourism and grassroots genealogy.  We have a great opportunity to make a significant contribution to economic recovery in Ireland.  However, to enable us to do this, a collaborative approach with all of the relevant bodies will be key to ensuring we overcome the challenges we face on the accessibility of records and how we reach the right audiences.  As a business, <i>Ancestry.com</i> has the expertise and resources required to make a significant contribution to the development of this plan and it is something we look forward to being involved in.</p></speech>

The joint venture partner is DC Thomson, the 108 year old publishing firm from Dundee in Scotland which is well known to members as the creator of the &quot;Dandy&quot; and &quot;Beano&quot; comics.  Members may not know that it also owns several family history websites with over 26 million registered users worldwide, including <i>findmypast</i>, <i>Genes Reunited</i>, <i>British Newspaper Archive</i> and <i>ScotlandsPeople</i>.  It recognised the importance of local expertise in developing an Irish web service and record collection and established this joint venture with the best in the business in Ireland, Eneclann.  Eneclann is a campus company at Trinity College Dublin which was founded in 1998 and offers high profile genealogical research services and a variety of heritage and digitisation services.  It is well known for its partnership with many Irish cultural institutions.  Representatives of the two partners are here with me.</p><p>  We launched <i>findmypast</i> Ireland two years ago and in that short time have created the largest online collection of Irish records, with over 70 million published to date, including wills, newspapers, prison records, land records, etc.  We expect to double this number in a shorter duration.  There is much I can tell the committee about our joint venture company and the DC Thomson family history business in general, but I will refer it to our submission and focus on some key issues in the limited time I have available.</p><p>  Our success has been built on partnerships, specifically on developing partnership models which exceed expectations.  What does this mean in practice and what defines a successful partnership?  Our submission gives a number of concrete examples in the appendices and members will notice that the nature of the relationships we have with partners varies enormously, depending on their priorities.  For example, one of our biggest challenges was when we won the contract to release the 1911 census in England and Wales on a commercial basis with a royalty to the National Archives.  Rather like the 1926 census here, these records were still stored in their original collection boxes, with no archival finding aids.  Within 18 months we had arranged the collection, taken 16 million digital images, transcribed 36 million entries and published them online.  A total of 3.4 million people successfully searched the site within the first 24 hours, which is a testament to the stability of our technology and marketing.  By contrast, in the United States when we were faced with the enormous challenge of releasing the 1940 census, we worked with a consortium of organisations, including the government archives, National Archives and Records Administration, non-commercial bodies such as FamilySearch and other commercial copies such as <i>Archives.com</i>.  Together we created a part cloud-sourced solution which indexed the 136 million records and published them online for free within six months of release of the images.  In Ireland we have developed a vibrant relationship with the National Archives of Ireland which is committed to free access.  We are digitising and indexing the principal genealogical records for release online for free from the moment they are published.  We are also publishing another 100 million records initially commercially but which will be made available free after five years.  To date, we have digitised 40 million records and published 20 million, with five million being made available for free early in 2014.  There are many examples in our submission of other relationship types which mix elements of free and commercial access.</p><p>  Ireland has been successful at fostering entrepreneurship and encouraging significant international companies to base themselves in Dublin.  With some good decisions, we could turn Dublin into a global hub for family history in Europe, fostering ancestral tourism, technological innovation, employment and tax revenues, as demonstrated in Salt Lake City in the United States.  Having encouraged companies such as ours and <i>Ancestry.com</i> to base themselves here, it raises the question of what Ireland is going to do with us.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Ms Ann Robinson, chairman, North of Ireland Family History Society, Mr. Con Cochrane, chairman of the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, CIGO, Mr. Richard Flatman, treasurer Irish Family History Society and my colleague, Ms Rosaleen Underwood, who, like myself, is a professional genealogist.  CIGO was founded in 1991 intially under the name GRO Users Group but shortly after it adopted its current name.  Its original name reflected that it was established in response to the then Government's surprise announcement that the GRO would be decentralised to Roscommon town.  In the 20 years since, CIGO has been hard at work on behalf of Irish genealogists.  We are a lobby group for the various national and international organisations that share an interest in Irish genealogical research.  We lobby for better and greater access to source material and through our work we give a voice to those involved in genealogical research across the island and beyond.  Nationally and internationally, we represent more than 50,000 genealogists.</p><p>  Part of our remit is to keep genealogists and family historians at home and abroad abreast of the latest news and events in Irish genealogy.  We carefully monitor the genealogical issues of the day and comment on proposed policy and legislation.  From its early years, CIGO quickly began to take its place in lobbying right across the island on behalf of those involved in genealogy for which it has earned an enviable reputation.  Its views are regularly sought by institutions, politicians, archivists and the press.  Its stature is such that it can easily gain access to decision makers and policy setters using its influence to make views known, urge caution and initiate change.</p><p>  Issues on which CIGO's lobbying has been successful include achieving amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004 to provide for death registrations in Ireland to include the deceased's date and place of birth and parents names.  This had not been done until then.  We achieved the same in regard to death registrations in Northern Ireland under new regulations introduced in December 2012.  There were brought in on foot of our intervention on new registration legislation n Northern Ireland.  We obtained confirmation from the CSO that next of kin to deceased persons were in principle entitled to data from the 1926 census about their deceased relatives under section 33 of the Statistics Act 1993.  We also secured inclusion in the programme for Government of early release of the 1926 census and obtained a decision from the UK Information Commissioner that the public had the right to obtain data relating to deceased persons recorded in the UK's wartime national register compiled in September 1939, which included Northern Ireland.</p><p>  Of the various important issues currently affecting genealogy in Ireland, we consider the two most important areas to be the upgrading the GRO and its web presence and establishing public access to the 1926 census returns.  Other issues include adequate funding for the National Archives to upgrade-rebuild its current facility and to deal with the conservation, cataloguing and digitisation of its records, assistance for the National Library to upload digitised copies of its Roman Catholic parish registers to the Internet, and legislation to finally allow proper public access to the records of the Land Commission, many of which date from the 17th and 18th centuries.</p></speech>

Our DNA product is basically where family history marries technology and DNA.  It is an ethnicity test and one can figure out the value of one ethnicity.  We launched this product in the United States in 2012 and it is providing some very interesting findings.  My boss in the United States, who has been with <i>Ancestry.com</i> for ten years and has spent a lot of time on family history always believed he was Welsh.  However, when he undertook his ethnicity test he found out that he has Irish ethnicity.  It prompted him to go back further in tracing his family history to find out where his Irishness comes into it.  It is a very simple test that prompts them to do a search to find out where they come from.</p><p>  We also have 50 million family trees online on <i>Ancestry.com</i> so that is a major database.  Once the DNA database grows and once we have DNA matches we are also able to introduce cousin matches through the DNA.  The test will match DNA cousins so I have had some e-mails from fourth cousins in the US that I did not know I had.  It is a new product and let me repeat that it is where technology marries family history.  Its reach is such that even people who have no access to family history records will be able to find their ethnicity.  We are very excited about that.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about partnership arrangements and charges for research.  The number of searches within family history is significant.  In our submission we state that more than 40 million searches are done on our website daily.  We have 50 million family trees on line and some 600 million records are available for free online.  Many people will find free databases when they search.  When people join <i>Ancestry.com</i> for the first time they also have a two week free trial period in which they can search for the particular records they are looking for.  I will ask my colleague Mr. Brad Argent to go into more detail on the content.</p></speech>

One of the great things about free material is that it gives people an experience of what it is like to see a record.  It it that scopic experience of seeing history come alive.  It is wonderful to have that outside the paid wall because it can help them get over the paid wall and understand the journey they are going on.  Over time what happens with particular types of material, not all of it, is that it becomes commodified.  Once it is out there behind a number of paid walls after a period of time one can bring that out and make it free because one is always filling the pipeline at the back-end with more material.  In broad terms that is how one can make that kind of commercial arrangement.  There needs to be a very strong balance between what is behind the paid wall and what is free.  I feel very strongly that one needs to be able to provide access to the material for those who are not only economically disadvantaged but technically disadvantaged, so that people can walk into a local library, without the need to have any money and sit down and have the same kind of experience that you or I might choose to pay for and do in the comfort of our own homes.  There needs to be a balance and an addressing of that dichotomy  in the family history community.</p></speech>

Mr. John Slyne and Mr. Brad Argent explained the business model very well.  Another dimension which I addressed in my short introduction is through new platforms and new ways of accessing data, in particular through mobile telephones.  There are different ways of charging for a dataset that has been around for quite a long time and has been commodified, as Mr. Argent said, by sandwiching that product into a set of content one can produce a new product, wrapping it in nice ribbon and get people to pay for it on their Iphone.</p><p>  The exciting part of this business is the combination of DNA user generated contents by people filling in their own records and sharing information - not necessarily their birth records - such as photographs and stories and the professional data we have as well as newspaper content.  We are actively digitising information at present.  One creates a story and part of the stories people create themselves.  Obviously we are not charging for them.  They are so deeply involved in the story that they want to buy a particular element that enriches their story.</p></speech>

DC Thomson is very pleased to be in a very strong partnership with  Eneclann and our commitment to what we think can be done with Irish family history and Irish family records is clear by the strength of the team we have brought to this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Steven Smyrl" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121200017#S00200"><p>The Deputy mentioned the GRO.  It might be worth looking at the GRO in Northern Ireland.  I mentioned it in my address.  In recent times, the GRO in Northern Ireland, by comparison to the General Register Office here in Dublin, decided that it was going to scan its records and create digitised records of them.  I do not know whether it looked at doing this in partnership or whether it decided against that.  However, we had been promised at an early stage - the early 1990s - a computerised index and as matters moved along, as technology rolled out, we were promised by the GRO in Dublin that the records would be digitised, they would be made available, there would be computers to be used for the public.  None of this has happened, so much so that the old room at the Irish Life Centre in Lower Abbey Street was fitted out with purpose-built desks to house computer terminals and we still had to use these tattered old indexes.  The staff there went out of their way to ensure that the indexes were rebound in more recent times because 20 years ago they had been rebound and the binding was falling apart and splitting.  When it split open we discovered that it was made out of recycled Kellogg's flake boxes, which were squashed together, and they were falling to bits.  In more recent times, more hard-wearing covers have been put on them.</p><p>  However, the issue is that the General Register Office of Northern Ireland decided it was going to digitise its records.  I and another colleague, who is not here today, Mr. Rob Davison, also part of the CIGO, appeared before a committee in regard to the Civil Registration Bill for Northern Ireland three to four years ago.  Let us say that some of their political parties are more diametrically opposed to each other, yet were able to make decisions and make matters work.  They worked with the GRO to help it create the legislation that it needed and this allowed it to digitise its records, to link them to index centres and to make them available in a public search room for the public to search through.  There is now more legislation in place so that it can put scanned images of the historic records online.  That was to be launched this year but it may be next year.  In a short time, the General Register Office of Northern Ireland, GRONI, was able to do this.  We, in the CIGO, representing all kinds of users, from quite a small number of professional genealogists to a much larger number of amateurs - I do not like the work "amateur" but I am talking about people who do this for their own interest - find it most frustrating that, once again, we feel left behind by the issues.  Surely something must be done.  Even in the times we are in, there has to be funding for this.  There is the additional matter of the amount of revenue that could be raised from this by allowing access from a distance to these records.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121200017#S00300"><p>My apologies, I had to leave.  There was a vote in the Seanad.</p><p>  I read the submissions with great interest.  I am an amateur.  I have no difficulty in calling myself an amateur when it comes to genealogy.  I am also a subscriber to <i>findmypast.ie</i> and <i>Ancestry.com</i>.  I can testify to what they are talking about, for example, roots tourism.  If I look at the access of records, for example, in the United States of America, that led me last year to going to a small town called Watertown, Wisconsin, which, when I was in New York and Chicago, people asked why I was doing this.  It was purely an interest in ancestry that drove me to this small town because three generations of females from my family ended up in Watertown, Wisconsin.  I am a testament to the fact that there is a generation of roots tourism.</p><p>  On their presentations and first that of the CIGA, I wholeheartedly support everything its representatives stated in it.  I agree with them about the GRO, especially from the outside where it is now.  I have been there twice and on both occasions, I have at least had two or three persons on the street asking where it is located.  I know how to find it.  On the outside the building does not look like its image on the Internst but In fairness, I do not have complaints about the inside of it.</p><p>  I agree with them on the 1926 Census.  As a committee, we will look at this issue further, particularly in regard to the position being taken by the CSO on it.</p><p>  On <i>Ancestry.com</i>, <i>findmypast.ie</i> and the submissions they made, these all are good.  I agree with them about collaborative approaches and working together but I am trying to think of when this committee is writing its report and getting down to some of the hard facts of what we need to recommend.  We can say we need a collaborative approach and we need greater partnerships and strategic alliances.  Will that make a difference to anybody?  Will that change anything for anybody?  Perhaps there was a way that they could be forthcoming for us on some of their frustrations, obstacles or wish-lists that they see, perhaps, from other countries, that drive people to their sites.  Both of their sites at times will offer free access to certain records, for instance, around St. Patrick's Day.  Around certain events, they have Irish records to drive people to the sites.  I wonder are there recommendations that they would like to see in the report to get an idea of where are the real issues for us as a committee to examine and ask what are the real obstacles to working together.  We heard presentations earlier from the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland.  They have priorities, such as digitising the church records, which, for me, as an amateur, I would welcome.  If they have already spoken about it while I was out of the room, I can read the transcripts.  I thank them.</p></speech>

I think both sides would probably agree that the more records we have digitised with the best technology, the more interesting it will be for our customers, and, obviously, combining it with DNA.  I am not the specialist on the Irish market.  Mr. Brian Donovan is and I will hand over to him shortly.</p><p>  We have had lots of experience in other countries, in particular, in the United States and the United Kingdom, where we have worked with government institutions to digitise sets of records that we believe we have been able - with our knowledge and experience - to digitise much faster and in a more efficient way than they would have been able to do on their own.   Digitised records are a foundation for this industry.  They are a foundation for the consumer, like Senator van Turnhout.  Without these records digitised, one will be able to find probably what one is looking for but it will take much longer and much more dedication.</p><p>  We also talked about broadening the market.  We are only looking at the tip of the iceberg of people who are engaged with this information on a regular basis.  It is our duty to ensure that an increasing number people will have access to this data.  We also believe there is an increasing appetite for this data.  In the current age many people are looking for where they come from.</p><p>  Can Mr. Donovan speak about Irish data?</p></speech>

There are a number of them, mostly around the access to the records and the ability to digitise those records.  We have talked about some of the legal obstacles in regard to the 1926 census but it goes well beyond that.  We have legal obstacles because of the Data Protection Acts to a vast quantity of record materials.  Reducing the data protection regulations, let alone the Act, to 70 years, which one could do in most cases, would release tens of millions of records up to 1943 and would have a phenomenal impact on research.</p><p>  There are some extraordinary legal obstacles which have been mentioned by a CIGO submission about the Land Commission.  The records there are an enormous collection.  We also have a real lack of knowledge within archives about what they can do with them.  With the Eneclann submission, we cited the Registry of Deeds lack of understanding of what it could do with them.  We cited the Valuation Office, among others.</p><p>  However, the biggest problem that we have is that we can bring proposals to a public organisation and it can do nothing with them because it does not even have the staff to look at a proposal and assess whether it is worth doing.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Thompson would like to say something about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Thompson" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121200018#T00300"><p>It works quite well in Scotland.  We have had a partnership with the Scottish Government for over ten years for the Scotland's People website, which has 1.3 million registered users.  There is a revenue share model where the Scottish Government gets some revenue and we get some revenue.  We are incurring the cost of setting up and running the site.  On Princess Street in Edinburgh, there is a Scotland's People centre, which has 30 full-time employees.  It is cost neutral because it is funded out of what is done on the website.  That is a way of opening up genealogy to people who can come in and look at records.  There is a small charge involved, but there are also opportunities to view things for free as well.  Looking at what works elsewhere, we are not here to advocate a particular partnership model, but there are partnership models out there that work.  These are the way forward in terms of getting digitisation access and then global accessibility - something that is very important for the diaspora - and getting that online as quickly and as effectively as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Steven Smyrl" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121200018#T00400"><p>Senator van Turnhout mentioned the 1926 census.  This is a particular bugbear.  We fought long and hard during the debate on the Statistics Bill 2013 that the census should be allowed to be open less than 100 years later.  If I am filling in a form these days there is a lot of information requested, so perhaps I might wonder if I want this to be opened in my lifetime.  However, the information recorded in 1926 is virtually no different from that in 1911.  It is all available in one form or another in civil records, so therefore all it does is to helpfully put it into a family group situation.  Unfortunately, the Central Statistics Office was absolutely not in favour of the idea of the Bill having a 70 year cut-off, and it was raised back to 100 years at later Stages of the Bill.  The Bill was enacted and that was set in stone, but that did not stop us trying to push all the time.  The more years that have gone by since 1926, the easier it has been to suggest to people that maybe this information could be placed in the public domain because it is so much further back in the public psyche.</p><p>  It will require legislative change to enable the census to be opened.  Our colleagues in the Genealogical Society of Ireland put forward a Bill to try to open the census but it was not successful.  What antagonised the CIGO is the fact that much effort was made to get the opening of the 1926 census put into the programme for Government, and then the Central Statistics Office dragged its heels.  However, we established, through careful questioning under the Freedom of Information Act, that while the Statistics Act categorically denies any access to information <i>per se</i>, it nonetheless seems to allow, under a very oddly worded section, that the next of kin of an individual who has died have the right to apply for his information.  I believe the committee has a copy of the letter which shows that was accepted by the CSO, but it went on to put a number of very odd obstacles in the way of why that information cannot be given.  These include the fact that the information is stored away in boxes on pallets, and that there are no finding aids.  That may be true to a degree but if there are instances where this information is available and should be made available under the Freedom of Information Act, then the individual applying for it should have some cause to try to find it.</p><p>  Some work was done some years ago to organise the 1926 census returns so that the particular townlands or district electoral divisions could be located if necessary.   That being the case, the CSO should have allowed the National Archives and Mr. Gorry to look for the information he was seeking.  However, the CSO stated that the issue was with the National Archives, while the National Archives stated that the issue was with the CSO.  We went back and forth until the Minister for Arts, Heritage the Gaeltacht announced that he was in favour of this.  The Ombudsman, to whom several people had made complaints that they could not get access under the next of kin rule, rightly decided that this would be set to one side because the likelihood was that the census was going to be released.  That has not been released and the CIGO has made representations to the Ombudsman again to reactivate these complaints and to make a finding one way or the other that the individuals have a right to this information.</p></speech>

Our taxi driver today had dropped off somebody who had ancestors from Cavan who were looking for people.  As we entered, the security guard was also asking us questions about Irish records, so there is a huge opportunity here.  I lived in the US and almost everyone I met claimed to be Irish.</p><p>  Many of our people here in Dublin are talking to customers daily.   Many of them are asking for more and more Irish records and are wondering why we cannot get them all.  It is definitely a major opportunity for us.  We are only in Ireland two years but in our experience, everybody is looking for resources to get the material online.  We have multiple examples of how that has been done in other jurisdictions, and I will ask Mr. Argent to give examples of those.</p></speech>

This is what we do for a living.  This is what our friends at <i>findmypast.ie</i> do for a living.  Let us do that and let the libraries, archives and other institutions focus on their core competencies.  Give them the power to enter into these types of agreements.  Empower them to do something about the future.  One of the challenges that archives and libraries face around the world is simply the act of conservation and preservation of these wonderful archives.  By digitising them, they will be allowed to undertake the core aspects of their work, and I think they need to be given as much scope as possible to do that.</p><p>  They also need to be able to make decisions for themselves and their own institutions about free content versus paid content.  To put this into perspective, the National Archives in the UK gets 25% of its funding from commercial relationships.  That equates to about 80 staff.  If the organisation decided that it wanted to make all that information free, there would be 80 fewer people employed and therefore there would be a huge amount of people that would not be serviced.  While we are focusing on digitisation of records, we all know the reality is that the vast bulk of material will never make it online.  It will sit offline and that is the role of our archives and libraries, which preserve and share that with people.  We need to make sure that they are funded to do so.  The commercialisation of it, putting it behind a paywall, is one way of doing that.  The challenge for us all is how to achieve both of those objectives; making it free and making it commercial.  I do not believe they are mutually exclusive.</p></speech>

It was possible for people in Northern Ireland to get records from the census in the South about the North before they were available.  There are many of these anomalies and I am sure the reverse is the case in some of the peripheral areas to the Six Counties.  In that context, has the Ireland Fund been considered as a source of funding?  The issue is something that unites in terms of records and cultural heritage.</p><p>  There is a notion that once the records are found, then that is it.  However, the reverse is the case.</p></speech>

Unless one happens to be living or, like me, working next to the National Library of Ireland, there is a cost to going to these places physically.  That is often not taken into account in the argument of free versus paid content.  I would like to see access to certain records of cultural heritage but there is a balance that can be struck and that is what we would be trying to do.  Deputy Murphy spoke about going to places.  My experience is that it is when people absolutely know where their ancestors are from, only then do they want to go physically to the place, rather than on a wild goose chase.  That is when the tourism element comes in.  We should note that in our report.</p></speech>

I am on a team of genealogists who work in the genealogy advisory service in the National Archives.  I am dealing with the public all the time, including tourists.  They are not impressed with the GRO.  Having given a friend - like I do with everyone - detailed directions of exactly where it was last week, he still could not find it because of the lack of signs.  Having been there myself, I would be hesitantly looking down alleyways and so on between rows of trucks and buses parked on the street.  Eventually I would see a blue sign stating "HSE" at the bottom of the street.  We know what the HSE is, but the first thing someone would think of is a clinic.  Eventually I might see the GRO at the end of it.  The sign "HSE" means nothing to tourists.  Signposts are needed outside pointing in the right direction from all directions and pointing down that alley.</p><p>  I have also heard complaints about the toilet at the GRO.   There is only one toilet in a public building.  I am sure there is a separate toilet for staff but I do not know how they got away with putting only one toilet in a public building.  Admittedly, it is a very large room.  In fact, it is so large that they could have fitted several toilets in it.  At the very least, they could have had three very adequate cubicles - one for men, one for women and a reasonably large disabled toilet.  That is the minimum requirement but I do not know how they got away with what they have.</p><p>  I have also got feedback from colleagues about the lack of plugs for laptops and so on.  This is just general feedback but I think somebody ought to be aware of it.  I have no problem with the staff there.  Personally, I find the place to be very gloomy and not particularly welcome at the entrance.  It is bright, but gloomy; that is the grey.  It is Christmas time, but there is not as much as a Christmas card or bit of tinsel.  It would not break the bank, even in these times, to have a couple of Christmas decorations to cheer the place up a bit.  There are still a good few tourists around.</p></speech>

I am a big fan of cemeteries.  I spend way too much time in them.  I am just getting accustomed to the fact that I will be spending eternity there.  We have recently acquired a business called <i>findagrave.com</i>, and we are enabling people to find their own headstone and then transcribe those monumental inscriptions, preserve them, take photographs of them and share them around the world.  That kind of community sourced project is very cost effective and it makes it so much easier for us to provide access to that kind of material around the world.  That is another of these doorways into ancestral tourism.  A person sees that headstone and then wants to go to the graveyard and pay his or her respects.</p></speech>

We are aware that we are working within a timeframe regarding the Richard Haass talks.  A delegation from the committee met with him last month.  Hopefully, this session today will be helpful to his deliberations.</p><p>  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only cognisant evidence on the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses nor an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Ms Sandra Peake to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

It was created in response to ongoing deaths in north Belfast.  From a nucleus of eight women, all of whom had lost partners, Widows Against Violence Empowered was formed with a constitution to only work with innocent victims bereaved through sectarian violence.  In 1993, a woman whose husband was murdered by a paramilitary organisation for alleged informing was struggling with this information and the impact of the death on her young children.  The women in WAVE identified it was wrong to view her as to be guilty by association.  She and her children were grieving and it was felt we needed to widen our constitution to include everyone bereaved, regardless of religion, political opinion, cultural views or circumstances.</p><p>  Later, WAVE&rsquo;s remit was widened to include those injured or traumatised as a result of the Troubles.  This was an important development because while an official list exists of those who died, there is no list of those severely injured.  The needs of the injured in many government reports have often been overlooked.  We now see many injured people coming forward for the first time seeking help.  Today, WAVE is an organisation which works in five dedicated outreach centres in Belfast, Armagh, Omagh, Ballymoney and Derry-Londonderry.  We have 12 satellite projects, as well as providing services in other areas as required like in Dublin and London if families in these cities approach us for local-based services.  Every year we serve on average 2,100 people who access support services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary McCallan" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013121200004#F00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today.  WAVE has worked for a number of years to support families and individuals who have sought to obtain information on the circumstances behind their bereavement or injury.  A specific case work service was established in September 2012.  However, truth, justice and acknowledgement remain contested matters in a society with varying expectations across the community and the client base we work with.  It is clear from WAVE's work that families and individuals affected by the conflict deserve access to information on the circumstances in which people were bereaved or physically and psychologically injured.  Acknowledgement of hurt is a vital part of recovery in their health and well-being.  The withholding of information from the bereaved and injured people prolongs their suffering and prevents individual and societal healing.</p><p>  WAVE is a cross-community and inclusive support organisation and is accustomed to dealing with individuals from a variety of backgrounds.  It believes that all families have a right to know the circumstances of their bereavement or injury.  The provision of advocacy and support to families engaging in these processes is vital.  NGOs, such as WAVE, should not be hampered in carrying out such important work, whether through a lack of funding or a perceived unwillingness of others to provide information.  Accessing information allows victims and survivors to become empowered, take ownership and resolve difficult and sensitive issues.  Engaging with legacy issues contributes to building and cementing peace in areas affected by the conflict.</p><p>  Over the past 15 years statements and promises have been made to victims.  There was little in the various agreements to specifically address the need for information recovery by victims of the Troubles.  We were disappointed with Together: Building a United Community Strategy produced by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, OFMDFM.  It contained some commitments to deliver support services to victims and briefly examined the issues of memoralisation but did not address the issue of information recovery in a comprehensive fashion.  Many families and individuals regard the reluctance to deal with human rights violations and breaches of the criminal law as affording ongoing immunity to the perpetrators of acts of violence during the Troubles.  The corrosive effect that has had on societal confidence in policing the criminal justice system and in the current political system cannot be underestimated.</p><p>  A great concern for WAVE is the continuing trauma being experienced by families who will try any possible avenue to gain the vital information.  It is worth remembering that what has been established, and commonly referred to as a package of measures, did not grow from a coherent logical policy.  It was established in reaction to sustained campaigning by families and individuals such as the families of the disappeared and the establishment of the independent commission.  Over the past number of years families and campaigning organisations have attempted to use legal mechanisms, and publicity that surrounded high profile cases, as vehicles to uncover hidden truths or as a means to apply political or moral pressure to individuals or organisations that may be in possession of relevant information.  </p><p>  WAVE has worked with people who have had positive and negative experiences of the various established investigative processes.  It is important to acknowledge that some families have been satisfied.  On contacting various bodies, they have expressed satisfaction with the work undertaken and found it valuable.  Some families knew very little about the circumstances surrounding the death of their loved one so the opportunity to obtain some knowledge has brought comfort.  In the recent high profile case of John Proctor, the Historical Enquiries Team reviewed the case, passed it to the PSNI to investigate and a conviction was obtained.  The Proctor family have felt a great relief having obtained that degree of justice.  </p><p>  We acknowledge that good work has been carried out by individual officers investigating cases.  However, some families who approached WAVE have raised legitimate concerns due to their experiences of the processes, many questioned how informative the reports produced are and there was a perception that some cases were treated differently from others.  The recent report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, HMIC, on the HET stated that the HET's overall approach was unacceptable.  </p><p>  The current piecemeal unco-ordinated processes impede collective understanding of what occurred during the period of conflict.  The inherent insufficiencies and lack of coherence has failed to provide families and individuals with the information that they desperately need in order to begin the healing process.  WAVE strongly advocates the development of a structured and comprehensive approach to end the relentless need for families and individuals to endlessly engage with process after process.  We advocate that those who were injured in the Troubles have access to information.  Some of the injuries were of a life-threatening nature.  In other cases the injuries were obtained at the same time as a fatality occurred and reports have been prepared via some of the mechanisms that I outlined.  The processes that currently attempt to examine the past do not address the issues.  Even those that have a remit to examine the cases, such as the Office of the Police Ombudsman, have adopted a system of prioritisation that gives precedence to cases that resulted in a fatality over cases of injury.</p></speech>

There were seven known cases of people abducted in the course of the Troubles and secretly buried.  However, that figure may be higher, given that a few cases have come forward.</p><p>  Given the circumstances of many of the cases, the families have been left isolated and vulnerable.  It is only in recent years that we have begun to meet together.  We formed a group called the Families of the Disappeared, which is supported through WAVE.  WAVE has worked to connect the families through a variety of means.  A yearly remembrance Mass is held on Psalm Sunday in St. Patrick's School, Armagh, at which the Cardinal usually officiates.  The yearly event has brought immense comfort to those who continue to struggle with the pain and grief of loss, in addition to the lack of knowledge of the final resting place of their loved one.</p><p>  We also have an All Souls silent walk at Stormont.  The families lay a wreath on the steps of Stormont to show those who are working in Stormont that we have not gone away and that we need to be regarded as people to whom it is worthwhile to talk.</p><p>  In addition, the families lobby by meeting with committees such as this one, political parties and special envoys.  Other special events have been facilitated also to keep our families together.</p><p>  Having come before this committee we must ask what it can do for us.  This is an accurate, information driven process.  Seven individuals are still missing.  In my brother's case, he is reportedly buried in France.  In the case of Sean Megraw, who is on my left, his brother, Brendan, is buried in Meath.  There are three other cases in the areas of Meath and Navan.  Kevin McKee, Seamus Wright and Joe Lynskey.  Columba McVeigh is reportedly buried in Monaghan.  Robert Nairac's remains are unknown.</p><p>  The committee members can help by wearing a Forget Me Not badge, which we as a group have developed.  I am wearing one of the badges, which is a representation of forget me know flowers to show that we exist.  It is very important for people to wear it.  We would like people to wear a badge, if they can do so, going about their daily work to remind people that we are still here.  The committee can help us also by facilitating the Families of the Disappeared exhibition, which we hope will come to the South of Ireland and perhaps be located in its members' area.  </p><p>  We know there are individuals who have not spoken.  The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, the ICLVR, is in place for information.  That commission is the last of the Good Friday Agreement commissions.</p><p>  This is unfinished business.  We need publicity.  We need people to remember that the disappeared remain disappeared.  Two and a half million people watched the RTE-BBC documentary "The Disappeared" last month.  Ten thousand people recently walked through the disappeared exhibition in Belfast City Hall.  We hope that information has come, but we need the committee's support.</p><p>  We thank the Irish Government and the British Government for their continued and valued support.  Since 1999, the families of the disappeared have been given a voice, mainly through WAVE's support.  In 1985, I received a death threat if I spoke about my brother's disappearance.  That is why I am here now.  I have been given a voice.</p><p>  This committee can help us with our campaign to highlight the disappeared issue and to bring it to the attention of the politicians both North and South of the Border.  Meeting with the members has helped me and has given me a voice.</p></speech>

I will give the committee some background information on myself and then outline my connection with the peace factory.  My father, Denis Mullen, was murdered by the Glenanne gang in 1975.  He was one of more than 120 victims of that gang, which was a unit operating in Armagh and Tyrone, with the support of elements of the RUC and the UDR.  Only one of its victims had any connection with violent republicanism.  My father was an SDLP activist.  He was Austin Currie's election agent.  My mother, who they also tried to kill, was active in civil rights agitation from the mid-1960s.  They fired 27 rounds at my father and he was hit 17 times.  At four years of age, I sat with my dead father in a pool of blood on our doorstep.  The Sterling sub-machine gun that killed him had been taken from the UDR base in Glenanne, in County Armagh.  It was used to kill at least ten other people.  There was never any police investigation into how that weapon got out of the UDR armoury into the hands of a murder gang.  It was just one of hundreds that went the same route.</p><p>  There are many stories like mine and they are listed in the recently published book <i>Lethal Allies</i>, by the journalist Anne Cadwallader.  Her book was rejected as a work of fiction by some who bear responsibility for finding a way for our society to deal with its violent past yet if we were to adopt the balance of probability standard acceptable to Mr. Justice Smithwick, we would find collusion proving my father's mother and all the 121 cases.  In reality, almost all of them would stand up to much more rigorous definition.</p><p>  Fifteen years after the Good Friday Agreement there has been no effective progress on the area of victims and facing up to decades of violence.  We have had 15 years of frozen stand-off because the main political decision-makers prefer to defend what they see as their vital political interests to present their version of the past, their own tailored narrative, rather than simply seek and accept the truth.  To put it even more bluntly, they have things they want to continue to hide.  They have friends they want to protect in the RUC, the UDR, the British Army or the Provisional IRA or among the informers who worked for two or more of those organisations.  Thus, every attempt to debate victims or even to define who they are drowns in a wave of whataboutery.  This is what has happened to the most comprehensive attempt to face the past since the Eames Bradley proposals of 2009.  We should watch what will happen to any specific or practical proposals put forward by Dr. Richard Haas.</p><p>  The organisations that killed people share a common interest in letting this state of affairs continue.  They and political parties will pursue their interests and neglect the victims.  They pick over the bones of the dead, accepting some and rejecting others, championing some survivors and slandering others, fighting their dirty war all over again.  There are those who would embrace me because my father was a victim of collusion while others reject me for the same reason.  They reverse roles when it comes to the families of the disappeared.  They are equally dishonest.</p><p>  I sincerely hope that the Haass-O'Sullivan process will produce movement on dealing with the past but we face challenges from vested political interests and from victims groups which adopt a partisan approach.</p></speech>

A number of weeks I proposed that the committee ask groups to attend and make presentations.  I am glad that my suggestion was unanimously accepted.</p><p>  I compliment all of the witnesses on their presentations.  Ms Mullen Fox and Ms Morgan have been exceptionally brave in discussing their particular circumstances and the tragedies experienced by both of their families.  Recently I spoke with Ms Morgan's brother in Newry, on the subject of her brother's disappearance, so I am familiar with the details.  I also heard Ms Mullen Fox make an outstanding presentation in Armagh recently.  At the same meeting, Mr. Seamus Mallon, a very distinguished former parliamentarian and a great Irishman, gave a powerful presentation on the terrible tragedies that occurred in the area.  He clearly stated who was responsible for the murders perpetrated in a triangle of areas. </p><p>  Politicians, in general, have very good reasons not to praise the media.  Earlier Ms Morgan referred to the powerful BBC-RTE documentary called "The Disappeared" which did a good public service.  Similarly, the same applies to Anne Cadwallader's book which is extremely important.  I do not think any of us have the words to give full vent to the anger and sorrow we all have regarding the tragedies that were inflicted on so many families.  It is very important that the issues are kept to the fore as much as possible.  Today's presentations are important and outline the need for people with any information to come forward and give it to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains.  Last night I spoke to Mr. Frank Murray who is the Irish commissioner, one of two in the organisation.  He and his fellow commissioner colleague are determined to do everything that they can to progress the search for bodies and have been relentless in performing that task.  </p><p>  I am very familiar with the commission's work because its first commissioner was the late T&aacute;naiste, John Wilson.  John and I were very close political colleagues and personal friends.  Deputy Joe O'Reilly was also a personal friend of John Wilson.  I knew when the commission's work started how difficult it was going to be.  It was the first time that the families of the victims had been spoken to or listened to, in any respect.  John Wilson often gave me an outline of the issues that had been brought to his attention and the undemanding requests made by the families.  He spoke only in general terms.  He never put the matter on record and never spoke to me in specific details about a family or needs of the families.  The message was always given that all the bereaved families wanted was to learn the location of the remains in order to give their loved ones a decent and proper burial, have a place to leave flowers and say a prayer.  That is very undemanding coming from families who have lost people in the most horrific circumstances.  It is horrific for anyone who must bear the burden and experience the tragedy of a murder.  It is an added and particular cruelty to not know the burial place of loved ones.  </p><p>  I am sure that all of the committee members would be unanimous and call for persons with any bit of information to give it to the independent commission.  That piece of information could be important.  Time is against everybody who must deal with the issue because memories fade as every day passes.  Perhaps the terrain will have changed due to farm work or access roads being improved or disimproving.  All of those matters make the necessary task of locating the remains more difficult by the day.</p><p>  The witnesses have been very brave to outline the tragedies that have afflicted on their families in a public forum and with no closure.  I know the phrase "no closure" is not the best phrase but I hope that the witnesses will understand the context.  In this country we have a ritual of giving a person a decent burial, allowing people a time to grieve and having a place to say a prayer and lay flowers.  The families of the disappeared have been denied that ritual.  The issue is very important.  I had a special debate on the issue in the D&aacute;il where the Minister for Justice and Equality assured me that every resource would be given to the independent commission.  The witnesses can be assured of that and it has the support of all political parties.  </p><p>  Ms Peake mentioned issues that arise today such as the threats made by so-called dissidents, or people who class themselves as dissidents.  There does not seem to be a structure to deal with such threats.  I ask her to elaborate on what she meant.  If I understood Ms McCallan correctly, a strong theme ran through her contribution whereby the lack of information continues to inflict pain on people.  I know the work done by both of the organisations and there are many individuals who support them.  I wish them well in a very difficult task.  </p></speech>

This committee is conscious of trying to implement the Good Friday Agreement in order to bring peace to a very troubled area and to our country.  We takes our job very seriously.  I am also a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly committee where I chair its sovereign committee that has prepared a report on the decade of commemorations.  We are preparing a report on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Our discussions have taken us to Belfast, Northern Ireland, across to Scotland and all across the island of Ireland.</p><p>  The discussions have been fruitful but we must deal with the past and the legacy issues.  In all of the details and discussions that have taken place, the Eames-Bradley report crops up all of the time.  Some people thought it was a great idea.  I have heard others to say as it was not their idea they will not agree with it.  Also, the &pound;12,000 recognition payment was seen as a very blunt instrument.  A lot of time,  discussions and cross-Border negotiations were taken on board and went into the Eames-Bradley report.  Why did the report not get the traction that I believe it deserved?  When talking to people behind the scenes, from all political parties and all groups in Northern Ireland, one hears that it was not a bad idea.  Did politicians not take the lead?  Were they fearful of taking a lead in something that people have told me is a good idea?  The politicians decided that they did not want it because it was not their idea.  The politicians should have taken the lead.  Politicians are in a different zone now.  I would like to hear the opinions from the witnesses on the report.</p><p>  I watched the programme called "The Disappeared."  It brought home the message to people in the Republic who were not as familiar as they should have been with the suffering and legacy of the past.</p></speech>

As part of the conflict resolution process it is incumbent on all of us to do everything possible to bring some form of closure to people who continue to be victims of that conflict.  I refer in particular to the families of the Disappeared.  The loss of a loved one is a great sorrow for any family but the loss of the remains makes it all the more painful and that pain continues until such time as there is a recovery which will help to bring about an element of closure.</p><p>  I am a former combatant.  I know the efforts being made by many people to address the continuing injustice which the families have to endure.  This committee and the party to which I belong have worked tirelessly in order to help in that regard.  We have been successful in quite a number of instances but issues remain.  I am certain that all members of this committee will join me in making the appeal to anyone with any information that can help to please come forward to help resolve this part of an issue which arose out of the conflict.</p><p>Regrettably the past cannot be changed and wrongs and injustices happened and cannot be undone.  Recognition and acknowledgement are part of the process by which victims are able to deal with pain and injustice.  I was very encouraged to hear how the trauma education process which is advocated by the delegation will filter through the wider system.  A structured comprehensive approach was also advocated.  I ask the delegates to elaborate on how the committee can be of assistance in the development of that approach.  </p><p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party has been advocating for a truth and reconciliation process because in my view before we can deal with all the outstanding aspects we will all need to own up to our responsibilities, irrespective of who we are and to help with the collective healing of our communities.  It is a significant and onerous undertaking.  I am reliably informed that the truth and reconciliation process in South Africa has been very helpful for both the victims and for the combatants.  I ask for the views of the delegates.  No effort should be spared to bring about the recovery of the Disappeared.  We all have an obligation to do our utmost to bring that about.</p></speech>

It is not easy and certainly not easy in formal settings such as this committee meeting.  I congratulate them for their excellent presentations which they have delivered with great passion and personal sincerity.</p><p>  I was happy that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, was able to assure my constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, that the funding for the victims commission would remain in place.  I join with Deputy Smith from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency - where all of this is very real - in saying that this is a very sensitive and important issue in our constituency.  We have a pride in County Cavan in the fact that the first Victims Commissioner was a distinguished Cavan man, the former T&aacute;naiste, John Wilson, a very distinguished academic and national politician.  That fact gives us an extra interest in the work of the commission which must be supported and continued.  </p><p>  Of course we understand that the families should be able to have the normal bereavement process, that they all should have a grave to visit.  Those of us who have the privilege of a grave to visit find it very therapeutic to attend the blessing of the graves in our religious tradition and to visit the grave on Sundays.  The delegates deserve the same as the very minimum.</p><p>  It is very disappointing that the families know the broad locations of where people are buried but do not have more precise information.  I ask the delegates to comment on this aspect and to explain what precise information is available to them.  It seems the location cannot be reached in a number of cases.  I have to ask the question whether the delegates are receiving the co-operation they believe they should be getting from members of the Provisional movement.  I know that Denise Mullen Fox does not have to deal with a disappeared victim but I ask if she is receiving support from the State services.</p><p>  Are the families of the Disappeared receiving the requisite co-operation?  Are the views expressed by Deputy Ferris typical?  Is there a real effort to find the information that the families need?  We need to know because the committee would have no point in meeting today if that question is not addressed in a clear way.  I ask the delegates to explain the gaps or lacunae in the information being provided to them.  Who is responsible for them?  Does more precise information exist which the families are not receiving?  If so, who is keeping it from them and why?  This has to be examined at this committee because otherwise this meeting will be sadly a farce.  It is our job to address that aspect in order to be of assistance.  This meeting is being broadcast live which means the matter will gain some media focus, in the same way as the recent evocative television programme.</p></speech>

I will start by paying tribute to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and his equivalent in the North for their support for and commitment to continuing funding for the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains.  This crucial process has worked when adequate information has been in place.  This relates to our point on ensuring an information-led process, which is what is required.</p><p>  I will start with the question on what is a trauma education programme.  This may also answer Deputy Ferris's question.  Such a programme equips us in order to ensure that we are more responsive to the needs of those who have been directly impacted by the Troubles.  In terms of training social workers, it has been quite a fascinating-----</p></speech>

These are distinct courses.  Information is also provided on the very prominent link between trauma and addiction.  We have a suite of eight community-based courses across a range of venues, which provide people with accreditation and equip them to have a greater awareness of the subject areas in question.</p><p>  The BSc programme at Queen's University Belfast covers a broad area around psychosocial responses, which is about recognising the role of treatment modalities, but at a wider level is also about how a societal response can be best encouraged.</p><p>  The professional development level involves victim and survivor trainers, supplemented by lectures, instructing social work students, nursing students and teachers for two weeks to make them more responsive to and aware of the issues presented by victims and survivors who they will meet.  This has been fascinating, as many of the social work students are 18 or 19 years of age and are asking why they must do this, seeing as how the Troubles are over.  By week two, they are reporting that they understand why, for example, their aunts are the way they are, they had not realised what had happened in their families and that the course has been beneficial.</p><p>  The programme is evaluated by practice users and clinical teachers, who state that they have seen an improvement in practice.  Social workers and, hopefully, nurses are more responsive towards the people they meet.</p><p>  Deputy Smith asked about threats.  The worrying trend is that this matter does not just relate to dissidents.  At a broader level, it also relates to loyalist intimidation and threats, in that individuals and families are presenting under threat.  The difficulty lies in how the threat is verified.  It is verified by the police, who come to our door and ask where the people can go and how they can stay safe.  For example, the police service asks about what it can do as regards young fellows whose names have appeared on lists.  Where are these people safe and who will take responsibility for them?  This issue has proven difficult.  We have considered which providers in our community might take them, but they understandably will not open themselves up to the risk of accepting people who are under threat.  We would argue that the process of verifying threats and providing meaningful support needs to be examined as a matter of urgency.  People are distressed.  It is an increasing problem among those who present to us.</p><p>  I will ask Ms McCallan to answer the question on a comprehensive process.</p><p>  Regarding the Eames-Bradley group, the payment of &pound;12,000 sadly became the story for the media and effectively shut the process down before anyone considered the wider report, which also suggested a range of mechanisms for dealing with the past.  As an organisation, we must take account of the fact that, while the &pound;12,000 was an issue for the people in WAVE, it was not for many more.  They asked why no one was speaking for them in that debate.  This is the sad reality.  In some ways, the report went to ground and should have been back on the table much sooner.</p></speech>

At the material time, I was a senior official in the Northern Ireland Office when Mr. Peter Hain set up the Eames-Bradley commission and also while Mr. Shaun Woodward was Secretary of State.  The report was never formally shelved by the British Government.  As the committee knows, the &pound;12,000 payment created a major political firestorm.  In an attempt to save the rest of the report, we felt that we had to distance ourselves from the payment.  In fact, we made the announcement on the way to a Northern Ireland Affairs Committee meeting on which Dr. Alasdair McDonnell may well have been sitting.  Thereafter, the politics of the greater issue of devolving policing and justice took over.  In a sense, the report sat there.</p><p>  There was not a good history of measures being imposed from the centre, particularly in these complex and sensitive issues.  Our view was that there needed to be a consensus at a local level.  The Deputy is right, in that, while I will not say that no one made an attempt to build a consensus, it simply never emerged.  There is a strong sense now that the Eames-Bradley report is back on Dr. Haass's desk in some shape or form.  All is not lost.  Certainly, all of that work is not lost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary McCallan" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013121200008#K00700"><p>Deputy Ferris asked about a structured and comprehensive approach to dealing with these issues.  He mentioned the South African approach of truth and reconciliation.  We would say that the Eames-Bradley recommendations are the structured approach.  In the discussions within our sector as well as the human rights sector since the report was finalised, people have been of the opinion that, despite the report's limitations, for example, the lack of provision for injured people, the defects could be remedied and the process itself was deep and comprehensive and had buy-in from quite a few victims.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alasdair McDonnell" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013121200009#L00200"><p>I do not want to say too much because I am familiar with victims.  I spent 30 years working as a GP and I often dealt with victims in a private or medical capacity.  I know the trauma experienced by every victim.  I am well aware that no two victims and no two sets of circumstances are exactly the same but that familiar or similar trends arise in respect of both.</p><p>  I wish to ask a very simple, general question and I would like as many of our guests as possible who feel able to do so to answer it.  I am interested in teasing out a particular outcome in the context of these proceedings.  Will the various groups indicate how the Deputies and Senators gathered here - who have a very genuine interest in this matter - might provide practical assistance to them in their mission to obtain closure in respect of a number of these cases?  What might be an acceptable solution for victims and survivors?  I was a very firm supporter of the Eames-Bradley process and I am keen to see it resurrected.  Would that process be sufficient or would add-ons be required in respect of survivors who are injured?  The hostility to the Eames-Bradley process was shocking.  It was frightening in many ways that people could get so angry.  Like Ms Peake, I felt that 95% of the Eames-Bradley proposals were very solid.  I informed Dr. Richard Haass of that fact and he has taken my views on board.  I am aware that the Eames-Bradley process is now well up on the agenda.  Would the Eames-Bradley process be sufficient?  In that context, we must ask how we get to the next stage.</p><p>  I wish to pose a specific question to Ms Mullen Fox which I would have thought would be of interest to many of our colleagues.  I am not sure whether everyone present has knowledge of the Glenanne gang.  Is it possible to connect the latter to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?  In the context of victims, the Glenanne gang was responsible for carrying out quite a few murders within the jurisdiction of this State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Murphy" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013121200009#L00300"><p>I will not repeat what others have said.  I echo Deputy Martin Ferris's comments on the absolute responsibility of anyone in possession of information which might assist in the recovery of people's remains to bring it forward.  I reiterate the appeal he made in respect of that matter.</p><p>  Our guests are welcome.  I have had an opportunity to meet many people involved with the groups before the committee.  A couple of broad issues arise, including those which relates to truth and justice.  It must be stated that justice means different things to different victims.  It also means different things to the families of victims.  I accept the point Mr. Godfrey made in respect of the rejection of the Eames-Bradley process by the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, and the British state on the basis that until there was sufficient consensus, it could not be proceeded with further.  If that approach had been taken previously, there would not have been a Good Friday Agreement and we would not be sitting in this room now.  There is a responsibility on those who occupy positions of leadership to go forward rather than hanging back.  I have had conversations with NIO Ministers and I am aware that this masks the hostility to a truth recovery process within the British state.  That matter must be tackled.  There is an onus on all of us to create a process which is about providing as much closure as possible or about giving people the information that will assist them in achieving closure.</p><p>  The justice issue is perhaps more complicated because people have different ideas about what constitutes justice.  Even within families, there are differing views as to what justice means.  I am interested in discovering our guests' position in respect of the idea that consensus will be required - this remains the official position of the British state - before we can begin to explore these matters.  I do not believe such consensus is either possible or achievable.  I am of the opinion that we have a responsibility to try to lead and to deal with as many of the issues relating to victims as possible.  We must also seek to reduce the numbers of those our guests represent and who continue to be affected.</p><p>  The other matter to which I wish to refer is victims services.  Ms Peake stated that the WAVE Trauma Centre does occasional work in Dublin.  Does this State provide any formal or practical support for that work?  Mr. McDonnell, MP, referred to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The Justice for the Forgotten has strongly criticised the level of support it has received.  Are our guests aware of what levels of practical support are available to victims or relevant organisations on this side of the Border?</p><p>  Those are the questions I wish to pose.  Many of the other issues have already been covered.  I thank our guests for attending and for the presentations they made.</p></speech>

I have met representatives from most of the groups involved - if not those who are present - on various visits to Northern Ireland.  The stories they tell in respect of their own circumstances and the various cases with which they are dealing are extremely sad.  I was surprised when Ms Peake indicated that the figure for new referrals last year was 550.  That is a huge number.  I do not wish to be misunderstood but what is the success rate in respect of such referrals?  When I use the phrase "success rate", I am seeking to discover that with which people are satisfied.  Is it just the case that they want to tell their stories?  Do they want to be part of Ms Peake's group - the purpose of which is to create a wider family of people who have been affected by the Troubles - in order to obtain some type of solace and consolation?</p><p>  Many groups in the North appear to have specific and good intentions in respect of the communities they represent but funding seems to be a problem for all of them.  What is the position in the context of funding?</p><p>  I was delighted to hear about the education programmes.</p></speech>

It is hard to believe it is 15 years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  For the majority of people, the Agreement brought an end to war.  Many viewed it as a triumph of dialogue and politics over violent conflict.  At that time, people spoke of inclusion as opposed to exclusion, making a new beginning, looking at things differently and trying to address the hurt that many people suffered.  Unfortunately, what we have heard from our guests is that we have not even agreed on the definition of a victim.  This is part of the difficulty.  We heard, for example, that the media focused on one aspect of the Eames-Bradley process but politicians also did so.  I do not know why some politicians do not want the issue discussed.  A dialogue needs to take place and we need a structure for examining the past.  While we cannot change the past, it is pulling us back and preventing us from moving forward.  Some parties and individuals continue to look to the past, even if that is understandable.</p><p>  Anniversaries and commemorations are taking place virtually on a weekly basis.  In addition to the large commemorations, victims will also mark occasions such as the anniversaries and birthdays of loved ones who died.  This issue is not being addressed. </p><p>  The hierarchy of victims is an issue because we cannot agree on who is a victim.  It is clear from the comments on who is acceptable as a victim that there is a hierarchy of victims.  This is all part of the discussion that needs to take place. </p><p>  I assume the organisations before us are trying to achieve a number of objectives.  It is important, for example, that the hurt inflicted in the past is not repeated.  We heard from our guests that threats continue.  Politicians on this island and in these islands need to address this issue. </p><p>  We were promised a new beginning but a number of outstanding issues have not been addressed.  This and the absence of an inclusive society are causing hurt.  Ms Morgan represents the disappeared.  That her family was treated differently within the broader group of families of the disappeared demonstrates differences in the treatment of victims.  We need to establish some mechanism to allow people to raise individual cases.  People looked at the South Africa model, yet some people in South Africa had difficulties with the truth commission process there.  Unless we devise some structure or platform for addressing this issue, we will return to the issue in 15 years and people will still feel hurt about their families and loved ones.  This creates difficulties in the process.  Clearly, work needs to be done on the victims issue and I hope the Haass recommendations will allow people to find common ground. </p><p>  We can learn from the past.  We hear that people thought the conflict was over but tension and conflict remains.  The onus is on all of us to produce solutions to this problem.  I assume Ms Morgan hopes that her appearance at this meeting will trigger a memory in someone who may then come forward with information.  It is important that the joint committee reiterate that any information passed to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains cannot be used in a court of law or transmitted to any other agency and that those passing on such information have absolute immunity in respect of such information.  That message must go out from this meeting.  Representatives of the independent commission met the joint committee to outline the ongoing work of the commission.  Its work depends on those who have information on the disappeared providing such information.  We all appeal to those who have information to please come forward. </p></speech>

What would be the best resolution for victims and their families, more so than the protagonists?</p> <p> I want to ask a question about the level of co-operation with people who may have information.  What can be done to advance that?  The question of an amnesty is a thorny one.  This possibility has been mentioned in cases like the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the killings in south Armagh and the Disappeared.  What really needs to happen here?  What would be the witnesses' attitude to something of this nature that would allow the truth to emerge?  I am sure there are people who have information but fear that it could be used against them if they were to provide it.  Many victims and families might find it abhorrent if those who provide information were to receive an amnesty.  I want to get a view from the witnesses of what needs to be done, or can be done, to get a resolution for the families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Reavey" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013121200011#N00200"><p>The work of Eames and Bradley was badly hampered by the definition of &quot;victim&quot; that was imposed on them by the British authorities.  My problem was that the victim and the perpetrator were seen in the same light.  I suppose I have come away from that to some extent over time.  Perhaps I am seeing things in a better light.  Some work could be done in this area to close the gap.  I have heard the word &quot;closure&quot; three or four times this morning.  I normally associate the word &quot;closure&quot; with politicians and press reporters.  I seldom hear a victim talking about closure.  In my vocabulary, I do not know what closure means because I will not get closure until we get answers to the questions we have been asking for many years.</p><p>  People asked about the Glenanne gang.  I live in the immediate area.  The UDR station was less than a mile from my home.  Three of my brothers were murdered by members of the Glenanne gang in 1976.  I have to say the circumstances were very suspicious.  On the night in question, there were checkpoints on all the roads leading to our house.  The police and the army say that the checkpoints were not legal.  If they were not legal checkpoints, they must have been illegal checkpoints.  In later years, I came to know which members of the gang carried out those murders.  S&eacute;amus Mallon lived in Markethill.  The word was on the street in Markethill over the next couple of days.  In fact, a publican from Markethill told my father the names of the people who murdered his sons.  He lived for 15 years after that.  He only told me those names two or three days before he died.  Guns went missing from Glenanne.  It was no surprise.</p><p>  A good few of those who were in the Glenanne gang were members of the Glenanne UDR centre.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were carried out by the same gang.  I have had many hours of discussions with the historical inquiries team about all of this.  There is no doubt that the Glenanne gang carried out the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We have been asked whether we get enough information from people in the North.  Perhaps the people in the South would say they did not get enough information from the authorities in the South about this incident.</p><p>  Perhaps the historical inquiries team had its difficulties.  I do not know all the politics of it.  I can say that in the Reavey case, the historical inquiries team was the finest group of officers I have ever met.  Mr. Cox was the first man who ever went in to shake my mother's hand.  It took 30 years.  He said on behalf of the British Government and the British authorities that he was sorry for the deaths of her sons.  No police officer ever came to her.  She never had any therapy.  She had nothing.  When her sons were killed, two of them were on the sick over Christmas.  She was not entitled to compensation because the British Government was paying their wages for the couple of weeks in question and she did not suffer any financial loss.  The other young fellow, who was 18, lived for two or three weeks before he died.  The coroner said that he died from natural causes.  We fought that as best we could.  Some 35 years later, Mr. Cox showed me where the coroner changed his report three days after the original inquest.  Never in the history of the state of Northern Ireland has an inquest report been changed other than by going back and having another court case or something.</p><p>  When one talks about collusion, one must wonder how far it went.  Mr. Cox will testify that the collusion went as far as the Attorney General.  We have evidence of that in the case of the Rock Bar attack.  The barrister for the UDR and the police, which carried out those shootings, said he had obtained a <i>nolle prosequi</i> sentence.  The only person who can authorise a <i>nolle prosequi</i> is the Attorney General.  As the members of this committee will be aware, the Attorney General is in touch with the Prime Minister many times every day.  It turned out that all those involved in that case got off.  It was subsequently proven by the historical inquiries team that they were the perpetrators of that bombing and shooting.</p><p>  There are 120 cases of collusion with regard to the Glenanne gang.  I am told that another 17 cases are pending.  I do not know how the RUC could not link those cases.  It had all the forensics.  There was a pool of guns and a mixture of guns would be used in one murder or another.  I listened to Assistant Chief Constable White on TV.  He said that the historical inquiries team gleaned this information from the police files.  It would never have left those files if it had not been for the historical inquiries team.  If the authorities here have any information about the Glenanne cases in their files, I encourage and plead with them to hand it over to the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland</p></speech>

Five people were involved in my father's case.  One of them was an RUC man.  The others were all UDR men.  My father was the first person to be murdered with guns stolen from the Glenanne army base.  A further ten people were killed by those using the guns in question.  I had a positive experience with the historical inquiries team.  It is a process that opens up the channels for one.  It depends on where one takes it after that.  The team will tell one that these things can be very daunting.  I can show the committee what my father's case file looks like.  It consists of several pieces of paper that were scrunched up and had to be straightened out.  A few days before my father was murdered, a man came to the house dressed as a nun basically to survey the house.  He turned out to be a UDR man.  We have now established where that uniform came from, right down to the rosary beads.  It came from a UDR base.</p><p>  I wish to comment on the drawbacks I have experienced in bringing my case through the legal system.</p></speech>

The responsibility of this committee is to highlight our issue both North and South and to those who have the answers to the location of our loved ones' bodies.  In my case, my brother is buried in France so it is very difficult for my family to access the French authorities in any way.  If anyone in the committee knows a way of getting to the area where our Seamus is buried which is called Pont de l'Arche outside Rouen, I would be very happy to work with them.  In our case, as we out of the jurisdiction both North and South and in Great Britain, we as a family need that extra support which we have not had at all.  Since 1985, I have written religiously and quietly to the Department of Foreign Affairs in the South.  I tried my best to keep Seamus's name alive and I hope I have done that through the campaign and that the committee can help us as a family in some small way to overcome the issues we are facing which relate to getting into the French situation.</p><p>  On a broader issue, we as families need always to hear that the members are giving us support even if it is only mentioning us when they are doing interviews or in their constituencies.  We continually need to hear that people are thinking about us.  Even that in a small way is very important so we can continue this struggle.  As members have said, recovering and burying a body and going to a graveside are so important.  It really is very important.  I hope that all the families of the disappeared will receive their loved ones back and we will be able to give them Christian burials.  If that day does come, I would like all the members to come to those burials. </p></speech>

Obviously, we do not have all the information we want but it is very difficult for us to answer that question because the information goes to the commission which cannot pass it on to us.  It can speak to us in general terms but because of confidentiality, it cannot give us specific information.  However, we do know that there was an event down in Orristown about six weeks ago at which Frank Murray, the commissioner, spoke.  He said they know there is at least one person who was involved with the burials at Wilkinstown bog who has not come forward.  It is important that they be encouraged and pressurised if necessary to come forward.  They are obviously not listening to appeals.  We would ask that some grassroots intervention and encouragement could be made in the Meath area to bring them forward.  Although they are involved with Wilkinstown, that person may also be aware of the situation at Orristown as well.  There needs to be some grassroots intervention at these localities.  The other one is up at Emyvale in Monaghan.  The number of sites is actually quite small so the number of people involved is small.  It is important that a big effort be made locally to encourage these people to come forward.  I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sandra Peake" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013121200012#O00400"><p>In respect of Deputy Crowe's comment about support, those who are here have said that they are not eligible for the newly created victims service created by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  That is an area that probably needs to be reconsidered.  Deputy Crowe mentioned that it has been 15 years since the Good Friday Agreement and the fact that past issues are so present.  It was 11 years before three of the bodies of the disappeared were recovered.  They included Peter Wilson who disappeared in 1973, Charlie Armstrong who disappeared in 1980 and Gerry Evans who disappeared in 1979.  Those bodies were recovered within a short space of time.  That highlighted the fact that this is not an easy process.  It takes time, commitment and tenacity to keep coming back and the families have had to do that time and time again.  That is not without its cost to them.  The last surviving mother of one of those who remain missing, Mrs. McKee, died 18 months ago.  It is no secret because the family has shared it but she died a woman who had long-term difficulties arising from the abduction of her son.  Many of the mothers have put their sons' names on headstones and, therefore, handed the mantle of responsibility to the siblings.  That is something that must be considered.  The message is there - please bring these people home.  The other sad reality is that we have a new victims and survivors service that has sought to medicalise matters and exclude siblings.  The siblings in the families of the disappeared are carrying this forward and are excluded from assistance.  We have highlighted the difficulties those policies and decisions create for individuals.</p><p>  The sad reality is that we have a system whereby the funding is for a maximum of two years.  The Peace Factory is now without funding for the important work they do for victims and survivors and quite frankly, it is not good enough.  We lose good staff and build up capacity.  You are never sure whether you are able to keep going beyond a certain period and I would urge this committee to urge those responsible to bring in a firm arrangement to ensure that the community sector, which is a Cinderella sector but does valuable and much-needed work, is funded adequately on the basis so that it does not continue to lose good people who are trained and then move on because they may need to.  They need that continuity.  That is something that is very important.  </p><p>  We have also brought the Families of the Disappeared book with us and have copies for people here.  Those books have been published by the families through WAVE and tell the stories of a number of families.  We are happy for those to be given to members.  Education is key.  The reality is that we often treat people like an abnormality when it is the situation faced by many people that is the abnormality.  How they experience it is not the abnormality.  They are experiencing the normal reaction to something that was totally abnormal.  Every day, a scar is unpicked for somebody.  Language, gestures and commemoration are important.  We have seen those events more recently causing people to count the sores and we must show care, sensitivity and support.  </p></speech>

Following on from what Ms Peake said, I draw members' attention to the situation in regard to the Victims and Survivors Service.  There is a serious difficulty in that the service it provides is means tested and applicants are required to attend for an hour's interview to establish whether or not they are, in fact, a victim.  My mother, who was shot but survived, cannot access any service from the VSS, whether it be counselling, the holiday package or anything else, because she in receipt of a working pension.  Likewise, my brother, because he has a full-time job as a teacher, cannot access any support though the VSS.  The service is absolutely flawed.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to hear from Mr. Megraw that there is somebody out there with information about the Wilkinstown site.  That is worthy of emphasis.  The individual in question should be approached and assured that he or she can speak to the commission in confidence and with immunity, without any adverse personal consequences.  It behoves anybody who could make that approach to do so.</p></speech>

There was some discussion around the role of this committee.  Deputy Wall summed it up well in pointing out that we are trying to reach out as best we can, which includes our visits to Belfast and Dungannon and to Derry in the new year.  We intend to continue that engagement.  We are absolutely delighted to be able to reach out to the witnesses today, and their attendance is a very good start to another branch of engagement.  I thank Deputy Smith and Mr. McDonnell for their work with the clerk and other committee staff to facilitate this meeting.  We are grateful to the witnesses for their engagement with us and for sharing their personal stories.  We are all conscious of the famous observation, from whom I cannot recall, that if we do not learn from the mistakes of the past we are condemned to repeat them in the future.  That is something of which we are very conscious.</p><p>  We as a committee are very much focused on the next generation and on issues such as education, social policy, housing and so on.  We are also acutely aware, however, of our responsibility to this generation and to people in similar situations to the witnesses.  We have learnt a great deal time from our discussion today, particularly in terms of our responsibility not only to those bereaved during the conflict but also to those who suffered physical harm.  That has come across loud and clear today.</p><p>  Wording and jargon are always an issue when one is dealing with such sensitive legacy issues.  It is helpful to hear that while the concept of closure is important for some people - certainly for many of the people to whom we have spoken - there are also people who are primarily concerned with accountability and other issues.  I was brought up near a fishing village and still live on the coast and, as such, I am familiar with the consolation for families that comes from retrieving the bodies of loved ones after a tragic drowning.  There is a correlation there with what Ms Morgan and Mr. Megraw are saying in terms of the seven bodies that have not been recovered.  We as a committee are asking once again, in this public forum, that anybody who has any evidence or information which might help the families would come forward.  We will continue to champion the witnesses' cause.  At Government level, officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Taoiseach will be listening to the contributions today.  If there is anything we can do in terms of collaborating with the French Government, we will be happy to support Ms Morgan in that regard.</p><p>  We are dealing with complex and multifaceted legacy issues.  Mr. Richard Haass and his team have an important job to do and we certainly would not wish to interfere by telling them what they need to do.  I hope, however, that the contributions of witnesses and members today will be of value to Mr. Haass in his deliberations.  Everybody in this room, and everybody North and South and throughout the United Kingdom, wishes to see a better Northern Ireland.  We sometimes have a tendency to dismiss the progress that has been made in the past 15 years.  At the same time, however, there is much work that remains to be done.  We look forward to working with the witnesses in the future.  We try to operate as honest brokers and our door is open to everybody.  We are delighted to have the witnesses in Dublin and will help them in any way we can, including in respect of the exhibition to which Deputy Wall referred.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013121200003#B00300"><p>I thank the select committee for giving me the opportunity to bring this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 39 before it.  The total additional funding being sought for the Health Service Executive is &euro;219 million.  However, I am allocating savings of &euro;20 million which have been identified within my Department&rsquo;s Vote towards the HSE requirement; thus, the net cost to the Exchequer is &euro;199 million.  This represents less than 1.6% of the health sector budget for 2013.  This is a considerable achievement for the health services in view of the very challenging environment in which they have operated this year, given the increasing demand due to demographic pressures, the need to ensure patient safety is a priority at all times and considering the very challenging targets for service delivery in areas such as waiting times for inpatients, outpatients and at emergency departments.</p><p>  From the outset in 2013, the Department of Health and the HSE identified certain risks to the achievement of the very demanding savings targets in the 2013 service plan.  Some of these risks have materialised, such as the delay in finalising and implementing the Haddington Road agreement, the decision by the Government to defer the introduction of charging for private patients occupying public hospital beds, and the delay in the introduction of regulations under the FEMPI Act to reduce fees paid to doctors and pharmacists, which could not be introduced until the Haddington Road agreement was finalised.  However, as a result of prudent financial management and rigorous cost containment, these risks have been mitigated and offset by savings in other areas, and many of the 2013 targets are expected to be achieved in 2014.  In addition, while there has been a shortfall in the savings targets, it is important to note that significant savings were achieved, notably in the PCRS, with considerable reductions achieved in the cost of drugs and medicines.</p><p>  I will outline in a few minutes the details of this Estimate and the other measures being taken to address this year&rsquo;s deficit, but, first, I wish briefly to bring to the committee&rsquo;s attention the significant improvements that have been achieved in the health status of our country&rsquo;s citizens, and also the reforms which are being initiated to strengthen financial management within the HSE. </p><p>  Next week, my Department will publish "Health in Ireland: Key Trends", which aims to provide an overview of health status and the health services during the past ten years.  It shows real improvements in outcomes, in particular, improvements in mortality and increased life expectancy.  Mortality rates from circulatory system diseases and cancers, for example, have declined by 35% and 11% respectively since 2003.  Better health care continues to contribute significantly to better outcomes and gains in life expectancy.   Over the past decade, Ireland has achieved a rapid and unprecedented improvement in life expectancy.  It has increased by a full four years since the year 2000 and has been consistently higher than the EU average throughout the last decade.  However, we still face considerable challenges in the coming years.  The population continues to grow and to age.  Each year, an additional 20,000 people are added to the total of those aged over 65 years.  I am sure everyone will agree that is a good thing.  To meet these demands in an environment of reduced resources, we must change the way we manage and deliver our services.  The data on acute hospitals shows one of the ways in which we are achieving this in that 60% of hospital admissions are now for day care treatment, compared with 54% in 2006.  This is an example of care which provides both better and less invasive treatment while at the same time increasing volume and efficiency.</p><p>  The strategic framework for reform of the health services, known as Future Health, identified as one of the key challenges the need for an integrated financial management system.  My Department is working with the HSE to ensure the development and roll-out of a comprehensive financial management system as a matter of priority.  As part of the process of further strengthening the financial management of the HSE, independent expertise was engaged to evaluate the financial performance management system and a finance reform board has been established, chaired by the director general, including senior HSE management and representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>Proposals on the development and roll-out of an integrated financial management system have been endorsed by the board, with my full support and approval, and the HSE is now finalising a business case for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  I will now set out the items making up this year&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate.  The sector faced very significant financial challenges in 2013.  The budget targets set for the HSE this year were extremely demanding.  The deferral of the introduction of legislation to charge private patients in public beds until 1 January 2014 means that the targeted savings of &euro;60 million will not be achieved in 2013.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was enacted on 24 July 2013, but the Government decided to implement the private inpatient charges from 1 January 2014 to ensure that the additional revenue is realised on a phased basis.  Therefore, no savings will accrue in 2013 as a result of this legislation. </p><p>  My Department and the HSE are committed to maximising the savings under the Haddington Road agreement.  The main drivers for savings under the agreement are additional hours commitment for staff which will lead to a reduction in overtime and agency staff; reductions in rates for overtime; pay reductions for all staff earning in excess of &euro;65,000; and the nurse graduate scheme and the support staff intern scheme.  Not all of these measures could be fully implemented from 1 July 2013.  For example, significant savings are to be achieved through the graduate nurse and midwife initiative and the support staff intern scheme, but there is a lead-in time before such savings can be realised, given the recruitment process and issues such as Garda vetting.  </p><p>  In addition, considerable savings will be made through the effective harnessing of the additional working hours to which staff are committed.  The harnessing of these additional working hours requires the reorganisation of services and the redesigning of rosters, and it is taking some time to effect these changes.  Planned savings through the reduction in numbers employed are also somewhat less than targeted in 2013, with a very low rate of retirements in 2013.  This is probably due to the fact that a higher than normal number of staff retired in 2012 as staff exited before the end of February 2012 to avail of the grace period.  Further reductions in numbers were targeted under an incentivised career break scheme.  Some 360 staff have been released from a total of 2,700 applications.  A large proportion of the applicants were front-line health professionals, such as nurses and therapists, and only limited numbers of these staff could be released due to the necessity to ensure that front-line services continued to be provided.  </p><p>  The 2013 budget set a target of &euro;323 million for reduction in expenditure on community schemes this year.  In addition, the HSE sought a further &euro;60 million in savings.  This ambitious target has fallen short due to the timing of the FEMPI regulations and a shortfall in other savings targets.  However, it must be acknowledged that the PCRS did achieve considerable savings on the schemes, for which it should be commended.</p><p>  As regards FEMPI, the legislation originally planned for April, was delayed due to delays in achieving agreement on the Haddington Road agreement.  In July, I announced reductions in fees payable to GPs, pharmacists, ophthalmologists and psychiatrists which will save &euro;70 million in a full year.  However, although there will be a shortfall of some &euro;37 million in 2013, the balance will come through in 2014.  The 2013 national service plan set a target of &euro;30 million savings from the local schemes, that is, savings related to the purchase and use of goods in local integrated service areas for supply to eligible persons.  However, the nature of expenditure and the low level of potentially discretionary aids and appliances have limited the potential for savings.</p></speech>

I suppose it is no surprise that we are where we are in terms of a Supplementary Estimate.  Any person who looked at the Estimate that was presented last year would have stated there and then that a Supplementary Estimate would be required.  As the year drifted on that became increasingly evident, even though there were stark denials from time to time and a certain amount of head-in-the-sand syndrome on the issue.</p><p>  Without taking up too much of the committee's time, because I have only five minutes for an opening statement, we are talking about a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;199 million.  However, when one looks down through the figures, they include, for example, an underspend in pension lump sum payments of &euro;82 million.  What is the reason that came about?  Is it for administrative reasons or is it due to an intentional delay?  How was there an underspend in lump sum payments of &euro;82 million in view of the fact that it would have been a fairly straightforward calculation to work out the pension lump sum payments to made?</p><p>  The other issue is the underspend on capital expenditure.  It is almost cited here as an achievement.  In view of the capital programme as outlined over the past number of years, this would suggest that there has been a decrease in capital projects, as opposed to savings, because of greater efficiencies and the reduction in cost of capital programmes.  I seek clarity on whether the saving is due to delayed projects rather than efficiencies in the building projects.</p><p>  The difficulty is that every year the Minister speaks about the HSE's outstanding achievements over the years.  In fact, half of his speech consists of this.  He mentioned the HSE's Health in Ireland: Key Trends report, the fact that mortality rates from circulatory system diseases and cancers have declined by 35% and 11%, respectively, since 2003, and the rapid increase in life expectancy.  There have been many other major accomplishments in health care in this country and the Minister has accepted that over some time.  The difficulty is that while we expect the HSE to be put out of its misery some time next year - it must be taken out and put down - the question that arises is how much cost has been involved in the internal restructuring of the HSE to provide for its eradication.  The Minister stated that it must be got rid of because it has been an eternal failure.  I note that in his last few speeches the Minister has become almost a hostage to the HSE.  He is beginning to praise it.  I wonder has some form of Stockholm syndrome developed between the Minister and the HSE.  What is the reasoning behind it?  Is the Minister merely being nice to the HSE before he puts it down?  It is a key issue, because the question that must be asked is-----</p></speech>

We never seem to get any definitive answers to that question.  Are there initial costs in terms of the Minister's restructuring programme?  I refer not to the roll-out of universal health insurance and all the other areas, but to the internal restructuring under which the HSE is being brought into the Department, with the Minister sitting at the top of the new organisation with full accountability to the D&aacute;il, as stated in the programme for Government.  The Minister never seems to be able to explain whether this will be cost-neutral, whether there will be a cost benefit or whether there has been a cost.

Some &euro;199 million is now sought to address deficits to bring the HSE to the end of this month.  Bearing in mind the Minister's opening remark that this is a considerable achievement given that the figure is less than 1.6% of the health sector budget for 2013, it is not a matter of congratulating anybody in these circumstances.  I have great sympathy for front-line staff and those entrusted with oversight and management across the HSE.  They most certainly have had a very difficult task.  I sympathise with the remark because the contraction in budgetary provision over recent years has made the task of the staff infinitely more difficult.  I will not be opposing the request, nor did I oppose the &euro;360 million sought this time last year to bring the HSE to the end of 2012.  The wonder is that the amount is not even more.  One cannot demonstrate on the balance sheet the real cost.  This is only in terms of euro and cent.  Despite the Minister's talk about demographic pressures, the prioritisation at all times of patient safety and challenging service delivery targets in respect of phenomena such as waiting times, and despite his natural focus on defending what he regards as his and his colleagues' achievements over 2013 and 2012, he ought to be equally aware that the position is far from what it ought to be.  An inordinate number of people are waiting to get onto a waiting list to be seen for the first time.  The number is in the tens of thousands, which is very distressing for people.  When people enter the system, the experience is generally good.  However, getting into the system is a huge part of the difficulty that is raised frequently with elected representatives.</p><p>  I, too, I am interested in the detail on the Supplementary Estimate calculation.  Deputy Kelleher referred to the pension lump sum payments.  There is under-expenditure of &euro;82 million.  I, too, question this.  With regard to the under-expenditure in the capital area, what capital works have not been undertaken?</p><p>  I would like the Minister to elaborate on the services deficit of &euro;111 million.  The figure pertaining to the primary care reimbursement schemes is &euro;104 million, yet, in the course of the Minister's contribution, he spoke of savings having been made.  An additional &euro;104 million is required to bring the schemes to the end of this month.  An explanation on this is required.</p><p>  Regarding the new integrated financial management system that the Minister referred to in his introductory remarks, and his reference to changing the financial management system, there is relevant legislation to be considered, the Health Service Executive (financial matters) Bill, which has not yet been published.  I questioned the Taoiseach on this yesterday.  It is to disestablish the HSE Vote and establish a statutory financial governance framework for the HSE.  Can the Minister elaborate on that?  What will be the impact of the presentation of that legislation and its processing in regard to the democratic engagement at this committee?  With regard to disestablishment of the HSE Vote, we are dealing with the HSE Vote now in supplementary terms.  Will the Minister advise us on the intent of the legislation and its impact on the process in which we are currently engaged?</p><p>  On the deferral of the introduction of the charge for private patients using public beds, which is coming into effect as of 1 January, the targeted savings amounting to &euro;60 million in 2013 were not realised.  What is the savings target to be realised in 2014?  I recall a figure of &euro;30 million having been mentioned.  Can the Minister clarify what is expected to be realised?  Why would he put the brake on that?  I can understand the impact on the private health insurance sector but no mistake should be made in acknowledging that if the commitment exists to move and motor this process, the slow-down is not excusable.  It needs to be grappled with as part of the move towards universal entitlement to health care on the basis of need, and need alone.</p><p>  The Minister talks about the Haddington Road agreement and the main drivers of savings under the agreement, as he sees it.  He refers to the commitment of additional hours by staff that will lead to a reduction in overtime and agency staff.  Can the Minister indicate what reductions in agency staff have been achieved in the course of 2013?  What prospect is there for any genuine reduction in agency staff - primarily nursing staff but also administrative staff - when the Minister continues to operate under the embargo placed on recruitment?  Will this matter be addressed in 2014, and will we see a move from agency staff to properly employed, full-time, permanent and pensionable nursing staff and other operators within the health services?</p></speech>

This year, it amounts to &euro;199 million.  This immediately raises the question as to the adequacy of the initial budgets, whether these budgets were deliberately understated and whether the service was deliberately under-funded.  Although we cannot speak about next year, we have very serious concerns about the 2014 budget.</p></speech>

Is this another case of money going into a black hole?  What is happening in terms of where budgets are being allocated?  Community beds were closed in a community hospital because of legal bills in child care services.  That is how these child care costs are reflected in people's lives.  It is a reflection of how this pans out for us as public representatives and for constituents.</p><p>  Long before the Minister&rsquo;s tenure, there was a difficulty in the Department of Health and the HSE with moneys going awry, being sucked into acute centres and away from community-based services.  How well has the integrated financial system come along?  How are we ensuring that moneys allocated to mental health or child care services are spent on them?  Has the Minister had any discussions with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs or the Minister for Justice and Equality on legal costs?  I understand the legal services Bill has still not been published.  Fifteen million euro is quite a substantial amount of money.</p><p>  Last year, due to the failure of consultants to complete forms for health insurance companies, there was more than &euro;14 million outstanding for the HSE.  How much of this money has been collected?  We were told that those who failed to complete the forms would have their names published on a departmental website.  Has that been done?</p></speech>

The Minister said the Department would be publishing the Health in Ireland: Key Trends report next week, which will provide an overview of health status and health services over the past ten years.  He said it showed a real improvement in mortality and increased life expectancy.  Better health care has increased life expectancy by four years since 2006, ahead of the EU average.  Cancer rates are down 11% and diseases are down 35%.  One cannot put a price on this and I congratulate the Minister on it.</p><p>  He stated that an additional 20,000 people had been added to the number of those over 65.  How much will this cost in next year&rsquo;s budget?</p></speech>

Was there an error in calculating the amount of funding the Haddington Road agreement would bring in which resulted in this shortfall?</p><p>  I have had representations from some pharmacists about the cost of registering with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  It comes to &euro;2,250, while in Britain and Northern Ireland it is only &euro;200.  It was put to me that this is adding to the cost of medicines.  Can this be reduced?  I understand the society has &euro;11 million in reserve.  What is the purpose of this reserve and can it be used to fund aspects of the HSE?</p><p>  With regard to the PCRS and the &euro;104 million, the Minister produced the list of primary care centres some time ago.  Some worked out okay but others did not.  Is there any plan to revisit that list?</p><p>  Maybe I am missing something, but when I look at the various subheads, it is &euro;11 million for each area.</p></speech>

Mr. Tom Byrne will be very happy to address that.  The underspend in capital was also mentioned by Deputy Kelleher and Ms Bairbre Ni Aonghusa will address that.  Can I take the opportunity to thank both the members of the Department and the HSE for being here?</p><p>  The issue of longevity was raised by a number of people.  I would be the first person to put my hand up and say that is not all down to health.  They say about 50% of that is down to social conditions - living conditions.  Nonetheless, health has a very large influence on it.  </p><p>  We were talking about praising the HSE.  I am praising the people who work at the top of it who have brought in new financial reforms, put in a reformed board and got much greater control and command over the finances, which is something we did not have in the past to the extent that we should have.  This issue has been raised by a number of people in terms of being able to follow money and where it goes.  </p><p>  The Deputy asked about the costs involved in restructuring.  I believe it is saving rather than costing money.  Of course, there is always some initial cost.  The Deputy also mentioned the effect of the Supplementary Estimate on next year.  The Supplementary Estimate cannot be carried to the next year so moneys and debts that crystallise during this year are dealt with this year.  If any money is left over, we would have to hand it back to the Exchequer.  In respect of the key retirements at specialist grades and the fact that we must look abroad for key specialist grades of nursing, that is not down to any directive from us <i>per se</i> but rather a public service agreement that allowed people a grace period to February to go if they felt it was more beneficial to them.  We had no hand in it and could not direct who could stay or go.  It was down to the individual's choice.  In respect of the incentivised career break scheme, it is very much in our gift to decide who goes and who stays and that is why out of the 2,700 who applied, so few have been let go because they were front-line staff who were key to our service delivery requirements and we could not let them go.  </p><p>  I believe this Supplementary Estimate, which is less than last year's Supplementary Estimate despite the hugely challenging year we have had, compares very favourably with the last Supplementary Estimate of the previous Administration, which was &euro;595 million.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the health service being far from what it must be.  We all accept that it is far from what it must be and we aspire to make it a much better and fairer service.  However, I would like to put on the record of this committee that it is far from what it used to be.  It is an awful lot better.  It was only January two years ago when we had 569 people on trolleys.  Since we came into Government, we have seen a reduction of 34% in the number of people who must endure long trolley waits.  I will return to that issue.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke about the savings relating to the charge for private patients using public beds.  It is &euro;30 million.  That is what we hope to realise next year with the new charge regime.  I have very strong feelings on this and have it made very clear to the VHI and other insurers that they have not done anything remotely like what they should be doing in terms of controlling private health care costs in this country.  The audit was very weak in respect of ensuring that things that were charged for were actually done.  There was no clinical audit, which still astonishes me.  In other words, there was nobody to challenge the doctor as to when the tests were done in the first place.  There is no point in sending a surgeon to challenge a cardiologist.  You need a cardiologist to challenge a cardiologist.  In respect of benchmarking, the question arises as to why we are still paying several hundred euro for procedures that used to take two hours but now only take 20 minutes.  Benchmarking and auditing in the private hospital sector are issues.  </p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned savings relating to agency staff.  I will ask Mr. Byrne to address that. Deputy Healy spoke about the budget being deliberately under-funded.  This is absolutely not the case but one must understand that health is unique in this regard.  It is demand-led and unpredictable.  An area like social protection gets the benefit straight away if there is a drop in unemployment but that is not the case in health.  We have an ageing population and it is great that we are all living longer but as we live longer, our demands on the health service increase.  Consequently, we have seen an increase in activity in the region of something like 2% this year.  We sought &euro;190 million for a 1% increase and got &euro;90 million.  It turns out to be 2%.  We are not in the position that we can decline to give service to people who are acutely ill.  People who turn up have to be treated and treated quickly and we are seeking to improve that from the point of view of the initiatives we took around the waiting times.  In the first year, over 95% of people were treated within the year.  Last year, over 95% of people were treated within nine months.  This year, we aim to do it in eight months.  On top of that, one must note the astonishing fact that no previous Government ever bothered to count the outpatient waiting list or quantify what it was.  We have done that.  It was 386,000.  As I said before, the real disgrace is not that number but the fact that so many people waited longer than four years.  We have already seen a 75% reduction in that since March 2013 and that has declined further since I received the latest figures although I do not have them.  We want everyone seen or treated within a year having been referred by their GP.  That is an enormous challenge given the constraints we face with a 20% reduction in budget and a 10% reduction in staff yet the men and women of our health service have not just maintained a safe service, they have made it better, as I have outlined.  I want to put on record my gratitude and thanks to them for the hard work and the great work they do on a daily basis.  What we are trying to do is create a system that allows them to do that rather than frustrating them in trying to do that.  </p><p>  Deputy Healy also spoke about how you cannot maintain a service having taken &euro;3 billion out of it.  I think we have proved that you can and can improve as well.  As for taking any more out-----</p></speech>

In the last couple of months we have seen a number of high profile cases in which people were pushed along because the HSE was reluctant to agree a settlement.  This practice costs a huge amount of money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013121200008#G00300"><p>That practice can be considered more historical but the outcomes are only now being realised.  Families should not have to endure that sort of process to get the services they need for their children.  The State Claims Agency has taken over many of the cases, which is possibly why we are seeing settlements.  Furthermore, the legislation has yet to come through on periodic payments, which would make judges feel comfortable about making that type of award.  It is not appropriate that a sum of several million euro is awarded straight away when the needs of the person concerned may evolve over a period of time.  The principle of periodic payments will address both the initial needs and make funds available for the future.</p><p>  Mr. Tom Byrne will deal with the issue of private health insurance forms.  He has done a considerable amount of work on the issue of consultants not signing forms.  I do not think the problem is nearly as big as it used to be.  The bigger problem now is getting the insurers to pay on time.  They are delaying.</p><p>  Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick asked about the costs associated with an aging population.  Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa and Mr. Tom Byrne would like to address that issue.  Mr. Tom Byrne can also deal with Deputy Timmins's question on the Haddington Road agreement.  In regard to pharmacy registration costs and the reserve of &euro;11 million, I am unaware of the issue and will have to find out more about it.  However, I advise the Deputy that Denmark, with a population of 5.6 million, has 350 pharmacy outlets.  Ireland, with a population of 4.6 million, has 1,750 pharmacy outlets.  An investigation is needed into margins, etc.</p><p>  In regard to the PCRS and primary care centres, I am happy to report that since the Government took office we have opened an average of one new primary care centre per month.  We are exploring more ways of doing this, including PPPs, direct bills and leasing arrangements.  The need to get the GPs on board is a limiting factor because there is no point investing in an expensive building if they are going to sit outside and ask us how much we are going to pay them to enter it.  We need to address all those areas.  The negotiation of a new GP contract early next year will expedite this process and give more certainty to GPs who are concerned that there has not been clear engagement to date.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, and I are committed to engaging on this in the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>  In regard to Deputy Neville's comments on mental health, I assure him that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is a strong voice for ensuring the moneys are spent in the right areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1259" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Byrne" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013121200008#G00400"><p>In regard to the figure of &euro;82 million for pensions, under the employment control framework the HSE estimated that 3,500 people were going to retire over the year.  Unfortunately, this did not happen.  The number of retirements fell to fewer than 100 per month and, as those who retired had shorter periods of service, it was not necessary to spend the amount provided.  Similarly, as no notice period is required for retirement it becomes difficult to estimate when people will decide to retire.  People can retire on pre-Haddington Road agreement rates until August 2014.  The remaining funds allocated for pensions may be requested to be written back because people were not retiring.</p><p>  In regard to the Haddington Road agreement and the decrease in agency payments, I do not have the exact figure but the monthly reviews of accounts indicate a decrease in agency hours.  On foot of discussions with our colleagues in the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, we have established a team comprising front line people under my colleague, Mr. Colum Maddox, who are experts in hospitals and rostering, along with a representative from the human resources department and each of the service areas.  The team's sole function over the next several months will be to visit hospitals to review individual rosters to ensure we are getting the maximum from Haddington Road in a safe and secure manner.</p><p>  With regard to the question on integrated financial services, I commenced this role six months ago.  I brought in people with experience in this area and we are currently commencing the roll-out of the programme.  Over the next 12 weeks we will be preparing our business case for submission.  We intend to reduce the number of direct reporters in finance to a core team in order to deliver on our aims.  We have 12 weeks to prepare an integrated plan which will incorporate the new role of CFO across the HSE.</p><p>  With regard to the sensible question on debt collection and debt at risk, this is something I took on personally several months ago.  As the Minister indicated, there has been a substantial fall-off.  I began by specifically examining at risk income.  At that stage income at risk with two of the health care providers amounted to &euro;6 million.  That figure is now down to &euro;3,000 because we visited the hospitals and set up an internal team to address the issue.  As the Minister noted, however, while the proportion of claims awaiting consultant action dropped from 36% to 29% by August 2013, and continues to drop because we are having the required impact internally in the HSE, the proportion of claims awaiting payment from insurers has increased from 33% to 37% and claims pending have increased from 18% to 21%.  The reasons for this increase relate to issues that have arisen with health care providers.  The HSE does not have a service level agreement with private insurers because they deal directly with clients.  Hospitals have identified significant problems in that they do not have a direct point of contact with insurance companies.</p></speech>

Legally we cannot do that.  There was some unfortunate correspondence that I have visited hospitals and have had surgeons on arrival sign off claims for &euro;500,000.  Those at-risk claims have been dealt with and we have a very good relationship developed with our surgeons.  We must take this in the context of the fact that a surgeon has a job to do.  The surgeon responsible for a patient must sign off on everything for that claim, be it endoscopes or wards.  That is being addressed.  The issue is more about getting back the money due and having claims sent back for minor points.  At August 2013, debtor days have increased from 46 to 60 days for claims awaiting payment and from 26 days to 34 days for pended claims.  Claims awaiting consultant and other actions have dropped by &euro;10 million.</p></speech>

The issues that arose regarding the disability sector where we had to issue that were taken back on a time-related basis while we do the review.  It is still being held centrally.  It was not a case of an error but that we were demanded to issue &euro;150 million by the Haddington Road agreement.  It was not appropriate at the time and we did the right thing by taking back &euro;50 million to make it more fair.  They were all withdrawn from the areas at that time.</p></speech>

These include the children's hospital, the Central Mental Hospital, the move of the National Maternity Hospital to St. Vincent's and the national plan for radiation oncology.  For various reasons those big projects have not proceeded as quickly as expected and that gives rise to the money not being spent.</p><p>  The procurement of design teams and contractors is taking longer than it used to because of the particular challenges in the industry at the time.  For example in one capital project in the Department's Vote a number of companies went into liquidation and the contracts had to be re-tendered.  Those are the challenges we face.  When it became clear during the year that we would have a surplus the HSE has tendered for minor capital works and equipment which could be realistically completed by year end and we did a big push for an equipment replacement programme and a flexible scope replacement programme and expenditure in October and November was increased significantly.  Despite that we had a surplus.  It will not continue in other years because these large projects are expected to use up all the capital programme funding in future years.</p></speech>

We have a difficulty where there are organisations, such as COPE Foundation and St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, which provide care and services to persons in the community and which at the same time are obligated to honour all the wage agreements, for which there is no provision ever made in terms of funding from the HSE through the Department for such wage increases.  All that ever happens is the wage increase is taken from the services side.  Every time a wage increase comes about, rather than the HSE making funding provision for it, the organisations are asked to absorb that wage increase through service cuts.  That is effectively what is happening.  I assume that the HSE is aware of that as well.  I wonder is there some way of addressing this issue in future Estimates where, if there is a national pay agreement, it would not be at the expense of service and there should be some other way of addressing that issue.</p></speech>

There have not been any wage increases in the recent past of which I am aware.  In fact, it is quite the reverse.  It is that the Haddington Road agreement savings, which relate to pay, must be applied across all sections.  In fact, it is reductions in pay, not the reverse, that is the direction of travel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/989" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013121200010#J02700"><p>Perhaps Deputy Kelleher's point was that COPE Foundation, for example, has in its service level agreement taken a reduction and yet the issue of pay, that proportion of the funding allocated, cannot be touched because the Haddington Road agreement protected certain funding.  My argument to the Minister has always been that organisations, such as COPE Foundation, which have lived by the service level agreement, should not be penalised in the way others who go over their budgets are.  There is funding allocated for staffing only that comes in the lump sum these organisations get that cannot be touched, yet at the same time there is an element of the funding that is touched which has implications for the delivery of services.  I fully agree with the Minister in terms of shared services and reducing the cost of services, but in my opinion, many organisations, such as COPE Foundation, which are compliant and which work within the system, are being unfairly penalised.  Perhaps that is the point Deputy Kelleher is trying to make.</p></speech>

Will the Minister revisit arrangements in regard to special top-ups for a CEO in a group of hospitals under the HSE in the west region?  Will the same spirit of pursuit in relation to top-up payments in the context of HSE employees be adopted in that case as is being sought in section 38 entities?</p></speech>

That is the reality of the situation.</p><p>  In answer to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, everyone will be treated the same way.  I made it clear, yesterday and at the outset of this.  For the record, it is important to say that I initiated this investigation, through the then chair of the HSE who also happened to be the Secretary General, Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, arising from issues in the HIQA report on Tallaght Hospital.  They followed due process and they continue to do so.</p></speech>

Under that subhead, members of the committee are very concerned and disappointed about what happened regarding the section 38 and 39 agencies, about which we have spoken already.  In my view the positions of the board members of the Central Remedial Clinical, based on yesterday's proceedings and the remarks made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, and by Deputy Kelleher previously, are untenable.  I hope the Minister and the HSE will take action.  I have made the point here and on the national airwaves that the service level agreement, which is not part of what we are considering today, should be used to make sure that they are complaint.  That does not mean cutting the service but making sure that the organisation is accountable for the consequences of what it is doing.</p></speech>

We will use all available powers to us to ensure that the pubic pay policy is adhered to.  One of the avenues open to us is the service level agreement but I want to make sure this is done in a way that affects those who are in breach and not those whom they are supposed to served.  I do not want patients or clients of any of these institutions or bodies affected in any way negatively as a consequence of behaviours of others because this is not their fault and they have no implication in it.  It is the people at the top who need to sort it out and be sorted out in respect of the manner in which the arrangements that were in place under the previous administration have panned out.  I take this opportunity to again appeal to people at this time of the year not to allow what is currently before us at this committee and before the Committee of Public Accounts to impede them in respect of their normal sense of charity and justice towards those who are less fortunate than themselves.</p></speech>

I have expressed that sentiment on a number of occasions in media interviews.  It is hugely important and we need to take on board concerns expressed by a number of charitable organisations, including by a spokesperson for Bothar on the national airwaves during the week, which indicates the extent of the problem at this point in time.</p><p>  Regarding the engagement at the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday, the situation exposed by Mr. Kiely, formerly the chief executive officer of the Central Remedial Clinic, and an arrangement with the Mater Hospital in regard to a payment to facilitate pension arrangements, is the Minister in a position to comment on the transfer of funds of the order of &euro;660,000 per annum from the Central Remedial Clinic to the Mater Hospital to facilitate an arrangement?  I understand that a contradictory position is taken by the Mater Hospital in today's media but I am not privy to the facts and full truth of this.

How is it expected that the PCRS  will function in 2014 in ever more straitened economic circumstances than has been the case in 2013, yet an additional &euro;104 million is to be provided to get it across the board?  I am aware it is not only in regard to the medical card area but it also covers the cost of drugs etc.</p></speech>

It is an impossible task.  What is being expected of them is untenable and even from the last time when we engaged in discussion on the impact of the change in attitude towards discretionary medical cards, from my experience there is growing evidence of people who are in very serious circumstances whose medical cards are not being renewed.  It is a very serious matter for these people.  Not only are they trying to cope with very difficult health challenges but they now have that situation compounded by the loss of the certainty and support their medical card gave them on a daily basis.</p></speech>

The difficulty I have with this is that we seem to be of the view that discretionary medical cards are being reduced even though that is stringently denied by the Minister, the HSE, the Department and everybody else on that side, but from our interpretation of everything that is being said to us by our constituents, debates in the D&aacute;il and replies to parliamentary questions by the Department and the HSE, there is no doubt in my mind, and that of many organisations that advocate for people with long-term illnesses and disabilities, that there is a reduction in the number of discretionary medical cards being granted.  I would safely say there is an aggressive campaign by the HSE to rein in the number of discretionary medical cards being granted and I am concerned about that.</p><p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out, a proposal in the budget for 2014 outlines a probity charge or savings of &euro;113 million.  I am beginning to wonder does anybody know what is happening any more in terms of medical cards, particularly discretionary medical cards.  The continued denials by the HSE, the Minister and the Department versus what I would say everybody in this committee views to be the contrary in terms of an aggressive approach to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards leads me to believe that this particular figure was targeted.  It was clear from early on that with the increase in the number of people qualifying because of income eligibility, there was going to be an overspend but, on top of that, the Minister reined in quite aggressively the overspend by targeting discretionary medical card holders.  That is clear when one notes this figure.</p></speech>

The bottom line here is very clear.  There has not been any targeting of discretionary medical cards; a probity exercise has been ongoing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-12a.1388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013121200012#L00300"><p>There is compassion in the system, which is why I asked for a panel of doctors to be put in to help in the area.  They go to great lengths to ensure that people get a medical card but it does not always work out that way.  We have had people with very serious illnesses, and as Deputy Kelleher noted, on a compassionate basis one might say they should get a medical card, but their income could be a couple of thousand euro per week.  We must bear that in mind when there are other people out there who do not have a medical card and whose income is only a couple of hundred euro per week.  That is the difficulty.</p><p>  The initial goal was to give all those people with specific conditions on the long-term illness card a medical card but the technicalities around trying to achieve that were proving so onerous, it would have taken a couple of years to complete the task, and this was only a temporary phase on the way to free GP care.  We would have needed panels of doctors to verify conditions and continuously required monitoring to see if people's positions had changed.  It seemed to be such an onerous administrative nightmare that it seemed easier to progress the matter through age cohorts.</p><p>  We are still fully committed to free GP care in the Government and it remains our ambition.  I hope the position of the country will improve in the next couple of years, making that possible.  There is no campaign in the HSE to go after people with discretionary medical cards.  I have issued an instruction that there should not be, and the Minister of State, Deputy White, is very much in the same space as me.  There will always be hard cases and examples where on the surface one might want to issue a medical card.  Either we run the system on a transparent set of rules - which was not the case in the past - or we do not.  In that case, people in much less difficult circumstances in one part of the country will get medical cards but in other areas, people in much more grave difficulty will not get a card.  That would be unfair.</p></speech>

The shortfall is in the region of &euro;70 million, of which &euro;41 million came from delayed implementation of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act.  Another &euro;30 million comes from the shortfall in local schemes delivery, which are mainly demand-driven.  There is a low level of discretion with regard to aids and appliances issued across the system.  In his opening address the Minister covered the actions we are taking to address the matter.</p></speech>

We do not want to rewrite history but a Supplementary Estimate for health without a change in policy is new, and the HSE did not have Supplementary Estimates for a long number of years.  There may have been Supplementary Estimates because of a change in policy but the figures debated in these Chambers for many years were outlined as fact.  For people to come in to rewrite history in order to make this better does not mean it is fact.  There are people sitting next to the Minister who could verify that fact but because of political reasons, they are unable to do so.</p><p>  Every year there are Supplementary Estimates for health in December.  That has happened for the past two years and we will have one again next year no doubt.  It is a recurring theme.  We cannot continuously pass an Estimate in the budget knowing in our heart and soul - with all the statistics and data in front of us confirming it - that there will be a Supplementary Estimate next year.  The Government should be up-front and honest at the start of the year as opposed to being disingenuous and cute at the end of the year.  For example, we know the &euro;113 million in the probity cannot be realised and there are many other aspects of the Estimate for next year that we are taking on a wing and prayer.  In good times or bad, the Estimate should be based on fact as opposed to a novel of fiction, which is what we will face again next year.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to disestablish the HSE Vote.  I want to know if the Minister is in a position to tell us when the Bill will be introduced and if it will do away with this democratic engagement.  It is stated that the Bill will establish a statutory financial governance framework for the HSE.  As members of the committee and democratically elected voices, we are anxious to know about these matters.  If the Minister is not in a position to give us the detail here, perhaps he would be good enough to furnish us with a briefing note that could be shared at this point, given that the heads of the Bill have not been published and we have no further insight into it.  I am concerned that the intent is to do away with the HSE Vote, which would undermine our democratic responsibility of oversight and scrutiny.</p></speech>

I asked for figures on agency costs for non-consultant hospital doctors and nurses.  I know the Minister does not have the figures with him but I ask him to send them on.</p></speech>

I hope I will get those figures.  I have been told that the agency cost of non-consultant hospital doctors in particular is significant.  The Minister tells a good story about medical cards.  Unfortunately, I do not believe him because what he has said conflicts with what I see on a daily basis in my clinics around Tipperary and what I am told by other Deputies on what they hear in their clinics around the country.  In one case a child with hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy and epilepsy, who is wheelchair bound, was refused a medical card.  I also seek clarification on how the medical assessment is done by the PCRS.  I am aware of two cases where the applications have been with doctors since 7 October and have not been finalised.  I heard what the Minister said but, unfortunately, I do not believe him.  I am certain there has been a policy change on discretionary medical cards on medical grounds.</p></speech>

Perhaps he would like to tell the committee what policy change took place in 2010 when the Supplementary Estimate of a Minister of a Government of which he was also a Minister was &euro;595 million.</p></speech>

To take things in isolation does not allow the context.  Health spending quadrupled from 1997 to 2010 and still in 2002 there was a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;210 million, in 2003 it was &euro;62 million, in 2006 it was &euro;240 million, in 2008 it was &euro;345 million, in 2009 it was &euro;254 million and a whopper in 2010 of &euro;595 million.  In January 2011, despite a quadrupling of health spending and the voting of massive Supplementary Estimates, we still ended up with 569 people on trolleys on a given day.  That is noteworthy.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was concerned about the new Act and whether it would mean that we would have less transparency.  In fact, we will have even more transparency because both the Secretary General as the Vote holder and the director general of the replacement agency will still be in before the committee to face questions.  There will be no diminution of accountability.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also referred to the cost of drugs and wanting the lowest price.  Such matters have to be decided by way of negotiation.  We did seek to go for the lowest price but as we could not get agreement through negotiation we went for the median.  We have still reduced the cost of drugs this year by &euro;120 million, which is a considerable amount of money.  We need to do more.  The serious cross-border threats directive will allow us to join with much bigger countries such as the UK, Germany and France to purchase vaccines in particular and that will reduce costs even further.  I will push the notion in Europe that the directive should extend to drugs in a more general sense.  We have a problem in that if we go too low even the drug companies that produce drugs in this country will release so much for our market and wholesalers will snap them up and sell them in other countries where they can make a profit.  There is a balance to be struck.</p><p>  This has been an extremely busy year.  We launched Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015.  In May we had two reports - on the establishment of hospital groups as a transition to independent hospital trusts and on securing the future of small hospitals.  They were both published and we now have the chairperson of each group in place and the advertisements are in the newspapers for the new CEOs of the groups.  We launched the Healthy Ireland policy initiative on health and well-being.  That was published in March and is now being implemented.  That is a critical point for me.  As Minister for Health and as a doctor I believe we must to stop paying lip service to prevention and pay for it.  That applies to tobacco in particular.  I am very pleased that the committee was able to start the hearings on the heads of the standard packaging Bill.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act came into operation on 25 July, which abolished the board of the HSE and provided for a directorate which is now in place.  The work on the national children&rsquo;s hospital is progressing.  The two boards are in place.  Timelines are being put in place and we look forward to expediting that.  Only last week St. James&rsquo;s Hospital secured planning permission in an eight-week period for a seven-storey building to help with the decant of existing services off the site to make more room for the hospital.  The draft paper on universal health insurance, UHI, which I know Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has been anxious about, has been presented to me.  We are studying that.  We hope to expedite it and, if possible, to get it published before Christmas.</p><p>  Shadow funding for selected hospitals under the "money follows the patient" policy is in full progress.  That will be implemented on a phased basis from 1 January 2014.  All that progress was made while hosting an extremely successful European Presidency where we got the directive on tobacco through against the odds, as many people saw it.  We have engaged in significant cross-Border initiatives with the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Poots, on alcohol, tobacco, paediatric cardiac care and a range of other initiatives.  We made a major contribution to the Haddington Road agreement, and successfully concluded negotiations with consultants which now reduces their starting pay by one third, allows for the appointment of directors of clinical care and allows consultants to work any five days out of seven, which is making a big impact on services.</p><p>  The health reform board, a programme management office in the Department and a systems reform group in the HSE have all been established.  We have a communications strategy.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill was enacted by the Houses.  A national positive ageing strategy was published in April and is now being implemented.  A review of the emergency aeronautical support service pilot project has been completed and found that significant reduced transport times for seriously ill patients were achieved and made a recommendation that it would be continued.</p><p>  The finance reform board is in place and the chief financial officer, who is present, has been appointed.  A new financial and cost management system has been identified and is being costed.  We will introduce free GP care next year.  The special delivery unit, SDU, work continues.  The e-health strategy was approved by Government in October and will be shortly launched and implemented.</p> <p> The publication of the Health Identifiers Bill, as agreed by the Government, will take place tomorrow.  All of us, including committee members, did considerable work on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  It was another achievement during the year.  The public health (sunbeds) Bill has now been stamped by the Attorney General and will be published either this side of the new year or early in the new year.  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, to St. Vincent's campus in Elm Park was announced in May and, as members know, the report of the tobacco policy review group, Tobacco Free Ireland, was published and launched in October.  These are only some of the developments during the year, which has been extremely busy.</p><p> I thank the members for all their assistance.  They hold us to account and we expect to be held to account.  I thank the Department and HSE representatives for attending today.  I thank them and all the officials for their courtesy.  I wish everyone present and all the staff in the health service and Department a happy Christmas.</p></speech>
