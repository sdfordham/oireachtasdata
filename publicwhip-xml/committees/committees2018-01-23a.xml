    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara McCarthy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#C00300"><p>When we received our invitation from the Oireachtas joint committee, we were asked to cover the topics of Origin Green, climate change and sustainability and market diversification, as well as our key programmes.  We have structured our document to reflect that request and will be delighted to answer further questions members may have.</p> <p>  In 2012 Bord Bia developed and launched Origin Green, Ireland's national sustainability programme for the food and drink industry.  The programme was developed in response to international market research which had been commissioned by Bord Bia that confirmed the positive perception internationally of Ireland as a green and natural food producing country.</p><p>However, the market research also showed that, in future, ongoing proof of our sustainability credentials would be required.  Origin Green is the programme to provide such proof.  </p><p> The Origin Green programme is a voluntary programme that operates across the food chain, from farmers to food manufacturing companies to retailers and food service businesses.  Farmers are members of Origin Green by being certified members of Bord Bia&rsquo;s sustainable farm assurance schemes.  The two largest schemes, the sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme and the sustainable dairy assurance scheme, have 51,507 and 15,913 members respectively.  This represents over 90% of all beef produced and 90% of dairy farmers.  All farms are audited at 18 month intervals and must meet all of the requirements of the schemes before they can be certified.  Additional sustainability data is also collected at audit that enables the carbon footprint of each farm to be calculated.  To date, over 170,000 carbon footprint assessments have been completed.  Feedback reports to farmers highlight where improvements can be made.  All of Bord Bia&rsquo;s sustainability assurance schemes are independently accredited to the European standard for product certification, ISO 17065.  The carbon footprint models have been developed in partnership with Teagasc and are also independently accredited by the Carbon Trust to the PAS 2050 standard.  Over 36,000 audits are conducted annually.  </p><p> At food manufacturing level, producers become members of Origin Green by signing up to the Origin Green sustainability charter and developing a multi-annual sustainability plan for their business which must include setting and achieving targets under three key areas: raw material sourcing; manufacturing processes; and social sustainability.  Achieving the sustainability targets helps to reduce a company&rsquo;s environmental impact, makes the daily running of its operations more efficient and positively contributes to its impact on society and the local community.  In order to become a verified member of Origin Green, food and drink manufacturers must undergo a rigorous initial audit process with plans that are verified independently by the SGS Group, a world leading auditing body.  Thereafter, each annual progress report is verified by SGS, to ensure that timelines and targets, committed to in the plan, are being met.  There are currently 282 verified members of the Origin Green programme which represents over 90% of all of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports.  Approximately another 300 companies have registered an interest in the programme or are in the process of formulating plans and setting targets.  </p><p> Membership of Origin Green was extended, on a pilot basis, to the retail and food service sector in 2016.  Participation for these companies is, in a similar way to the food manufacturers, through the development and delivery of ambitious targets as part of a five-year plan.  To date, two retailers and four food service businesses have become verified members.  The first years of Origin Green have been very successful as outlined above.  In addition Origin Green has become firmly established as the brand for Irish food and drink internationally and is now used on all branding of Ireland&rsquo;s stands at international food and drink trade events.  Bord Bia and Irish companies will attend 24 this year.  Bord Bia will continue to evolve the Origin Green programme.  We are currently reviewing the first five years and developing a strategy for the next five.  International market insight will again play an important role in informing the strategy.  This market research is currently under way.  </p><p> Climate change is one of the major challenges of our generation.  There is scientific consensus that climate change is happening and that it is largely caused by human activity.  Over the past 250 years the burning of fossil fuels, land use change and agriculture has contributed to altered global average temperatures by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, CO2, methane, CH4, and nitrous oxide, N2O.   With the global population projected to increase by more than 2.4 billion people by 2050, the world will need to produce up to twice as much food from increasingly limited resources in uncertain climatic conditions.  This is leading to long-term fears over the security of food supplies in many parts of the world.  </p><p> Sustained pressure on the world&rsquo;s already strained resources is also being exacerbated by the ongoing challenges presented by climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  In order to meet these challenges, it will require everyone involved in the agrifood industry to produce more from less and decrease the environmental impact of production, which necessitates the adoption of more sustainable practices.  The FoodWise 2025 strategy of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, while setting ambitious targets for the growth of the agrifood sector, acknowledges the importance of balancing production with environmental management and protection.  It identifies over 70 actions to achieve agricultural sustainability.  Collaboration and co-operation from all stakeholders in the industry will be required to achieve this ambition.  </p><p> The Irish food and drink industry has shown an impressive ability to diversify its exports over recent years with almost half of the growth in the value of food and drink shipments since 2010 coming from markets outside of Europe.  Some notable achievements over the period include a six-fold increase in exports to China and more than a doubling to the rest of Asia and North America.  The industry now exports to 180 markets annually.  Reflecting the further growth ambitions of the sector and the uncertain backdrop created by Brexit, Bord Bia has adopted a data-driven approach to help identify potential opportunities for further growth in new and existing markets.  This is being led by a market prioritisation study that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine commissioned Bord Bia to undertake in mid-2017.  The study undertakes a detailed assessment of potential growth markets for meat, dairy, prepared consumer foods, beverages and seafood and selects 15 priority markets for further examination.  </p><p> The findings of this work will help Bord Bia and our client companies make decisions on where we invest our resources with a view to delivering the best return for all involved in the sector.  The findings will drive the on-the-ground activities of Bord Bia&rsquo;s international network of 13 offices which work directly with client companies to build market understanding and facilitate business development opportunities.  Our upcoming marketplace event in April will attract 550 to 600 international buyers to Ireland to engage with up to 200 Irish food and drink companies.  It aims to identify potential business opportunities and position Ireland as a source of high quality, sustainably produced food and drink products.  More than half of the international buyers will come from emerging markets outside of Europe.  </p><p> The need for the food and drink industry to attract and develop the right talent is critical to its future success, particularly as market demand and consumer needs continue to evolve rapidly.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s industry talent programme currently involves over 100 participants taking part in five key programmes that focus on core areas such as sustainability, marketing and sales and supply chain.  The success of the programmes to date are highlighted by a few key figures: over 80% of participants are being retained in the food and drink industry once they finish their programme; our market fellows work with 40 client companies across 13 export markets; and, in 2017, the expected value of sales attributable to the programme was almost &euro;60 million.  Our Origin Green ambassador programme has seen ambassadors placed in the sustainability teams of 35 of the world-leading food and drink organisations.  The strength of demand for our programmes is demonstrated by the fact that in 2017 our marketing fellowship and Origin Green ambassador programmes attracted 600 applicants for 30 places.  </p><p> Bord Bia launched two new programmes in 2017, namely the market placement and MSc in design innovation.  The market placement programme sees participants placed in the operations teams of leading retail and food service customers in export markets for a period of up to 15 months.  The MSc in design innovation, in conjunction with Maynooth University, involves ten participants undertaking a two year design-thinking led approach to insights and innovation.  Participants will be placed with Irish food and drink companies for a period of 20 months to help further embed design thinking into their insight and innovation teams.  </p><p> In conclusion, Bord Bia is currently planning and developing its next three-year strategy for the period 2019 to 2021.  This strategy will be based on extensive stakeholder consultation and will be positioned to support the further growth of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry.  Origin Green will continue to be a central pillar in delivery of this strategy.  In an increasingly competitive and demanding global marketplace, Ireland can continue to grow its exports through the provision of high quality, sustainably produced food and drink products.</p></speech>

Senator Mulherin, Senator Cahill and Deputy Penrose were the first to indicate questions, in that order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#D00300"><p>I am sure Ms McCarthy noted in November that the Citizens' Assembly delivered a damning indictment of Irish agriculture.  I think 89% called for a tax on greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.  Was Bord Bia invited to present at the Citizens' Assembly?  What is its view in relation to that particular proposition and, to me, the very negative view put on the efforts being made by farmers to address greenhouse gas emissions?</p> <p>  The other issue then is on the Origin Green side.  I understand that 60% of the feedstuffs fed to dairy cows, beef cattle, pigs and sheep is imported.  That is increasing year-on-year.  How confident is Bord Bia that this will not affect our food standards?</p><p>How can we stand over the quality of the foods we are bringing in when we are promoting our own for export?  We are promoting foods of a certain standard in the context of sustainability, etc.  Of particular concern is the fact that, in respect of the 9 million tonnes of feed consumed, most of the 6 million tonnes imported is made from genetically modified soya and maize.  Is that correct?  If that is the case, surely we need an increase in output from the tillage sector to counter this trend.  I understand that already in the German market there are demands that no food, including cheese, butter and beef, be tainted by genetically modified feed.  The food chain is already being examined there.  I would welcome Ms McCarthy's observations on the matter.</p><p> How does Ms McCarthy foresee the tillage sector growing in the future?  Representatives of the sector outlined the challenges and the committee drew up a report.  The sector is making a very positive contribution in the use of the environment as a carbon sink.  I would appreciate Ms McCarthy's response on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#E00200"><p>I thank Ms McCarthy for her excellent presentation.  Bord Bia is one of our standard bearers.  I had the privilege of being on its board for six years.  Its personnel do a very professional job.  It has always promoted the food and drinks industry excellently and done a lot to establish markets for our produce.  In that context, I refer to the reduction of our reliance on the UK market.  Today we talk about Brexit, but 15 or 20 years ago our reliance on the British market was reflected in a far higher percentage of exports.</p> <p>  Leaving that issue aside, I refer to the challenges presented by Brexit and Origin Green.  Bearing in mind the fact that a significant amount of the produce we process could soon come from a non-EU member state, what challenges does Ms McCarthy foresee in our promotion of Origin Green status?  There could soon be different standards applied in Northern Ireland and the Twenty-six Counties.  How does Ms McCarthy think this could impact on the good trademark we have developed in Origin Green?</p> <p>  We have increased Bord Bia's budget.  Supplementary amounts were allocated in the last two budgets.  If we are serious about reducing our dependence on the UK market and sourcing alternative markets through our offices around the world, what would be a sufficient budget for Bord Bia in the post-Brexit period?  There has been a lot of attention focused on the problems we have had in producing cheddar in the context of Brexit.  We would have the same problems in the beef sector if UK buyers were to turn to South American countries to source beef.  If Bord Bia was to mount a serious drive to divert 30% or 40% of the product exported to the UK market, what resources would be needed?</p> <p>  The Bord Bia quality mark has been a success story, although I have a few cribs about the scheme.  On a quality assured farm animals are produced to a certain standard, but only a certain percentage of the animals that leave the farm attract a premium.  A consumer can go into a McDonald's restaurant to buy a burger and see the quality mark, but the farmer who produced the beef does not receive a premium for producing it to that standard.  We have all bought into the need for quality assurance which retailers and consumers are demanding.  However, processors have been allowed to get away with it for too long.  I am not saying every animal produced should attract the same premium, but there should definitely be some premium paid on all animals leaving a quality assured farm.  The quality assurance scheme in place in the dairy sector is roughly a year and a half old.  The dairy sector is different from the beef sector in that a lorry will go to every dairy farm.  We will have 100% compliance within a short time.  </p> <p>  I would like to ask a question about the use of antibiotics in the dairy industry.  The vast majority of dairy farmers use them as a preventive measure.  How will this affect the level of quality assurance in the future?  Questions have been raised about the level of antibiotic resistance in humans.  Will this become a condition of the dairy quality assurance scheme?</p> <p>  When I was a member of the board of Bord Bia, I was always concerned about the lack of focus on live exports.  How much of the money spent in the beef sector goes towards developing live export markets?  How much money has been spent and how much does Bord Bia plan to spend?  An increasing amount of the stock is coming from the diary herd.  Live exports are of more importance to us than ever before. </p> <p>  I also have a question about the fifth quarter.  Thankfully, its value has increased dramatically, while Bord Bia has played its part in securing markets.  As farmers, we find it very hard to determine the value of the fifth quarter to the industry.  I would, therefore, like to see greater transparency on its value to processors. </p> <p>  I have two more questions.  We have had a discussion about putting a health warning on alcohol products, similar to the one attached to cigarette packets.  Bord Bia is trying to promote Irish whiskeys and beers in foreign markets.  What is its view on the putting of a health warning on drink products?</p> <p>  The last question I want to ask is related to products which are free of genetically modified organisms.  Is there a genuine demand for GMO-free products in the markets we supply?  If there is, is meeting that need a practical aspiration for us?  Will it create a problem?  I refer to the German market, in particular, as we have heard that there is such a demand in Germany.  Is it for what the consumer is asking?  If it is, are we in a position to fulfil that requirement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#E00300"><p>I thank Ms McCarthy and her colleagues for the presentation.  I have always been a very strong supporter of Bord Bia.  In a cost-benefit analysis it would stand up particularly well to external scrutiny.  As Ms McCarthy said, it has played a pivotal role in ensuring we now have more than 180 markets.  Are there others in the wider world, particularly Asia, which might present opportunities to diversify and Bord Bia could explore?  In the context of Brexit, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.  What resources does Ms McCarthy think will be required in that regard?  There is an international network of 13 offices which operate directly with client companies.  Are more resources needed to ensure Bord Bia can penetrate and open up other markets?  Even when the economy was on the ground, Bord Bia was not left behind because it was seen as integral to recovering lost and securing new markets.</p> <p>  Has there been any notable increase under the beef genomics scheme?  I know that it is a recent development, but has it had any impact on the quality of beef products coming onto the market, which is absolutely critical?  It is probably too early to say, but I hope it is having an impact because I am a very strong supporter of it.</p> <p>  Ms McCarthy is clearly concerned that the value of the UK market was undermined by third country imports.  In that context, an initiative could be facilitated by a future agreement negotiated by the United Kingdom.  Will she outline a view on the issue?</p><p>Would Bord Bia be in favour of an extended transition period to allow companies to bed in and meet demand in the market?  Coming from a midlands county in which the level of beef farming is significant, there has to be a concern about the significant decrease, a little over 6%, in cattle numbers nationally.  The figure has gone down from 917,000 to a little over 860,000, which is significant.  It is the seed stock of the industry and I am sure the delegates are examining the issue critically.  Even in County Westmeath, the figure is down by approximately 3%, while in County Longford it is down by approximately 5%.  Some of the beef farmers in question are switching to dairy production.  We can see the evidence and I am sure Senator Paul Daly will back me up.  It would have been unheard of a decade or two ago for beef farmers to switch to dairy production.  Is there any way to reverse the trend, perhaps by making payments based on meat yields, with top prices guaranteed for the heavier U and other carcase grades which present a significant difficulty for some farmers, particularly in the midlands, who try to finish cattle in the best way possible?  That has to be a concern; otherwise we will not have seed stock and be able to compete in many markets.  We have increased significantly the quality of our beef stock.  Not too long ago, only one in four animals was of sufficient quality to achieve the price charged by supermarkets across the European market.  </p><p> These are matters about which I am concerned and we have to keep our eye on the ball.  If the seed stock drops away, I know that there is an argument that the suckler cow subsidy should be restored which might be one way to address the issue, but it may not be the only way to ensure it.  Making payments based on meat yields might be a more positive way to achieve the same result with reference to the economic return for farmers.</p></speech>

We were not invited to present at the Citizens' Assembly.  The views expressed are the result of the process the citizens involved in it went through.  Our perspective is that they will feed into policy discussions.  We would have had many other comments to add from the perspective of Origin Green which was not deeply discussed at any stage.  At a similar time, we undertook, independently of the Citizens' Assembly, a campaign in order that the public in Ireland would be aware of what was going on in the context of Origin Green.  We invited people to learn more about the campaign and the work being doing by the food industry by visiting the Origin Green website.  It was viewed as a successful campaign in generating a strong level of awareness among the public.  However, we recognise that more work has to be done in order that the general public will be aware of the work being done in this space in agriculture.  </p> <p>  I ask Mr. Maloney to address the matter of animal feed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Maloney" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#F00300"><p>It is a requirement of all of our quality assurance schemes that the feed used on farms, whether it be beef, dairy or pig farms, come from quality assured sources.  We have a feed quality assurance scheme in place.  Whether the feed comes from outside or within the country, it must come through a quality assurance scheme.  We are confident, therefore, about the feed being used on quality assured farms.  Under our quality assurance schemes, Bord Bia has responsibility for the quality assured farms, including 50,000 beef farms and nearly 18,000 dairy farms, all of which must source their feed from quality assured sources.  We run the schemes or recognise them as meeting the requirements of our schemes.</p> <p>  On genetically modified, GM, products, we do not make any distinction under our quality assurance schemes between GM and non-GM foods.  We do not require food to be GM or non-GM.  We are conducting market research in the international marketplace to see what perspective international buyers have of GM foods with reference to the products we produce.  That research is under way and we will analyse the results and take on board what we hear in the marketplace.</p></speech>

When one discusses grass-fed animals with consumers and those involved in trade, the conversation turns to what else would the animal eat if was not eating grass.  Against that backdrop, we wanted to understand what their other concerns were about grass-fed animals, the use of GM products and everything that might be part of the food chain.  We commissioned this work last year which was part of a review that we were undertaking.  It was to look at the matter from the perspective of both dairy and beef producers.  We wanted to understand whether it was a consumer or a trade issue.  The Senator's comment on Germany not wanting to accept any non-GM product was not exactly accurate.  Lidl has launched a private label product in Germany.  It has called its private label range, with a very limited range of products, non-GM, on which it is not paying any premium to any supplier.  It is counted as a discount product which has created some concern for the Irish suppliers involved.  That would have been another influence in commissioning the work to understand what was happening in Germany.  Germany is not the only market we are researching.  We are looking at quite a number of other markets, including the United States and markets to the east, to understand the full global impact.</p></speech>

While the most recent figures show a decline in our exports, from 37% to 35%, the British market is still our fundamental export market.  There is a logic to it in that it is our closest market, we speak the same language, have a similar taste profile and it is an efficient market to deliver products with a short shelf life.  There is movement towards the managing the risk attached to overdependence on any one customer or particular market.  Our budget has been increased significantly again this year.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced an additional allocation of 32 staff to Bord Bia.  In an organisation that has a headcount of 110 to date we believe we will be very focused on ensuring we properly absorb the additional 32 staff and value of money is achieved for the additional funding received.  In the short term there has not been an additional ask as we seek to make sure we will get value for money.  </p> <p>  I ask Mr. Maloney to address the quality assurance issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Maloney" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#F01500"><p>I will address the cribs about quality assurance and the percentage of animals on which premiums are paid.  It is not fully understood that it is called a quality assurance premium, but there are additional requirements over and above being a member of a quality assurance scheme to be met to allow animals to qualify for the premium.</p><p>However, there are additional requirements over and above being members of a quality assurance scheme to enable animals to qualify for the premium.  That leads to a certain degree of frustration.  It is called a quality assurance premium and quality assurance is one of the criteria required to be met to enable the premium to be paid, but there are other criteria related to the age of the animal, the fat score, the confirmation of the animal, the number of movements and so on.  If he or she meets all of the criteria, the farmer qualifies for the premium.  We have set up the quality assurance scheme in such a way that all animals from a quality assured farm are quality assured.  To qualify for the premium, the additional requirements have to be met.</p><p> Reference was made to dairying and the concerns about antimicrobials and antibiotics.  That is a concern, but we have addressed it in our quality assurance scheme.  There is increasing concern and we continue to promote and monitor the responsible use of antibiotics on farms.  A big part of the focus of auditors when they conduct an audit is ensuring the correct remedies are used, as well as the correct dosage.  If antibiotics are under or overused or not used for the correct period, it leads to antimicrobial resistance.  A significant part of the audit is focused on the correct use of antibiotics.  A national action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance has been launched by the Government.  Bord Bia is part of the plan.  We will liaise with the other stakeholders to ensure this issue which is of increasing concern is addressed as fully as possible.</p></speech>

There will be a number of key export and commercial meetings facilitated during the visit.  We will also undertake a number of advertising campaigns to support what Ireland is doing.  The Dutch market will be targeted particularly.  It is an area on which we have focused, but the focus will increase significantly.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned GM.  As per the previous response, we are researching the issue, particularly because of some of the market activities in Germany and because of the claims Ireland wants to make.  We are liaising significantly with the industry because it is a complex matter when it comes to the food industry and costs are associated with it.  We want to ensure before any recommendation is made on what the market requirements may be it will be profitable for the industry also.  Current operations undertaken by retailers in Germany would not generate a premium, although they would add costs for anybody in Ireland looking to do so.  Our concern is to ensure what is going on there is an absolute market fact and to understand the dynamic behind it both from a consumer and a trade perspective because sometimes the two diverge.</p> <p>  With regard to the health warning carried on drink products, we will respect whatever legislators come up with and work with the law within the land in which we are operating.</p> <p>  On the fifth quarter, there has been an increase, particularly in markets in the east.  As we have developed these markets and the Deputy may have seen in our performance and prospects, we are looking to call out the identification of from where the market values are coming and explain it to exporters and producers with as much transparency as our figures will allow.</p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Penrose's questions.  Other markets, new opportunities and new resources are a key priority for us.  We undertook with funding from the Department a complete project on market prioritisation mid-year and we did this not just from the perspective of looking out for Ireland and its food industry.  We divided the industry into key sectors to identify where the opportunities are for beef, pork, lamb, all other meats, and dairy products such as cheese and powders.  We subdivided those by our seafood exports, prepared consumer foods and commissioned separate studies into each.  We looked at the top 30 exports to 180 markets by sector.  We divided that to look at the top 15 markets and now, in collaboration with industry, we are looking at the top five markets.  We are trying to create a targeted approach to market access conversations as well as to our own priorities.  We will put in new resources with the additional headcount for which we have been approved to help us to exploit the opportunities that are identified.</p> <p>  Clearly, Brexit is a huge concern.  We have met to discuss the issue every single week since the referendum.  We are looking to manage every element of the risks Ireland faces.  The risks we face are multifaceted, ranging from organising our supply chain to understanding the route to market and the dynamic that will change in the UK market also.  We have maintained close relationships with our key retail customers, from whom the feedback tells us that their brands are very much built on the trust that they have earned with consumers and that, therefore, their supply chain must be trusted by consumers also.  That gives us some solace regarding Ireland's position both from the perspective of the British consumer and the trade.  However, we would appreciate as extended a transition period as possible throughout the negotiations.  I have covered  most of the questions askeed.</p></speech>

I have two questions about Brexit and climate change.  </p> <p>  Ms McCarthy has said the feedback from producers is positive in maintaining supply following Brexit.  However, the feedback does not account for tariffs, controls and so on, which will impact on businesses.  I wonder about the possibility of developing alternative markets.  Realistically, France and other countries in continental Europe are the alternatives, but the quality and standard of products are totally different.  For example, there is no market for cheddar cheese other than England.  How much work is being done to make this change?  It will probably have to happen.  Ms McCarthy has said the United Kingdom accounts for 35% of our trade.  Which country accounts for the next highest percentage?</p> <p>  Ms McCarthy has explained how Origin Green works, but climate change and sustainability were dealt with in a different section of the presentation, whereas they should have been discussed with Origin Green.  Origin Green and climate change policy should provide protection for the food sector, but do they?  Why do they make up two sections of the presentation?</p><p>How is climate change feeding into Origin Green?  I think that is vitally important.  Is Origin Green just a marketing tool rather than an effective tool that will make a difference to producers and to this country's climate footprint?  It is vital for Irish agriculture to recognise that climate change is an issue.  While recognising that it is an issue, we can develop our markets in a manner that counteracts it in some way.  We can that accept there are high emissions in this sector and attempt to counteract that by trying to reduce them in another sector.  At least we should be able to say it and do it.  That is very important.  I am aware that some companies that previously had Origin Green marks were challenged by the Environmental Protection Agency for reasons associated with pollution, etc.  How does that square with the whole Origin Green project and with climate change as well?</p></speech>

I would like to ask a couple of questions about the market prioritisation study she mentioned.  Origin Green is well established and has developed many markets.  Is there a strategy for developing new markets, as opposed to extending existing markets?  Are there comparisons to be made in that regard?  It is sometimes suggested that it might be best to pursue a policy of "what we have, we hold".  In other words, if we take our eye off the ball by trying to increase the number of new markets, we might not be able to look after existing markets.  Have any studies been done to ascertain which strategy yields the best or most development from exports?  Are exports increased by focusing on new markets, or does a concentration on the development of existing markets provide more opportunities?</p> <p>  I would like to follow up on what has been said about quality assurance with specific reference to the importation of grain under Origin Green.  I ask Ms McCarthy to comment on the markets that might become open in the event of a total focus on organics.  If it proves possible to source and tap into such markets, will we have sufficient supply here?  Do we have enough organic farmers?  If not, why not?  Do those who have experience on the global market believe there is a future for Ireland in the event of a move from Origin Green to full organic?  If so, what can we do to encourage more farmers to take the extra step and get fully involved in organic farming?</p></speech>

I would like to refer to a few particular issues.  Most of the topics have been covered.  A review of the Origin Green strategy from 2019 to 2021 is taking place.  I think sustainability is the big stumbling block in the agriculture industry at the moment.  We need to consider where we are going with the current model.  The Minister has spoken extensively about this issue, particularly over the last six months.  Will sustainability be a major plank of the Origin Green strategy as it goes forward?  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on whether, as we seek to make sure the Irish agriculture sector is sustainable, we will need to monitor the sustainability of the carbon footprint of the sector.  It should be acknowledged that an increase of 32 in the number of staff is very significant.  I suggest it shows a great commitment on the part of Bord Bia to what is required for it to do its job on the international stage.</p> <p>  I do not think the poultry sector has been mentioned today.  I would like to get some figures as an update on the development of Origin Green in the poultry sector.  Ms McCarthy provided some comprehensive figures for the beef and dairy sectors, but I would be interested to know how the poultry sector is tied into the Origin Green effect.  There have been phenomenal successes in the dairy and beef sectors.  This is obvious in every supermarket.  I wonder whether the poultry sector is enjoying the same take-up at market level.  Is there an issue with produce coming to this island to be remodelled or processed and then exported, perhaps not with the Origin Green label but with a Republic of Ireland label or with the Tricolour attached to it?  Is this becoming a major factor in the poultry market?  I refer to the practice of bringing in produce from France or Germany to be chopped up, remodelled or repacked for export without the Origin Green branding.  Do housewives and people on the street know that produce that is manufactured in this way is not Irish?  I am very interested in where we are going with the poultry sector and in how we can close any marketing loopholes that exist, particularly in the context of the proposed Origin Green strategy from 2019 to 2021.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara McCarthy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#H00400"><p>I will begin by responding to Deputy Pringle.  He is absolutely right that tariffs are a significant concern for companies in the context of Brexit.  If we were so inclined, we could do nothing other than look at the many possible Brexit scenarios.  We are trying not to get blocked into that one.  We are looking at doing the risk analysis for companies.  Last year, we did a significant piece of work called the "Brexit barometer".  We spoke to representatives of companies that account for approximately 70% of exports to the UK about their key areas of concern.  The Deputy is absolutely right when he suggests that tariffs, the calculation of tariffs and non-tariff barriers are key areas of concern.  We need to look at the complexity that Brexit will add to the supply chain.  Delays at borders will cause new costs, perhaps because of decreases in product quality, longer hours worked by lorry drivers or other time factors.  New challenges will be faced on the route to the market.  New competitors will be encountered as well.  Other challenges relate to currency issues and the associated volatility.</p> <p>  We have been looking at helping companies to calculate tariffs.  As many of our exporters export predominantly to the UK, or even to the UK and Europe, they have not had any experience of touching tariffs for many years.  We have two objectives in mind.  We are working out the risk, but we are also looking at market diversification, which means we will need new skills in our industry.  As the idea of going outside the EU becomes more realistic, skill sets will need to be developed.  We are piloting a new training programme with companies so that they understand how to work with tariffs.  We want to make sure that is bedded into their system.  While Brexit is not considered desirable or helpful within the industry, it is accepted as a market reality.  We need to know we can deal with it.  We are introducing a training programme for companies with that perspective in mind.</p> <p>  We are also looking at it from another perspective.  Companies that import certain products, such as some of the ingredients they use, are facing a realistic threat as well.  They need to know how to calculate the import tariff.  They need to understand the consequences of such imports from the perspective of VAT refunds, for example.  They need to know whether Brexit will increase the cost of doing business with their suppliers.</p> <p>  I am not suggesting nobody is worried about Brexit.  There are multiple concerns when it comes to Brexit.  We are trying to break it down into manageable and realistic chunks by focusing on skill sets, on what people can do about Brexit and on the scenarios that might have risks associated with them.  The focus on scenarios has led to the market diversification projects we have been looking at.  That has not resulted in a suggestion that we should all move to France or Germany.  We are dealing with very different stories in each product category.  Some sectors have very few options as they decide what to do.  Approximately 95% of the exports in the horticulture industry go to the UK.  There are quite a few options in that industry because its products tend to have a seven-day shelf life and, thankfully, attract low tariffs.  We are trying to ensure we add as much value as possible in that regard.</p> <p>  Particular reference has been made to the cheddar market.  Clearly, 50% of our cheddar exports go to the UK.  We do not envisage that the first opportunities for those products will be in France.  That is why we specifically called out cheddar within the market prioritisation process.  We are finding that we need to look at where food service products are growing.  Rather than focusing on the kind of high-quality mature cheddar that is produced today, we are looking at the use of processed cheddar in products like burgers and pizzas, etc.  We are looking for such base opportunities in various markets in the first instance.  We have already found that the Japanese market is potentially a strong market for importing cheddar into.  As a result of the new Japan-Europe trade deal, the tariffs on those products will decrease significantly in the coming years.  We are looking outside the box at such opportunities.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, we want as long a transition as possible to facilitate the negotiations on Brexit.  It will take time for Ireland to build its reputation in these markets.  It will take time to recognise who the right contacts in those markets are.</p><p>We would appreciate having as much time as possible, as would our exporters.  </p><p> The Deputy asked where the next market after the United Kingdom was.  We export over &euro;4 billion worth of goods to the United Kingdom.  The United States is our second largest market.  It hit the &euro;1 billion mark this year for the first time.  Some 50% of our exports to the United States are alcohol products.  Dairy products account for the second highest percentage.  We consider Europe to be one group of countries, to where 33% of our exports go.  </p><p> The Deputy asked which markets were growing the fastest and where there was growth.  Last year there was 8% growth in exports to the UK market, 16% growth in exports to the European market and 17% growth in exports to international markets.  Growth was very robust.  As Deputy Jackie Cahill knows, dairy prices, particularly butter prices, skewed a lot of the figures because, given our butter exports to the Netherlands and Germany, butter export values increased significantly and that had an impact.  There are multiple factors that influence the where, what and why in all of these markets.  We are trying not to ask to what country we will go but rather what sector will be the most attractive in what location.  We are merging the two scenarios and looking at the macroeconomic forces, the ease with which we can export to a particular country and its track record with Ireland.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  Sustainability is an integral part of the Origin Green programme which operates at two levels.  It operates for food companies and at farm level.  At farm level, farmers are members of Origin Green by being part of our sustainable assurance schemes, our quality assurance schemes with sustainability added.  Farmers are required to give us data that allow us to calculate the carbon footprint on their farms.  As mentioned in our submission, to date we have made over 170,000 of those carbon footprint calculations.  The provision of that information allows us to feed back to the farmer his or her carbon footprint relative to his or her peers and we can demonstrate where improvements can be made.  We are moving on to look at other areas surrounding biodiversity, water quality and all of that.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Maloney" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#J00400"><p>It does have an impact and farmers are required to give us the information.  We must get it from them.  We have also developed, with Teagasc, a carbon navigator tool, a tool that combines the economic performance of farms with their greenhouse gas emissions.  With the carbon navigator tool, we can demonstrate what effect achieving certain efficiencies on a farm would have on its carbon footprint and profitability.  A good example to illustrate what I mean is looking at the length of the grazing season, which in part of the country might be 290 days.  If it could be increased to 300 days, it would have an effect on the carbon footprint because animals on grass have less of an effect on the environment than animals which are housed indoors.  It is also cheaper and more economic to keep animals on grass.  It increases the efficiency of the farm and also profitability.  That is how farmers are members of Origin Green.</p> <p>  Companies are also members of Origin Green.  We have mentioned that there are 282 companies that are verified members of Origin Green and that account for over 90% of exports.  For a company to be a member of Origin Green, it has to sign up to a charter.  It has to set targets to achieve sustainability.  Companies must set targets for raw material sourcing, manufacturing processes and social sustainability, including health and nutrition, worker welfare and so on.  They are not targets they can just set by themselves and get a pass on them.  SGS which is internationally recognised as a world leader in auditing and verification analyses the targets for individual companies and only if it is satisfied that they are stretch targets, realistic and credible can a company become a verified member of Origin Green.  Companies have to meet these targets; set out a three-year plan and submit them to us for analysis on an annual basis to show they have met the targets.  In addition to the 282 companies that have been verified, we have another 300 that are registered but not yet over the line because they are in the process of toing and froing with us on the setting and credibility of the targets they are setting.</p></speech>

Companies are required to meet the requirements attached to their licences.  That is one part of what they are required to do and it is a legal requirement.  What we are talking about in Origin Green is setting targets in areas such as raw material sourcing.  If we take some of the dairy co-ops, for example, one of their targets is that all of their suppliers be in the dairy sustainability assurance scheme.  Two years ago they had no supplier in that scheme, but by the end of this year 100% of their suppliers will be in it.  In the manufacturing sector they will be looking at reducing energy levels, recycling water and reducing waste.</p></speech>

On new and current markets, our approach is to invest in market insight initiatives to understand the dynamics of a particular market.  In some of our mature markets there is a level of sophistication in our understanding which shapes the promotions we undertake in them.  In some of our newer markets there is much more exploratory research.  Very often those involved in them do not know where Ireland is and we are looking to understand how best we can make a pitch for Ireland to them.</p><p>A clear example of that is when we were looking at the Chinese market and trying to understand whether China respected Ireland and what assets Ireland had that we could communicate to the Chinese consumer.  We were looking to position in that market because we do not have the funding of a branding company to conduct huge branding campaigns.  We need to use our assets as much as possible and to leverage Ireland's values as much as we can.  We have a thinking house facility, which is an insight centre that we have invested in over the past year and half, particularly in our office in Dublin.  We have researchers in that facility whom we send overseas.  They went to China and spent time with Chinese consumers in their homes, speaking to them about what is important to them, and, in particular, about the dairy products they consume and what makes them choose one product over another.  Their awareness of Ireland at the time was low but they linked Ireland to Europe and European regulation and standards were important to them.  We then researched in a number of different cities to explore in-depth the language that should be used when speaking about Ireland, the respect they would have for tradition versus technology and making sure that we were understood within that market as we tried to communicate to those consumers the benefits of a sustainable food production and the traceability systems we have in a simple way.  We found with Chinese consumers, which is different from European consumers, that they wanted us to demonstrate the merging of technology and tradition.</p><p> With regard to the images we used, they were not interested in seeing Irish rain, for example, because in China pollution is very often associated with rain and, therefore, why would rain be connected to food?  They were impressed with images showing the clarity of rivers, etc., that we could share with them.  They wanted the farmers that we were illustrating to them not to be the traditional farmer, which we have often used in imagery.  They wanted to see a young farmer with an iPad beside a modern tractor.  Again, one is talking about an industry that has tradition and respects the farming culture but uses technology well so that the consumers can trust the technology.  It is about the merging of modernity and tradition and how we can position that to show what Ireland does best.  They could respect and understand that.  The approach we took there, compared to the approach we take in the German or UK market, which we know much better, was much different.  We can go straight to product category in Germany given the respect consumers have for Irish traditions and their knowledge of Ireland whereas in newer markets, we first have to ground where Ireland is and then introduce the systems the country has before getting into marketing the product.</p><p> With regard to quality assurance and the move towards organic farming, Origin Green welcomes organic products within it.  It is not an either-or of a journey.  Organic producers are members of Origin Green and we hope that will add to their proof points or credentials.  There are further opportunities for organic products in the market, particularly for organic dairy products.  There is huge demand in eastern markets for organic infant formula, for example, and many organic dairy products.  It might also explain the backdrop to us looking at grass because sometimes natural is a short cut to organic.  We are looking for consumers to understand that natural equals grass fed whereas organic adds to that and attracts a higher premium.  What we are trying to understand in our research all the time is how to position Ireland to best fulfil its commercial potential.  There are further opportunities for Ireland to increase organic production and there are markets for organic products but the pricing needed to make organic production profitable is not as obvious as people sometimes assume.  For example, many continental retailers discount organic products in the same way they discount mainstream products.  It is not the "Eureka" that it is positioned as but it is definitely a space that has huge opportunities.  Ireland competes successfully in markets for organic salmon and most of the salmon we export is organic.  That is one of the main categories we operate in on an export platform and there are not that many other categories that we export organic in on any scale.</p><p> Senator Lombard asked about our strategy and the journey we are on.  We have two major projects under way.  The first project is looking at the next five years of Origin Green.  Over the past five years, there has been a sustainability agenda.  If we conversed five years ago, the Citizens' Assembly would not have been in operation and would not have been as eloquent in speaking to the challenges around sustainability in comparison to today.  The market has significantly changed, as have the expectations of both the consumer and the producer.  We logically expect it to change even further over the next five years.  We are conducting significant research in our main markets and in new markets to understand where the sustainability agenda is going.  We want to bring that information home in order that we can build our sustainability credentials and build Origin Green to ensure it is ready for the next five years of its existence.  While that research will feed into our strategy work, we are engaging widely with our stakeholders in this work, particularly Irish companies as well as acknowledging the politics that surrounds Bord Bia ranging from the producer organisations to the EPA or the Department, as they have a perspective on the future of Irish agriculture, and we want to ensure that we find out what is meaningful to them.  It will be very much informed by the market drivers and we will have detailed research looking at the key forces of change from a consumer and a market perspective.  A coalition of those forces will decide our new strategy.  We have every expectation that sustainability will be at the heart of that.  We had a small business event earlier and sustainability was highlighted in every market force that we described at it.  We have no doubt that sustainability will be a major underpinning of our future strategy.</p></speech>

I focused on dairy and beef because they are our largest schemes.  However, we have quality assurance schemes across the board.  At farm level, we have schemes for poultry, eggs, pigmeat, and horticulture.  We are in the process of converting the schemes from our traditional quality assurance schemes to sustainability assurance schemes.  Our beef and dairy schemes have been converted to sustainability assurance schemes and they are fully accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Board.  Our egg scheme has just got over the line to be converted as well.  We are in the process of converting the poultry and pig schemes but that process takes time because the conversion has to be done with input from key stakeholders.  We cannot, therefore, change schemes and impose them.  Under the rules of accreditation, which are important because they are recognised internationally, we must involve stakeholders.  We want to do that anyway because the schemes are for them.  The technical committee on the poultry scheme has met a number of times and we expect that the scheme will be converted by June or July this year.  A total of 95% of the poultry produced in Ireland is processed under our existing quality assurance schemes and it is a similar scenario for pig production.  While the number of producers may be much smaller than the number of beef or dairy farmers, almost 100% of the product is covered.</p> <p>  The Senator also raised the issue of the concern relating to imported product being chopped up and relabelled.  There is concern about whether the consumer is being misled when the product is sold with a tricolour on it.  We can speak for the 95% of the product that is processed in Ireland under the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.  If it is produced under the scheme, it can carry the Bord Bia quality mark, which has "Quality Assured" and "Origin: Ireland" on it.  One will see that on all the products that come through under the scheme in supermarkets.</p><p>That means that the product was born, reared and slaughtered in Ireland.  At over 90%, consumer awareness of the quality assurance mark is extremely high.  We have carried out quite a bit of research with consumers because all of our advertising in the home market is very much based on the quality assurance mark.  We encourage consumers to look for it and know from where products come.  They are the messages we send and they are getting across to the consumer.  As I said, there is very high consumer awareness of the quality assurance mark and what it stands for.  It stands for quality but also origin, as consumers understand.  The message we are driving home is that they should look for it.  If a consumer is concerned and wants to support what is produced from start to finish in Ireland, he or she must look for the quality assurance mark.</p></speech>

When a such scheme is launched, we will not expect all poultry producers to change and be audited overnight.  When their membership comes up for renewal, they will become a member of the new scheme in a phased process.  Producers may be in the process of being audited under the current scheme and it would be unfair to expect them to undergo another audit in three or four months' time.  It will form part of the overall marketing strategy for the quality assurance mark.  It will be worked out with the board in the context of the plans for the year ahead whether it will be product or species-specific.</p></speech>

They are co-operative models in which the size of a herd for particular farmers has to be below 100 head.  In terms of animal welfare and achieving sustainability and strong environmental standards, there is a very strong brand that benefits farmers immensely.  I am very impressed by it and in due course will place some recommendations before the committee.  This touches on the questions asked by Deputy Thomas Pringle.  It strikes me that the typical farm in rural Ireland would be a good fit for the organic model.  I have spoken to a number of farming organisations about this matter and wonder if, in the context of the ambitions for Origin Green, the aim is to go down this road.</p> <p>  On the markets that have been identified, we have a grass-based model in beef and dairy farming in Ireland, of which we are very proud, but there is a concern that we are not getting the benefit in the prices achieved.  I noted Ms McCarthy's remark about Lidl in Germany and how there was no premium, despite the fact that it was marketed as a special category of food which I assume is more expensive than other categories in that supermarket chain.  Did I hear it correctly?</p></speech>

Farmers often say to me that it is a niche market and too limited.  It has not been accepted that if people want to have sustainable farming and rural communities, they will have to pay a little more than they are for a range of produce.  I want to get a sense that the consumer is being so educated.  This is applicable globally, not just to Bord B&iacute;a.  Are we really engaging with and explaining to consumers that if they want to know about animal welfare and achieve environmental standards and the sustainability of rural communities, they will have to pay a little more for that quality produce?  If they want to make sure climate change and environmental standards are adhered to, they will have to pay a little more.  How are the delegates joining up the dots?  Deputy Thomas Pringle's question was fair, as was Mr. Maloney's response.  The committee presented that structure to the delegates.  How does one ensure consumers are educated in order that they understand they will have to pay a little more?  Where does the plan all fit together?  Are we heading down the road towards big ranches, meat factories and major producers and in the process letting the small family farm model to die eventually?</p> <p>  One of the issues that came up in the context of Brexit was that of all-Ireland markets.  Is Bord B&iacute;a happy that there is an all-island approach in the dairy sector and that it is facilitating the adoption of that approach?  Do the delegates believe dairy processors in the North are at a significant disadvantage compared to those in the South?  Is there a partnership with their counterparts in the North?  The Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are talking about the need to ensure there will be no barriers to trade and that there will be an all-Ireland approach to the agrifood sector, but I am picking up on criticism of Bord B&iacute;a's approach in that it seems barriers are being put in place in adopting a genuine all-Ireland approach.  Processors are reporting difficulties in accessing schemes Bord B&iacute;a is promoting in this state.  Is that a fair criticism?  Is Bord B&iacute;a aware of and working on it?</p></speech>

What does Bord B&iacute;a intend to do to sort out this problem?  The product may have originated in another country, but it is stamped as having come from Ireland, which is causing confusion.</p> <p>  The delegates made reference to the success of the beef genomics scheme.  Do they have any worry that 10,000 extra cattle are being killed to have the same tonnage of beef?  They are the latest statistics.</p><p>Bord Bia had a system with the dairy farms and then came into the beef farms.  Farmers in the dairy sector had an opportunity to sort something out and come back a few weeks later, whereas the quality assurance lasted for a certain length of time on the beef sector.  Is that still the case or has it been rectified?</p><p> Ms McCarthy spoke about the carbon navigator earlier.  Farmers are being charged fairly heavy prices for doing these carbon navigators.  Is it a concern that at the end of the day the farmer is paying for nearly all of these new add-ons to make things better?  I know it is in the interest of food, but generally they are not getting any more for what they produce.</p><p> Ms McCarthy mentioned the organic sector.  Senator Mac Lochlainn and Deputy Pringle also mentioned it.  I know of many people who go to the ordinary mart because it does not pay them to go to the organic sales.  They go to the ordinary commercial marts with their stock.  There does not seem to be a niche market for that.  I believe the hill lambs are organic because when they are up on hills they are not getting too many injections or anything.  They have no good market for the hill lamb at the moment.  Why are we not doing something on that end?</p><p> We are hearing stories that the China market is close to being open for us.  Does Ms McCarthy have any update on that?</p><p> Restrictions on the movement of cattle are causing problems for farmers.  If an animal was in two or three different farms, provided it was looked after properly, it is the same animal that gets eaten.  We have the 30 month requirement.  After 30 months and two days the steak tastes the same as after 29 months and 28 days.  As Senator Mac Lochlainn said, we may need to educate consumers more about how Irish beef, lamb etc. are produced to a great standard.</p></speech>

I want to ask one other question and then go back on a few of the answers I got from the delegation.  Does Bord Bia have any concerns about zero-grazing with the larger herds on the dairy side and the higher proportion of indoor feeding especially as it affects the taste of butter, which attracts a premium especially on the German market?</p> <p>  I asked a specific question on whether the Bord Bia budget is adequate to cater for the challenges Brexit will present.  The witnesses spoke about the additional resources Bord Bia had taken on.  It does not answer my question as to whether the budget is adequate.  If we had more resources, could we do more to reduce our dependence on the UK market?</p> <p>  A point was made about quality assurance and the different add-ons there are to qualify for premium.  The reality is that processors are using quality assurance as a marketing tool.  They are being disingenuous to farmers in not paying a premium for all animals coming from farms that are quality assured.  In some cases only 30% or 35% of the animals coming from a farm are getting the premium even though all the meat would be marketed as quality assured.  That issue needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Of the money Bord Bia spends on the beef side, what percentage is devoted to live exports?  As a promotional body, what is Bord Bia's view on the consequences for our sales in foreign markets of the proposed health warning on drinks?</p> <p>  There is one other point on which I felt I did not get a satisfactory answer.  How can we determine the value of the fifth quarter, which will have an increasing value owing to much of the work Bord Bia has done?  How can producers be sure the proper price is being paid?  That fifth quarter is increasing in value all the time, but it is very hard to get a handle on it.</p></speech>

As she probably knows, we produced a report on the tillage sector just before Christmas.  It is a sector that is at the crossroads at the moment.  We made a number of recommendations in that regard.  Some of the recommendations, Nos. 8, 11 and 16 in particular, refer to the part Bord Bia might play in the promotion of some of the products.  Perhaps at some stage Ms McCarthy could give us her opinion or some input into that report.</p></speech>

Origin Green is pro or anti anything on organic.  Organic is part of the membership of Origin Green.  It is not some sort of system to drive organic behaviour or to take organic clothes or anything like that.  They are two very different initiatives with regard to the certification behind it and the production systems involved.</p> <p>  On the research the Senator has done on the different co-operative models with regard to organic, we have done a lot of work and we work with the organic section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure the promotions we run within the organic sector and the research we do for the organic sector are keeping that sector informed.  In many of the sectors Ireland plays in a very small niche when we look overseas.  As I mentioned earlier, salmon is the only category we would have any volume of organic exports.  We do a lot of work on the home market to help organic producers to understand the route to market for organic food.  We have done a lot of work on farmers' markets in particular to ensure they are able to communicate the value of what they offer within their organic range and to assure where possible they can get that premium for their product.  We commit resources to it, but it is very much in partnership with the organic section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Funds are ring-fenced specifically for organics and specific work programmes are designed in partnership with the organic industry.</p> <p>  With regard to Brexit, we obviously have huge concern on the Border issues.  We are an agency with a remit for 26 counties.  We are not an all-Ireland agency.  Therefore, we clearly bias our services towards the companies producing in the Twenty-six Counties.  Obviously anybody who is not producing in the Republic of Ireland will say that we are not giving them a service.  While that is true, our remit is towards the counties that are producing here in the Republic of Ireland.</p></speech>

We have repeatedly said that the loss of the all-Ireland market would be devastating for agrifood.  Obviously it is not just the all-Ireland market, but also access to the British market.  Has there been any attempt to improve the all-Ireland nature of what Bord Bia is doing to work in co-operation with its counterparts in the North to market the island of Ireland?  Obviously the 40 shades of green - coming from Buncrana, I appreciate this more than most - does not stop at the Border of Derry and Donegal or Louth and Down.  The all-island model could be marketed.  The potential consumers for what we are marketing overseas do not look at the Border.  They think of this beautiful green island and that is what we sell.</p> <p>  Would Ms McCarthy accept that for producers and processors in this State who are signed up to Bord Bia, the lack of an all-Ireland approach impacts on their business model?</p><p>It is not good for many businesses in this State that conduct business in the North.  I appreciate that Bord Bia has a 26-county remit.  Does it plan to change that situation?  We have the North-South Ministerial Council.  We talk about all-Ireland co-operation and an all-Ireland market.  We have an all-Ireland agency that markets tourism and there is a range of all-Ireland agencies and markets.  It strikes me that we have a dichotomy and contradiction.  On the one hand, we say we want the all-island agrifood sector to be protected but, on the other hand, we say we will only promote Irish food produced in the Twenty-six Counties.  I would like to hear the views of Bord Bia other than its remit.  Does Bord Bia think its remit should be changed?  Should the Irish Government give Bord Bia better instructions about its work?</p></speech>

I am saying that the Government, this committee and many others have articulated a desire to protect the all-island agrifood sector.

What we are looking to do, which is our remit, is to promote the products of the Irish food and drink industry which are produced in the Republic of Ireland.  When we look at everything that we do, if a company has facilities in the North or in mainland Britain, we do not show a bias but seek to work with those companies as much as possible.</p> <p>  When it comes to Derry, I am not quite sure.  The Senator might have confused activities.  We have a lot of challenges on the promotion of the Republic of Ireland on the Irish market but it was not Bord Bia activity that caused them.  We have never promoted or un-promoted products from outside of the county.  What we look at is quality assurance schemes.  We do have, and recognise, facilities in the North of Ireland within that but we do not have, include or invite, from any member state, anybody who is working on it.  We are fair with everybody in that we operate within our remit.  The Twenty-six Counties are within our remit.  Outside of the Twenty-six Counties, and that can be in Normandy in France, Germany, Wales or the North of Ireland, we respect the job we have been given to do.  </p></speech>

We talk to them and promote organic products.  We also pay for advertorials to be placed in the newspapers on the Irish market as part of our campaigns.  We do not do that much work overseas because we do not have that many organic products to market.  We learn from and research other markets to ensure we have best practice in what is happening within the organic categories, and ensure then that when we speak to our individual companies they are informed and position their products correctly to speak to organic consumers, no matter what market they go to.  From a scaled Ireland Inc. perspective, we do not do advertising campaigns in organics overseas.  We conduct trade or study missions for companies.  We go to BIOFACH, which is a very large trade show that takes place in Nuremberg in Germany.  At the event we have an organic stand and represent the companies that can export.    </p></speech>

If meat origin is being misrepresented in the marketplace then that is an issue for bodies other than Bord Bia.  We do not have responsibility for policing how meat is stamped, sold or portrayed in the marketplace.  That is not a role for us.  Other agencies have that remit.  As I said earlier, we have responsibility for the products that carry the Bord Bia quality assurance mark.   We promote them and police the system.  We  police it at farm level and, particularly, at factory level.  When we go to the meat processors we carry out extensive audits to ensure that, in terms of traceability and reconciliation, it is only quality assured products that come out of the meat factory that carry the Bord Bia mark.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the beef quality assurance scheme.  I think it is the closed-out model for beef.  We had a situation in our previous beef scheme whereby, if non-compliances were raised at farm level, then the farm fell out of certification and had to reapply.  Last April we introduced a new scheme and changed the rules to have a closed-out model in line with our other schemes.  Therefore, if a farmer gets a non-compliance notification, following an audit, he or she gets 30 days to rectify the problem.  Provided the matter is resolved within 30 days, he or she remains certified for the 30 days and will continue to be certified.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that farmers are charged a heavy price for carbon navigation.  In actual terms, farmers are not charged.  There is no fee to be paid by the farmer to be part of the programme.  I presume he was referring to the things that farmers have to do to pass the audit.  In terms of all of those things, and particularly since we moved to the closed-out model for farms, there seems to be very little negative feedback on the schemes.  Farmers appreciate that the criteria for the quality assurance schemes are criteria that reflect good practice at farm level.  There is also an appreciation that being part of a quality assurance scheme, and a sustainability assurance scheme, is important for market access and trying to access better markets.</p> <p>   In terms of the movement of cattle and whether an animal aged 30 months and three days tastes better or worse than one aged 30 months less three days or one that has not reached its 30-month birthday.  That is an issue for the meat factories and their customers.  If their customers demand a product that is less than 30 months of age then that is a specification individual factories must meet in order to meet the requirements of their contracts.  As far as Bord Bia is concerned, we have left our quality assurance as broad as possible so as many animals as possible can qualify.  We insist on animals spending 70 days on the final farm or farms but they can move a number of times and still be quality assured by us.</p><p>The marketplace will dictate in certain markets, and in certain higher spec markets, that the number of movements are restricted and that the age of the animal is restricted.  I mention confirmation, the fat score and the weight as well.  That would reflect an earlier comment about extra cattle for the same tonnage of beef, and smaller carcases being required in regard to that.  Our schemes try to keep it as broad and as open as possible.  Then it is really a matter for the meat factories and their customers to work out the details of the contracts and which animals meet particular contracts.  I do not know if Ms McCarthy wants to pick up on any other matters.</p></speech>

Obviously, one cannot market anything as organic unless it is certified, regardless of the process that it has gone through.  One would, obviously, market it on its naturalness.  We do a number of campaigns promoting lamb, and the particular markets which we have been looking to grow within that have been the French, German, Swedish and Swiss markets as we move our dependency away from the UK market and, in particular, the French market.  It is in those newer markets that we are looking to create a premium for the product and to really market the naturalness of our product.  We have been doing European campaigns as well in order to amplify the spend we have so that in partnership with the French and the UK we have been able to get funds from Europe to market European lamb and then within that, obviously, to have a position for Irish lamb.</p> <p>  Lamb, as a product this year, had a reasonably good finish to the year.  While it had a very hard start to the year, it had a good summer within the pricing that it achieved but we would regularly work with industry to review our marketing efforts of lamb and to take guidance from industry.  We are in consultation with industry at present in order to undertake a new meat strategy.  We will look specifically at the products - again this is dictated by the challenges Brexit will pose for us - and at where the best places and the best value for Ireland Inc. will be in terms of its promotional campaigns.  We are sitting down with industry, and in partnership with Meat Industry Ireland, as part of that stakeholder consultation to get their guidance and input as to where they believe the best bang for our buck will be achieved, as we look at the different positionings and marketing opportunities for Ireland, first, for quality assured lamb, and then for different opportunities for niches within that.</p> <p>  We were asked for an update on the Chinese market.  Obviously, this is a Government decision.  Ireland received a further inspection from the Chinese who have reported back.  The feedback will go to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I believe the committee might be meeting officials from the Department after this meeting.  They will have seen this report and they are in dialogue with their Chinese counterparts with regard to some of the details but they have fed back to us that the overall tone of the report was positive.</p></speech>

To get a 30 extra headcount, for us the biggest job is recruiting those on Government salaries in a market that is coming closer to full employment.  That is absolutely a challenge for us when we look to ensure we are getting the best people who are prepared to travel, who have languages and who understand the food industry.  We will we have challenges within that.  Would I say a 32 headcount for an organisation of 110 is not a huge investment and vote of confidence from the Government in it?  Absolutely not.  One cannot do every single job in year one.  What we are trying to do is to phase ourselves and our budgets are given to us on an annual basis for the jobs that we have described to the Government that we need to get done this year, in addition to the &euro;6.7 million we were given in September of last year.  We are adequately funded to get us through this year.  We will obviously keep dialogue going with all Government parties to ensure that adequate funding takes us step by step through it.  What we do not want is to given funding that we cannot spend with a good value-for-money head on us.  If one threw money at a problem, one would not get good value for money.  Each of the projects we have presented have been funded by Government.  What we would regularly do is to keep dialogue going during supplementary budget discussions.  If there are new jobs to which we have resources to allocate and if we have resources we can disseminate back out to industry, all these will be influences on the asks we have of Government.  When we got that &euro;6.7 million last September, it put our organisation, in some ways, under pressure to make sure we could spend it properly and well.   We would be concerned about asking for huge budget amounts in order to make sure we can absorb the spend and give value for money on it.</p> <p>  I cannot give the exact percentage for live exports versus beef.  It would be a small percentage because the work we do is very different.  We can follow up on it and give the Deputy the exact percentage on this.  However, when looking at the type of work we do in live exports, it is very targeted work.  We would take advertising in trade magazines and we would do trade or study missions in particular markets.  They do not have the same spend as undertaking consumer insight, undertaking huge market research or undertaking consumer campaigns on the ground so one will get quite a different budgetary spend on it.  However, I cannot give the Deputy the exact figure today but I will follow up on that.  Was there another question?</p></speech>

More than most, the Deputy, as a former member of the board of Bord Bia, he will understand our role and the fact we cannot get involved in the price discussion between meat factories and producers.  That is an issue between the meat factories and the representatives of the farmers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012300002#O01600"><p>The point I am making is that a farm is quality assured.  The culled cow coming off that farm is meeting the same standards as the 18-month old heifer coming off the farm.  The processor buying that culled cow is using the fact the animal is quality assured to help sell the product but the farmer is getting no return for that.  There are farms that are quality assured but would have no animals coming off them attracting a premium.  That is wrong.  Quality assurance was the brainchild of Bord Bia and it has worked very well.  I am not questioning the scheme at all, but factories are using the quality assurance, which is what it was brought in for, to promote our beef.  However, they are not being genuine with the people who participate in the scheme.  I accept that they say that in order to qualify for the top level of premium, the animal must be under 13 months and be graded in a certain grade.  However, I refer to the culled cow going out the gate and the farm which is meeting all the standards required and the O minus bullock or the O minus heifer going out the gate, which is what many farmers are producing.</p><p>Where a culled cow, or an O minus bull or heifer, which a lot of farms produce, goes out the gate, the farmer is paid nothing for adhering to the standards.  If those farmers opted out of the scheme in the morning, it would give processors a very severe headache.  They should look at that seriously.  We met the representatives of the milk promotion body.  They have a lovely glossy brochure, but it did not contain one picture of a black and white cow, yet those cattle are producing more than 50% of our beef.  That should be recognised.  For example, one sees Aberdeen Angus beef on the shelves and all these standards apply.  However, a significant number of Aberdeen Angus cattle that are killed do not qualify for quality assurance.  Factories are being short-sighted in their approach.  Farmers are brought well into the scheme.  While I am not saying there should not be a different level of premium, all animals that come out of a farm should attract some premium.  Quality assurance has served the industry well and factories are being short-sighted in failing to incentivise people to adhere to those standards.</p></speech>

We have looked at the recommendations made within the report and which were referenced during the meeting.  We were chatted through some sort of fair trade concept and there was a familiarity or similarity running through each of the report's recommendations on understanding how better to integrate the supply chain with the market to achieve better returns.  We have no problem looking at that.  Anything we do must be linked to a market requirement and buy-in from the industry.  If we create a quality assurance scheme into which the industry does not buy, we have wasted our time and our money.  We are going into deep stakeholder consultation on all of our work and, having read the recommendations somewhat briefly, we have no issue committing to asking industry, within our strategy development process, to come together to find out the appetite in the market, among distillers or drinks producers and among farmers, for something workable within this.  However, there is only so much we can do in this context from within our remit versus others.</p> <p>  We have two pressure points, the first of which is state aid rules which prevent us from advertising "made in Ireland" as a point of differentiation.  However, we can advertise that a product has its origin in Ireland as part of a quality assurance or traceability scheme.  If that is the route industry decides it would like to go down, we will definitely have a role.  Origin Green is not the "Buy Irish" campaign in any sense.  It is a sustainability scheme.  Clearly, we can communicate the work being done under that banner.  In relation to the three issues that the committee raises with us, we can commit to bringing industry together to discuss solutions which may be within our remit and to see if there is an appetite for that.  Once again, we will not be able to decide who gets the premium and where.  We can, however, decide whether putting the infrastructure in place represents a good investment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Jennings" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018012300002#D00300"><p>The Convenience Stores &amp;amp; Newsagents Association, CSNA, welcomes the opportunity to participate in the committee's detailed scrutiny of the general scheme of the waste reduction Bill.  The Bill, not having been subject to a regulatory impact assessment or cost-benefit analysis, is lacking in what we would require for detailed scrutiny.  We are also concerned that the Bill may be in contravention of European rules on the freedom of movement of goods and Article 18 of the packaging directive.  We are concerned that the Bill provides, by way of regulation, for ministerial action without any further stakeholder involvement.  CSNA does not consider that Bills discussed in a pre-legislative format should have amendments suggested that may materially alter their substance without a requirement for re-engagement with stakeholders.<br/><br/>We would like to discuss three elements pertaining to this Bill: the banning of non-compostable tableware, the deposit-return scheme, and the possibility, <i>in lieu</i>of a cup-banning section, of the introduction of an environmental levy on hot beverage containers, the so-called &quot;latte levy&quot;.<br/><br/>The CSNA questions whether the proposed ban would materially affect the levels of littering and, if so, how the committee could ensure there would be adequate bin facilities for compostables placed throughout the country.  We are aware that EU targets for recycling would not be improved for many involved in home composting and we query how success would be measured.  The very considerable changes in every workplace to accommodate separate bins for compostable beverage containers need to be evaluated properly and costed.  In many cases, we are aware that the contents of bins within local authority collection areas are mixed with ordinary waste, thereby defeating the effort of the consumer.  It is a rarity to find any separate bins for recycling waste in our cities or towns.<br/><br/>The cost to industry of providing compostable tableware is currently six times higher than that of ordinary tableware.  There are no guarantees that these costs would reduce solely on the basis of increased demand, leaving the retailer or the consumer, or both, with additional costs.<br/><br/>The Department has indicated that its preferred option, instead of a ban on tableware, would be the introduction of an environmental levy.  We would like to make a number of observations on this.  Initial reports have suggested that such a levy would be based on a percentage of the retail value of the product.  The CSNA, while not advocating a levy, suggests, in the interest of equity, that a unit price be charged rather than a percentage.  There need to be very clear rules on the levy's application and exceptions.  We are concerned that the levy may give rise to difficulties for retailers with regard to product contamination and their HACCP obligations.<br/><br/>We are concerned that the introduction of the proposed levy, unlike the very successful plastic bag levy, could lead to significant additional costs to retailers.  Machines might need to be recalibrated, tills and back-office systems would have to have additional product lines applied to accommodate a two-tier system, and there would be significant additional training costs.  If such a scheme is being considered, and assuming the Revenue Commissioners are involved in devising rules for its implementation, detailed consultation is required as a matter of urgency to ensure retailers are not affected negatively in their businesses.<br/><br/>One of the areas the CSNA would be most concerned about would be the lack of an even playing field if a certain style of beverage reseller could avoid charging the levy.</p><p> With regard to a deposit return scheme, the CSNA does not believe such a scheme is necessary, given the comprehensive existing shared responsibility scheme, Repak, in place across the country.  However, we ask the committee to consider how such a deposit return scheme could be put in place which would not act as a barrier to small manufacturers and distributors in getting into the marketplace.</p><p> There are many styles of deposit return scheme.  The type that would be put in place in Ireland might be for plastic bottles, plastic cartons, aluminium cans and glass bottles.  If that is the case, it will be important to ensure it is not limited to retailers but also captures hotels, bars and restaurants.  We make reference to this because there is always a possibility that partial systems can lead to returns being made of products on which no deposit has been charged.  Similarly, the CSNA is most concerned that products purchased outside the State may be subject to the reclaim of unpaid deposits.  If a deposit return scheme was in place, it would need to be sufficiently robust to ensure any retailer would not pay out more than the deposit taken in by him or her.  If a retail store was the nearest store to a sports gathering or a music festival, the prospect of enterprising groups returning thousands of bottles to a store in which very few deposits had been taken demonstrates the importance of having adequate responsible controls in place.  If the module is being designed to be revenue neutral at a macro level, sufficient consideration must be given to ensure that, on a micro level, individual retailers will be rewarded, not penalised, for their involvement in the scheme.</p><p> The majority of our members meet their existing packaging obligations through membership of Repak.  We do not believe we should be subject to what might be considered to be double taxation were we to be obligated to maintain our Repak membership and incur additional packaging costs for the same products.  It is our concern that if implementation of a deposit return scheme were to lead to a reduced income stream for commercial operators, such a reduction could lead to an increase in Repak fees for members.</p></speech>

It was unfortunate that owing to time constraints he was not able to present at an earlier hearing.</p> <p>  When introducing new measures to increase the level of recycling and cut out the wasteful use of plastics, it is important that we work with retailers and everyone involved in the supply chain to make them work.  I was taken by one of the statistics given at the last hearing that 34% of plastic packaging was recycled.  We know that this figure needs to rise dramatically for reasons such as developing a circular economy, reducing the wasteful use of plastics, environmental emissions, littering problems, the volume of plastics in the environment and so on.  That will not be easy, but it is an essential policy objective which we all share.</p> <p>  The plastic bag levy was a huge success.  As much as anything else and the 15 cent charge, its success was that it changed the public's perception of the wasteful use of plastics.  While I am sure there were difficulties at the time in switching to the use of paper bags and so forth, does Mr. Jennings agree that one of the beneficial effects was the change in public attitudes?  My sense is that there is a similar possibility to change our attitude to the use of plastic cups and bottles.  A significant number of retailers now sell coffee.  I can think of half a dozen newsagents near here, all of which have a coffee machine.  There must be reasonable regulations for its use.  It is dangerous enough as one is using boiling water and so forth.  Is it as simple as plugging it in and not having to worry about it?  Do retailers have obligations on the health and safety or food safety side?  We do not want to over-regulate and make it impossible for businesses.  However, I would have thought that in that aspect of the retail trade, there would already have been in place extensive health and safety and food safety regulations.</p></speech>

The main concern is the significant volume of plastic and paper cups being used and what happens to them.  Mr. Jennings has made some valid points about the practicalities of a working scheme in that regard as proposed in the Green Party's Bill.  Several months ago I brought forward a similar Bill for Sinn F&eacute;in to introduce such a scheme and which compared other schemes in European countries.  I would welcome Mr. Jennings's views on it.  Our Bill proposed that the scheme be self-funding and that every shop would not have recycling units but that they would be located in prominent areas or large shopping centres.  We could have a situation where we would return to the use of closed glass bottles or cans.  There would be practicalities in how CSNA members would manage such proposals.  My Bill proposed that returns be to larger units.  For example, if someone was to bring back ten plastic or ten glass bottles, he or she would receive a credit in return.</p> <p>  Do the CSNA's members have views on how we could reduce the use of plastic cups or change to another type of material?  In January, as hedgerows and the grass on the side of the road die back, thousands of discarded plastic cups are revealed.  In turn, they will be washed into rivers and out into the ocean.  We cannot allow this to continue to happen.</p></speech>

Where does he believe the industry needs to go on the issue of a latte tax?  Millions of plastic cups are being used every day.  This is a cultural issue and their use has expanded rapidly in the past decade.  Some say corner shops are making more on coffee than on anything else.  It has become the cash machine in the corner.  Should plastic cups be recyclable?  Will it be like the plastic bag levy whereby one will be bringing one's own cup to a coffee dispensing unit?  How would CSNA members work with that scenario?  Has it been thought out?  This is one of the big dilemmas coming down the tracks and it is only a matter of time before the area is regulated by the industry or the Oireachtas.  Buy-in by the CSNA's members is key to ensuring it will actually happen.</p></speech>

We acknowledge that we are part of that problem; we are a conduit.  As long as I have been around - I am older than most here - there has been education on litter in schools.  All of us remember it from fourth class onwards.  We were very proud and our teachers were very proud in bringing us up.  However, at the same time people feel no difficulty in opening their window and throwing things out, including things we have sold and things that others have sold.  There is a fundamental problem here.  The crux of the matter is that people are behaving inappropriately.  Having a deposit-and-return scheme for glass and plastic bottles would most certainly meet some of the requirements in pushing people in another direction and making it economic.</p> <p>  However, the matter relating to litter and people thinking nothing about tossing a coffee cup out of the window will not be addressed because there is no return scheme for that.  I have suggested that receptacles for those products be more widely available and also that our littering laws be enforced more fully.  Local authorities should make a big thing about compliance.  At the moment the fine is &euro;150.  In addition to local authorities, the Garda should also be involved.  We need to use CCTV or whatever.  We need to make it very clear that this society does not stand for littering.</p> <p>  Relating to small stores, the Deputy may think that his Bill was designed to facilitate and make it an easy streamlined thing.  I can assure him that whatever solutions are being planned by this committee, the Department or others, small retailers need to be part of that solution.  We cannot end up effectively exporting sales.  If there is only one area - and it is attached to a shopping centre - where one can return the product and the vouchers are only available to be cashed in at that point, it becomes the norm for people to make their purchases there.  We do not want to see that.  We need to be part of the solution and that may require grants to assist us in the reverse-vending machines.  It may require consideration on being rewarded for taking part if it is on a manual basis rather than reverse machines.  However, if there is such a scheme the small retailer needs to be part of it because otherwise we are leaving it go over to the multinationals and we cannot afford that.</p> <p>  On the composition of the cup, there is no doubt that the cup could be changed.  Whether it will retain the same level of heat is a matter for the scientists and others.  I return to the fact that even if we meet all of those and there is no product contamination and no difficulties in the taste or anything like that, we still have the question of what that person who leaves my store and finishes his coffee walking down the street will do with the cup.  How can we ensure that, following very significant investment in time and resources to devise a compostable cup, it actually does what it is supposed to do and becomes composted, and does not just end up in landfill or being incinerated?  That is the important thing.  There is an education requirement.  I may not have answered all the questions; I probably did not.  I would like to leave one message.  We the small retailers want to be part of the solution.  We acknowledge that there is a problem.  We do not have our heads in the sand.  We are not saying: "It's not our fault."  We are all part of that, but we also need to be part of the solution.</p></speech>

I will focus primarily on retrofitting homes.  To remind members, our 2050 climate change targets are essentially that we achieve 80% to 95% less in carbon emissions.  In light of the situation in agriculture and aviation, we will need to decarbonise our homes.  The context of my presentation will be the question of how to do that.  It is important to point out that we are far off trajectory and that we will not get back on it unless we make a significant change in what we do.</p> <p>  A deep retrofit means that a home will no longer use carbon fuels, will be energy efficient and - given that homes can be retrofitted poorly, leading to mould, damp and so on - healthy to live in.  In collaboration with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the national energy agency, the ESB and others, we established a programme that we originally titled the nearly zero energy building retrofit.  Our communications officer decided that was not catchy, so we called it SuperHomes.  Its aim is the 2050 home.  Approximately 75 homes have been retrofitted to date with support from the SEAI.  Under it, the average home is heated for &euro;200 to &euro;300 and is healthy inside.  People who have spent &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 under the programme are telling us that, even if they save nothing, it is the best money they have ever spent.  A retrofitted home means it is lovely, warm, comfortable and healthy.  It is important for people to understand that this is what we need to do to every home.  Small amounts of attic or wall insulation are insufficient to get us to where we need to be.  Consumer acceptance of that is high.</p> <p>  We set up and trained an independent, expert-led renovation contractor panel.  We are using heat pumps.  We have a research arm, with three Limerick Institute of Technology researchers working full-time on improving SuperHomes.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, has given us a substantial amount of money to scale us upwards.  As such, this is not a small project.  It has global aims.  From the EU has emerged the idea of a one-stop-shop, where homeowners can access information, grants, finance and so on.</p> <p>  It is a question of how to get to where we need to be and ensuring that everyone understands.  Slide No. 3 of my presentation shows the carbon intensity of heating a home using gas, oil and heat pumps today and in 2035 based on EirGrid's analysis of where our grid will be.  Using oil, solid peat, coal or gas to heat homes while also trying to meet our climate targets is not an option.</p> <p>  To make this happen, we need to consider finance and the levers that we can use.  For example, we can use grants, which we have in place, and taxation in the form of carbon taxes.  These taxes are not particularly popular, but we need to understand that, if we do not price carbon, we will not remove it from society.  The third lever of low-cost finance is an important one.  If someone can pay to upgrade a home for &euro;60 or &euro;100 per month after the energy savings, it will be easy to convince people to move from a D energy rating to an A rating because of the comfort benefit.  That is the point we need to reach if we are to get finance into the market, including low-cost finance from the banks.  The EIB has a great deal of money to put into this space.  We need to have market demand so that financiers will supply the right products and services.  To do that, we need a stable policy framework, carbon pricing and a long-term plan.  Low-cost finance will get this to happen.</p> <p>  Last week's discussion focused somewhat on solar energy.  The average Irish home uses 4,000 units of electricity, to which solar could contribute, and 18,000 units of heat.  We need to focus on the latter because Ireland has done little in that regard as opposed to electricity, in which regard we have done much.  I would be supportive of solar, but it must be approached in line with the decarbonisation of homes.  A building's energy transition entails getting rid of its fossil fuel boiler rather than just putting up a bit of window dressing in the form of solar panels on a roof.  Solar is still necessary, but it is only a part of the solution.  That solution involves heat pumps, electric cars and solar.</p></speech>

Regrettably, it is also one that we have not yet utilised to any significant extent.  It must be emphasised to committee members and others that the development of offshore wind as a resource would achieve a number of aims: reduce or avoid fines by contributing to the reduction of our emissions; increase security of energy supply; and, particularly important in light of the potential adverse effects of Brexit, create a significantly expanded indigenous industrial sector across Ireland, not just in the Dublin area like much of the industrial and service development that has occurred to date.  It would also provide activity, jobs and exports.</p> <p>  Four companies have been active for some time in developing offshore wind projects in the Irish Sea and advancing the necessary work.  I will invite Mr. Connell to discuss the example provided by Oriel Windfarm Limited.</p></speech>

It was established in 2005 to develop a wind farm off the north-east coast.  We have made significant progress in planning and permitting since that date.  We received a grid connection offer from EirGrid under the Commission for Regulation of Utilities' gate 3 connection programme.  When we reach full development, we will have a capacity of up to 330 MW.  With the efficiencies that are available from the strength of the wind offshore, that should allow us to generate up to 1.2 TWh per year of electricity, which is equivalent to approximately 300,000 homes' annual demand.  It would enable us to reduce our carbon emissions by 600,000 tonnes per year, which is significant.</p> <p>  The Oriel programme is the right size to kick-start the offshore sector in Ireland and, since it is well progressed through the planning and grid connection processes, is ready to go.  We involved a strategic partner group last October, a Belgian specialist in offshore wind development.  The specialist is positive that, with the finalisation of permit and tariff schemes, it will take two years from the finalisation date for the wind farm to become fully operational.</p></speech>

These companies could deliver 2.5 GW of power, and it is not always recognised that they could do this in the near term, that being, within the 2021 timeframe.  However, a number of requirements would have to be met first, which is the crunch of the message with which we would like to leave the committee.  A critical requirement is for a Government policy statement, one to the effect that offshore wind will be developed intensively now, to be conveyed to those Departments and agencies that would implement the actions flowing from it.  There are seven such bodies, so the committee should realise that this is not a simple issue.  It is critical that Departments be able to act on the policy statement.</p><p>There are two immediate actions.  The renewable energy support system, RESS, should have a technology specific auction for offshore wind now and it should operate within a target of 75% for renewable electricity in 2020.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Wheeler" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018012300002#H00300"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the committee on the opportunity presented by offshore wind energy to meet Ireland's 2020 renewable targets.  My company, SSE, is the largest renewable generator in Ireland, with over 700 MW of onshore wind under operation, including Ireland's largest wind farm, the 169 MW Galway wind farm.  It is also a leading developer and operator of offshore wind energy.  All told, we are involved in over 8,000 MW of offshore wind projects in the UK and Ireland, 900 MW of which is already generating, providing energy to customers and contributing to the achievement of the UK's targets.  Closer to home in Irish waters we co-developed Ireland's first and only operational offshore wind farm in 2004, namely, the seven turbine, 25 MW Arklow Bank Phase 1.  This was delivered at the time as a demonstrator project to prove the opportunity that offshore energy could represent for Ireland but almost 15 years later this opportunity has not been seized.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we have one of the strongest wind resources in the world yet we are the only country in northern Europe not currently developing offshore capacity.  SSE believes that offshore wind can play a key role in bridging the gap to Ireland's 2020 targets and beyond.  Onshore technologies have served us extremely well to date but we must be realistic that social acceptance to onshore energy developments is challenging and greater grid and planning constraints are now in place.  What has been successful for us in the past does not guarantee future success.  If we are to make up ground on 2020 and beyond - and we believe we can - then we need to fast-forward the build-out of large-scale renewable energy capacity.  Offshore wind energy can deliver large volumes of renewable electricity in the short term and also set us on the right trajectory for more ambitious 2030 targets.</p> <p>  SSE is actively progressing plans to fully develop its Arklow Bank Wind Park project.  This would represent an investment of over &euro;1 billion and deliver a minimum of 520 MW of capacity.  Most importantly, this project can be delivered in a timescale, from construction through to commercial operation that would qualify towards Ireland's 2020 targets, offsetting or potentially eliminating any fines.  The Arklow Bank project and other Irish Sea projects are an efficient and realistic way to take the big strides we need to hit our targets.  Looking beyond 2020, we are very excited that new floating foundation technology will allow Ireland to harness the resources off southern and western coasts and thereby stimulate very significant regional development.  However, we can only do this as a sector if the right market conditions are in place.  These conditions include, having a support scheme that supports offshore wind, an effective connection policy and efficient management of the consenting process.  As the committee is aware, the Department has consulted recently on the design of a new renewable electricity support scheme.  In our response, SSE called for the inclusion of offshore wind as a separate category in the first of the new support scheme auctions.  The technology-neutral approach proposed will not give offshore wind projects investment clarity in the timeframe required or enable a local supply chain to develop.  We fear that it will result in an over-reliance on onshore technology and, as I mentioned, we have doubts that a sufficient quantity of this technology can be delivered in the timeframe required.  A technology-neutral approach fails to capture the diversification benefits of offshore wind.  These benefits include, typical load factors of in excess of 40%, which is considerably higher than most other renewable electricity sources; delivery of consistent and predictable power to our national grid, providing significant system demand benefits; only connection is required to bring big power to where it is needed, which is simpler than developing lots of small decentralised projects; potential scale and strategic location of offshore wind can meet the future energy demands of clean-tech multinationals, particularly, large-scale load from data centres, the majority of which are located on the east coast; economic investment benefits in coastal regions and consequent employment opportunities and, upskilling for more ambitious 2030 targets and demand growth as heat and transport decarbonise through electrification.</p> <p>  From a cost perspective, following several years of innovation and de-risking offshore wind is now a scalable, proven and maturing technology which offers considerable benefits to consumers and society.  Costs continue to fall and I believe Ireland should be part of this story.  While offshore wind remains more expensive than onshore wind this gap has been narrowing and I believe that support is justified in light of the challenges of developing onshore wind, the climate change backdrop, Ireland's international reputation and impending fines, not to mention expected grid cost efficiencies and reduction in the wholesale cost of energy.  As a supplier of energy through our SSE Airtricity brand we are acutely aware of the need to keep costs to a minimum but as a society we also need to decarbonise.  While decarbonisation does come at a cost, not doing anything will cost us more and mean missed opportunities for Ireland.</p> <p>  We have a window of opportunity right now to transform the way to transform the way in which we generate power in Ireland and to do so in a way that reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to its EU targets and accelerates the deployment of new and diverse energy technology.  Aside from the climate imperative, we can also avoid unnecessary costs to the Exchequer from failure to meet our targets domestically.  In so doing, we can restore our reputation as a leading low carbon economy in Europe and the world, proudly supporting greener energy and attracting inward investment from across the globe to support jobs and our economy as a result.</p> <p>  I ask the committee to support our efforts in this regard.</p></speech>

It is a no-brainer that we should be backing these initiatives.  I am very interested in the deep retrofitting of homes.  The quality of some housing in this country is very poor owing to shoddy building in the past.  Houses in many of the old council estates require deep retrofitting and this should be strongly recommended in the committee's report not only because this would help in terms of our climate change targets but because it is sensible in terms of ensuring the long-term healthy lifestyle of our population and it has the added benefit of creating tends of thousands of sustainable jobs.  This issue should be a strong feature of our report, as should wind energy, solar energy and so on.</p> <p>  I would like to make an observation.  One could not say "No" to anything that has been said here.  From a scientific and societal point of view, all that has been said is very sensible.  How we do force the Government and successive Governments to take this issue seriously and to ring-fence the financing required to ensure that it happens in a timely way.  We are in a race against time.  Mr. Wheeler mentioned in his opening statement that almost 15 years on from the construction of the Arklow offshore energy bank an opportunity has not been seized, which is shocking.  To continue to do what we are doing is insane.  We need to listen to the scientific and technological submissions on all options and we need to have a discussion about how politically we can force this onto the agenda in a way that ensures the Government takes it seriously.</p> <p>  The committee previously looked at a project on the Arran Islands off the west coast.  Small scale community projects like this and the St. Fintan's high school project, which involves students trying to solar power their school, matter as much as the big projects.  If we are not being listened to at the top, politically, then this has to be driven at grass-roots level, using the examples of schools and communities that are trying to get us to change and working with the companies which are leading the advances in this area.</p></speech>

Mr. Kenny is correct that heat is a key issue but we have potential in solar heat to tackle it.  I support the work being done by St. Fintan's high school in terms of promoting solar PV because it has the potential to provide one power supply for the heat technology mentioned by Mr. Kenny.  Solar has a role on the heat side as well as on the electricity side.  Energy efficiency is always the best lowest cost form of decarbonised.  We have more than 1 million houses with oil fired central heating systems that we need to switch.  We also have many houses that are poorly insulated.  In recent years, the EIB has been offering finance to people operating in this space.  Why is it that we have not got the financing together?</p><p>As impressive as the work is, at this stage 75 houses should be 75,000, with an aim to provide 750,000 in a ten year period, at least it would be if we were ambitious.  Is there any sign of finance being made available to package this in a way that would wrap solar, heat pump, electric vehicle and retrofit programmes together?  Is there any straw in the wind that a financing package is finally on the horizon?  </p><p> I agree with Mr. Teahon on the potential for development offshore.  If there was separate offshore technology, will he outline how it would be structured?  I agree that we should do it.  I am conscious that all of the spectacular reductions in costs in recent years have come from the likes of the Danish, Dutch and German bidding systems.  We will obviously have to follow them.  However, very large international consortia, including Vattenfalls, DONG/&Oslash;rsted and so on, have brought forward lower bids.  How will smaller Irish operators connect to such developments in a way that will allow us to avail of the cost reductions that have occurred elsewhere?  How would the auction be structured? </p><p> In respect of our colleagues from SSE, after thinking about what I had said before, I agree with Mr. Teahon in saying we should be aiming for a power renewal figure of 75% by 2030.  It is absolutely the level of ambition we should have.  EirGrid studies assume the use of a certain amount of biomass in our system which I do not think we will see happen.  </p><p> In respect of SSE's international expertise, are there certain services the wind energy industry would be able to provide in terms of inertia or frequency voltage stability?  Is there any development that would allow us to start clutching these wind turbines in a way that would gives us some of the system services?  Have the delegates carried out any research into what the level of renewables could be by 2030 by adjusting the technology, particularly wind energy and other flywheel technologies, to help it to happen?  Do the delegates have any expertise in that regard?</p><p> Again I agree that there is potential to use offshore wind energy to benefit this island.  However, do the delegates agree that the level of power generated will require us to interconnect with our near neighbours, particularly Britain?  Does their company have any perspective that it might be able to share with us on the Brexit negotiations and how we will manage the volume of wind energy produced offshore in terms of interconnection and trading with the United Kingdom?  Has any assessment been made of the implications for Ireland in developing large-scale offshore wind energy projects in the Irish Sea and off the west coast?  We should do so.  However, we will have to sell it to make the process work.  What reassurance can be provided that it will survive the Brexit talks?</p></speech>

The issue of offshore wind energy is one in which I am interested.  I was looking at the Arklow project about a year ago.  It is very interesting.  Will Mr. Wheeler tell me how much Government support was available for the project which involved the use of seven turbines in Arklow?  Should there be more Government initiatives in developing the offshore sector?</p> <p>  I also want to ask Mr. Wheeler for his views on the issue of planning permission.  Many agencies have to be dealt with when multiple consents are needed.  Scotland has a simpler more streamlined system involving the use of one agency.  Sinn F&eacute;in sees wind energy as part of the solution, but we have a concern about its intermittent nature.  I know that there are differing views, depending on to whom one talks.  At different times we have had different views at this committee also.  However, there are two problems.  One is that on the nights of the two big freezes five and six years ago there was no wind.  The temperature was -16 degrees Celsius in the area in which I live.  The  other aspect is the potential overheating of the grid because of power surges.  How can this be regulated?  There is a view in the electricity industry that only so much wind energy can be handled.</p> <p>  The project in Tipperary is interesting.  The full cost, as stated in the presentation, is &euro;33,000.  I have been raising the issue of deep retrofitting.  A lot of homes have some insulation.  Unfortunately, there is none in some houses dating from the 1800s and early 1900s which means that an elderly person may be living in a house with no insulation.  The heat is flying out through the windows and doors.  It is an issue we have to tackle.  </p> <p>  The construction industry has left not only a financial hangover but also an energy hangover.  Most of what was done was bloody awful.  I have talked to people who have climbed into the attic of their rented accommodation which was built in 2006 and 2007 only to discover there is no insulation.  Insulation is also missing from some of the walls.  It is dreadful stuff.  How does Mr. Kenny see the cost being funded?  Does he see a role for a green bond type system?  In other words, pension funds or the credit unions which have funds of between &euro;8 billion and &euro;11 billion might provide funding for an upfront grants scheme?  The funds would be paid back over time with some interest on top.  There would be a premium to make it attractive.  Not too many people can put their hands in their pocket and pull out &euro;33,000, particularly if they are paying a mortgage, etc.  </p> <p>  I recently introduced a Bill on microgeneration which refers specifically to solar energy.  Students might be interested in having a look at it.  I would be interested in hearing their views on that Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  Political support might be generated from other parties to try to get it through the House, something we would also welcome.  However, what other renewable resources do the delegates believe could be used?  Solar energy has been mentioned, with solar panels on a roof, but I can see them having very little effect in some places.  On what can we make the big win fairly quickly?  There is no quick fix.</p></speech>

In 2017, 37% of homes were built with a renewal heating system.  That means that between now and 2050 we will have to retrofit 63% of homes.  I urge the committee to prevent the imposition of that huge cost on the Exchequer.</p></speech>

That is an important point to make.</p> <p>  The two questions about financing are very important.  We have engaged directly with the banks which have told us that they would be delighted to lend money, as that is their business.  However, it cannot be done without scale.  We have tried desperately hard to scale up and 33,000 homes is a large turnover in two years.  What we need to do is have a strong stable commitment at a policy level.  About 500 people have already applied to us and we are trying to deal with them.  Obviously, there is a capacity issue in the marketplace.  However, a carbon tax is very important to drive people into it because only some will understand the grants scheme and so on.</p> <p>  The other key aspect, looking at green bonds and what other countries have done across Europe, is that the models at we have looked more or less combine public good banks such as KfW in Germany with local parties such as local energy agencies and others like them.  We need the two to work together.  I strongly encourage the committee to consider a slight rebalancing from capital grants towards capital grants and current expenditure support.</p><p>I encourage the committee to consider a slight rebalancing of supports from capital grants to capital grants and current expenditure.  We need advisers.  Upper Austria has gone from 2% to 50% renewable heat and in a region the size of Munster they have 45 publicly-funded advisers to give advice to homeowners and so on.  That is what we do and, thankfully, with the likes of the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Electricity Supply Board, ESB and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI we have been able to fund some of it.  We need a lot more of it because people do not know.  </p><p> What is the big win in terms of microgen?  Solar is very important at one level; of the super-homes, I think about 80% would have solar PV.  It is very much part of the solution and will generate roughly 2,000 units of energy for what we usually put on homes.  However, it is just a part.  The other main microgeneration technology is heat pumps.  A heat pump is coupled with a solar panel on the roof.  The sun hits the solar panel and powers the heat pump.  That provides a huge amount of energy from the sun, essentially.  This goes back to Deputy Eamon Ryan's comment that solar should not be overlooked.  It is really important that the two go together, with the solar heat from the pump and the solar panel coupled together as part of a retrofit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Teahon" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018012300002#K00200"><p>Floating wind turbines are on the way.  The technology is developing very rapidly.  There is huge potential there for Ireland after the cases we are talking about.</p> <p>  To tackle Deputy Ryan's question, we believe technology-specific auctions for offshore wind would be for a given number of megawatts.  Even in our most optimistic moments, we do not believe the first auction would be for 2,500 MW but for a much smaller figure.  Therefore there will be significant competition between the four companies.  They will be competing for let us say 500 MW.  Each witness has identified already that we will have to have partners in the areas the Deputy speaks about.  This has transpired already.  I will ask Mr. Connell to say what is happening with Oriel Wind Farm but it has happened already.  I am involved in the Codling Bank project.  We received approaches from ten different people at the level of Vattenfall and similar after the Oriel announcement.  I think we can take it that there will be competition and we will see the big operators playing in the Irish Sea, which will contribute to the prices coming down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Garrett Connell" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018012300002#K00300"><p>On the Oriel example, we brought in Parkwind, which is the leading offshore wind developer in Belgium.  It has delivered three projects to date and is currently building the fourth.  It is a key example of the type of expertise we will need to bring into the Irish projects that are developing.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan asked a question on the auction structure.  What we really need is a practical solution that can be delivered quickly if offshore is to be part of the mix to meet our 2020 targets or to come in soon afterwards.  There are numerous examples across Europe of this type of auction scheme.  The UK is a good example.  They have technology-specific pots that are allocated and that have certain caps by technology and by the amount of support they can provide.  They have been very successful in reducing the cost of offshore wind in the UK.  It is also worth mentioning that direct negotiation for a tariff has been a common method of bringing offshore wind projects forward in the early days of a new system.  This is possible under the state aid scheme as well under certain conditions, such as where there is limited capacity for an auction or limited ability of other projects to compete.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dan O'Connor" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018012300002#K00400"><p>I am representing Brian Britton on behalf of Oriel.  Brian is not well at the moment.  I had a different hat on 15 years ago when I worked in General Electric and we supplied the turbines to Arklow.  At that time, Ireland was in the lead and those projects were world firsts.  It is incredibly sad that 15 years on, nothing has happened.  A number of projects are in really good shape and ready to go.  I was involved in bringing in the Parkwind transaction and can confirm that there are many investors who are absolutely willing to get involved.  This is not a 2030 issue; these guys are ready to go now.  This can be delivered in the early 2020s.  We were in the lead 15 years ago but now the rest of Europe has overtaken us.  Only very simple things need to be done, particularly for this committee.  We need a really strong message from Government that this is part of policy and that offshore in particular can play an important role.  It is complicated because there are a number of Departments.  Mr. Manly is representing the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  However, there are other issues in respect of planning, the grid and energy.  We need a system that allows them to work together.  If we can get that, I can confirm that investors are out there ready and willing to invest.  Most of those parties are surprised that Ireland has not taken the lead on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Wheeler" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018012300002#K00500"><p>To address Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments with regard to the auction and the signals, there is something of which we need to be really aware.  Currently, there is around 15 GW of offshore wind deployed across Europe.  The target is to get that to 100 GW by 2030.  In order for Ireland to play its part in the industry and really take advantage of the supply chain benefits that will come from work on that scale and that have already come, we need to send clear signals.  As my colleagues in NOW Ireland have indicated, it is incredibly important that a clear policy comes out to support offshore wind so that we can be part of that industry.  In respect of jobs creation and inward investment, my own company, SSE, has already invested over &euro;2.5 billion in the last ten years.  We are one of the investors that want to continue investing but we need clear signals.  Once they are given the competition and the big players will come.  As Mr. O'Connor has just said, they are already interested in Ireland.  We have to show our credentials to really be part of this industry.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley raised wind intermittency.  Members may have seen that over Christmas we reached record levels on the island of Ireland, when over 67% of our energy requirement was delivered through renewable resources.  That was for one half-hour period.  However, it really does show the fantastic work that companies like EirGrid have done in allowing renewables to penetrate the system and work within it.  The Deputy is right that the wind does not always blow.  However, it actually blows a lot.  To avoid intermittency issues, we need what we already have, namely, VS3 programmes that are already kicking off to support and drive flexibility.  As well as wind, we also own and operate thermal stations.  Great Ireland has a 460 MW combined cycle gas turbine, CCGT, in Wexford, which is the most efficient in the plant.  When the wind is not blowing, it is about ensuring we have the flexibility that the traditional, cleaner plants can actually come on in the time that is required.  We are world leaders in how we adopt renewables and bring them onto our system without causing significant issues.  EirGrid should be given a lot of credit for that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about our seven turbines at the Arklow bank.  That was done with GE back in the day.  It is disappointing that we are sitting here today and still have not seen that grow.  It could potentially be delivered well within the 2020 timelines but we need the decisions now.  There is no point in 2018 or 2019 saying we are going to have an offshore option.  We will not hit the 2020 timelines if that is the case.  It is really important that we see action now as distinct from a couple of years down the road.  As I said in my presentation, we have had huge success in delivering onshore wind to date - nearly 4 GW of onshore wind on the island of Ireland.  We should be incredibly proud of that.  I have been in this business for over 15 years.  I have been on the ground and have seen the challenges and complexities, whether they be social acceptance, grid, or planning challenges.  It is becoming more and more difficult.  The future is not about one technology but many complementary technologies in onshore wind, solar and offshore wind.  The big advantage of offshore wind is the scale.  This can be deployed at scale by big international and local partners over a very short period.  That is something we now need to be a part of.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked about Brexit implications with regard to interconnection.  To keep the interconnectors up and going is incredibly important.</p><p>The east-west interconnector has proven it is already a really important part of infrastructure.  We also need to be clear that it is one thing to talk about exporting but first and foremost we need to look at our domestic demand requirement and as targets grow beyond 2020 out to 2030 we are talking potentially 30% to 35%.  We will have a job in its own right to deliver against those targets locally before we even get to thinking about exporting.  The reality right now is that we are off our target for 2020.  We need to accelerate the delivery to 2020 to hit that target and then go beyond that.  Brexit will play out and at this stage I do not know what the outcome of it will be.  Most important, there is an opportunity here to deliver on our domestic targets and we need to make sure that all the technologies are supported to do so.</p></speech>

There may be a perception out there that offshore wind is something that could be delivered in the late 2020s but offshore wind has the advantage of scale and location.  Large-scale projects can be connected to existing grid infrastructure very quickly and these projects are well progressed through the planning process so they can be delivered in time to help meet our 2020 targets.</p></speech>

From a developer's point of view efficiency is always sought after but we recognise that the process needs to be robust, defensible and have public involvement in the planning process as well.  The projects that we are involved in are in a process already.  We know the Departments are looking at a maritime and foreshore Bill for offshore infrastructure, which is very positive, but an ask that we have is that in the meantime the projects in the system are not stalled because for all the points we have made we need them to deliver soon to meet our targets.</p></speech>

We are here to provide the committee with an update on the tracker mortgage issue, the progress to date and the work being done to bring this to a conclusion for our impacted customers.  I am joined today by members of my executive team, Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Mr. Robert Mulhall and Mr. Tom Kinsella</p> <p>  Since 26 September 26 when we last discussed the tracker mortgage issue with this committee, there has been ongoing and understandable public and political criticism of the banking industry&rsquo;s handling of the matter.  In the course of that debate, many questions have been raised about how we got to this point.  Fundamentally there are three areas where key questions arise.  The first is how the problem arose, the second is how the bank has responded and the third is the current status. </p> <p>  In terms of how the problem arose, it is helpful at the outset to articulate the circumstances, as we understand them, that existed at the time the original decision was made.  The tracker mortgage product was introduced in 2002 at a time when wholesale market funding for banks was readily available and referenced off European Central Bank, ECB, rates.  The tracker product had its interest rate based on ECB rates, plus an appropriate margin.  As the 2008 financial crisis devastated economies globally, banks across many countries, including Ireland, were experiencing severe liquidity difficulties and the wholesale markets effectively closed or radically repriced credit causing the dislocation of funding from the ECB rate.  Faced with this reality, AIB, initially in the second quarter of 2008, began to increase the tracker product margin.  Things moved very rapidly and a month after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the introduction of the Government guarantee scheme, the tracker product had very quickly become unsustainable.  The tracker as a new product offering became redundant due to the scale of the margin increase required to reflect the rising cost of funding.  The decision which was taken in late 2008 was to no longer make the product available for new customers.  In other words, tracker mortgages were no longer offered to new customers but remained in place for those already holding one.  Contrary to a widely held view, approximately 104,000 AIB and Educational Building Society, EBS, customer accounts, which at the time of the decision were on tracker mortgages were not affected by this decision and retained their rate.  The unforeseen and unintended consequence of this decision was that certain customers who held a tracker product at some point previously but had already moved off the tracker product prior to this decision were not able to revert to the tracker product.  It is clear that the potential fallout of the decision to stop offering the tracker product to new customers was not considered in terms of how existing customers might be impacted in the future, as some of these customers had a right to revert to a tracker product.  This clearly should not have happened. </p> <p>  In terms of how the bank responded, the differential that would later develop between the bank&rsquo;s standard variable rate, SVR, and historical tracker mortgage rates and the unprecedented duration of the historically low ECB rates clearly amplified the initial error.  In addition, the difficulty was compounded by limited legacy IT systems and operational failures in AIB and EBS when it merged with AIB in 2011.  The systems did not record the bank's proper commitments and obligations to its customers.</p><p>While the failure to consider the impact on customers was not deliberate, it is a failure that should not have happened and we apologise for this.  Where complaints occurred, they were initially infrequent and were dealt with by the bank on an individual basis as each arose.  Legal advice and the initial outcome of cases taken to the ombudsman supported the bank&rsquo;s position.  With the benefit of hindsight, this was a too bank-centred approach.</p><p> In August 2015, following the identification of a particular issue involving certain EBS customers, and in the context of wider industry developments at the time, an analysis of the tracker issue was conducted within AIB.  We commenced a significant programme of work which ultimately scaled up to 500 bank personnel dedicated to the programme.  The bank over time conducted an analysis of circa 650,000 accounts to establish what we were dealing with.  From the outset, we conducted our review by looking at contractual obligations but also examined whether proper levels of transparency and information were made available to customers that would enable them to make appropriate decisions in their own best interests.  We sought to establish how the product was designed, administered and ultimately discontinued.</p><p> Issues identified included contractual breaches and-or unclear marketing, as well as process weaknesses.  Eventually, more than 30 different customer groupings were recognised as impacted across AIB and EBS.  Thus it became apparent that while we wanted to build early momentum in the programme, we would not be able to arrive at a one-size-fits-all solution.  Essentially, impacted customers fell into three broad categories: those not on a tracker rate but who were entitled to revert to a tracker; those who remained on a tracker rate but were incorrectly charged a higher margin for a period of time; and those who were never on a tracker rate but who had a contractual option to be offered a prevailing tracker rate at the end of their fixed rate period.</p><p> On the basis of what we believed to be the scale of the problem, the bank set aside a provision of &euro;190 million to cover the anticipated costs involved.  We worked to ensure full compliance with the Central Bank framework that issued in December 2015, which included a fully independent third party review and an appeals process.  We submitted to the Central Bank in 2016 our approach to rate rectification and compensation.  Since then, we have continued to implement that programme, completing all the required steps under the Central Bank of Ireland framework.</p><p> Members will have seen from information provided directly to the committee and from other recent bank statements that by the end of quarter 1 2018, all 3,509 customers who were identified as not on the tracker rate as they should have been will be redressed and compensated.  Approximately 96% of these been completed.  By the end of quarter 1 2018, all 939 customers incorrectly charged a higher margin for a period of time &ndash; most impacted by less than &euro;500 &ndash; will be redressed and compensated.  A total of 81% have been completed.  For these categories, customer accounts have been returned to their own historic tracker mortgage rate.  In addition, as noted in our December 2017 review, the following are now included and will be redressed: by the end of quarter 1 2018, the customers who were never on a tracker mortgage - our initial estimate of 4,000 was published in December - but who could not avail of one because it was withdrawn, will each receive compensation of &euro;1,000 plus &euro;615 towards independent advice.  This group was included in the review in December 2017.  By the end of quarter 2, a further 900 customers will be reverted to their own tracker rate and will be redressed and compensated.</p><p> I fully accept the need for real urgency in bringing this issue to a close, most especially in the interests of the impacted customers.  AIB continues to focus very significant energy and resources to ensure we reach a conclusion as quickly as possible.  The bank has many challenges and opportunities as we face into 2018.  Resolution of this tracker issue is clearly a priority.  I am not in a position to make any new financial disclosures today as we are in a close period, but in our trading update issued in December, the bank reported that it is on track to deliver a full year financial performance materially in line with market expectations.</p><p> As I have said to the committee previously, AIB is deeply conscious of the adverse effect this issue has had on impacted customers.  Many people are angry as a result of the treatment they encountered and I apologise again for this on behalf of the bank.  AIB's culture and reputation can only stand on the foundation of fair treatment for the customer.  Where we fall short of this standard, it undermines our values and the credibility of the bank.  We cannot allow that as we seek to put the interests of our customers first and to rebuild the bank and its reputation.  We will continue to work hard until the programme is finished and we intend to reach that point by mid-2018.  Customers are assured that payments they receive under the redress scheme will not compromise their right to appeal and, therefore, we can reasonably expect that cases might flow on from this for some time after the date we have indicated.  However, AIB, for its part, will have concluded the overwhelming majority of its redress and compensation programme within months.</p><p> I thank the committee again for inviting us and we look forward to questions.</p></speech>

He said that in late 2008 the bank withdrew the tracker product and "the unforeseen and unintended consequence of this decision was that certain customers, who held a tracker product at some point previously but had already moved off the tracker product prior to this decision, were not able to revert to the tracker product".  While that was unintended and unforeseen, they had a contractual entitlement to revert to a tracker, the terms of which were defined in their contract.  How could the bank have thought at that time that because it had withdrawn a tracker product that those customers, whose contracts stated they had the right to return to a tracker product, would not be so entitled?  How could that be "unforeseen and unintended"?</p></speech>

As we have gone through each cohort, we have tried to look at the underlying circumstances that gave rise to these issues.  What we have done in respect of that is go back and, ultimately, one had to back to what was the decision to exit the tracker product.  The decision that was made in 2008 was to take away the tracker product for new customers.  That was a discrete decision.  There was no consideration based on what we can see of consequences of that decision elsewhere.  The decision was around whether the tracker product would remain for new customers.  That was the decision that was clearly made at that point in time and, as I have mentioned, another aspect of that - and this just flowed from it - was that any customer who was on a tracker stayed on a tracker.  There were 104,000 customers.</p></speech>

In addition, we look at their affordability to see if customers would have been able to afford that rate.  The homes that were lost were all sales as opposed to repossessions, so they would have gone through a forbearance process and identified the sale of the property.  In identifying that grouping, we identified the tracker rate, calculated the affordability of the customer and, to allow flexibility, we built in 15% extra affordability because of the nature of the issue we were facing.  We looked at what was the most favourable forbearance option that could have been provided to the customer so that we minimised the repayment amount as much as we could.  If we put them through the forbearance structure, what we would then get to would be the minimum repayment amount versus the maximum affordability that we could find related to it.  On that basis, we would compensate and we take a series of actions relating to the compensation.  There is the refund of any overpayments on the account itself and the account was rebuilt right back to the date on which the error occurred.  Transaction statements are rebuilt line by line so that we put it back exactly as it was.</p></speech>

In looking at and deriving compensation for this particular grouping, we look at the future value of the tracker which they lost, so there is a compensation payment for that.  There is a compensation payment for the loss of value on the property that would have arisen had they managed to hold the property during that period.  There is a write-down of any residual debt associated with it, compensation for time value of money and general compensation on top of that.  It is based on people being in a property of a similar position to the compensation value that is derived and then clearing out any other obligations.  I am not saying that is the right answer but it is the one that we think is trying to be reasonable or address effectively the position of that customer and the loss of value of that property.</p></speech>

The compensation percentage runs from 15%, for the vast majority, some 85% of customers, to the 22% range for customers who had entered the legal process, 22% for customers where the property has been sold but the rate has not been deemed causal and, finally, for those most severely impacted, the 14 customers we spoke about, the compensation rate is 30%.  On top of that are the compensation procedures that Mr. Byrne talked about.  On top of that again is a minimum payment of &euro;50,000 per customer.</p></speech>

As a result of the engagement with the Central Bank over the past quarter, its main objective was to get customers into the framework so that they would have the protection of the framework and that is how we arrived at the significant increase of those numbers coming in.  We have not looked at those customers as being impacted because of the detriment issue.  We do not view them as having lost as a result of the tracker issue.  We might talk about that later.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Mulhall" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018012300002#F00400"><p>I will respond to the previous point first and then lead into how we calculate the prevailing rate.  Quite specifically, if customers started on a tracker mortgage then section 1 of their contract would have indicated the margin for their tracker mortgage.  I think that is what the Deputy is referring to.  The 4,000 customers we are talking about, however, did not start on a tracker mortgage so no such mortgage margin was defined in section 1.  I think that is where the Deputy is trying to get to in respect of that clause 3.6.</p> <p>  To define a prevailing rate we looked at the underlying funding costs in the market at the time.  It is worth noting that in 2008 and 2009 in the UK, where trackers were not withdrawn in some instances, tracker mortgages went up to 7% and exceeded that.  The reference rate for what was likely to happen given the funding environment makes clear that it would have been a very expensive product.  We considered it from the point of view of cost of funds, cost of risk etc. and had that verified by an external party to ensure independence and that it was a fair treatment of what the model would have told in terms of what the prevailing rates would have been in the intervening period.  </p></speech>

They are not entitled to go onto a tracker at the prevailing rate today.</p></speech>

To respond to the earlier point, that is the basis for how much the bank was maybe incorrect in its decision in the past, whereby it was interpreting the then prevailing rate in these instances as the tracker product had been withdrawn, therefore there was no such offer to be made to customers.  That applied to customers who had and did not have trackers and we have now rectified that situation.</p> <p>  For clarity, we have returned people who previously held a tracker to their historic margin.  That is 640 customers and that was completed in the latter half of 2016 and early 2017. </p></speech>

The individual would fix for three years or so and the conditions in clause 3.2 were that after the fixed period it would be the prevailing rate.

Therefore there was not a contractual position associated with a tracker.  They would have been entitled to an offer of a variable rate mortgage or a fixed rate.  That was under the terms and conditions of their contract.  Upon final examination in respect of that, and when the Central Bank as part of its programme spoke about its broad perspective on the industry and the weighting to be given to marketing materials over contractual materials, we decided that we should include them.  That effectively meant that any customer who ever had a tracker in that context would therefore be entitled to go back onto that tracker rate, as a result of giving more weight to the marketing materials than the contractual ones.</p></speech>

They started out with a tracker and then went on to a fixed period.  When they rolled off their fixed, the tracker product was no longer available as an option.

To tell the truth, my blood pressure continued to increase because I simply do not believe what I heard.  I do not believe that IT systems can be blamed and that the effects were not considered at the time.  I know Mr. Byrne was not there at the time but I want to tell him that I believe that it was not just an accident.   I do not believe people when they say: "Ah, we discontinued the scheme in 2008 and we did not consider that thousands of our customers had the contractual right to go on to trackers."  The reason I say I do not believe AIB is because customers approached it and made complaints.  They told the bank about their entitlement long before any examination by AIB in 2015.  What did AIB do?  AIB pulled down the shutters, told people to hit the high road and told people they were wrong.  When the matter was brought to the bank's attention by individuals it did not correct the matter.</p></speech>

In the opening statement we talked about the period after that.  We identified and recognised that complaints came in.  We have said that there was a very small number of complaints, and they were.  In the scheme of where the organisation was and where things were, there was a tiny number of complaints.  A number of those complaints were made and passed on through the ombudsman, and the ombudsman did find in favour of the bank in terms of its position.  At that point in time, people understood the position that the bank was adopting and, principally, these were around rate-type issues, and that actually there was a reasonable position that the bank was adopting in respect of that offering.</p> <p>  It was only later on, and the period that we are talking about now is into the 2015 period, when the prevailing rate issue started to emerge more in the ombudsman-type issue.  Broader issues were taking place across the industry at that point in time.  We identified a particular group in respect of an EBS offering, which we have not talked about.  It is a price promise offering, which also sat on a 3,500 group that Mr. Kinsella has talked about.  All of those issue came and we said that we need to look at this because there is enough indication now that there is a problem.  That was when, in August 2015, we started the programme around looking at the whole tracker issue, and started to step up our position on that. </p></speech>

They had identified some issues in relation to terms and conditions that existed.  At the time there was a restitution or a group of customers identified within AIB, within our broker business, who had specific terms and conditions that were not clear in terms of what would happen with the outcome post the fixed term piece.  As we have identified in our document, there were 200 customers restituted or redressed at that point in time.</p> <p>  In addition, one of the key findings of the review conducted by the Central Bank at the time was that, in general, there had been no process around warning customers as they were stepping off a tracker on to other things, or changing the contract for different reasons.  There was no warning in place to the customers.  That was one of the key findings at the time, and that was implemented at that point to create that warning as people would exit.  That would have then pertained to customers in all of these groupings.  In terms of the 4,000 customers, and the 900 customers, that warning letter would have been put into place to protect customers as they went forward.  </p></speech>

AIB now recognises that those people had a contractual obligation under law but AIB denied them that right at the time.</p></speech>

That was the first one that we really became aware of that said, "actually, there is an issue here."  That was because there was a price promise in terms of a commitment to the customer, which had not been reflected in the way that rates were dealt with as those customers moved from one contractual position to another.</p></speech>

The initial 3,500 people were made up of over 30 different groupings in terms of what happened.  I know that the Deputy does not favour the use of the term "unintended consequences" but various circumstances created each of those groupings.  The grouping that Mr. Byrne referred to was the grouping that came to light in 2015.  We have talked about the prevailing tracker item.  That was something that we were aware of in terms of the contract status of that.  The EBS grouping that emerged at the time was whereby customers had moved from one rate to another rate.  In the first rate that they were on they had been given a price promise that their rate would never go above a certain percentage.  When they had been moved that promise was dropped.  They had lost that promise.  At that point, when we identified that issue and, indeed, with the other issues that were emerging in the market, what was identified was - and we have spoken a lot about the groupings just now - that there could be inherent issues in the book that had not come to light during that intervening period.  That is then what caused us to go through the analysis and resulted in the-----</p></speech>

AIB deserves a pat on the back for finally taking action in 2015 on the EBS stuff and at a time when the courts had decided that banks - AIB's competitors - were wrong and were involved in what I would call "grand theft" of their customers.</p> <p>  I shall return to discussing the customers who came knocking on the door of AIB.  They told AIB that they believed they were contractually robbed by it in terms of not being given a tracker mortgage.  Has any of those customers been put back on a tracker mortgage?  Whatever about the ombudsman, the first port of call is that AIB must tell its customers that they are wrong and that the bank is right.  Has AIB reversed any of its decisions that it made in those earlier years?  </p></speech>

All of them did the same.   None of these 9,000 customers ended up better off with more money in their pockets.  They were not granted additional houses.  AIB took the houses off them.  This committee will hear from the Bank of Ireland that it did the exact same thing.  We are supposed to believe that this issue arose due to unintended consequences.  We are supposed to believe that some of the highest paid individuals in the history of the State sat around board tables and decided to discontinue a product in 2008 without realising that 9,000 of their customers had a contractual obligation.  I cannot swallow that guff and I do not think the bank should ask the public to swallow it.  It was in the interest of the bank to move people off trackers.  What I have heard here is that anybody who could have been moved off was moved off.  The only problem that the officials had as bankers, and I am not talking personally but AIB corporate, is that they could not get rid of the other hundreds of thousands of people who had trackers at that point in time because they clearly had it written into their contracts.</p><p>As a result, AIB could not figure out a way to swindle them out of their own money.  That is what I believe happened and I think it will continue to happen.</p></speech>

Hindsight often makes it easy to have a certain narrative.  At the time those decisions were made, rates were where they were and decisions were made.  We have gone through an unprecedented period in terms of the decade that followed.  We have talked, it is to be hoped openly, about the issues that occurred with each customer grouping as they happened and developed.  That is the situation.

Obviously, when the decisions were being made originally, the bank sought legal advice as to whether it could end the contracts and what its contractual obligations would be.  It sought legal advice specifically.</p></speech>

The decision was that this offering was being taken away so that was that decision.  As far as I can see, it would not have involved a legal consideration about whether that would or would not have been offered to customers.  What we have talked about is that clearly the consequence of that, which was much more detailed and involved, as we now know, was not properly thought through, so that would speak to the point about which the Senator is talking, which is that if people had really thought it through, they would have gone through that process, but that did not happen.</p></speech>

That is the first thing anybody would do in terms of changing somebody's contract or looking at somebody's contractual obligations.  It is absolutely astonishing.  I have a question about the 4,000 people who had the contractual right to a tracker.  Why are they different?  Why are they not getting full redress and compensation?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the decision made was that this product would have been priced at a level that would have made it unattractive so it was withdrawn from the market.  Therefore, the decision was that these customers were not disadvantaged from a commercial point of view because the prevailing rate tracker would have been unattractive and that is why they are not included in the confines of the other option about which the Senator is talking.  That is the answer to the question.</p></speech>

Certainly in terms of processes and procedures that exist at this stage, all products and all product decisions think forward and backwards in terms of the impact and the obligations.  We have a full understanding of the obligations that sit in every product and every contract and we have done a lot of work to make sure we understand those, which was not the case historically.</p> <p>  We have had a complete change in terms of the leadership, the board and senior management teams across the organisation.  This is to give us a fresh perspective on where we are.  We have introduced quite a diverse leadership team in terms of banking and non-banking positions to make sure we have a different perspective.</p> <p>  We have a performance management system across the organisation that in respect of the assessment of individual performance assesses 50% on what someone does and 50% on how they go about doing it so how people do their job, and that includes interactions with customers, is just as important as what they actually get done.  Historically, effectively, 100% of assessment would have been on the what side.  We have a net promoter score system that allows us 30,000 individual customer contacts every quarter to understand the customer's perspective in respect of each of our product offerings and each of our customer journeys and we rank, rate and track those.  In respect of complaints, which historically would not have been analysed as forensically, we have a complaints team that effectively analyses them and looks for root causes.</p><p>Even small modest numbers of complaints would be picked up now and we would understand what the underlying causes were in respect of those.</p><p> Staff engagement is very important.  We have spent a significant amount of time working with our own staff to understand what they feel about the organisation.  We carried out our first assessment in respect of that in 2013.  Obviously morale was very low at that time and the position was very difficult.  The bank was ranked very low at the fifth percentile in terms of comparable organisations in a worldwide survey.  When we last completed the survey in November, we had reached the 62nd percentile, which is quite good and shows we are moving in the right direction, with engaged staff, interest in the customer and having adopted a number of pillars across the organisation.</p><p> I ask my colleague, Mr. Mulhall, to answer the Senator's question on the customer perspective in terms of bank branches.</p></speech>

Let us remember that we have had to fix the bank.  During the period that we are talking about the bank lost &euro;19 billion operationally and an extra &euro;9 billion of losses was associated with the transfer of assets to NAMA.  That is the size and scale of what happened operationally.  Over the period we have taken &euro;450 million of operating cost out and grown the income side by &euro;800 million, so &euro;1.3 billion has been dealt with in respect of that.  A lot of things have happened and changed across the organisation, including building much more resilient and much more reliable systems.</p> <p>  The conduct agenda and the prudential regulation agenda have moved on hugely.  Therefore, the amount of supervision and intervention in the organisation is radically different.  We are moving in a direction.  We have not in any way achieved what we want in terms of the final position but I think we are on a journey to get to a better place.</p></speech>

I would put the context the other way around.  We will have a different view on prevailing rate.  Let us all accept that we have a different view.  Approximately speaking, the total number of customers under this framework who are being put into a position where a tracker has been reinstated for them is about 4,000.  The approximate income, and I will try to estimate the number based on average balance, is about &euro;170,000.  The interest rate differential is probably between &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million per annum in terms of the operational impact across the organisation.  This was at a time when the overall income and cost base of the bank changed by &euro;1.3 billion.  It would not have been a logical place for the bank to focus a lot of resources on getting this deliberately wrong.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Byrne saying that it is a happy coincidence that the bank made a decision not to offer tracker mortgages which had unforeseen and unintended consequences in the form of a benefit to the bank of between &euro;80 million and &euro;100 million?  Is the windfall purely a happy coincidence for the bank?</p></speech>

First, plenty of other mistakes were made that went the other way.  We do not talk about them, nor should we, because they are issues where we found that the bank was equal in terms of the flaws on the other side.  Those are issues that clearly are not of importance in terms of fixing a customer issue because the customer benefited and he or she kept that benefit.</p> <p>  Second, because of the size of the bank and its balance sheet, it is very hard to make a small mistake. Any mistake that is made will end up being a big financial mistake.  It is a business that makes in excess of &euro;1.2 billion of operating profit.  We have a balance sheet of close to &euro;100 billion.  Therefore, a very small mistake multiplied by that will mean we will end up dealing with large numbers.</p></speech>

What I said was any mistake the bank makes, no matter how small, will end up having a consequence.  I was giving a context.  I did not talk about this issue in that regard.</p></speech>

He minimised the issue.  He has said that, in the context of all of the money that the bank has, it is not that much money and it is purely a coincidence that the bank benefited from the mistake.  He said that, first, it is a coincidence that the bank made decisions that resulted in people not being entitled to go back onto tracker mortgages.</p></speech>

The bank was not in a position to make the right decisions for a whole series of things.  That is the context I tried to provide.  We are looking at this issue, rightly, as an issue that affected individual customers and should not have occurred.  To put the matter in context, there are a series of other things that need to be borne in mind.</p></speech>

As I understand from the opening statement, the decisions made about tracker mortgages were not made as decisions to improve the profitability of the banks or to deny people's contractual rights to a tracker mortgage and that these were an unforeseen consequence.  Is that what Mr. Byrne has said?</p></speech>

The piece that flowed over the decade that followed was not part of that decision piece.  The decision piece was around a new product.</p></speech>

Correct.  Is he saying that it was an unforeseen and unintended consequence and meant that people who were coming off fixed mortgages were not entitled to what they were entitled to, which was to go onto tracker mortgages?</p></speech>

The other sets of decisions that were made occurred over a period of time.  For example, in 2011, the forward ECB rate was at 3.5%.  That was the market rate for ECB rates.  It was not immediately obvious in 2011, for example.  We are looking back at the history of this where a tracker product at that point in time was instantly the best product because the market was assuming that ECB rates were getting back to that level at that point in time.  However, they did not; we all know that did not occur.  It was not that there was a light switch moment that occurred forever and that we moved to a decade of incredibly low rates; some of those things evolved afterwards.  There is a separation in terms of one decision and then the consequences played out in a different time period.  It should have been thought through-----</p></speech>

We have taken a series of steps in the organisation.  We believe that those are taking hold and we are developing and delivering a different type of organisation as we go forward.  We think we are on the journey.  I do not accept the point that we have not tried to do anything.  We are trying to do things and some of those are having a meaningful impact in terms of how the organisation is different and is improving.  This issue is a scar and is not one that any of us would have wanted to happen but, in terms of the overall perspective of what we are trying to do, we are trying to improve the organisation and the culture.</p></speech>

We have four pillars in the organisation that we try to build everything around, the first of which is customer first.  We know we have more to do on it, but that is absolutely where we are at.

We now have a centralised complaints team to make it much easier for customers to get satisfaction in terms of that.  That has reduced waiting times from 28 days down to 11 days.  That team is based in Limerick.  In every branch in the country we have a resolver role, which is played by somebody senior in the branch who is authorised to deal with complaints involving up to &euro;750 on the spot, to deal with a complaint from a first point of contract for a customer.  That is an example of how we are trying to put our customers first.</p></speech>

The contracts are very different.  EBS was a separate entity at the time, so the contracts have very different wording.  The EBS contract is unique and very different from the AIB situation around the prevailing rates.  In terms of the decisions we have made, 1,600 people have been restored to their tracker product now within EBS, as we described earlier.  It is largely around the price promise issue and the incorrect supplying of terms and conditions associated with a product that gave a customer the perception of a right associated with that product.</p></speech>

The systems did not record the bank's proper commitments and obligations to its customers.  </blockquote><p>Did that relate to both EBS and AIB?</p></speech>

I do not buy that argument.  I do not buy that the bank did not have a record of the commitments and obligations of the banks.  If the banks were enforcing them with customers, they would have them in chapter and verse.  It has echoes of "the dog ate my homework".</p> <p>  Am I correct in saying the bank has identified, based on the figures I extracted from Mr. Byrne's presentation, roughly 9,348 customers who are affected?  There are 3,509 in the first category, who were on the wrong tracker rate; 939 in the group who were on a higher margin than they should have been on; 4,000 in the group that signed up to a fixed rate but had the option at the end of the fixed rate period to go on the prevailing tracker at that time; and the final cohort of 900 customers who signed up on a tracker, went to a fixed rate, and although there was nothing definitive, they felt it was implied in the contract that they could go back on a tracker rate.  That figure comes to 9,348.  Is that the correct figure?</p></speech>

This is the conversation that has been well rehearsed at this point in time.  The position we have, which is the one the Central Bank talked about, is that the prevailing tracker rate would have been at a prohibitively expensive rate and therefore the customer was not denied an attractive commercial offer at that point in time.  Therefore, the compensation is to do with the failure to deliver the contractual offer, not that there was a financial loss associated with not being offered that product.  It is a very different position than somebody who had an existing tracker margin and was able to go back to it.</p></speech>

It is not true that they are all still on tracker mortgages today because some have redeemed their mortgages but effectively 77% of them are still on tracker mortgages.  That group did not change.  They probably were not subject to any review because effectively they were on a tracker, kept their tracker margin, and still have that tracker product.  The contractual review was in respect of all the other contracts, amendments, modifications and top-ups that took place across both institutions over the period to understand if there was any correspondence or communication during that period, all the way back to 2002, which might have resulted in a consequential obligation in respect of tracker, open and closed.

The context is that many of the loans were backed by the value of the core asset, be it the farm or business.  Many of the borrowers now feel they are being held over a barrel by the banks in that the banks are seeking to realise the value of their debt through the sale of the asset that constitutes their livelihood.

If I am thinking of the right contract, I believe the customer has the option of a fixed rate or variable rate if he or she was offered the prevailing rate.  If he or she decides not to take the prevailing rate, or if he or she did not come back to the bank at all, he or she reverts to the standard variable rate, SVR.  That is what is agreed.  If the customer has refused the prevailing rate, he or she selects either the fixed rate or standard variable rate.</p></speech>

Have the delegates examined this?  Obviously, if there are legal considerations, Mr. Byrne will not give me his view on it.</p> <p>  We receive correspondence here regarding Belfry, general overcharging within AIB on business loans and so on.  When the bank receives a number of complaints in this regard, does it conduct a general inquiry into how its rates are applied?  If there is overcharging, does the bank address it?  Did the bank examine the Belfry matter?  Is there any aspect of it that is not contentious or that will not end up in the legal arena?</p></speech>

That was certainly well researched and a certain position has been adopted.  It is going through a legal process.</p> <p>  The general position on complaints is that we now have a very active approach.  We track individual complaints and try to identify any thematic issues that would not have arisen in the past.  This is to make sure we understand, where there is a series of complaints on a topic, the root cause and whether there is an issue such as the one the Chairman is talking about.</p></speech>

An issue has been raised regarding the main company name, which is Allied Irish Banks, plc.  In a small number of cases &mdash; one can imagine the volume of cases &mdash; the comma was left out.  I will return to the question of the other entities in a moment.  What happens when the comma is left out?  From the bank's perspective or from a litigation point of view, it is an error.  When the bank goes to court, there is first a request that the change be made.  The court satisfies itself that the debt is owed, that it is owed to the appropriate entity, that the issue is, for all intents and purposes, a clerical one, and that the bank is not trying to create a situation whereby the debt would be owed to a different entity.</p><p>In the cases that I have looked at, the court gets to that remedy in a reasonably straightforward fashion, moves on from that point and is able to deal with that because it is able to satisfy itself that this money is owing to the entity <i>in situ</i>.  We have multiple entities in the group.  Part of that was due to the merger of EBS in 2011.  My colleague would have talked through the volume of companies at the last meeting but I will address the different legal entities.  We will have EBS itself as an entity, EBS Mortgage Finance and AIB Mortgage Bank, where some of the mortgage loans are domiciled and therefore legal cases are taken under those legal entities.  The specific issue with the comma, as my colleague would have spoken about at the last meeting, arises in the instance that I highlighted.</p></speech>

Taking up Deputy Doherty's suggestion, will AIB provide a<i>pro forma </i>mortgage contract in respect of the prevailing rate issue?  It would be a typical redacted contract which deals with the clauses 3.2 and 3.6, and the letter of offer with customer details redacted.  If there are other variations which represent significant cohorts within that overall cohort, then that should be provided as well.  When Mr. Byrne was before the committee last month to speak on a different issue, he made remarks about the State's shareholding in the bank.  They were interpreted as encouraging the State to sell additional shares in AIB.  The share price is approximately &euro;5.62.  The market capitalisation of AIB is at approximately &euro;15.2 billion.  Would that be correct?</p></speech>

I have not expressed any different views since then.  I still think the markets are good.  We can see that.  It is not a unique insight on the position the markets are currently in.  I cannot make any comment about the trading position of the bank right now other than to refer back to our December statement which said that we expect to deliver close in line with market expectations.

The majority of what we do is through individual case-by-case restructuring activity, but we have kept the issue of portfolio sales open.  I might turn to my colleague, Mr. O'Keeffe, for any comments he would like to make on it but we do not have any update on that position at this stage other than to say that we are aiming for the target set for the end of 2019.  We are making good progress, which is what we said in the trading statement, across our overall non-performing exposures, which is obviously helped by the position of the economy.

We highlighted to the committee previously that we continue to have our full team of approximately 1,500 people in place, working with customers in difficulty to find solutions.  While we have looked at that, we will need to execute loan portfolio sales.  In general, we have absolute capacity to work with customers who come forward to us to work with us.  As we work towards that eventual position, we will determine what level of loan sales need to take place.  During 2017, while we are in a closed period, we continued to see really good and improving engagement with customers.  The Deputy will have recently seen that we announced new measures relating to our family home portfolio and mortgage-to-rent, which we have seen good performance with.  We are reaching out across the portfolio to find other solutions to try to engage with customers so that we can bring that to a solution in a restructuring manner.</p></speech>

AIB sues more than twice as many borrowers as Bank of Ireland.  It was based on an analysis of High Court cases and looked at summary judgment records.  It stated &quot;AIB has scaled back its use of the hawkish &quot;summary judgment&quot; debt recovery tactic, but remains, by far, the Irish lender most likely to sue its customers in the High Court, according to an analysis of official records by <i>The Irish Times</i>.&quot;</p><p>Court records show that in 2017 AIB applied for debt summary judgments on 755 occasions, down 37% from the 2016 level.  In 2016 AIB was four times more likely to apply for a summary judgment than Bank of Ireland which in 2016 sought just over 308.  The evidence which is based on hard facts - actual court filings - seems to be that AIB is the most aggressive bank in pursuing SMEs and doing so in an adversarial, litigious manner, namely, going to court to get summary judgments which then in some ways narrows the capacity to enable an agreement to be reached.</p></speech>

I will not comment on Bank of Ireland's position, but it is clear when one looks at the balance sheets and the scale of the issue that faced AIB in dealing with non-performing loans - it continues to be the case - that they are of a different quantum.  That accounts for some, if not all, of the comparison to which the Deputy referred.  It also accounts for the fact, as he articulated, that the number was significantly down on the figure for 2016.  When one looks at the level, we had more than 5,000 restructures last year on the non-mortgage loan side and <i>circa</i>5,000 restructures on the mortgage loan side.  We continue to work right alongside that level of activity.  All of the solutions available to customers prevent us from ultimately having to go down the legal route.  To come back to the discussion we had on loan sales, we really encourage people to come forward and engage because the legal route is the route of last resort that we want to pursue.</p></speech>

When the bank obtains a summary judgment against an SME, what happens then?  What prospect is there of an agreement being reached to avoid repossession?</p></speech>

At that point we still engage with customers and continue to engage if customers come forward and seriously want to do so.  It is unfortunate that at times we must reach that point before there is real engagement, but we remain open as we move through the process.  As we see it, when we reach that point, in a lot of cases there is still an opportunity to engage, but for whatever reason the customer at the other end who owns the business is not willing to do so.</p></speech>

We stated when we were discussing it that we had been open for a considerable period to writing down debt.  We are realistic in that regard.  As we said, when customers come to us and want to solve the debt problem, we have options available.  We have created a unique structure for putting in place compromise debt arrangements where we split a loan into three parts in order that we can create a warehouse part and if the performance of the other notes works, we can write off that portion of the debt.  That process is working well for us.  With the come-back in the economy, we are seeing a consistent level of restructuring and an appetite to engage, both at customer and adviser level.  I mentioned the numbers.  That is what we encourage because if there is engagement, it avoids us having to take the legal route which we have to do at a point in time to be fair to everybody.  One should also remember that at this stage we have restructured for more than 25,000 customers.  To be fair to them, they came forward and engaged with us.  They engaged in an compromise and got on with the business.  To be fair to them, we must also make sure we take the appropriate action at the other end.</p></speech>

Surely in cases in which there is full disclosure by the borrower, there are up-to-date valuations on file and there has been a thorough assessment made, it is far better to deal with them in a non-adversarial and non-litigious manner and reach an agreement, even if it involves writing off debts rather than securing an asset in a very messy way that leaves a sour taste in the mouth?</p></speech>

However, for the sake of consistency, what we look at is affordability for the customer when he or she comes forward and we see the elements of the debt that can be addressed by him or her.  We then make decisions on what it is possible to write off and, as we discussed, the elements of non-core assets that could be sold in that regard.  I am very confident about the approach we have taken.  We have had several reviews of our consistency.  We work a very consistent policy and protocol to make sure there is consistency for borrowers.</p></speech>

As members know, while the mortgage-to-rent scheme is of noble intent, it had not delivered in a lot of cases over a five-year period.  In fact, at the point when we launched the scheme with Mr. Hall, a total of 260 cases had been completed over a five-year period.  The level of progress has been good.  For AIB, at this point we have completed a financial questionnaire in 325 cases, about 50 of which have been identified as suitable for the scheme, while 50 others will be suitable for other forbearance solutions.  We are working through the remainder.  I also understand iCare has a number of cases outside AIB in which people are coming to it.  The pipeline of customers looks very good.  We have had very extensive engagement in recent weeks with our customers in the legal process to encourage customers to come forward to see whether this solution would be appropriate for them and the response has been positive.</p></speech>

His company covers loans other than ones with AIB.

If customers express an interest, their cases will be passed on in due course to iCare.</p></speech>

However, there was documentation as part of the statements relating to those customers which intertwined the use of the terms "tracker" and "variable mortgages".  So they were offered a variable rate or a fixed rate when they finished their fixed-rate mortgage.  As a result of that confusion around the statement, these are judgment calls but we erred on the side of the customer to include them in the programme.</p></speech>

The Central Bank had a different view and AIB has come to an agreement whereby it is now giving them compensation and redress.  In the case of the 4,000, it is not enormous amounts of money relative to the &euro;1 billion we were talking about with the Central Bank.  I accept that AIB's provision is still &euro;190 million.  With 4,000 getting &euro;1,600 each, it will not be an enormous amount of money.  I take the point that small mistakes by a large amount of people can still be a lot.  Relatively speaking, it is not a gigantic amount of money in the context of everything that is going on.  AIB has 500 staff doing this.  Are they all contracted staff?</p></speech>

Then we entered into a process of rebuilding that account on a line by line basis.  The framework requires that we have to reset the account so that it is back in the position it should have been in.  We did that twice to make sure we got it right and then we passed it on to KPMG, who assured it for us.  Later in the process it was assured again by EY, on behalf of the CBI.  We then refund overpayments to the customer and give the customer a time value of money on the overpayments, which worked out at about 6% on average.  In line with that, we provide compensation based on a percentage of the interest overcharged.  We have four tiers of compensation, with 85% falling within tier 1, these being performing customers who were never in arrears.  The figure for these is 15%.  The next tier is customers who might have been in the legal process at some stage, who get 22% and the next set, where the property may have been sold but the rate was not causal, also get 22%.  Finally, the most seriously impacted customers, where the property was sold and the rate was causal, got a 30% compensation level.  In the case of the last group, we also compensate for the future value of the tracker and any uplift in the value of the house since it was sold, and we write off any residual debt refund and any payments made on it.  We make a &euro;50,000 incremental payment on top of that and finally, where applicable, we offer them the opportunity of a new tracker mortgage based on their old historic rate.</p></speech>

We have to look at the value that exists now.  AIB is a valuable asset, to a degree that I do not think people would have expected when this was discussed in 2014.  We are at the point where the combination of the value received already and the market value that is implicit in the State's 71% share is in excess of the total amount that the State put in.  At that point in time, we would not have collectively thought that this would be the situation in 2018.  The value realisation comes from having the listing as opposed to not having it.  There is always going to be a point at which the listing process must be undergone.  Markets go up and down.  I do not subscribe to the idea that there is a straight line process by which value will always grow as a result of market positions.</p></speech>

However, the reason that these individuals are not being given redress or increased compensation is that AIB has calculated that collectively and individually, they would have been worse off.  I presume that the bank has a duty to specify what the prevailing rate would have been when they came off a fixed rate, or when the option was available to them under the terms of the tracker mortgage.  I will say this; if the bank does not do that, I think it is in breach of an obligation to provide accurate and full information to the customer.  The letters should not say that the bank is awarding a customer &euro;1,000 as they were contractually entitled to a tracker mortgage and the bank denied them this contractual entitlement for the past seven or eight years, only to assert that the bank has internally determined that this rate would have been higher than what the customer has actually paid, but the customer will not be told what rate they should have been on.  AIB will have to tell them what that rate would have been.</p></speech>

Obviously, the process of engagement with the Central Bank on those groups of customers only took place towards the end of last year.  That was when we came to the conclusion on the groups of 4,000 and 900 that we have described.</p></speech>

I want to get to this point.  I want to figure out when the Central Bank started to raise an issue with AIB regarding its belief that there were thousands of customers that AIB were not including in the scope of the framework.  I want to know when that started, what resistance AIB offered this argument, and how it eventually came to agreeing on it.  Then I want to know how AIB came to agree on the 900.  It is not for my benefit personally.  People out there want to know.  Representatives of the Central Bank came before this committee and were a bit more robust than at their last appearance.  They told us how they have hauled AIB over the coals.  I want to know if that is true.  Was the Central Bank engaging with any of the 900 customers?  When did the Central Bank start to engage with AIB on that cohort of individuals?</p></speech>

It clearly had not agreed a final treatment in respect of the groupings about which we are talking but that does not mean the Central Bank was challenging those groupings and saying that we were wrong in respect of them.  One of them, as I have said, which involves 4,000 customers, was not in the framework.  Therefore, the debate that arose after the final quarter was around the treatment of those customers and whether they should be in the framework.  That was a final quarter activity.  I cannot remember the details or the timing around the group of 900 but I am happy to hand over to my colleague on that.</p></speech>

On the most recent occasion, we spoke about 900 homes being in the bank's possession and that we were working through those with the Housing Agency at that point.  Obviously, there is movement in and out in terms of that number as we go through the process.  It has come down slightly but we have made significant progress with regard to the initiative with the Housing Agency.  We are moving properties into the market on an ongoing basis in terms of sales.  In the context of the Housing Agency initiative, we are hoping to agree on somewhere in the region of 250 properties.  We have finalised contracts for 246 properties and we expect to close out on around 260 properties with the Housing Agency.  As I said on the previous occasion on which we met this committee, that initiative was launched on the basis of a fund of approximately &euro;70 million through the Housing Agency.  It was done across all of the financial institutions but we would expect that our close out on that will be north of &euro;50 million.  That figure is evidence that we have really embraced that initiative.  In addition to that, in recent weeks we have re-engaged with the Housing Agency and provided a further list of over 250 houses and an additional list of 150 will go to the agency in the next week or two.</p></speech>

In the middle of a housing crisis, AIB has 900 empty homes across the State.  The Housing Agency is going to take on approximately 246 of those homes and house people who are in desperate need.  Why did AIB not provide a list of all 900 properties to the Housing Agency?  How come another list of 250 homes is now being provided?</p></speech>

At one point, we provided a larger list to the Housing Agency.  The initial list that was provided contained over 500 properties.  Indeed, in the initial days we identified 700 properties that may have been suitable but because of various criteria laid down by the Housing Agency for social housing, that list was reduced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.735" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018012300002#S01300"><p>Okay.  Actually, it is not okay in my opinion.  The fact that a State-owned bank has 900 properties lying vacant is unforgivable.  I do not know who is at fault here, whether it is the Housing Agency, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or AIB.  That we cannot get three State actors, as well as the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, to work together in the middle of a housing crisis is sinful.  It reminds me of what happened during the Famine when we exported food abroad while Irish people starved.  We have a housing crisis, with significant numbers of people homeless.  We meet them all the time because they stay in the same hotels that many Deputies stay in.  It is shocking to think that AIB, a bank into which we put billions, has 900 empty houses.  The people who are homeless now put money into the bank.  It is next to unforgivable.  I raise this every time we meet and the figures are actually increasing.  The number of houses that the bank has in its possession is increasing.</p></speech>

From AIB's perspective, as I have outlined, we have recognised our position and the need for us to play a role.  We have gone to real lengths to make sure that the project to mobilise that was significant.  There are wider issues around the criteria for the houses and the funding available but the numbers, in terms of what we have done to date, are significant.  Obviously, we have to do more and are doing that.  We are working with other agencies who may be able to take some of those properties.</p></speech>

Did AIB carry out a review or did its board commission a report into the reasons so many of its customers were taken off tracker mortgages?

Was a report prepared by AIB or commissioned by the board that identified how this actually happened?</p></speech>

I also thank the committee for allowing me to bring along colleagues from my Department and from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We are all here to answer questions, if at all possible, later.</p> <p>  In the context of exempted development, each of the proposed regulations is aimed at amending provisions in the principal Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2017 concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Each of the proposed regulations deals with a specific type of development.  Under the Planning Acts, each House of the Oireachtas is required to approve draft planning regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by me, as Minister of State.  The consideration of the draft regulations by the committee is part of that approval process.</p> <p>  The first set of draft regulations is the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2018.  They relate to the provision of a number of exemptions for development works undertaken by Irish Water in the provision of water services.  This involves the insertion of a dedicated new class of exempted development - class 58 - in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the principal regulations.  These proposed exemptions will permit Irish Water to undertake works relating to its normal day-to-day operational activities without the need to obtain planning permission from the relevant local planning authority.  Previously, and prior to the establishment of Irish Water, the provision of water services and related works was undertaken by local authorities that had broad planning exemptions under which they could operate.  As Irish Water has now taken over the water services functions of local authorities and cannot avail of the exemptions available to local authorities, it is appropriate that Irish Water should have similar exemptions to those previously given to local authorities.  These proposed exemptions are also broadly similar to those given to other statutory utility providers such as those involved in the provision of electricity, gas and telecommunications services.  I also propose amendments to the existing telecommunications services-related planning exemptions.  I will address them separately in a few moments.</p> <p>  The exemptions proposed will essentially enable Irish Water to undertake development, such as that relating to the general maintenance, repair and installation of pipes, cables and water mains - typically along public roads - as well as the provision of underground water pumping stations and holding tanks, without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby helping to ensure continuity of water supply for households and businesses and that such water supply is not disrupted to any major extent.  The majority of the proposed exemptions relate to works that would be carried out within the confines of existing water services sites, including the upgrading and maintenance of water structures, the installation of equipment in the event of critical infrastructure failure, and works required to comply with statutory licences issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The proposed exemptions also include other minor works within such water services sites, for example, the provision of fencing and telecommunications apparatus or structures for testing water.  I would particularly like to point out that these draft regulations do not propose to provide blanket exemptions for development works by Irish Water.  Any works proposed by Irish Water that are not specifically exempted by these exempted development regulations will still require planning permission in the normal course.</p> <p>  The second set of draft regulations is the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018.  They propose to provide an exemption for the change of use, and any related works, of certain vacant commercial premises to residential use without the need to obtain planning permission.  The draft regulations propose to amend Article 10 of the principal regulations that deals with changes of use.  These draft regulations propose that the exemption will apply for a temporary limited period from when they come into operation until 31 December 2021, concurrent with the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  They will apply to commercial buildings that have been lying vacant for at least two years.  The proposed exemption relates primarily to works to the interior of such buildings.  It is proposed that some limited alternations to the exterior of buildings will also be permitted, subject to their being in keeping with the building and neighbouring buildings.</p> <p>  It is proposed that a number of restrictions will apply to these exempted development works, including that a maximum of nine residential units can be provided in any one building, and that certain minimum standards relating to floor areas, storage space and the provision of natural light are met for each unit.  It is important to note that these proposed exemptions relate to planning permission only.</p><p>Development works to vacant commercial buildings which are being converted to residential use also generally need to comply with the requirements of the building control regulations in respect of fire safety, structural stability, ventilation and so forth.  In this regard, the relevant building control regulations require a competent qualified professional to be assigned by the owner or developer to be involved in the design of the proposed development works, oversee the construction phase and to certify that the finished building works are compliant with the requirements of the building control regulations, thereby ensuring that the relevant works meet the necessary safety and standards requirements.  In effect, these draft exempted development regulations will not in any way change the relevant building control requirements which will continue to apply.  I know that is an issue of concern for some members so I will be very clear that the building control regulations still apply.  I should also mention in passing that the building control standards generally relate to new build construction.  Recognising the possible need for some dispensations from the building control requirements in respect of development works on existing buildings, specifically to better facilitate the conversion of existing vacant commercial buildings for residential use, a working group chaired by my Department was established in late 2017 to develop new building control guidance with a view to providing clarity on what regulatory requirements should be applied in this area and to provide advice on how best to facilitate the re-use or development of under-utilised older buildings for residential purposes.  I understand that the committee has had discussions on this previously in the context of another Bill.  The working group, which includes expertise in building regulations, fire safety, planning, design, and heritage from within and external to the Department, has identified a number of common existing building typologies on which to base its guidance.  It is intended that the output of the working group's deliberations in the form of revised guidance will be finalised in the coming months and will supplement the exempted development planning regulations we are discussing here today.   </p><p> The background to these draft regulations is the commitment in action no. 5.9 of Rebuilding Ireland to bring forward proposals to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground-floor premises, to residential use without having to go through the planning process and thereby help in the rejuvenation of inner urban areas which have been particularly adversely affected by the recent economic downturn.  This proposal is also incorporated in action no. 6 of the Action Plan for Rural Development.  I know this proposal is of particular interest to committee members and having regard to the circumstances outlined, I would hope that they will support its approval which, as I have indicated, has a sunset clause to end in 2021.  </p><p> I commend these three sets of draft regulations to the committee.  They are each very important in their own right and they have the potential to have a real and positive impact on people's lives.  They will support Irish Water in the efficient delivery of the water service, facilitate the re-use of the many vacant buildings in our cities and towns for housing purposes which will revitalise our urban centres and they will assist in the accelerated roll-out of broadband and mobile services generally.  I look forward to what I know will be an engaging discussion with the committee this morning and I will endeavour to answer any questions that committee members may have. </p></speech>

I am in two minds on these regulations and the questions I have are very similar to those I raised in the context of Deputy Pat Casey's Bill on over-the-shop developments.  Specifically with regard to the water infrastructure and the over-the-shop developments regulations, I absolutely understand the need to have exemptions for emergency works, for example, or for routine or basic works.  However, I have a concern that the list of exemptions in the first regulation is broader than that.  What reassurances can the Minister of State give that we are not going to have a situation where a more significant piece of work that is more of a planned infrastructural investment rather than response, maintenance or emergency maintenance is not going to end up in a dispute with people who feel that an application for planning permission should have been required?</p><p>How certain is the Minister of State that the list is as restrictive as it should be?  </p><p> On the proposals for the development of residential accommodation over a shop, my big concern, although I support them in principle, is that if we grant these exemptions, how will we ensure all of the minimum standards for fire safety will be fully adhered to?  No one wants to stand in the way of streamlining and fast-tracking developments to get units back into use, nor do we want to see a situation where the minimum standards are not being met when property is subdivided into nine units.  The regulations state the minimum standards must be met, but how can we ensure this will actually happen when planning permission is not required for the redevelopment of a property into nine units or less?</p></speech>

We cannot amend the regulations, but the Minister could revoke them and come back with something better if he thought there were grounds to do so.</p><p>I am not going to deal with the proposals for water services, as I see the logic in them.  I want to deal with the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations and change of use.  Will the Minister of State outline the logic for stating no more than nine individual housing units can be provided for the purposes of conversion? This is to avoid Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  I do not like the language to avoid Part V because it is an important aspect of planning.  In some of the larger towns one could create more than ten units in some of the properties to be redeveloped.  That is not something we should have ruled out.  We are effectively saying this measure relates to places which have fewer than ten housing units.  There is potential in some larger towns to provide a percentage of social housing units in this type of development.</p><p>In respect of protected structures, the proposals shall not be permitted unless there is a section 57 declaration, which is a strange condition.  This morning I spoke to three planners who told me about the process of self-regulation.  Effectively, people are telling local authorities that their proposals are related to exempt development.  The planning authorities neither have the resources nor the staff to check all of them and a person can claim the proposals relate to a pre-1963 development.  We really need to tidy up the conditions that apply to section 57 declarations.  </p><p>Furthermore, in the context of ensuring public confidence in the planning process and public engagement which is a really important part of the planning process, no elected member of a council or member of the public would be aware of a section 57 declaration.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State would be fully aware of one.  A section 57 declaration does not involve the erection of a site notice or the publication of a public notice and does not go up on the council's website.  Who actually knows when a section 57 declaration has been sought?  We are proposing changes to section 57 declarations, but there is no official public log.  I logged onto a number of local authority websites today to investigate and also spoke to a number of planners about section 57 declarations, about which I have a concern.  If a local authority refuses a section 57 declaration, which is its prerogative, what is being proposed?  Is there an appeals mechanism?  Is there a grievance procedure when somebody who makes an application for a section 57 declaration is refused?  Traditionally, an application for a section 57 declaration has been referred to a heritage officer, a conservation officer and a raft of officials in a local authority and, in some cases, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I flag this as an issue.</p><p>My major concern is about county development plans.  I looked at the 1999 telecommunications antennae and support structures guidelines.  I found two paragraphs alarming.  They read:</p><blockquote>Planning authorities should not include separation distances (i.e. from houses, protected structures, schools etc) in development plans as they prevent case-by-case analysis and can inadvertently have a major impact on the roll-out of viable and effective telecommunications networks.  This will have implications for a number of planning authorities around the country who include specific distances, often up to 1 kilometre, from schools, houses etc.  <br /><br />It will also have implications for local communities who wish to object to proposed masts as they often could rely on policies which required such separation distances to be met in order to get the application refused.</blockquote><p>The previous Minister also included two reminders to the planning authorities, "namely that health grounds should not be considered as part of a planning application and, all future Development Contribution Schemes must include waivers for broadband infrastructure provision as per the recent draft guidelines on development contributions."  </p><p> The Minister of State has been around politics for a long time, as have I, and I can tell him of at least ten objections to masts in the area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, where I live, in respect of which members of the Minister's party, members of other parties and people not affiliated to a party mobilised huge groups of people.  I recall one case in respect of an addition to a mast on top of a Garda station on Tubbermore Road in Dalkey.  I can understand the reasons and the concerns.  Health is a huge issue in respect of telecommunications.  Guidelines with regard to schools are particularly important.  Many schools have been in touch with us over the years.  I have met a number of them.  They mobilise.  I can think of two cases in Meath about which people contacted us and expressed great concern.  These are big national schools and primary schools.  They want to know how they can have their voice and their say.  They want to know how they can be assured that an antenna or a piece of telecommunications equipment will not have health implications for children.  Local elected Members must now put up their hands and say that the Minister of State signed regulations and that they have no role or function.  We just need to be careful.  I would like to see tighter guidelines on the use of antennae and on additions to antennae.  </p><p> I will tell the Minister of State of a situation.  I know of a woman who was very ill and commissioned very interesting research.  She worked for the Defence Forces.  She was very much involved in engineering and telecommunications.  She had independent research carried out on antennae and on the accumulative effect of the 30 or 40 antennae attached to a particular church.  By the way, the church did not have planning permission.  It said it was exempt.  That was pursued and it was found not to be exempt.  The antennae required planning permission, which was granted.  The permission was appealed, An Bord Plean&aacute;la accepted the appeal and all the equipment had to be taken down.  That is a very long process which is also not very satisfactory.  There were serious health issues in respect of the antennae, the radiation and the accumulative effect of the combined network, which was a high-radiation network at one particular point.  It would not be right of me to come in here and not to voice those concerns.</p><p> Public health and the location of these antennae near schools and hospitals has to be an issue.  I am not a scientist.  I do not know enough about it.  I have read enough about people's concerns to feel that it warrants some attention.  What am I going to suggest?  There is no point in bellyaching without coming up with a proposal.  My proposal may possibly not be suited to these regulations but it might be a possibility in the broader legislative framework.   I am calling for a register of approved telecommunications structures and their locations, which would be supported by a relevant database.  I will email this to the Minister of State.  A database should be created and maintained by each planning authority in co-operation with the telecommunications operators.  Such a register would provide an important input in the assessment of future telecommunications developments and would also be useful in maximising the potential for future mast sharing, possible co-location and all that is associated with it, bearing in mind the accumulative effect on which we need more research.</p><p> Furthermore, I suggest that planning consent - and I am saying planning consent, not planning permission - should include a condition stating that when the structure is no longer required it should be demolished, removed and the site reinstated by the operator - not the applicant, but the operator at its own expense.  That might address the issue if it was introduced through some other form of legislation.</p><p> I will wrap up on this final issue.  In the Minister of State's statement he spoke about changes to the permitted height of poles for antennae and increases in the permitted number and size of dishes on structures.  He said that he will facilitate an increase in the number of antennae permitted on large structures and spoke about the deployment of smaller cells.  I understand the need for the national broadband plan and its roll-out in rural parts of the country.  It is critical for economic development and all that goes with it.  That is all to be welcomed.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment but a balance must be found.  It will be the public representatives, including the Minister of State as a Deputy for Meath West, who will have to face the next backlash when we see a massive set of structures put up right beside a school or hospital.  I am not suggesting that this is the mechanism to deal with it.</p><p>It was suggested for many years that we should establish a national database mapping all antennae.  This morning, three planning authorities have informed us that no such database is in place.  Effectively, this means they do not know where antennae are located.  They learn about the locations of antennae, for example, on a church steeple, when a resident telephones the local authority asking why a vehicle from company X is parked at a particular location.  The company in question will then inform the local authority that an antenna has been in place in the location for years and staff were repairing or upgrading it.  This means the planning authority does not know about it.  All these structures must be mapped out and communities informed of their locations.  While local people should not be the arbiter of decisions on locations, they should be able to express a view on this infrastructure.</p><p> My local authority has received an application to erect three of these structures.  The planning authority has confirmed it is considering the application and indicated its decision will be open to appeal, which is democratic.  Let us not water down the powers of citizens to engage.  As I stated, these structures are fine when they are not on our doorstep but it is another story when one is erected in Navan and people bang on the Minister of State's door asking what he will do about it. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.783" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018012300002#H00200"><p>On Senator Boyhan's final point, these structures are a double-edged sword in many respects because we also want to improve communications.  Members of the Oireachtas use communications every day.  People want technology to progress and we need the best available technology.  The visual issue may be a concern for the Senator and some of my constituents.  Before one has a surfeit of masts and antennae, we must first ensure proposed new infrastructure cannot be piggy-backed on existing masts.  In other words, we should try to have four separate masts working from one item of physical infrastructure.  Notwithstanding the commitment, if that is what it is, to increase the numbers of masts, new masts should only be erected if the companies in question can show it is not possible to piggy-back on the existing system.  I expect the issue is one of security, for example, a logarithm or similar, and may not be a physical issue.</p> <p>  Years ago, people were afraid they would be fried by these masts or that a chicken placed beside one of them would roast overnight.  These fears were not realised but they affected the capacity of communities to obtain proper reception for their mobile telephones.  People in some parts of County Louth do not have good mobile telephone reception, for example, on the approach to Monasterboice.  Every county has its problems.  We must use best available technology but the companies must first show that the communications cannot be carried on existing infrastructure.</p> <p>  I recently received complaints from people in County Louth about a decision to reject an application for a new mast in County Meath.  I was not familiar with the details of the case as it involved a different county.  The complaints were made by residents of a particular part of County Louth which has very poor broadband coverage.  From their perspective, the mast would have improved broadband and delivered a major benefit to their community.  It would be useful in cases involving applications to increase the height or number of antennae to assess the community benefit as well as the benefits for commercial users and private companies.  We should ask whether broadband coverage in the local area could be improved and, if so, whether it would be a good idea to do so. </p> <p>  In many cases, it is not necessary to install pointed antennae on top of a building because they can be hidden within a structure or constructed in a way that they do not protrude visually.  </p> <p>  I apologise for arriving late.  I understand the Minister of State was speaking about over-the-shop developments and planning when I arrived.  This area offers significant scope to deliver material benefits to hundreds of households, particularly single people and couples who do not have children.  It is not easy for families with young children to live above a shop because of the need to go up and down stairs and so forth.</p><p> Let us consider our town centres.  My own town centre is practically empty at night.  It is not that they are no-go zones but they are more like no-people zones.  There is no one living over the shops; there is no one there.  Anyone who has the wisdom and time can examine the 1901 census and see all the people and families who lived in the centre of towns and all the activities that went on there.  All that is gone.</p><p> It makes sense to bring people back to the centre of towns.  The physical infrastructure is in place, including water services, sewerage, public lighting and proximity to shops and services.  There is a bonus in it.  There is a downside and we are dealing with the associated problems too.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's concerns over fire regulations.  There should be mandatory standards.  Property owners should have to get a certificate from the fire officer to say that what they are doing meets the requirements.  I support making it easier for people to develop dwelling space over shops.</p><p> Certain areas near older transport hubs have potential.  I am not suggesting it applies in every case but there are areas near railway and bus stations and so on.  Often these are in older parts of cities and towns.  Fast-track developments in such zones are important.  We could zone areas where there is no habitation - these include abandoned shopping areas or areas that are no longer active commercially.  I would welcome fast-track zoning for development in such areas.</p><p> We should consider what happens in the United Kingdom.  I have looked at the website of the empty homes organisation in the United Kingdom.  It has plenty of examples of abandoned bank buildings, shops, garage forecourts and so on that are now occupied by families and have been turned into apartments.  There is constructive living and urban renewal.  There are major benefits.  That is why I welcome the advances from the Department with the assessment provisos that people are suggesting.</p><p> The lack of housing needs to be met with increased urgency from the Department.  Whatever the initiatives are, I would welcome greater initiatives.  Those responsible in the UK appoint empty homes officers in local authorities.  I am not suggesting that is the destination the Department has in mind for Ireland, but it might be helpful to have people who could map the centre of the town, knock on each door and ascertain who owns each premises.  If there is no one there, they could use the Louth solution, which is to slap a compulsory purchase order on the property if it meets the requirements.  We need active on-the-ground officers, whose job it could be to report to the county manager and the Department on a quarterly basis.  That is one of the things missing from our housing policy.  It is not that we do not care, but the sense of urgency is not being transmitted.  I believe that could change with the appointment of such officers.  A website like that operating in the UK may be the type of constructive engagement we need to create the sense of urgency and crisis.  I do not get the same sense when I walk around my town because I am still looking at premises.  I welcome the support of Louth County Council.  I looked at a place where we could have 16 people living.  The problem is that is an old building and would require more money than usual to do up  but I think we should do it up because it is in the centre of the town.  The old Central Hotel in Drogheda is right in the centre of the town.  There were 15 or 16 bedrooms in it.  It is abandoned now and there is no one in it.  We should get in there and turn it into habitable dwelling space.</p><p> Finally, I welcome in particular the engagement of organisations like the Peter McVerry Trust in tackling derelict buildings in cities.  I welcome this work.</p></speech>

I want to talk about part 2 of the statutory instrument.  I am a little disappointed because I thought we would have worked through our vacant housing Bill.  It took a more holistic approach to converting vacant properties into residential units because it dealt with planning, fire and disability certification, as well as final certification.  In its response to the Bill the Department stated: </p><blockquote>Separately, there is a concern about the proposal in the Bill in relation to making the sub-division of a dwelling into two or more dwellings exempt from planning permission.  This conflicts with the Planning Act which provides that such development is a material change of use requiring consideration by a planning authority through the planning application process, with particular regard to protecting residential amenity and other considerations. </blockquote> <p>The Minister of State's statutory instrument is proposing allowing up to nine sub-divisions within each dwelling.  We all have concerns about the fire and safety regulations.  As pointed out and acknowledged in our Bill, there are no technical documents on fire and disability certification when older buildings are being converted.  The Minister of State is acknowledging that the technical guidance documents are not and will not be there for a few months.  Is the proposed statutory instrument premature until the documents are available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.786" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018012300002#K00300"><p>We have been through the vacant housing Bill here and in the Department and also discussed it in the D&aacute;il.  It is a worthwhile Bill which is aiding our work, but our approach to it and tackling this issue and an issue raised as Action No. 5.9 of Rebuilding Ireland is two-pronged.  First, it deals with the exemptions in respect of what we are putting forward today.  We all agreed that ideally commercial buildings such as shop on main streets should be turned back into housing.  There is permission for up to nine units because it applies to commercial buildings only.  The difficulty the Department had with Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill was that it would allow the sub-division of an existing house.  Where would it stop?  There are houses all over the country.  People would try left, right and centre to make two houses out of one, which would not be conducive to good planning.</p> <p>  This measure refers to a commercial building of a size in which, under all of the regulations, up to nine units could be fitted in.  That is what we are allowing for.  We are working on a version of the sub-division of a house such that under existing planning laws space can be made available to share a house.  The winning proposal in the competition in the Homes for Smart Ageing Universal Design Challenge involved dividing a house in a certain way to allow one person to occupy that house; it is not two houses.  It comes under the exempted development legislation and I will bring it forward here later.  It has almost passed through pilot stage.  It is worth considering.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill was a little different and we could not agree to it because of the planning authority.  We are willing to discuss it further later, but this discussion is about bringing commercial buildings back into use.  </p> <p>  The second part which is intended to make it easier and viable for anyone who owns commercial buildings to bring them back into use involves issues concerning fire safety, the building regulations and the heritage regulations which do not make it easy for someone to bring a property back into use.  In counties Wicklow and Carlow and other places where I visited properties on the high street that could be brought back into use, it is very complicated and people are afraid to touch the system.  In the light of Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill and our own discussions, in late 2007 we set up a working group across all Departments to consider these issues and bring forward new guidelines for local authorities.  It was important to have the Department of Culture, Heritage and Local Government on board to make it as easy as possible to cut out some of the unnecessary red tape, not to renege on safety and health measures but to make it easier where we could give better guidance in this area .  That is what we are doing.  I hope the working document will come out in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>It will aid the work that is carried out here.  In light of that document, these exemptions are not premature.  People can still work away under the existing planning regulations and certification process.  Any guidance we have, if it changes that, will kick in for this as well.  As of today, it is the existing planning regulations continue to apply.  It is not premature.  The other document will be useful.  The working group, which is chaired by the Department, will hopefully report quite soon.  I think it will bring forward many resolutions similar to those discussed by this committee and with which I would agree.  It is important that we do it in a co-ordinated way and ensure that all Departments - not just mine - will be involved.  I assure the Chairman that the committee's good work on that Bill will not be wasted.  It is best to take the two-pronged approach with which we are trying to proceed.  That deals with the Chairman's questions.  I will move on to those from Senator Boyhan shortly.</p><p> Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin also raised two questions, the first of which relates to his concern regarding whether we are giving a blanket ban to Irish Water.  We are absolutely not.  Are we confident that we do not go too far in what we are doing here?  We are confident because it is exactly the way it was with the local authorities for I do not know how many years but for a long number of years, as long as I can remember.  The same exemptions are there.  We are not changing any of that.  It is just giving Irish Water the same exemptions that were there for local authorities, with which most people were happy.  To my knowledge, there have been no cases of concern.</p><p> To be very clear, under the section 5 process, people can appeal exemptions.  That is the issue that Senator Boyhan raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018012300002#L00300"><p>Section 57 as well.  We are mainly dealing with section 5 today.  Section 57 relates to protected structures.  Under both, there is an appeal mechanism to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Either side can bring that appeal or review and the board will give a decision.  That mechanism is available.  I can get the Senator a note on that if he wants the position clarified.  This is an issue with which, for many reasons, I am very familiar as a result of what has happened in my county, not just in the context of telephone masts but for other reasons as well.  The process is there and it is useful because it gives people the right to raise concerns.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's other question was about building control and the fear or perception that giving people exemptions gives them free rein to go and do what they like.  That is not the case.  These exemptions are for buildings that already have planning permission.  Also, the building process, building regulations and the certification process kick in for any development being brought forward.  There has to be an assigned certifier and all the professionals involved, so there is no way of coming under the radar or escaping the rules.  They are there for any building and for anyone who wants to develop a home.  From analysis, most people would say that our system of regulation is quite strong now.  The certification process that was introduced a few years ago is working very well and gives us much greater assurance that building control is followed.  There are always inspections and that as well, of course.  I reassure members that these exemptions will not allow anybody to escape that.  That is not the case, at all.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan asked about social housing, Part V and our reasons for choosing the figure of nine units.  That figure was chosen specifically with regard to the Part V requirement for up to 10% of social housing development in excess of nine units.  It is only above nine units that the 10% kicks in.  The Part V obligations involve engaging with the local authority and are normally dealt with in tandem with the planning process.  It would be important that we do not exempt buildings above nine units because then we would lose the opportunity to have Part V requirements adhered to.  That would letting developers, builders and owners of properties out the gate.  It is specifically to achieve what the Senator wants that people do not get away from their obligations in this regard.  It is quite likely that many of these properties will come back into use.  Certainly, those located in town centres would be ideal for social housing because they have access to all the services a town provides.  These properties are ideal for the repair-and-lease initiative.  I must say I am disappointed that the repair-and-lease initiative was not taken up by more people.  We made changes to it yesterday to make it less complicated and more straightforward, with an earlier payback of money.  I hope that will encourage people to come forward.  It is an ideal mechanism to fund the work that could be carried out under these exemptions in some cases because it is up to a certain amount of money per unit.</p> <p>  What we are changing here will not allow anybody pass under the radar in terms of their Part V obligations, unlike what is happening in other countries where there was no limit on the size and properties were put forward with a couple of hundred units and with no social housing provision.  We are making sure that does not happen here.  I hope that puts the Senator's mind at ease.  I understand his question and hope I have made it clear to him as to why we picked the figure of nine.</p> <p>  The issue of staff resources in general was raised.  This goes back to the powers of local authorities and being in authority.  This is something I have discussed with the committee previously, as well as in many other places.</p><p>Resources are better than they were in the past thanks to people being back at work and more taxes coming in.  Therefore, we have to allow more money for local authorities to be in control of planning.  That involves having enough staff to deal with all questions, exemptions, checks and so on. </p><p> On substandard accommodation, our aim is that by 2019 properties will be inspected every four years.  We are putting more resources in place to allow for this to happen, which means more people across the planning system.  I agree with the Senator that, as a Department, it is our job to work with local authorities to make sure resources are in place.  It is probably fair to say resources have not always been in place and that this might be an area which does not receive the full attention it needs.  </p><p> Exemptions will not affect the situation to which the Senator referred because the properties are exempt.  Local authorities are notified when people register and we will keep an eye on the numbers.  If local authorities consider they need more staff in certain areas, they can bring forward their requests to us and we will deal with them.  In general, when it comes to tackling derelict, neglected or vacant properties, local authorities need to be strengthened.  We had a discussion on this matter yesterday and most people have the same view.</p><p> On the development plan, national guidelines have been set down for telecommunications, telephone masts, wind farms and so on.  We ask that development plans respect the national guidelines.  Like previous Ministers and Ministers of State, I will have to step in if development plans try to undermine the national guidelines when it comes to important infrastructure.  Very often we have to advise local authorities that a blanket ban on any development within one mile of a school is not permitted under the national guidelines. </p><p> We publish national guidelines for consultation purposes.  There are guidelines for wind energy projects passing through the system.  They will change matters and make things easier for people.  Likewise, guidelines have been set down for telecommunications.  We are making changes to small rather than large structures which will be very clear in respect of field strength.  The guidelines state the field strength of any small antenna shall not result in the non-ionising radiation emitting from the radio installations on the site exceeding the limit specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  The commission brings forward all of the standards and recommendations based on EU law and best practice.  It deals with many organisations in that regard, but the national guidelines are clear.  My colleagues from the Department can clarify any issue the Senator may have.  It is my understanding the regulator has a register of all planned telecommunications infrastructure and that it should be up-to-date at all times, but I will check the position for the Senator.</p></speech>

On the exemptions we are discussing, notification will be given to local authorities regarding housing.  We can keep track of it and can look at the regulator.  I imagine that the regulator has the information on a county by county basis.  Planning authorities operate on an individual basis.</p> <p>  The Senator said he had other issues which he would forward to me.  I will be happy to read his submission and tease it through with officials from both Departments.  There is probably merit in some of the points he has raised.  Some are already dealt with in the planning process and I will tease through the other issues with him.  He has raised issues which are of concern to the public and we want to make sure their rights are not being infringed on.  </p> <p>  Deputy Fergus O'Dowd referred to the refusal to grant planning permission for a mast.  I am not familiar with the case, but I can check the details for him.</p></speech>

I am sure there was a planning reason permission could not be granted.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to co-location.  All mobile phone operators have infrastructure and mast sharing arrangements in place.  They may have tried to avoid this in the past, but generally they have come to arrangements which are cost-effective and managed to deal with most of the issues involved.  The sharing arrangements promote co-ordination of the use of mast infrastructure and reduce the number of masts used.  For planning purposes, as well as other reasons, we like to see infrastructure being used wisely and shared, where possible.  I am well aware that this did not happen in the past, but we have moved on in the past couple of years and it is something we can address in the future.</p> <p>  All planning applications are not judged on the community benefits, but when it comes to telecommunications and other infrastructure, generaly community gain overrides other considerations.</p><p>I do not know what they were, but I presume there were some reasons for what happened.</p><p> I welcome the support for the exemption for commercial properties.  Deputy O'Dowd hit the nail on the head.  Breathing life back into parts of our towns and villages that have been neglected over the years is exactly what we are trying to do here.  There are shops that have been lying empty for years.  This affects properties that have been vacant for two years, so it will not encourage vacancy in order to achieve exemption from planning permission.  It is designed to deal with vacancies of over two years' duration.  It is common sense, and I absolutely agree that it will breathe life back into many parts of towns and villages.  The people who own these properties need to be jolted into doing something with them.  What we are trying to do is make it easier to work with local authorities in the context of the building control mechanism.</p><p> Apart from simplifying the planning process, the other benefit of doing that relates to development fees and development contribution levies.  They can sometimes take effect when there is a change to the use of a building.  That can make it less attractive to bring forward plans for development or it can mean that owners need a certain level of resources in order to do so.  Generally, the owners of these properties are exempt and that makes it easier to bring the properties back into use.  That is exactly what we want to happen.</p><p> The UK was mentioned as an example.  Many of these initiatives in urban rejuvenation are in operation there.  We have a similar example in Waterford with the strategic development zone, SDZ, which is developing the urban area similarly to the manner that has been suggested.  We have set up a fund which can be used to aid major urban renewal schemes, and we will be bringing forward the details of that scheme in the weeks ahead.  Resources were allocated in the recent budget to help us tackle dereliction and vacancy and to co-ordinate different Departments to do so.  There are various initiatives across the different action plans to do that.  The challenge is in finding the resources to do it.</p><p> I am of the view that local authorities need to be front and centre in this.  We are trying put them in a strong position so that they can drive this agenda.  We had a lengthy discussion at our housing summit yesterday about dealing with properties that have been lying idle for many years.  Along with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and all of my Department colleagues, I stressed the importance of local authorities to this.  We discussed the local authorities that are doing this well, Louth being one example, and we encourage all of them to come at this with the same urgency.  I made it clear that we will not tackle a vacancy problem or under-utilisation of property without local authorities fully taking it on.  We have committed resources to this.</p></speech>

Every time I visit a council I ask the members to take a lead in this area and drive this agenda.  I have to say that this has not happened in respect of some of the schemes we have presented.  Where the repair-and-lease scheme is concerned, the ideal is for councillors, who know the people who own these properties, to go out and explain what is involved.  Very often, owners need to be encouraged to bring properties forward.  We want local authorities to knock on doors, inquire about properties and try to encourage their development.  Councillors have a role in doing this because they generally know who the people involved.  There are schemes available and there are solutions to this problem, but people have to have the will to do it.</p> <p>  I know that Deputy O'Dowd would like us to apply more of the stick as well as the carrot to make this happen.  I am not against that if it would work.  Very often, if enough carrots are put in front of people and they are encouraged to do act, the problem is dealt with better and more quickly.  However, we need people to get that out and push that agenda.</p></speech>

I did express my concern.  I am not convinced of the speed with which such a tax would bring us a solution, but if it helps, I have no problem with it whatsoever.  I am trying to offer carrots to make it attractive to bring these properties back into use.  By all means, however, we need to strengthen the laws.  I discussed this with local authorities yesterday .  We have to put them in a stronger position in order to deal with vacant properties, and that is what we are trying to do.  If a vacant homes tax works, we will opt for that as well.</p> <p>  Yesterday, we discussed the vacant site register and the effect it is having.  The Deputy is correct.  In many cases where people were notified that they were going to be put on the vacant site register, they came forward with plans to develop.  Deputy O'Dowd's suggestion of a vacant house tax might have the same effect.  It might drive people to do something to avoid the tax.  I understand the reasoning.</p></speech>

He mentioned an old hotel in Drogheda, which could very easily be brought back into use by the local authority.  I will ask it to look at it.  It would probably be ideal for a family hub, or for a traditional property or for accommodation units, but it should be considered.  Different funds have been put in place to enable that to happen.  I hope I have dealt with most of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.811" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018012300002#O00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  I was delighted to hear about the meeting that took place yesterday.  It is important to get the officials in all the local authorities together because a problem exists in this area.  The Minister of State referred to the repair and lease scheme but, in general terms, it is not working because of a funding issue.  Carlow and Waterford were two of the counties to which it was rolled out.   There is an imbalance when it comes to rural Ireland in that the owners of small commercial shops are barely taking home a living and they are finding it very hard to come up with the necessary funding.  The issue of funding is the main reason that scheme has not taken off.  Unless a funding stream can be put in place that would provide an incentive for the refurbishment of commercial units in town centres, this proposal will not work.  The three-year timeframe for it - up until 31 December 2021 - is very short.  I believe that will be a big problem, and that needs to be examined.</p> <p>  The Minister of State met all the chief executive officers - or county managers as I and many people would refer to them - of the local authorities yesterday.  How many people do they believe will take up this proposal, how many will invest in it, and how will it work?  As we are aware, there is a massive issue in our small urban areas.  We need to get life back into our town centres, particularly in rural Ireland where the owners of small commercial units are finding it very hard to exist.  We can put in place as many regulations as we want but unless there is an uptake of this proposal, it will not work.  The Minister needs to sit down with the owners of the commercial units.  The council officials need to meet them.  How many does the Minister think might take up the proposal?  I note he said that only some of the councils have come back to him with those figures. </p> <p>  This can be compared to imposing compulsory purchase orders.  Efforts have been made to apply compulsory purchase orders to buildings in town centres for many years.  There are no regulations in place in that respect.  There are a great number of issues involved in town centres that are not been addressed.  If this exemption will apply for only three years, it is crucial that the Minister of State ensures that it will work because unless it will work we might as well not provide it.  I would have massive concerns about it.  The regulations propose an exemption for a change of use, which I welcome.  I am in favour of renewal and factors such as buyer safety and building regulations are crucial.  However, there is the matter of the way this proposal will work and the way the incentives will work for the people concerned.  Funding is the biggest issue facing everyone who has a commercial property.  That is the reason many of them are derelict.  Two years is a very small timescale.  I could advise the Minister of State of buildings that have been derelict for ten or 15 years.  We need to make sure that there is something in place that can with worked with.</p> <p>  If this proposal goes ahead and I hope it does, working through the local authorities, what will be the exact timescale for it?  Can the Minister of State give us three or four pointers with respect to working with the local authorities and the commercial owners to turn their properties into viable housing units?  What role will each of those parties play?  What exactly is the Minister of State going to do for them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.812" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018012300002#O00500"><p>I want to pick up on two or three points, and I am mindful of what the Minister of State said in his responses.  Regarding section 5 and section 57 declarations, and I have had a look through the Planning and Development Act, a copy of which I have in front of me, members of the public and politicians would not know if a section 5 or a section 57 declaration had been submitted.  We need to look at that again and have a register.  Reference was made to an appeal.  I have been to a number of local authorities today and no one seems to quite know what happens.  Declarations are not laid before anyone.  The only way one will find a declaration if one is clever enough, through chief executive's orders, or what we would have known as the county manager's orders and many local authorities are not even getting these.  Section 57 and section 5 declarations would be included in them.</p><p>On foot of section 57 and section 5 I rigorously and meticulously month in and month out had people hauling trolleys into county hall and I went through everything.  At one stage in my office I had thousands of manager's orders and the chief executive used to ask me how I knew everything.  It was because I took the bloody time to look and read, but one cannot expect all members to have that amount of time.  We have a listing system for planning applications every week in every local authority.  We need a system to flag section 5s and 57s because it is about openness and transparency and that is important.  How can one have an appeal?  It is all on websites.  Let us imagine that I am in a little place such as Johnstown in Meath and I live in a little cottage, am 57 years of age and have two lamps, I do not have any IT or a son or daughter to access the Internet.  We must be user-friendly for a whole generation of people who want to engage.  The first thing they see is something in the sky outside their door and they are told they did not appeal it.  What is the process?  Who does one register with first?  What is the fee?  The case then goes to the board.  I do not say we must do it all today but let us tease out how section 5 and section 57 declarations come to the attention of the public.  I was a councillor for years and I could not find out.  One would have to ring up on a regular basis or one would see something or hear a man with a big truck putting something up and that would be the first one would know about something happening.  That is an important point.</p><p> I wish to reiterate my concern to the Minister of State because I know I will be back to him in a few months.  I know there are ten live issues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I know of three in the Minister of State's county because I happen to be in and out of the area a lot.</p></speech>

It is not pylons I am talking about.  What I am asking about is how the public engages.  There is also a health issue.  There was a reference to the Minister including two reminders to the planning authorities about not accepting health grounds as a basis for objection.  That is alarming.  I know that before the close of business the media will be asking me to comment on that.  I have flagged at this public meeting public health considerations.  My quote referred to the Minister including two reminders to the planning authorities, namely, that health grounds should not be considered as part of any planning.  It is important to make that point.  I think we are going to have a lot of concern about it and the Minister of State will have people getting on his case within a week asking him about it.</p><p>I acknowledge the importance of national broadband and mobile phones, which all feed into economic development and prosperity for our people and country, which is marvellous.  I see where the Minister of State is going but let us set out public engagement, ensure there is a process and deal with the fees in terms of how people can appeal.  I have read a lot of documentation about this issue.  I call for a register of approved telecommunications structures and locations, supported by a relevant database.  I have spoken to senior planners across the country who tell me they are not aware of there being a relevant database to be created and maintained by the statutory planning authority in each case.  Proper planning and sustainable development is very important and a national database mapping out who all of those are is required.  Such a register would provide important input for the assessment of future telecommunications developments and would also be used from the point of view of maximising the potential for future sharing, co-locating and managing the structure.  I am not talking about the look of something when it is awful.  We are blessed in south County Dublin to have a lot of architectural conservation areas.  The highest number of protected structures outside of Dublin are in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.</p><p>Where future planning consent and conditions are obsolete there should be provision that they will be taken down.  There may be other issues.  The regulations will go before the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  I know the Minister of State is anxious to sign them and get on with his job because that is what he does and he does well.  He is already talking to us today.  I know we cannot amend the regulations so the Minister of State must proceed with them, which I presume he will do.  Could he tell us that is what he will do and the timeframe he envisages?  In that case it is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  That begs the question of what we are doing here, but that is another day's work.  I know the Minister of State is amenable to looking at some of the ideas and I will write to him about them under separate cover.</p></speech>

This is a very serious issue.  Health is a major issue.</p><p>We all want broadband because modern technology will be crucial to our lives in future.  The Minister of State indicated that minor changes would be made to the height of poles and structures carrying overhead lines.  Larger structures will also be built to facilitate a greater number of antennae.  I have to tell people in County Carlow that we still do not know how large these structures will be or what effect they will have.  That is a serious issue. </p><p> As Senator Boyhan stated, the issue is one of a lack of information and communication.  People are not aware of what is happening because they are never given the full details.  I read through this document last night.  What height will be poles be and what types of structures will be allowed?  The Minister of State must provide accurate information.  Common sense does not prevail in local authorities on some issues.  We need to find a balance and ensure that health is taken into consideration.  I ask the Minister of State to provide further information on these regulations.</p><p> Broadband is crucial and we all want to have proper communications but the detail in the proposals will also be crucial.</p></speech>

My concern is that we are dealing with existing structures.  To return to the building control regulations, the guidance documents relate to new builds as opposed to the renovation of existing buildings, which are what we are discussing.  Under the current process, an applicant submits a commencement notice and no inspection is done to ascertain whether the proposal meets requirements.  Local authorities issue fire certificates and certification that a building meets disability requirements.  There are no guidance documents in this area, which means 31 local authorities are making their own interpretations.  I am concerned that the process involves the submission to the local authority of a simple commencement notice and there is no pre-approval that it is exempt development based on any plan submitted.</p></speech>

The Vice Chairman's concerns are dealt with by planning control.  Professionals must be involved, including a signed certifier.  Building control applies to the process and applicants must obtain a fire certificate and so forth afterwards.  The process is exactly the same as the process that applies when a new house is being built.  Building control and requirements will apply and the signed certifier must be part of the process.  I hope I have put the Vice Chairman's mind at ease in that regard.</p> <p>  The only changes that may be made will be in the guidance document that we have been asked to produce in a working group.  If changes to simplify the system are proposed, we will tease them out in the committee.  These exemptions do not exempt people from standard building control regulations.  I hope that is clear.</p></speech>

Members are concerned that there is a demolition of standards here but there is not.  It all stays the same.  If that working group puts forward some suggestions for certain properties based on the realisation that it is more difficult with certain properties, we will look at that.  However, that is not on the table today.  I am happy to discuss this with the committee when the working group reports.  I have no problem with doing that because this is an area with which I am very concerned.  It is very clear to me that people who own these properties say that it must be practical for them to bring them back into use.  That is what the working group is examining.  It is trying to determine if we can make changes while maintaining standards to allow such properties to be brought back into use.  That is a slightly different conversation to the one we are having today about exemptions.</p><p> Senator Murnane O'Connor is in a different space today in terms of her questions.

The exemptions here will make it more viable for some of these properties to be brought back into use because owners do not have to go through the whole planning process for change of use and incur the costs involved in doing that.  They do not have to pay contribution levies, planning fees and so on which makes it more viable to bring the properties back into use.  It should make it more attractive.  Local authorities were not asked to give us any indications on this.  This is not a scheme that will be driven by local authorities.  It is a scheme aimed at the owners of the properties and involves giving them a planning exemption to make it more viable and more straightforward for them to bring their properties back into use.  The costs of doing that and the funding for same is their own business if it is a private development.  If they want to use the property for social housing, however, it becomes our business.  Schemes have been put in place which local authorities can use, including repair and lease back, purchase and renew and so on.  I am not happy that such schemes are not being used more and agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor on that point.  One can point the finger left, right and centre but the fact remains that it is not happening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.835" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018012300002#R00900"><p>We are bringing forward some solutions to make it more viable.  I have also asked the local authorities to put people in charge of making this happen.  We need people to drive this because if it is not driven by the local authorities and by councillors of all parties and none, it will not happen.  I must disagree with Senator Murnane O'Connor on the question of funding.  A cash payment of &euro;40,000 per unit, upfront, to renovate a property is quite attractive and in most cases would make the proposition viable.  The majority of these properties, based on analysis, would need less than &euro;30,000 to be brought back into use.  In that context, I disagree with the Senator's assertion that the funding is inadequate.  In some cases, with the changes we have announced, permission can be granted to go a little bit above the limit.  If the property was previously a bedsit and it is an attractive proposition to return it to use, there is scope for local authorities to go above the &euro;40,000 limit.  That said, I believe that a sum of &euro;40,000 is quite attractive.  The issue for many property owners was the ten-year commitment that was required.  I always felt that was too long and that has now been changed to a five-year commitment, which will make the scheme far more attractive to people.  The scheme is attractive but people just do not seem to know about it or understand it.  That is why I repeatedly ask Members of both Houses to advertise this deal in their constituencies and among councillors, to let people know it is there.  The Department will conduct a national advertising campaign but people need to hear about it and to be told that it is a good scheme.  In my opinion, it is a very good scheme.  It was introduced because people told us that they did not have funds to spend on their properties to bring them up to a standard that would allow them to be rented out.  This scheme provides those funds and is logical.  It is, however, separate to what we are discussing today which is the exemption.  There is a bit of a kick-on but they are not totally linked.</p> <p>  I am not sure what the Senator's concern is with regard to two or three years.  This is in line with commitments made in Rebuilding Ireland.  It is an exemption that will apply up until the end of the term covered by that document, that is, to the end of 2021.  We are trying to drive on change today, not in ten years' time.  We want to see activity now and most of the actions we have in this document are about driving activity in the present because we need more houses today.  We want to tackle dereliction and vacancy but we also want to solve homelessness and the housing shortage.  We are not introducing changes that will help in 20 years' time.  This is about now as well as the years ahead.  I am not sure what the Senator's concerns are in that regard.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan made reference to health grounds but the planning authority is not the judge of health related matters.  There are national guidelines set down by various commissioners and regulators.  Their job is to analyse all the WHO documents, the European directives and so on.  The guidelines are then set by Departments in conjunction with regulators.  Planning authorities are concerned with planning matters and are not there to make judgments on health matters.  The same principle applies to development plans.</p><p> I like Senator Boyhan's suggestion - there is merit in it - of public awareness and engagement around section 5 and section 27 provisions.  Again, they are in place and there are hundreds of exemptions throughout the pages of legislation.  Most have been in place for many years for good reason.  The system enables exemptions under certain classes and categories in order to move forward.  That is what they are there for.  We can take a look at Senator Boyhan's suggestion of a register or public notice, but I have no wish to defeat the purpose either.  Anyway, I will look at it to see if we can get the balance right.</p><p> Planning permission is required for anything substantial and people have to go through the whole process.  Exemptions can make an application viable.  If we make it too cumbersome or awkward, it will not happen and we will achieve nothing.  I know what Senator Boyhan is saying.  We can discuss the balance.  It is something we will review.  There is logic in it.  A register of section 5 applications is kept although it is not always talked about or seen.  Perhaps we can look at making it a more public document or more-----</p></speech>

We are all for transparency in the planning system.  Certainly, I am and the Department is too.  If we can aid that, we will do so and we will look at that.  Senator Boyhan is right on that point.</p> <p>  The Senator also referred to a register for telecommunications infrastructure.  Again, that is in place.  Senator Boyhan has said he would like that to be central to local authority planning.  That is something we could look at doing.  Every local authority has a broadband officer.  That is a job we could look at and see whether we could add to it.  The idea of having a broadband officer is to drive the delivery of broadband.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could add that work to the role of the broadband officer without taking away from the main work, which is to drive that agenda.  Senator Boyhan is making a positive request.  It is not something we will knock and it is certainly something we will look at.  It should be possible to do it.</p></speech>

I cannot understand it.  Does the Minister of State believe that property owners on main streets would have units vacant if they had money to do them up?  Realistically, this is what we are talking about.  We are talking sense now.  I was making representations for the repair and lease scheme, but it has not taken up.  I know it was kind of a good scheme in a sense, but the provision for ten years was too long and there were too many issues with it.</p></speech>

We have to be practical.  I understand that we want to get town centres back.  Funding is the biggest issue.  Unless some help is given to owners of small shop units, they are not going to be able to use it.</p></speech>

It was one of the first schemes I asked about when I came to the Department.  To me, it is totally a matter of common sense.  People in some cases own these properties and do not have the cash to spend.  In consequence, they do not come back into the system.  Others own properties and have the necessary cash but have no wish to spend it.  That is their choice.  The scheme was brought forward to aid people who have qualifying properties and would like to see them utilised but cannot borrow the money or have no means to pay it back.  A sum of &euro;40,000 per unit is a lot of money given that in most cases units only need &euro;25,000 or &euro;22,000.  It is a lot of money.  We researched the amount.  We believe that in the majority of cases it is attractive and would work.  People can add to that from their own resources if they wish.  Along with the &euro;40,000 to spend on the property, the councils lease the properties from the owners for five, ten, 20 years or more.</p></speech>

It is an attractive scheme.  I disagree with the contention from Senator Murnane O'Connor that it is not attractive.  We have made it more attractive with changes to try to ensure better take-up.  What is wrong is that it is simply not being pushed out there.  I hope this scheme will work.  We are trying to spend the money wisely across the board.</p></speech>

There are other ways to do it.  The scheme is in place because we recognise that in some cases people do not have access to funds.  It seems like a good investment to me to spend this cash on a property to get rent in straight away or one month later and for that to continue for the rest of the landlord's life.  We need to encourage people to do it.  That is why we are trying to make it easier than other schemes.  That is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

I am delighted to hear today that the Department is changing them.  Some of the conditions were simply not possible for people to meet.

Consistent with earlier amendments, if we are going to do away with the committees, section 10 should not stand in the Bill.</p></speech>

It was felt that the most appropriate way of doing this was to establish certain committees.  Notwithstanding the amendments to earlier sections, particularly section 9, it is fundamental that the offices of the presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court be fully acknowledged and accommodated in the legislation.  In such circumstances, I am of the view that we will be obliged to revisit this issue at a later Stage.</p></speech>

This issue will need to be revisited on Report Stage.  In the context of the proposal that the commission, as a whole, be responsible for the appointment of judges, I believe will be necessary to revisit this section.</p></speech>

Rather, they should be full members of the commission.  The solution for the Minister is to include them by means of an amendment on Report Stage.</p><p>If he wants to retain his objective of having a lay majority, he can still do so, but the presidents of these courts should be included.</p></speech>

This amendment provides for his or her removal from the Judicial Appointments Commission, with a view to keeping a healthy distance between Government and this first stage of the process when the Judicial Appointments Commission selects and recommends a three person short-list.  In any event, the Attorney General as legal adviser to the Government will naturally be involved at the second stage of the process when the Government considers and decides which of the three names to nominate to the President for appointment.</p><p>It would be procedurally unnecessary and incorrect to duplicate the Attorney General's involvement at both first and second stages of the process.  Both the Law Society and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in their 2014 submissions as part of the consultation process suggested the removal of the Attorney General for this and other reasons.  The ICCL referred to the Attorney General as a political appointee.  Replacing the Attorney General with the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, would improve the balance of the commission as the IHREC chief commissioner cannot be regarded as either a wholly legal or a wholly lay person.  Initially when we had a balance of six and six plus one, it would bring a bit of extra balance.  Given we are looking at getting rid of the smaller subcommittees, the numbers are going to work out a bit different.  I still think that getting rid of the Attorney General from this section will help us to reach a good place when we reconfigure the full commission, now that we have voted to get rid of the subcommittees.  It adds a welcome human rights perspective to the selection and recommendation process, ensuring that section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 is adhered to.</p><p>It is a statutory body established by the State in accordance with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  It has a statutory function to advise the State in regard to compliance with human rights standards, both domestic and international.  It is particularly appropriate that its chief commissioner would have input in regard to the appointment of judges, which is a fundamental rule of law issue in any democracy.  I refer to the Law Society's submission in March 2017.  It stated:</p><blockquote>If the new Commission is to be genuinely independent in its function, there should be no reason for the Attorney General, who also sits at the Cabinet table to participate in discussions of the Commission.  The Attorney General should give his or her perspective at Cabinet or in the course of discussions with relevant Cabinet members following receipt of recommendations made to Government by the Commission.  Furthermore, as the Attorney General is a major purchaser of legal services in the State, there is a risk of conflict of professional interest in the Attorney General being the central element at each stage of the judicial selection process.  There is no good reason why the Attorney General must be a member of the Commission.  It is not the standard practice in comparable jurisdictions.  It diminishes the independence of the Commission and the Government will have the benefit of the advice of the Attorney General at a political level in any event.  The Society has one of its central functions an ongoing vigilance for the protection of the independence of the legal profession.  When an obvious conflict of interest such as this arises, it is the duty of the Society to challenge it.  This is a brand new system and as a result assumptions about the merit of the status quo must be challenged.</blockquote></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.911" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018012300002#H00100"><p>I will speak to amendment No. 31, which is an enabling amendment allowing for the more substantial amendment No. 50.  That amendment is not included in this grouping, so it is necessary to explain the amendments.</p> <p>  One of the points raised on Second Stage was that, while the issue of a lay majority was favoured by many, a lay membership alone would not suffice, in that lay members would need to be more than the traditional State board appointees.  They would have to have a wide range of perspectives and experiences and be representative of society as a whole, covering various organisations and sectors.</p> <p>  The amendments propose three different models.  If I understand Deputies Daly and Wallace correctly, one model replaces the Attorney General with the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  I support that.  They also propose replacing two of the six lay members with a representative of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and a representative of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers propose that there be six specific nominees for lay appointment.</p> <p>  My approach is that there needs to be flexibility.  While the ICCL, FLAC and the IHREC are worthy organisations to nominate people, there are other bodies.  For example, the National Women's Council of Ireland might have an interest in the manner in which violence against women is treated in the courts and, consequently, be interested in judicial appointments.  There is any number of other relevant organisations, including the Migrants Right Centre Ireland and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.</p> <p>  Rather than be prescriptive, my proposed approach is for six lay nominees to be divided into two categories.  Three are described in amendments Nos. 31 and 50 as "the General Lay Appointments" who would be appointed through the traditional Public Appointments Service, PAS, approach.  The others would be what I have called "the Diversity and Social Inclusion Appointments".  This would allow for any organisation that is interested in nominating persons and can demonstrate its relevance to the objectives of diversity as outlined in section 7 and-or the nine grounds in the Employment Equality Acts to be considered an organisation that can nominate.  The PAS could maintain a list of organisations capable of nominating.  It would then be for the judicial appointments commission to choose between their nominations to the three lay positions.</p> <p>  The advantage of this flexibility is that a call can go out to interested organisations, such as those I have mentioned, for nominations of persons whom they believe to be suitable for appointment to the judicial appointments commission.  Those persons would have to demonstrate their capacity in terms of the eight criteria outlined in the legislation.  Although I favour this approach over those favoured by other Deputies, I have a preference for that of Deputies Daly and Wallace.  While there is merit in the approach taken by Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers, it is more restrictive.  The flexibility of the other amendment is preferable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.912" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018012300002#H00200"><p>In some ways, we are probably trying to do the same thing by reconfiguring the lay membership and striking a better, more representative balance as part of that.  Amendments in the preceding group - they could not be moved because Deputy Sherlock was not present - overlapped with this in some respects.</p><p>I am not sure what the final configuration will be and so we probably will not be able to deal with this issue until Report Stage.</p><p> Under the current system, lay people are very much particular types of individuals and they come, in the main, from the commercial and financial sectors and their curricula vitae would reflect those of senior civil servants or business big-wigs, which is fine but we need more than that.  The amendments deal with some of the aspects around how laypersons are configured.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated, Fianna F&aacute;il has said that all of the laypersons should come from organisations.  However, we would prefer a mix, with some coming from organisations and others coming by way of appointment through the PAS.  I acknowledge there is a bit of a middle ground in that proposal.  In our rush to get the amendments in, which is many months ago now, we may not have properly added up our sums.  For example, the four should perhaps be a three to ensure balance.  However, we are not fixed on that for the moment.  The PAS, for all its good work, cannot be viewed as being entirely independent.  There are issues of potential explicit political influence and, moreover, the subtle influence of a particular world view of the types of people who would meet the criteria.  Our amendments seek to correct the current loading of the commission with a certain type of person that the PAS would have to consider.  We want to ensure that the commission is a lot more diverse and has a range of views and voices.</p><p> I agree with the point made by Deputy Wallace.  We are proposing to replace the Attorney General with the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which may have to change in light of the consensus for the inclusion of the presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  As Deputy Wallace pointed out earlier, the elimination of the Attorney General would free up a space for one of them.  We would be happy enough on that score.  However, the fact remains that there is no reason that the Attorney General should sit on this commission.  I do not see what expertise he or she could bring to the role of appointing judicial members.  The Attorney General is already involved in the appointments process at Cabinet in any event.  No other model replicates that.</p><p> In light of the changes made earlier, I do not think any of these amendments will achieve what we are trying to do.  However, we remain adamant on the Attorney General not being a member of the commission.  If he or she is not a member, it would free up space for others to serve on the commission.  We are not overly hung up on the lay versus legal issue, rather we are more concerned about the type of layperson that would be appointed in order to ensure the diversity needed.</p></speech>

This could be done by asking the PAS to select the individuals but we are proposing that they be nominated by particular bodies.  For example, the Act which currently governs the appointment of the Garda Commissioner states that the PAS shall run a competition to select a new person for the role.  We all would be very fearful of that but, fortunately, within that legislation is a role for the Policing Authority.  It is important to have a body with the experience and expertise to advise on the type of person for which the PAS should be looking.  If we allow a situation whereby the PAS can nominate a person based on competition or open application, we will not then be able to mould the commission in a way that is reflective of society.  It would be much better to have bodies that are reflective of different aspects of Irish society yet have a knowledge and involvement in the courts nominate who they would wish to be a member of the commission.  It is a role they would take very seriously.  They would be able to cajole people who may in the ordinary course of events not apply to the PAS to take on the role.</p> <p>  I support amendment No. 26, which seeks to do two things, the first of which is to remove the Attorney General from the commission.  I recently put forward legislation on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il that provided for a judicial appointments commission of which the Attorney General would not be a member.  The reason for the latter was not that the Attorney General lacks the relevant expertise or knowledge but because we thought it was inappropriate for him or her to have two bites at the cherry.</p><p>The Attorney General would not only be a member of the commission, which would recommend to the Government who should be nominated to a position, but would also be present when those names came to the Cabinet, advising the Government on who should or should not be appointed.  That would have entailed too much of a governmental involvement in the commission.</p><p> The Attorney General, whoever that may be, has significant expertise in terms of advising on judicial appointments, but that is a function played by the Attorney General in Cabinet when he or she is advising the Minister on who or should not be appointed.  If the names that come from the commission are not adequate or acceptable or if the Attorney General believes that they are not appropriate for appointment, he or she can say so and the Government can refuse them.  Notwithstanding all of this structure, the Government maintains the prerogative to appoint or not appoint people recommended to it.</p><p> Amendment No. 26 proposes to replace the Attorney General with the Chief Commissioner of the IHREC.  I would have preferred that body to be able to nominate someone.  Notwithstanding that, I will support the amendment and may table a further amendment on Report Stage.</p><p> Regarding the other significant amendments, I note with surprise Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 30.  I support it fully.  He is proposing to include the President of the Circuit Court on the commission.  I note it with surprise because my amendment No. 25 was ruled out of order.  However, I am pleased to see that Deputy Wallace's proposal has not been ruled out of order.</p><p> I have concerns about Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment.  It would complicate the process a great deal if some members were appointed under the diversity and social inclusion heading while others were appointed under the general lay person heading.</p><p> I will support Deputy Daly's amendment seeking to reduce the number of lay people from six to four.</p></speech>

I cannot accept the amendment.  One needs to acknowledge the importance of the role of the Attorney General and the manner in which that officer operates.  One also needs to acknowledge the fact that the Attorney General has been a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, since it was established more than 20 years ago.  Given that the Office of the Attorney General is the constitutional legal adviser to the Government and the Government has a constitutional role to play in advising the President on the persons to be appointed to judicial office, it seems that the presence of the Attorney General on the new commission would provide a key line of continuity between the design, oversight and management of the selection process for appointees to the office of judge and the ultimate decision by the Government as to the persons who are to be appointed.</p> <p>  As the Chairman will appreciate, the Attorney General has a unique position as the recognised head of the Bar, plays an important function in both legal professions and is a key user of legal services for and on behalf of the Government.  Forming views as part of the commission process as to which candidates are or are not appropriate for appointment to judicial office, the perspective and focus of the Chief Commissioner of the IHREC would be different in nature from the Attorney General's.</p><p>With the greatest of respect to the office of Chief Commissioner, that person would not have the same perspective in terms of members of the professions.</p><p> Under section 15(7), which outlines the areas of desired professional expertise and experience for the selection of the lay members of the commission, we already have a specific reference to human rights.  I am somewhat amused by Deputy Daly's continued reference to this process as being occupied, directed, orchestrated or in the possession of civil servants and officials.  I see no reference to that in the legislation.  I invite members to examine section 15(7).  None of it makes any reference to anyone other than persons connected with areas of importance throughout the NGO sphere as well as agencies and stakeholders across the gamut of appropriate and necessary organisations within our society.  To suggest that the Civil Service has in some way an inordinate amount of influence under the new proposals is misleading.  Regarding amendment No. 26, though, there is an important role for the Attorney General in the process.</p><p> Deputy Daly's amendments Nos. 27 and 28 have been discussed and seem to propose that the practising solicitor and barrister, along with the lay members of the commission, be selected by the PAS.  I am unsure as to whether that would be an advantageous position.</p><p> In amendment No. 30, Deputy Wallace seeks to remove the lay chairperson selected by the PAS under section 15, but it is the Government's view that having a lay majority and lay chair is important.  We should continue along those lines.  Therefore, I am not prepared to accept that amendment.</p></speech>

Members might then respond, if the Chairman agrees it is appropriate to do so.  The group includes a number of important amendments to which specific reference has not been made.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware of the commitment in the programme for Government to replace the JAAB with the new commission, which would have an independent chairperson selected by the PAS and approved by an Oireachtas committee - presumably, that would be this committee, which I would regard as the appropriate one - and a majority of laypersons, including persons of independent disposition, all of whom would have some form of specialist qualification to which reference has been made.</p><p> It is essential that the reforms open up the process to ensure a more meaningful and effective input for and on behalf of those persons who are effectively consumers of the services of the courts.  They rely, on an ongoing basis, on the fairness of the judicial system and on those who, through the expertise and specialties, can make a substantial contribution to the selection process.</p><p> When considering the chairperson role for the new commission, it must be acknowledged that the role of the commission goes beyond the rather narrow remit of the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board regime.  All those wishing to be considered for appointment, including serving judges, will be required to go through the commission.  The shortlist work will be far more onerous and will reduce what is practically an unlimited number of names at present down to only three names for one vacancy.  A range of new procedures, skills and attributes will be drawn up in the form of published statements.  Relevant committees for appointment will be expected to engage in the associated operations.  Commission members will design the requirements as the commission takes foot.</p><p> I envisage an important role for the new chairperson.  I believe it is important that the role is undertaken by a person with an appropriate skill set.</p><p> The board is changing into the commission.  I believe the lay involvement in the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board currently is inadequate.  I welcome the contribution of members in respect of the lay or non-legal contribution to the commission and the status of the non-legal or lay chairperson.  Again, it is important at every remove to acknowledge that the functions under the Bill are far more extensive than the existing functions of the appointments board.</p><p> We have considered the neighbouring jurisdictions of England, Wales and Scotland.  The appointment boards in those jurisdictions are chaired by persons who are accepted as being eminent non-legal or laypersons.  I acknowledge that in Northern Ireland the chief justice presides over the appointments commission there.  England and Wales have non-legal and non-judicial chairpersons of their appointment commissions.  In Scotland, the judicial appointments board has a non-judicial, non-legal or lay chairperson.  These systems are working well.  I am not suggesting they are perfect or ideal, but they are working well.  It is important to look to designs, models and systems that have been working well.</p><p> I believe that we are striking at the heart of the legislation.  We need to address certain issues to ensure that ultimately we bring about the best in this endeavour.</p><p> Section 15 provides for an independent, detached and objective process that will secure the services of the appointees.  A Public Appointments Service model has been operating in our public services for some years now.  Appointments to State boards are open to scrutiny.  The system is effective and transparent.  I do not subscribe to the views that I have heard that appear to question the integrity or process in the matter of the work of the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>Moreover, I believe that the Public Appointments Service is the appropriate body in the selection of lay members.  This ties in with what I said earlier in respect of section 15(7).</p><p> The Opposition amendments do not provide for a role for the Public Appointments Service and their acceptance would involve the deletion of section 15.  They envisage a mechanism for securing the lay membership of the commission based on a nominating body approach.  The bodies referenced include the Citizens Information Board, the Free Legal Advice Centres or the Top Level Appointments Committee.  I am concerned at Deputies putting forward a nominating body mechanism that is focused on specific number of organisations, including the Citizens Information Board, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Free Legal Advice Centres and the Top Level Appointments Commission.  It is fair to say that there are many other mechanisms that may well be considered.  I hope that we could do so in a way to ensure the broadest possible base of participation.  Vital bodies in this context include, for example, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, victim support groups, Traveller representative groups, community Garda divisions, the Rape Crisis Centre, Amnesty International, domestic violence action organisations, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, refugee networks, the Children's Rights Alliance, Ruhama and many other similar groups that one could consider.  I do not believe that the best approach involves going for a list of nominated bodies, as suggested in the amendments.  Indeed, at one stage Deputy O'Callaghan indicated that potentially a number of bodies could be considered as appropriate nominators.  It is important that, in the context of these amendments, we give appropriate consideration to these points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.924" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018012300002#N00200"><p>The Minister is making these arguments.  Our argument for taking the Attorney General out of the first stage process is based on the fact that the Attorney General is involved in the second stage process.  It is not a question of undermining the Attorney General.  We simply do not see why the Attorney General should be involved in both stages.  It does not seem to stack up.</p> <p>  The Minister made a comparison between the expertise of the Attorney General and the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  First, we are not doing away with the expertise of the Attorney General given that the Attorney General will be involved in the second stage.  Second, given that we are keen to get extra bodies on the full commission, namely, the President of the District Court and the President of the Circuit Court, I am prepared to look at whether we insist on the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission being part of the final commission when we go to Report Stage.  This is because we have no wish for the commission to get any bigger than it needs to be in order to be workable.  Certainly, we will consider that concession given our determination to ensure that the presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court are involved.</p> <p>  I wish to address amendment No. 30 as I have not yet done so.  The amendment removes the proposed Government provision to appoint a chairperson through the Public Appointments Service.  The Minister has addressed this already.  The Minister has expressed his dislike for our questioning of the position of the Public Appointments Service.  I do not believe any of us has undermined the service.  Having said that, the service is made up of political appointees.</p><p>If Napoli were playing Torino in a cup final next week, and Napoli were allowed to appoint a commission from which the referee would be picked, we would be a little bit concerned as to which side the referee might be on.  The proposed amendment to section 15 envisages that the commission shall elect its own chairperson from among its membership and that the chairperson may or may not be a lay person, depending on how the members vote.  I am not overly concerned about whether the chairperson is a legal or lay person.  The point is that I think it would increase the independence of the commission to allow its members to elect the chairperson.  If we did that, I would lay money on it that the members would pick a lay chairperson in the first instance.  It would give the members a greater sense of ownership and a greater role in the direction of the commission, encouraging a more independent and original statutory body rather than having the commission steered from the outset by a possible career civil servant, which would be the likely outcome of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, competition envisaged in the Government's proposals.  Given the membership of PAS, there is the potential of channelling political influence, directly or indirectly, through the selection of lay members by the Public Appointments Service.  Although a chairperson elected in this way may or may not have the same experience of effective board management and corporate governance as one selected by PAS in accordance with section 15, as drafted by Government, the elected chairperson would have the assistance of a full-time director and staff of the commission, if there were gaps in this regard.  We argued in the earlier days as to whether this was overkill, given the cost involved, but now that we are considering getting rid of the subcommittees, there will be more work for them.  That gives it more merit.</p><p> The inclusion of the President of the Circuit Court as a permanent member of the commission reflects the recommendations and concerns of both the Association of Judges of Ireland, the Law Society and the majority of the committee at this stage.  The Law Society submission in March 2017 on the proposed heads of the Bill emphasised that it is in the Circuit Court and District Court where most citizens meet the justice system, a point which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan raised at a previous meeting.  These courts are where most of the vacancies are and to which appointments will be made.  There must be range of judges with suitable skills and personalities to meet the needs of these courts and to deal with the volume of people competently and sensitively and that the input of the relevant presidents would thus be of major importance to the commission.</p><p> We will stick with our amendment at present but we will review it for Report Stage in order to accommodate the need to prevent the commission from getting too large.</p><p> Will I get a chance to speak on amendment No. 39?</p></speech>

I want to respond to Deputy O'Callaghan who thinks it is a bit complicated.  I think the amendment is quite simple and straightforward.  It is based on the premise that it will not be possible to identify all the organisations that would have an interest in this.  While it looks complicated legislatively, ultimately it is a simple process where a short list exists of organisations that would be relevant and would have an interest in it.</p><p>They would be in a position to make nominations in a much more direct way than in the traditional Public Appointments Service process.  Three members of the commission could be selected in that way.  It would be relatively straightforward and also facilitate a wide number of organisations without having to name them.</p><p>While I support the principle of amendment No. 30, I do not think I can support it at this stage until we see the composition of the commission.  I would not like to see the Bill proceed through Committee Stage without making sure there would be a lay majority.  I would rather see the issue of the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court resolved on Report Stage.</p></speech>

If we were to increase the lay membership, having regard to the fact that the committee has already deleted the reference to the involvement of committees, it is important that there be a mix of people chosen by the Public Appointments Service and nominated by specific nominating bodies.  We need to give this issue further consideration following the removal of the committee structure.  Between now and Report Stage we should consider how best we can accommodate a Public Appointments Service group, on the one hand, and, on the other, the importance of maintaining a reference to the power of nominating bodies to make appointments.  There is not that much between us in what we want to achieve, yet in the context of the deliberations and debate in which there are differing amendments, it appears difficult to find common ground.  With a little breathing space between now and Report Stage we might be in a position to do so.  We have to do so against a background in which the committees have been removed.</p><p>The import of many of the amendments we are dealing with now is against the background of the Bill, including that committee as well as the commission process.</p></speech>

It may be that the revisitation and preparation would be the better approach in advance of Report Stage rather than a piecemeal approach with something hanging there that just does not fit neatly.

It is self-evident.  Why have a three-year term if we are going to then ignore it?  It smacks of something like Horse Racing Ireland.</p></speech>

As a result, I have a difficulty with the amendment.  The provision applies to lay members, including the non-legal chairperson selected by the Public Appointments Service and the nominees of the professional bodies, namely, the Law Society and the Bar Council.</p><p>Under section 14(4), the Minister would, in certain circumstances, be permitted to appoint such a member for a further term without a fresh PAS selection process.  The terms of subsection (4) are based for all intents and purposes on the corresponding provisions of Part IV of the Court and Court Officers Act 1995.  These are the prevailing procedures for the legal profession nominees and lay persons.  In these instances, their terms may be renewed for a further three years.  I acknowledge that we are changing the basis upon which, for example, lay persons are appointed, moving as we are to the PAS process.  Assuming that the relevant person is willing and able to continue serving, however, and it is considered appropriate to do so, it is nothing other than common sense to reappoint him or her.</p><p> I invite members to agree that this is a standard board membership provision.  It is not mandatory, merely permissive.  It also makes some administrative sense.  I ask that the section be retained.  Even in terms of the different lay member composition or different means by which members can be appointed that Deputies Wallace and Daly are seeking, having made the appointments, it makes sense to allow for a potential turnover from time to time and it may be deemed appropriate for persons to serve a second term.  In this regard, I am minded to draw on Deputy O'Callaghan's remarks about how it could become a challenge to interest people in the process in the first instance.  In any event, it is only for one further period, so there could be no suggestion that these positions are being territorialised or occupied for an unduly long period.  It will be based on the member's interests or otherwise in the work of the commission.</p></speech>

That is possible and there is a good chance that they would be nominated to it again by the PAS, which is a political animal anyway.  Given that one of the driving motivations of the Bill is to try to depoliticise the process, we are trying to create a situation in which a Minister cannot simply reappoint someone.  The person would have to go through a proper process.  We are trying to diminish the number of paws politicians can have on the process.  Our amendment is driven by that.</p></speech>

Someone who has been appointed for three years has been vetted by the PAS, which believes he or she is good enough.  Unless something remarkable happens to that person during the three years served on the commission, it is probably unlikely that we could say that he or she has not been suitably approved by the PAS.  Must that person have to go through the whole process again?</p></speech>

I might think differently were the period longer, for example, a renewable five-year term, but even a total block of six years if reappointed would not be excessively long.</p><p>If the commission had six different lay members every three years, their influence within the process might be reduced, given that it would take people some time to get their feet under the table.  I will consider the matter again on Report Stage, but I do not support the amendment at the moment.</p></speech>

Board members might be doing a perfectly adequate job, but someone who is even better qualified might come along.  Rather than an appointment being at the blessing of the Minister, it should be open to a competitive process.  Existing board members could go through that process as well.</p></speech>

It may well be the case that, after three years, we have people who have contributed substantially to the effective working of the commission.  They would be regarded as good people and have expertise.  They would have acquired three years of experience.  It is not unreasonable that they might be asked to serve for a further term of three years.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan referred to situations in which there might be a level of unsuitability.  It is important that such circumstances be considered, but I point to section 23(2), which provides the power to remove a member of the commission from office.</p> <p>  Consider the contribution of lay people across the public service.  It is important that, if people are good, competent and doing well and if they wish and are able to serve, the option is there.  This provision is no more than that.  From that perspective, it is difficult to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It is making the appointment a three-year term.  Aside from the points that we have made about depoliticising this operation, many people, even very good ones, stay on boards for too long.  Consider the teaching profession.  Some of the most brilliant teachers have stayed in it for too long and do not do their jobs as well anymore.  As to politicians, most of us spend too long in the Oireachtas as well.</p></speech>

Of all the nominating bodies proposed either by the Government or by Deputy O'Callaghan in his Bill, I have the most concern about the Law Society and the Bar Council, partly because the fear would be that whoever is in, as it were, would get the nod for the position.  I raise this in the context that we know senior members of the Law Society have had questions raised in the High Court regarding their probity and indeed the nominations to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority by the Bar Council have also often been questioned.  In order to assist diversity and so on, I would like to remove that power from them and have them nominated in the same way as the other lay members, meaning they would go before the Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p></speech>

The purpose of that section is to ensure that nominees of the Bar Council and of the Law Society should cease to be members of the commission if they cease to be a practising barrister or solicitor.</p> <p>  The amendment would seem to have the effect of requiring the Public Appointments Services to recruit a practising barrister and a practising solicitor to be members of the commission, rather than allowing their own professional bodies to nominate them.  The amendment changes the reference to the two members from the Law Society and Bar Council to the two practising lawyers to be selected by the Public Appointments Service.  It seems to me, therefore, that whether the two practising lawyers are nominated by their respective representative bodies or recruited by the Public Appointments Service, they will cease to hold office if they cease to practise.</p><p>I think the main point here is the approach to the appointment of the two legal professional members.</p><p> In line with sufficient precedent - I mentioned the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995 - and for other reasons we have adverted to in the course of this debate, I am not inclined to accept the amendment, nor am I minded to change the basis of the appointment of the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-23a.1036" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018012300002#X00200"><p>It is important to recall that one can only become a judge in Ireland if one is a practising barrister or solicitor.  There is very good reason for that.  One has to have, I think, 12 years experience for the superior courts in order to be appointed as a judge.  It is a job of expertise that requires legal knowledge and experience of the courts.  Around the world now, there are jobs that everyone thinks they can do.  This is a job which requires an expert level of knowledge in law.  The purpose behind the section in respect of Deputy Daly's amendment is that one person on the commission is going to be nominated by the Law Society and one is going to be nominated by the Bar Council.</p> <p>  This provision exists in respect of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  In general, what happens is that the chairman of the Bar Council sits on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It is democratic because there are about 2,000 barristers in the country.  They all have a vote every year to elect a Bar Council of 20 people, which body then elects a chairperson.  It is democratic in terms of being representative of the barristers' profession.  It is similar in the Law Society.  I am not sure how they do it but I think it is the president of the Law Society who sits on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and he or she has to be elected as well.</p> <p>  There is one area in which there may be a bit of unfairness in terms of who can be appointed.  One can be a practising solicitor in-house and be appointed as a judge but, in order to be appointed as a practising barrister, one has to be a member of the Law Library.  Maybe that is something the Minister should look at in the future in order to equate those sides, so that there could be an in-house solicitor and an in-house barrister.</p> <p>  If we had a situation in which the Public Appointments Service put ads in the paper for a barrister to sit on the Judicial Appointments Commission, my view is that most of the people who would apply might not be, I will put it politely, the best candidates.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding whatever issues may exist or may have existed with any of the organisations referred to, these are official representative bodies.  They are organisations that have policies and have developed views around sentencing, the appointment of judges and court procedures.  It is probably the most suitable avenue for the legal profession to be represented.  In the round, it makes sense to have representatives from the Bar Council and the Law Society.</p></speech>

That is precisely why I moved amendments in respect of the appointments from some of the external bodies like FLAC and the ICCL such that, even though they may be representing the lay component, their representatives could still be practising barristers or solicitors.</p><p>I am all in favour of the enhanced representation of solicitors and barristers on the board, but who will choose them?  Unlike FLAC and the ICCL, of which no questions have ever been asked about their probity, questions have been asked about the probity of the Law Society of Ireland in High Court proceedings and of the Bar Council of Ireland.  These tend to be organisations which nominate the in-crowd.  It is not the case that one necessarily is a practising member, a barrister or a solicitor, but the in-crowd or in-set tend to be favoured by these organisations.  The aim is to keep professional representation, as well as the importance and input of the profession, but to remove the choice as to who the representatives of the governing bodies would be.</p></speech>

In fact, it is very unfair on the representative professional bodies.  Of course, it is open to anyone in society to ask questions and Deputy Clare Daly has referred to people asking questions about suitability and appropriateness.  Asking questions is easy but answering them and drawing on conclusive evidence and ensuring due process is important.  I do not think it is fair that a shadow is being cast on the professional bodies to which we are referring in the context of this legislation.</p></speech>

All of our Irish words were counted.  I thought that was good to have a league table of those who use the most Irish: I think that is good and constructive.  Regretfully I believe I was on 128 words at the time but that was over a short period so I am going to catch up with the likes of Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who had a couple of thousand.  Is rud maith &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; sin ag titim amach agus go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilge &aacute; h&uacute;s&aacute;id.</p></speech>

From my own perspective there has been a very discernible change in the use of Irish, particularly in this D&aacute;il.  The establishment of this committee has given an impetus to that.  In fairness it has also pushed us as an institution because we have always struggled in terms of our Irish-speaking capacity.  Sometimes a little bit of a push is needed to get things going.  The change in this D&aacute;il has given us that push.  We obviously see more Irish spoken in the D&aacute;il by all of the party leaders and group leaders.  There is this committee and also the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is chaired by Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  All of these things are giving Irish a greater prominence within the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p> From my own point of view as the Secretary General of the organisation, my desire is to have an organisation that is very proactive about Irish.  We met an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga recently.  He spoke to us about the concept of the active offer.  The active offer is essentially where facilities and services in Irish are offered to people without them having to be sought out.  That is something we have to try to put in place for Irish speakers over the coming years.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir had an interesting anecdote when he came to us.  We have five or so ushers who speak Irish and who are capable of giving tours in Irish.  It just so happened, by pure fluke, that on the day an Coimisin&eacute;ir came to Leinster House one of these ushers was on the gate on Kildare Street.  He told us that it made all of the difference, because he could speak Irish to this usher and it added to the experience of coming to Leinster House.  I would certainly like to see a situation where people who come to Leinster House whose first language is Irish or who are Irish speakers would have the facility to use Irish during their time here, whether they are on tours or dealing with front-line staff.  That is something we will be working on over the coming years.</p></speech>

T&aacute; thart ar 30 Teachta&iacute; agus Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, a l&aacute;n den fhoireann a bhaineann leis na p&aacute;irtithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la agus na ushers.  Mar sin, t&aacute; Gaolainn le cloiste&aacute;il m&oacute;rthimpeall an fhoirgnimh agus an champais.  Is d&oacute;igh liom f&eacute;in nach bhfuil go leor le cloiste&aacute;il laistigh sa Chamber.  Bh&iacute; figi&uacute;ir&iacute; &aacute;if&eacute;iseacha le cloiste&aacute;il le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Chuir s&eacute; ionadh orm.  Cheap m&eacute; b'fh&eacute;idir nach raibh s&eacute; chomh olc leis sin, ach t&aacute; na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; sin ann.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; go bhfuil r&oacute;l ceannaireachta againn f&eacute;in, na Baill, agus go gcaithfimid n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaolainne a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus &iacute; a bhr&uacute; chun cinn.</p> <p>  Luaigh an Teachta O'Dowd &eacute; sin ach is d&oacute;igh liom freisin m&aacute; t&aacute; rud br&iacute;omhar ann ina bhfuil suim ag na me&aacute;in, d&eacute;anann siad tuning isteach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach chomh maith go mbeif&iacute; &aacute;balta freagra a fh&aacute;il nuair a chuirtear ceist as Gaolainn.  Mar sin, nuair a bh&iacute;tear os comhair an Aire n&oacute; an Thaoisigh, caithfear bheith s&aacute;sta go bhfaighf&iacute; freagra.  Teasta&iacute;onn uainn go l&eacute;ir freagra a fh&aacute;il, p&eacute; ceist a bh&iacute;onn &aacute; cur againn.  Teasta&iacute;onn uainn bheith cinnte go mbeidh na me&aacute;in &aacute;balta an cheist agus an freagra a fh&aacute;il chomh maith.  An bhfuil an c&oacute;ras aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar f&aacute;il do na me&aacute;in agus an slua a bheadh thuas sa Ghaileara&iacute; ag faire ar an gcruinni&uacute;?  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfaca m&eacute; riamh aon duine de na me&aacute;in ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na cluas&aacute;in.</p> <p>  Is one-way traffic at&aacute; ann sa ch&oacute;ras aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  T&aacute; laigeacht ansin.  Nuair a bh&iacute;onn duine ag caint as B&eacute;arla, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn an c&oacute;ras aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar f&aacute;il.  B&iacute;onn ar dhaoine &eacute;isteacht agus aistri&uacute; d&oacute;ibh f&eacute;in.  D&eacute;anfaimid &eacute; sin go nad&uacute;rtha ach ba mhaith liom &eacute; a bheith ar an taifead gur c&oacute;ras de shl&iacute; amh&aacute;in at&aacute; ann.  An bhfuil aon phlean chun feabhas a chur air sin chun go mbeadh s&eacute; ag obair sa d&aacute; shl&iacute;?  T&aacute; an-chuid pleananna ag na finn&eacute;ithe i gcomhar Bliain na Gaolainne.  C&eacute; a chur le ch&eacute;ile an plean?  An raibh an fhoireann p&aacute;irteach ansin?  Ar th&aacute;inig s&eacute; &oacute;n bhfoireann an&iacute;os n&oacute; cad ar spreag &eacute;?</p> <p>  Maidir leis na foteidil a fheictear ar an sc&aacute;ile&aacute;n, go minic nuair a bh&iacute;onn an pobal ag faire ar an D&aacute;il n&oacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis, is p&eacute; rud a bh&iacute;onn ar an sc&aacute;ile&aacute;n a bh&iacute;onn le feiscint.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; as B&eacute;arla fi&uacute; nuair a bh&iacute;onn an tAire St&aacute;it at&aacute; freagrach as an nGaeltacht ag freagairt ceisteanna.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ar a chumas ag an gc&oacute;ras ainm an Theachta a athr&uacute; go h&eacute;asca nuair a thagann duine chun cainte.  Surely d'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; a leith&eacute;id a athr&uacute; ar an sc&aacute;ile&aacute;n chun go mbeadh an Ghaolainn sofheicthe os comhair an phobail an t-am ar fad.  N&iacute; g&aacute; go mbeadh s&eacute; go huile is go hioml&aacute;n as B&eacute;arla.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur f&eacute;idir leis an bhfinn&eacute; an c&uacute;pla &aacute;bhar sin a l&aacute;imhse&aacute;il ar dt&uacute;s.</p></speech>

Out of a staff complement of approximately 500 we have 54 staff who advise us that they are able and willing to do business through Irish.  We are in a more fortunate position than other organisations because we obviously have Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, which has 23 staff.  Outside of Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in there are 31 other staff who can do business in Irish.  They are right across the organisation from the Debates Office to the committee secretariat.  We have staff in our Communications Unit and the five ushers in the Superintendent's section.</p><p>A number of our legal people are fluent in Irish.  We have someone in our Parliamentary Budget Office and in the Library and Research Service.  We have some coverage in most of the organisation in respect of conducting business in Irish.  We feel that is important because it provides Members and other people with the opportunity to use Irish.  It may be on a limited basis, but they can still do so.</p><p> In terms of the translation system, the first thing to say is that we are in the process of upgrading it.  For a long time only committee room 4 was equipped for simultaneous translation.  That was obviously quite limiting.  With the growth in the use of the Irish language, we felt that we needed to upgrade our committee rooms.  Last summer we upgraded committee room 3.  We would have done all four but for the fact that we were moving the Seanad Chamber, which caused a capacity issue.  We are going to upgrade committee rooms 1 and 2 this coming summer.  That means that all four rooms will have the capacity to host meetings in Irish.</p><p> That brings us to the question on the other side of putting in place the resources to translate proceedings.  Obviously, if four meetings are going ahead and all are using Irish-----</p></speech>

That is our objective for next summer in terms of the committee rooms.  I think it is an important development for us as an organisation.  With regard to the two-way translation system, I can see the validity and the usefulness of it.  In the context of what we are doing, we would have to examine it because it would obviously have resource implications.  We would be very happy to look at that facility and, if it is possible, we will endeavour to provide it.</p> <p>  With regard to Bliain na Gaeilge our strategy statement, which we published in 2016, makes a commitment to develop an Irish language strategy.  We were trying to follow through on that.  We have put together a working group with staff, led by Mr. U&iacute;bh Eachach, the Pr&iacute;omh-Aistritheoir.  That group developed the strategy for Bliain na Gaeilge.  It is our first attempt at an Irish language strategy and it is something on which we would like to build.  The key thing for us now is that we have the strategy developed.  The Ceann Comhairle will launch it next month.  We now want to fully implement it over the course of the year.  It will give us an impetus in terms of developing a further Irish language strategy for 2019 and onwards, which can tie in with our new strategic plan.</p> <p>  We are conscious of the issue of subtitles and broadcasting.  As I have said, we have already translated our static content on the web.  We would like to do that for the broadcasts and it is our intention to do so.  There is some work to do in respect of the technology but we will be looking at it.  </p></speech>

I do not if that could be done le haghaidh an Gaeilge or what it would cost to do, even if only for Leader's Questions or something like that.

As I said, approximately 10% of our staff can deliver services in Irish.  This year we recruited seven new staff members who are fluent in Irish and who have the ability to provide services bilingually.  Our strategy for the future revolves around ensuring that core services that use Irish, such as Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, the Debates Office and the Committees Secretariat, have sufficient staff to be able to conduct business.  After that, we are focusing on front-line services such as the ushers, the education services and things of that nature.  That is the focus of our efforts.</p> <p>  The biggest challenge we have is actually getting staff with language skills.  To illustrate the scale of this challenge I might explain the situation in respect of the recruitment of parliamentary reporters the last time around.  We advertised for parliamentary reporters in 2017.  We had 331 applications in total, of which 34 were applications for the bilingual option.  Of these 34 applicants, 27 sat a simulation test, five of whom passed and proceeded on to the interview stage.  At interview stage, four out of five passed and were placed on the panel.  When job offers were made to those people, two out of the four did not actually take up the posts.  Of the people who applied for the bilingual option, the pass rate was 12%.  If one looks at it as a percentage of the overall number of applicants, 1% passed the test and were put on the panel.  It is illustrative of the scale of the challenge that we face in recruiting staff.</p> <p>  In terms of some of the other issues, it could be the case that the booklet is just out of print.  We will follow that up and ensure that booklet is published again.  On the record of the meetings, is the Deputy talking about the debates?</p></speech>

T&aacute; rud amh&aacute;in go bhfuil m&eacute; ina aghaidh agus is &eacute; sin earca&iacute;ocht gan ch&uacute;is.  Is &eacute; an f&aacute;th go bhfuil muid ag iarraidh go mbeadh daoine le Gaeilge sa gc&oacute;ras n&aacute; le go mbeadh siad in ann seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge d&uacute;inn.

I had an interesting conversation recently about people who end up being pigeon-holed within jobs.  The difficulty we face at the moment is that, in some respects, it is career-limiting for people to move into Irish-speaking posts.</p><p>We have to change that because otherwise we will continue to struggle to broaden the use of the language.  I suppose the only way of changing it is by increasing the overall number of people within the system so that it is possible to move people in and out of particular posts.</p><p> We are conscious of the, as it were, easy wins piece.  We tried to do that in our last Irish language scheme.  We have translated a lot of the signage.  We are conscious that we have to deal with some issues in that regard.  We are dealing with them.  We have done things in our lifts with the help of a member of staff within Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  There are pre-recorded messages in our lifts that inform people whether they are on "url&aacute;r a haon", "url&aacute;r a d&oacute;" or "url&aacute;r a tr&iacute;", etc.</p><p> I will set out the next stage in the process.  We have done our website.  Our new beta website is going live very shortly.  As I have said, almost 100% of the static text is in Irish.  Our lesson plans will go up in Irish very soon, perhaps during Seachtain na Gaeilge.  We have quite a lot of Irish on that website.  The next stage for us as an organisation involves focusing on our in-house broadcasting system and on the Oireachtas television channel.</p><p> One person in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service can conduct business through Irish.  We will have to work on this area.</p></speech>

Other members of the usher team would have some level of proficiency in Irish but would not be l&iacute;ofa.  We do a number of things for them.  Our staff go on an extensive range of courses.  People can avail of refund of fees schemes and we encourage them to do so.  I have to say that the overall attendance level at the courses is disappointing.  We are putting on these facilities for people.  I will illustrate the numbers.  We have an elementary course for staff and an intermediate and advanced course for staff.  There are nine people in each class.  The average attendance would be five or six.  This means that just 18 of the 500 people in the organisation, or approximately 2% to 3%, are committed to doing weekly courses that last approximately an hour and a half.  My own view is that we almost have to whet people's appetite before we put on more courses.  Just as the leabharlann has social occasions, I feel there are things we can do to bring people back into using Irish.  We would hope they would want to build on that and improve their Irish through courses.  There is almost a kind of reintroductory piece that has to be done in respect of that.</p></speech>

I think it would be helpful to people if we had that type of system in place.  We will take the Senator's proposal away and examine it.</p> <p>  It is well known at this stage that there is a backlog in Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in for a number of reasons.  It dates back to 1992, when there were issues with resources.  The requirement in the Official Languages Act for the simultaneous production of legislation put further pressure on the rann&oacute;g.  It is something we have to get on top of as an organisation.  At the moment, we have a capacity review which is taking place.  We have commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to come in and look at Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  The review has two parts: there is a cultural aspect to the operation of the rann&oacute;g and then there is a capacity aspect.  The capacity aspect deals with a number of separate issues.  Essentially, it involves looking at the capacity of the rann&oacute;g to perform its statutory functions and all of the other functions for which it is responsible within the Houses of the Oireachtas service.  That entails looking at the overall number of staff, the systems that are used to translate legislation and the use of technology.  We are currently introducing a new state-of-the-art translation system, Trados, which is used in the European Parliament.  That will help us considerably.  Other models are also being looked at to determine whether some non-core translation work should be outsourced.  For example, we had a positive experience when we outsourced the translation of the website.  A considerable amount of text - I think I said earlier that 250,000 words have been translated - has been translated using an outsourced model.  We are waiting on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which is due to be delivered at the end of February.  At that stage, we will have to go through the recommendations and put the required resources in place.  I envisage that there will be fairly significant changes in how the organisation functions.  We have to get on top of the backlog.  It is not sustainable to continue as we are.</p></speech>

The three includes one person at assistant principal level who is a former Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta journalist and who has very good Irish.  In terms of the output from that unit, the target for press releases under the official language scheme was 5% and when we checked back on it, the output was actually 7.5%.  We are doing a considerable amount, although we will seek to improve that further in the new language scheme.  It is something on which we are doing reasonably well relative to other organisations.</p> <p>  On the legislation issue, first of all, it is a legacy issue.  One of the reasons the problem arose was that in the 1990s the emphasis was very much on quality, which was absolutely right, but the resources were not there to keep up with the output.  As a result the section fell far behind in terms of its level of output.  In recent years we have increased the staffing of Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in from 17 to 23.  Being realistic and given the increase in the usage of the Irish language and the legislative output of the Houses, we are going to have to put in significantly more resources.  I am conscious that we have a statutory obligation which we must meet.</p></speech>

The issue with the simultaneous translation of Acts was resolved with the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which allowed Acts to be published on the web.  The difficulty was that once we hit 2010 or so, we had a moratorium because of the economic situation.  It took until approximately 2014 before we could begin working our way out of that.  In 2015 we sanctioned an additional three editors ar gr&aacute;d II and they commenced their work.  It has been in the last year or so that we have been getting our heads around the exact extent of the problem and what we need to do about it.  We took the decision collectively as a management team that, rather than operating on a piecemeal basis and introducing more staff, we needed to have an overall review of the area, which was why a capacity review was commissioned.  PricewaterhouseCoopers was the firm which was subsequently engaged to carry that out.  I envisage that we are facing into a fairly significant programme of change management.</p></speech>
