    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300003#D00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this opportunity to address them on the proposed statutory code of practice for the grocery sector.  FDII represents 150 companies across meat, dairy, consumer foods and beverages and has consistently called for the introduction of a statutory code to address the unfair trading practices that flow from the imbalance of power between retailers and suppliers.  The supply sector, food companies and producers, which employs approximately one in eight people across the economy, is seeing increasing pressure on margins and escalating costs in retailer supports.  This is leading to reduced product choices, reduced quality, lack of competition and diversity and, ultimately, poorer value for the consumer.</p><p>  Examples of unfair trading practices are many and varied but can include retrospective price adjustments, retrospective financing of promotions and other practices that effectively lead to retrospective payments or excessive transfer of risk.  This reality has been acknowledged by the European Commission and the UK Competition Commission.  Other EU member states, including our nearest neighbour, have introduced measures up to and including legislation to combat these negative effects.  We must do so for the sake of the Irish agrifood sector and we must do this by way of a statutory code.  The European Commission continues to look closely at this issue and previous speakers before this committee have cited the European voluntary initiative on business-to-business relations in the food chain as an alternative to the Irish statutory code.</p> <p> I will provide some background on this initiative and the broader context at European level before making some general comments as to why it should not be considered as a valid alternative.  In November 2011, 11 representative bodies from the entire food chain - the European associations representing farmers, food processors, retailers, etc. - adopted a set of principles and examples of fair and unfair commercial practices.  They were subsequently asked by the European Commission to deliver an agreed framework for effective implementation of the principles, in other words, a form of voluntary code of practice for business-to-business relations at European Union level.  Securing agreement on such a framework proved much more difficult.  Farmers and secondary meat processors, for example, considered the implementation and enforcement element to be too weak and did not sign up, while others who signed up to the agreement had reservations.  This initiative took place in recent months and the process of getting companies operating in the food chain to sign up has begun.</p><p> Before the end of the year, the European Commission will decide on whether to propose EU legislation to tackle unfair trading practices.  It will base its decision on three factors: the take-up of the voluntary initiative I described; the results of an impact assessment of various possible actions that is being undertaken by the Commission's directorate general on competition; and the results of a consultation the Internal Market directorate general is undertaking based a Green Paper on unfair trading practices in the food and non-food supply chain.</p><p> It is worth noting the following points at this stage.  The European process is very much in its early days.  As I will detail shortly, we in Ireland have gone through an unsuccessful process, facilitated by Mr. John Travers, to determine whether a voluntary code could be introduced.  While the European voluntary initiative is principle based, it is also the case that the draft Irish statutory code circulated for consultation by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in 2011 also has four governing principles, namely, consumer interest, fair dealing, strong supplier base and a competitive retailer sector.  The opposition of the Competition Authority to the statutory code has also been cited in earlier hearings of the joint committee.  While the authority is opposed to a code, this misses the point in that the issue here is unfair trading practices as opposed to competition rules.</p><p> To illustrate the point, I will cite the Report on Competition Law Enforcement and Market Monitoring Activities by European Competition Authorities in the Food Sector, which was published in May 2012 by the European Competition Network, a body comprising of national competition authorities, NCAs, from across Europe.  The report states:<blockquote>In their monitoring investigations a large number of NCAs have also identified as an issue the existence of certain practices linked to imbalances of bargaining power between market players that are deemed unfair by many stakeholders.  Although this is an issue which has been identified regardless of the level of the chain, particular focus has been devoted to this type of practice in the context of the commercial relations between suppliers and retailers.  However, the NCAs have found that most of these practices do not fall within the scope of competition rules at the EU level or in most of the Member States.  Consequently, a few NCAs have proposed alternative solutions to tackle them, such as the application of national laws against unfair trading practices or the adoption of codes of conduct or good practices with effective enforcement mechanisms.  A few NCAs have also expressed concerns about the potential anti-competitive effects that certain of these practices may have in the long term, should they ultimately negatively affect the competitive process in the supply chain or consumer welfare by reducing investment and innovation or limiting consumer choice.</blockquote>While the development of a voluntary initiative at European level is to be welcomed, it is far from perfect and also questionable in terms of effective enforcement.  The initiative is part of a process to ascertain whether European wide legislation is the correct approach to take.  While Food and Drink Industry Ireland observes and participates in this process, it should not distract from the immediate priority of implementing an Irish statutory code of practice.</p><p> A major concern for Food and Drink Industry Ireland is the length of time it is taking to draw up and implement the code.  The groceries order which banned below cost selling was revoked in 2006.  In the absence of any legislative framework, the food industry began to highlight the buying power of retailers, incidents of unfair practices and the need for a grocery code.  In 2008-09, political commitment to introduce a code was achieved.  The proposal by Government was to try and introduce a voluntary code by agreement and if this was not possible, to introduce a statutory code.</p><p> Between 2009 and 2011, an unsuccessful attempt was made to reach agreement on a voluntary code of practice for the grocery sector.  Consequently, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation gave a commitment to introduce an enabling provision in primary legislation before the end of 2012 which would allow him to introduce a statutory code soon afterwards.  He issued a draft code for consultation in mid-2011.  Food and Drink Industry Ireland fully supports this course of action, which we would like implemented as a matter of urgency, with a view to introducing a fair trading framework, restoring a degree of balance to trading relationships and underpinning the continued growth of Ireland's agrifood sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300004#E00200"><p>I thank Mr. Kelly for coming before the joint committee.  It is interesting to hear the other side of the story, having listened to the case presented by a number of other groups.  Mr. Kelly will have followed our deliberations and will no doubt have noted that one could have concluded from most of the previous presentations that there were no problems in the sector, the current system is fair, everybody loved everybody else and every supplier was perfectly happy with the prices being paid for their products.  Mr. Kelly painted a different picture.</p><p>  Many of the other groups that appeared before us indicated they would not have a problem with a voluntary code but would have a difficulty with a statutory code.  They appeared to indicate that their principal objection was not to the power provided by a statutory code but the bureaucracy it would create.  Would it be possible to introduce a national statutory code that would have teeth but would not create unnecessary bureaucracy?  In designing any scheme, it is necessary to consider the benefits of the scheme in the context of the work required to achieve the desired outcome.  I am interested in Mr. Kelly's response to this because the creation of bureaucracy was the main argument presented against a statutory code.  I assume from Mr. Kelly's contribution that Food and Drink Industry Ireland favours a strong statutory code.  </p><p>  Food and Drink Industry Ireland represents the industry.  We also have primary producers, processors and retailers.  How do the processors believe they measure up in terms of demand from retailers?  In other words, one suspects that the primary producer is the weakest link in the power chain.  How much pressure is being applied to processors to drive down prices?  Is the financial pressure on processors forcing them to put pressure on suppliers and primary producers?  Some of us suspect that this pressure is forcing processors to switch to cheaper ingredients, including imports.  Does Mr. Kelly believe the recent horsemeat scandal was an indirect, if unjustifiable, action caused by ever increasing demand for cheaper ingredients?</p><p>  Will Mr. Kelly outline the position in terms of quality versus price as pressure is applied by large multiple retailers?  Is quality being diminished to secure more competitive prices?  We heard some figures on the prices at which beefburgers are retailing.  I am interested in industry's experience of price pressure.  Is this pressure forcing the industry to use lower quality ingredients?  Has price pressure on Irish food and drink manufacturers forced them to source lower quality products or materials outside the State?  </p><p>  We heard very little about product labelling.  What challenges does the industry face to ensure products that Irish labelled products come from Ireland?</p> <p>There seems to be so much packaged in Ireland with all sorts of flags and so on put on produce.  Is there an industry approach to labelling to ensure it is absolutely transparent that a product is Irish?  I agree that in the case of manufactured products this causes a difficulty.  I am interested in hearing the view of the delegation on how this labelling issue should be dealt with in order that we know the provenance of products, especially where there is a mixture of raw materials.  If a product is labelled as pure beef, one hopes there is nothing else in it except beef.</p><p> At EU level does the delegation see the European Union taking action on this issue in the short term in a mandatory way?  I am not referring to voluntary guidelines.  Will it deal with the international element that many multiples exhibit?  Does the delegation believe we can do things at a national level ahead of the European Union?  How effective can we be at a national level?  How important is it to have legal intervention in Europe if we want to deal with this issue, given the sheer size of the multiples?</p><p> That is my first round of questions and I thank the delegation for listening.</p></speech>

As Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v noted, we have been given a different perspective in the presentation.  The lack of commitment to the voluntary aspect is an issue.  If it could be agreed to on a voluntary basis across the board, it would be beneficial at this point, but, obviously, that is not the case.</p><p>  The delegation remarked that the voluntary code of practice was proving difficult in reaching agreement with farmers and secondary meat processors because of the belief the implementation and enforcement were too weak.  Will the delegation elaborate a little on the implementation and enforcement aspect?  Will it enlighten us on why it believe they were too weak?  It also stated the process of getting companies operating in the food chain to sign up to the initiative had begun.  How successful has this been?  How widespread has it been?  Reference was made to primary legislation before the end of 2012 that would allow the Minister to introduce a statutory code.  Where does that commitment now lie?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300005#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his presentation.  In the final paragraph of his statement he noted that he would like to see implemented as a matter of urgency a fairer trading framework.  Will he expand on this and give some examples of where it is unfair and indicate what is happening in practice?  All of the multiples from which we have heard here have said everything is perfect, that they operate a totally fair and transparent process in dealing with suppliers and that there are no unfair practices.  Will the delegation tell us something of the imbalance in the trading relationship and offer some examples?  Another point made by everyone was that the legal provisions were already in place for individuals to make complaints and that since no one made any complaint there must be no problems.  I am keen to hear more detail from Mr. Kelly in that regard.</p><p>  Reference was made to the process of Mr. John Travers to introduce a voluntary code.  Where did it fall down or fall apart?  Will the delegation expand on why the process did not work?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300005#F00500"><p>I will respond initially to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's questions on the concerns about undue bureaucracy.  Obviously, any additional legislation will bring with it a degree of additional bureaucracy.  However, this should be set against bringing a greater degree of balance to the trading relationships within the sector.  We believe the benefits will far outweigh any increased bureaucracy.  As for bureaucracy, there is much to be learned from the voluntary process.  I will come back to Deputy Thomas Pringle's particular question on that issue shortly.  We spent a significant amount of time on the issue, as did the officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation who worked with Mr. John Travers.  They explored the issue in great detail at national level in terms of how the market worked and what was taking place in other member states.  This brings them to a position where they have a more informed view of the code that will finally be put in place.</p><p>  We have learned significantly from what has happened across the water in Britain, where a voluntary code was brought in in 2000.  In 2010 what is known as the grocery sector code of practice, or GSCOP, was placed on a statutory basis.  In recent months an ombudsman was finally introduced.  We can learn from the mistakes made in Britain and also identify the good parts of what was done there.  Obviously, there will be an additional bureaucratic burden associated with this, but we believe the benefits will far outweigh that burden.</p><p>  The issue of price and pressure and so on was raised.  It is worth bearing in mind that initially the objective behind this approach was to deal with unfair trading practices.  It is not appropriate to address price setting in this context.  It is subject to normal commercial negotiations which are generally tough.  A problem arises with retrospective changes to contracts.  For example, demands can arise where there are changes to the conditions or where there is an excessive transfer of risk, whereby the cost of promotions must be largely borne by suppliers, whereas the benefits will largely accrue to the retailers.  This indirectly places a significant cost burden on suppliers.  However, just as important, this can have a remarkably negative impact on the business planning process and can result in rather bumpy cashflow and also minimise one's ability to forecast how cash movements will unfold.  This has a negative impact on companies and a downward impact on pricing.</p><p>  It is worth examining how each category is structured with regard to cheaper ingredients and so on.  Most categories will have the full spectrum, from premium to budget products.  There is a variety of other factors feeding into this issue alaso, including consumer sentiment, the money a consumer has in his or her pocket which is causing him or her to trade down and commodity prices which are having a notable impact on the cost of ingredients.  The overriding factor is whether a product is safe.  A number of lessons have been learned in recent months in this regard, but many of these cases have to do with deliberate fraud in various parts of the food chain.  It should not take away, however, from the fact that the downward pressure on pricing has an impact on the sustainable margins of companies and their ability to reinvest in the business, manufacturing operations and innovation, which is the lifeblood of the industry because if we are not innovating or bringing new products to the market, consumers will go elsewhere.</p><p>  I will outline some points specifically on labelling.  European legislation, specifically a regulation on the provision of food information for consumers, is being implemented and large aspects of the regulations will take effect from December 2014.  The Commission is considering extending the country of origin labelling regulations which currently apply to beef to other meat products such as poultry, lamb and so on.  Broadly, our colleagues in Meat Industry Ireland and most major export companies support the extension of country of origin labelling regulations to these products.</p> <p>The Commission's assessment is coming to an end and the results are expected soon.  The use of meat as an ingredient is undergoing assessment at European level.  There is a difference that is worth bearing in mind.  The extension to other primary meat products will take effect in December 2014 as part of the regulation.  The Commission is required to undertake an assessment to determine the feasibility of using meat as an ingredient and this assessment is under way.  Processed products such as pizzas, for example, are made up of a large number of varied ingredients which may come from different countries.  There are practical issues which need to be addressed and any solution will not necessarily be as straightforward as extending country of origin information to other primary meat products.</p><p> Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the European Union's approach.  We are very close to the line for the introduction of a statutory national code; we need to implement such a code.  Unfortunately, however, we have probably been very close to the line for too long at this stage, which is a matter that needs to dealt with urgently.  </p><p> I spoke about the details of the voluntary initiative.  This will be one of three factors which will feed into the Commission's decision about whether to go down the legislative route.  Legislating at European level will be somewhat complex because of the different legal systems in place, particularly with regard to contract law on which it will impinge, across the 27 member states.  The approach is likely to be accepted at this stage and it is probable the Commission will propose legislation in the not too distant future.  As with any legislation, it is very important that it be properly drafted in order to avoid legislation that is not fit for purpose.  The somewhat laborious process we have endured here in the past few years should mean the national code is fit for purpose.  The exercises being progressed at European level probably amount to the right approach at this stage.  As I said, our priority is to get the national level codes over the line and have them implemented.</p><p> As a major exporting nation, what happens across the rest of Europe is very important.  Our major export market which takes over 40% of our food exports has had a statutory code in place since 2010.  We simply ask that the domestic market have the same legal framework as is applied in our major export market.</p><p> In answer to Deputy Ferris's questions I will elaborate on the enforcement element.  A number of options were considered.  With regard to the implementation and effective enforcement of the voluntary initiative, the strength of that enforcement varied, depending on which part of the food chain needed the strongest enforcement.  Certain parties were looking for more of a third party approach such as independent assessment and enforcement to be overseen by the Commission.  However, this was not acceptable to some of the other players involved in the initiative.  The eventual compromise was that there would be an internal assessment and enforcement.  A series of KPIs have been put in place, including the number of companies and member states which will sign up in different parts of the food chain and the number of complaints coming through at national and European level.  It is all meant to be done in a transparent fashion and the results will, in turn, be fed back to the Commission.  This was not deemed to be an acceptable level by some parties to the original agreement on the principles.</p><p> The Deputy also asked if the process had begun.  It is envisaged that it should be up and running by the end of the year.  The initial communication has started to be issued to companies across Europe asking them to sign a letter of intent on signing up to the voluntary agreement.  We estimate that these letters will be returned to Brussels in the next month to three months.  A public launch of the voluntary initiative is being considered for the early summer.  In practical terms, it will probably be up and running in some form by the end of the year.  We strongly hope the national statutory code will be up and running in advance of this.  This relates to the Deputy's question about the urgent need for a code.  As I said in my statement, we have been talking about this in one form or another since 2006 when the groceries order was revoked.  The voluntary process was in place for a few years, but it did not work.  The statutory code was issued for public consultation in mid-2011 and we are now close to mid-2013.  It is a question of getting it over the line and having it implemented.  I emphasise to the committee that my members regard this matter as urgent.</p><p> Deputy Thomas Pringle asked about unfair practices.  I will give some examples.  Generally, they are defined in such terms as retrospective price adjustments and retrospective financing of promotions.  These are particular terms taken from the recent Green Paper produced by the EU Director General for the Internal Market.  The excessive transfer of risk or the general concern about retrospective changes to contracts are phrases the UK Competition Commission used as the centrepiece for the groceries supply code of practice, GSCOP.  I refer to practices such as suppliers being required to pay listing fees to ensure their product receives a prominent position.  Major issues include delays as a result of minor invoice queries.  This comes back to my point about the bumpiness of cashflow which can have a significant impact on companies, their business plans and medium to long-term viability in the current credit environment, in particular.  </p><p> The Deputy also asked about the imbalance in the trading relationship.  For the majority of companies in the domestic market, an individual customer may often account for 20% to 25% of their business.  As in most other European markets, there has been consolidation in the retail grocery sector.  Ireland is one of the more consolidated markets, with a very high level of concentration among a small number of retailers.  That is the reality for suppliers.  This imparts very significant buying power to retailers.  The countervailing market power of suppliers does not apply to any great extent.  It does not really matter whether a supplier is an SME or a large business.  If more than one of a supplier's customers have such a significant chunk of its business, this certainly concentrates the mind and may hinder companies in making complaints.</p><p> The Deputy made the point that existing competition legislation might not have been utilised to the extent it should have.  I refer to the point I made in my presentation.  I referred specifically to the European competition network which is made up of the competition authorities across Europe.  This is not about competition rules but rather has to do with unfair trading practices and there is a significant difference.  The legislative remedies appropriate to competition rules - competition legislation or the implementation and utilisation of existing competition legislation - are quite different from the legislative response required to deal with unfair trading practices.</p> <p>Our view is that the statutory code being introduced is the appropriate legislative response necessary to deal with unfair trading practices.  That has been seen in a number of member states across Europe.  The approach being taken at European level involves literally teasing out what form this will take.  It is worth bearing in mind that when legislation is considered at European level, it is not simply a case of either legislating or not doing so.  What is really the case is that they will either legislate at European level or indicate that they are happy with the legal remedies which are in place at national level.  That is what is going to be the outcome.</p><p> The final question related to the Travers process, as it was known.  That process went on for a significant period and we engaged very substantially and constructively with it.  The report relating to it is extremely detailed and contains both the submissions made and details relating to all of the meetings which took place.  All I can say in respect of the process - this is highlighted on numerous occasions in the report Mr. Travers produced - is that our preference was for a statutory code.  However, we entered into the voluntary process without prejudice to that view.  We were of the opinion that if it worked, that would be fine.  As already stated, we engaged constructively during the entire process.  When the process was complete, however, the facilitator ultimately adjudged it not to have been successful.</p></speech>

When they came before the committee, all of the multiples categorically stated that listing fees are not requested.  As a result of the fact that individuals cannot come forward or are afraid to do so, we have not been able to establish the position.  Is Mr. Kelly's organisation aware of the type of practices to which I refer?</p></speech>

Our members would have informed us about such practices on a regular basis.  There have been certain reports in some of the newspapers in recent weeks in respect of some of these practices.  When the then Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment held hearings on this matter in 2009, suppliers were extremely reticent to come before it and discuss these matters in public.  In Britain, the ombudsman has been brought in to deal with this issue and has been tasked with rooting out these practices in a very proactive fashion and without placing individual suppliers in a very invidious position.</p></speech>

Would a system similar to that in Britain work in Ireland?  There has been a great deal of discussion regarding the cost involved in putting in place a statutory - or even a voluntary - structure.  Would putting an ombudsman, or an independent adjudicator, as the relevant official is known in the UK, provide a practical solution?  Would it represent a step forward?  As Deputy Pringle indicated, suppliers are afraid to come forward.  The multiples continue to state that there is no issue, that everyone gets along and that they cannot wait to do business with each other.  There is no hard evidence to suggest that there is an issue here.  Would the appointment of an independent adjudicator or an ombudsman represent the way forward?</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly referred to the importance of innovation.  One of the innovations I have witnessed in the area in which I live - I believe this to be the case in all rural areas - is the emergence of farmers markets.  Approximately 18 months ago there was a major brouhaha with regard to whether raw milk could be sold.  This was symptomatic of something greater.  I grew up on a farm and when the hens laid too many eggs, the excess were sold to a local shop.  That shop is no longer there but if it were and if we sold our excess eggs to it, I am of the view that both parties would be fined.</p><p>  There are extensive health and safety regulations in place and anyone who makes pork pies, apple pies or whatever and sells them at a farmers market must, in theory, comply with those regulations.  The great majority of the regulations are not adhered to by most people.  How could one possibly comply with them if one is baking or whatever in one's own kitchen?  Surely there ought to be a voluntary assumption of risk whereby it must be stated that pies sold at, for example, farmers markets are not produced by a commercial enterprise or that one's eggs were not produced by hens kept in a battery.  I accept that I am being slightly facetious in saying so but some such batteries resemble factories.  If one accepts that certain foods or whatever are not produced by a commercial enterprise and that the relevant hygiene standards do not apply, then one is accepting the risk involved.  Said risk is the same as that which obtains in respect of raw milk.  Should a differentiation be made and should consumers be able to choose?  It is clear that foodstuffs, etc., presented at farmers markets elsewhere throughout Europe have been produced.  The states involved do not, on the face of it, appear to be as preoccupied - as is increasingly the case in this country - with closing down small businesses which demonstrate a modicum of innovation.  Perhaps as larger businesses go bust they concentrate their efforts on smaller ones.</p></speech>

I will make a quick statement rather than pose a question.  I am a supplier to all of the retailers to which Mr. Kelly refers.  I cannot really speak openly about my relationship with them.  We do very good business and have extremely strong relationships with them.  As is the case with all forms of business, times are tough.  Most of the practices which obtain in Ireland, England and throughout Europe emanated, possibly, from Walmart in the United States, which bought Asda in the UK.  Business is business.  If I have a product listed with a supermarket chain in the USA, the UK or Ireland, I do not enter into the arrangement with my hands hanging.  It is necessary for me to organise a spending budget in order that I can put in place a promotional calendar with the chain in question for the year.  This is something we have come to accept and it is extremely tough to deal with.  However, that is the way of life.  I suppose that in order to educate the other members of the committee we might other suppliers to come before the committee.  All suppliers have been obliged to come to terms with dealing with those in the retail trade.  Buyers are under huge pressure and must meet their targets.  We, in turn, must meet our targets.  Consumers are also very demanding because economies are in shreds and they want value.  It is a vicious circle.</p></speech>

We are not really concerned with people hammering out tough deals but rather with suppliers not having control over or input in respect of retrospective changes to such deals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300007#H00900"><p>Deputy Deering referred to bureaucracy and costs.  When the debate on GSCOP and the ombudsman was taking place in Britain, studies were carried out by the relevant authorities.  That was a few years ago and the position may have changed - either upwards or downwards - in the interim.  However, the authorities in Britain calculated the cost of running the office of the ombudsman at &pound;5 million.  At that stage, this equated to 1p on people's weekly shop.  That is for a market of 60 million people as opposed to one of 4.5 million.  The draft statutory code for this jurisdiction refers to the appointment of an officer who would have a series of powers that would be quite similar in a number of respects to those of an ombudsman.  It is difficult to comment further until the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation publishes the legislation and the associated statutory code.  In the context of what was available in draft form, it was envisaged that an officer would be appointed.  It is not clear whether said officer would operate within the Department or within the combined entity that will be created when the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency are merged.</p> <p> On Deputy Michael McNamara's question regarding farmers' markets and so on, that issue arises from time to time.  The question in this context is whether it is possible to put in place a lower threshold.  That issue arises from time to time and has been successfully addressed in other legislation applying to SMEs, but it is one to be considered.  The only proviso is that we are potentially talking about food safety.  The voluntary aspect having regard to some of the risks which can be associated with food not produced or stored properly is significant from a health perspective.  These concerns would need to be taken into account in considering whether a lower threshold would be appropriate.</p><p> On Senator Darragh O'Brien's statement, I agree with what the Chairman said.  I would differentiate between costs, including the cost of promotional plans for the year and so on.  Even within the food supply chain we see differences in categories.  One of the concerns of some companies is related to a promotion being cancelled at short notice.  The costs associated with this will differ greatly if one is producing ambient packaged products which can be kept in the warehouse and diverted somewhere else or if one is providing perishable fresh produce.  The implications in terms of different practices can vary, but it is our view that the draft code, in the way in which it has been phrased, has the capability to deal with these and bring a degree of fair trade back into the relationships between suppliers and retailers.  I acknowledge and agree with the Senator's point that ultimately there must be a good working relationship between suppliers and retailers which provide the outlets for the produce of the vast majority of companies.  When they retail, they can do it very well and it can be a very beneficial relationship both for suppliers and retailers and, ultimately, the consumer.  Our point is that there is an aspect of that relationship that is problematic.  The statutory code, if it can be introduced as a matter of urgency, is a way to address this aspect.</p></speech>

While Mr. Kelly welcomes the progress being made in Europe and the possibility that the code will be introduced on a statutory basis in time, we are much further ahead with the Irish process and have been for some time.  That is the important message to be noted.</p><p>  We will hear next from the delegates from the IFA.  We will also hear from the representatives of another willing multiple.  The representatives of one multiple have so far decided that they do not want to meet us and on foot of this, we will write a report which we will feed to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and also, I envisage, into the passage through the Houses of the consumer and competition Bill.  I  do not want to pre-empt what the committee will do, but if we believe we should do so, we may decide to recommend the tabling of amendments on Committee Stage.  I thank Mr. Kelly.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming before the committee to discuss the proposed code of practice for the grocery sector.  I draw their attention to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

As the Chairman is well aware, it is a presentation I have made on several previous occasions.  When he was Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture, we meet him on several occasions.  Deputy Martin Ferris is probably tired of looking at me in coming here to make presentations on this matter.  This legislation has dragged on for so long that I am concerned about the commitment made on the part of all those concerned to progress it.</p><p>  Farming and the food industry make a hugely important contribution to the economy and rural society, something that has become more apparent during the economic downturn.  It is an export-driven industry, with the volume of exports growing to a record &euro;9 billion last year.  Farming, the food sector and related service industries maintain an estimated 300,000 jobs in the economy and contribute to economic activity in every parish and town in Ireland.</p><p>  The report recently commissioned by the IFA and undertaken by the UCD professor of agriculture and food economics, Mr. Alan Renwick, on the cattle and sheep sectors shows how embedded primary agriculture is in the local economy.  Farming and the agrifood sector have the potential to capitalise on growing global demand for sustainably produced food products and further increase employment and exports.</p><p>  The Government's Food Harvest 2020 food targets are ambitious.  Farmers are willing and able to increase production but only on the basis that they will be fairly rewarded for their work and investment.  A major threat to realising this objective is posed by the reality that primary producers are not getting fair play in the food supply chain and that their viability is being seriously challenged, both in domestic and European markets.  The dominant position of the large retail groups in Ireland and across the European Union is widely recognised and forcing down the prices paid to food suppliers to below cost of production levels, in some cases.  For example, liquid milk producers are receiving 33 cent a litre, on average, with production costs near 40 cent a litre.  The food supply chain in Ireland, in our main export market, the United Kingdom, and most of Europe is characterised by the concentration of buying power in the hands of a small number of very large and powerful retail groups with significant market share.  In Ireland almost 80% of the retail grocery trade is controlled by three players - Tesco, Musgraves and Dunnes.</p><p>  Farmers are very disappointed at the delay on the part of the Government in the publication of the consumer and competition Bill which is to include a statutory code of practice for the grocery goods sector.  The two Government parties made a big play of this issue in the run-up to the general election over two years ago.  The programme for Government committed to "enact the Fair Trade Act, which will ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector such as "hello money" which suppliers have to pay to secure a place for their goods on supermarket shelves".  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, gave the IFA a personal commitment and made repeated promises that the legislation would be prioritised for publication, first, before the end 2011, then in 2012, followed by before the end of 2012.  I understand the legislation has been "A listed" for Government approval since last autumn and the Government's inaction in the matter is unacceptable.</p><p>  The inability of the Government to address the serious inequities in the food supply chain is putting primary producers under severe income pressure and some processors are in danger of being forced out of business.</p> <p>Demands by retailers for large sums of money for promotions, shelf space and discounts from suppliers are adding to this pressure, and are totally unacceptable.</p><p> The IFA supports statutory legislation to address the imbalance of power in the supermarket-supplier-producer relationship and to deliver more equity in the food supply chain for the primary producer.  The IFA believes that all stakeholders in the food supply chain should be covered by the code, but it must specifically focus on targeting retailers to secure equity in the chain, right back to the primary producer.</p><p> The code must ensure that retailers have responsibility for ensuring their pricing and purchasing decisions do not impact unfairly on primary producers; prevent below cost selling and predatory pricing practices; ensure a fair system of procurement for Irish products; guarantee that contracts between retailers and suppliers do not include provisions to support retailer promotions or discounting; set a limit on the use of own brands by retailers; address the credit terms between suppliers and retailers and provide for no more than 21 days credit; include a provision for "retention of title", which should be automatic until goods delivered are paid for in full by retailers; oblige retailers to report details of their profitability and turnover in this country; put substantial penalties in place to guarantee that retailers comply with the code; and insist on proper labelling of produce, avoiding any confusion or misleading of consumers.</p><p> Along with a statutory code of practice, the Government must legislate for an independent ombudsman's office which would have legal powers to investigate and adjudicate on the relationship between producers, suppliers and retailers; act in the public interest and in pursuance of the code of practice, ensuring farmers are not forced to produce below the cost of production; demand information from retailers as part of their investigations; provide anonymity and confidentiality to suppliers who make complaints, initiate investigations; and enforce penalties for non-compliance and abuse by retailers.</p><p> The Chairman has already had an in-depth discussion on EU legislation.  I attended a meeting in Brussels last week at which Commissioner Barnier spoke.  He was clear in his intention to introduce a statutory code in the long run that will introduce transparency and ethics - two things about which I have serious concerns.  I indicated that retailers do not publish their profits or margins which means transparency is lacking.  We will have a job to get ethics included in a code.  The UK would regard itself as the major free-trader in the world.  I am surprised that its retail legislation is way ahead of this country.  It is time we made a serious effort to catch up.</p><p> Farmers are highly regulated and the relentless downward pressure on their margins from the retailers is not sustainable if they are to continue to produce high-quality, safe food for consumers.  Product price and input cost volatility remains a constant challenge for farmers today, with product prices varying across the commodities in 2012, while input costs rose across the board, on top of a major cost increase experienced in 2011.  The horrendous weather conditions of the past 12 months led to an increase in the volume of inputs consumed, particularly feed and energy, which further added to the cost of production.</p><p> While product prices have been largely positive over the past two years, it is not sufficient to provide farmers with a viable income as input costs have increased at a greater rate.  Since 2005, the major input costs for feed, fertiliser and energy have increased by between 40% and 65%.  The price being returned to producers does not cover the increased costs and the retail multiples must reflect the reality by returning higher prices back down the chain.</p><p> Irish consumers want to buy Irish produced products.  The Bord Bia quality mark provides consumers with independent assurances of identification and traceability.  Research carried out by Bord Bia clearly shows that is the case.  The IFA continually monitors Irish retailers&rsquo; shelves on the basis of their self-acclaimed commitment to locally-sourced product.  The Government must close the loopholes in the labelling legislation, which are misleading consumers and short-changing producers.  Irish farmers are proud to produce food in an environmentally sustainable way, to the highest standards of traceability, quality, safety and animal welfare in the world.  Lessons must be learnt from the horsemeat DNA episode and it is clear that there must be stricter controls on secondary processors, particularly in relation to imports.</p><p> The IFA&rsquo;s position is as follows: any serious breach in regulations or lapse in standards that results in damage to the reputation of the Irish food sector should lead to proportionate penalties where one is guilty of an offence, including the possible loss of a licence for the processor involved; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must introduce real transparency in the supply chain and should publish the names of companies importing meat and the volumes involved on a monthly basis; only Irish raw materials should be used in meat products that are labelled and sold as Irish; and clear and accurate labelling must be implemented right across the food chain to include the retail sector, butchers, food service and restaurants.  Proper compliance with the regulation would guarantee full traceability on all meat.</p><p> Irish farmers are extremely disappointed that the Food Safety Authority, FSA, has not implemented the legislation on beef origin and labelling across all food outlets in Ireland.  I call on the committee to pursue this issue.  The over-riding principle is that food labelling must, first, serve consumers by upholding their right to clear and straightforward information on the origin of product, and, second, it must safeguard producers by ensuring transparency and fair competition from imported product.  To give the consumer an informed choice on all meats, similar to that currently available for beef, the Government must legislate so that there is an obligation on all food business operators, retailers and the entire food catering and service sector to state where their product is produced.  The legislation must then be backed up with proper enforcement across the entire sector.</p><p> I call on the committee to support the IFA&rsquo;s position on the urgent need to regulate the retail sector on grocery goods.  The current imbalance of power in the food supply chain is unsustainable for the family farm structure in Ireland and across Europe.  Vulnerable sectors, such as liquid milk, horticulture, pigs and poultry, are under particular pressure from retailers and will not survive the price war if the Government does not take action.  Retailers must review their race-to-the-bottom, lowest price policy, in order to ensure acceptable standards and quality are always maintained for consumers, and producers are paid a fair price which reflects production costs plus an acceptable margin.</p><p> The Government and the EU Commission must accelerate their plans to regulate the sector, as farm families are not recognised or fairly rewarded for their role in the food supply chain.  The legislation is required urgently.  People are being pushed out of the sector due to pressure from major retailers.  We would like to see legislation introduced and treated in the manner it deserves.  In the past we failed to regulate the banks and the entire economy is paying for it.  The second most powerful sector in the economy comprises the major retailers.  Our failure to regulate them is evident at this stage.  It is time that we stopped talking about the issue and took strong action.  I urge the committee to put pressure on both the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to address the legislation as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

It is not the first time it has been before us.  I have been asking about the consumer and competition Bill for some time.  Mr. Bryan will be delighted to hear that there is no need to apply any more pressure.  The Taoiseach gave a categoric assurance to me on the floor of the D&aacute;il last week that the Bill would be published in this session.  I take him at his word.  He was very clear.  Normally, on the Order of Business one could get a variety of answers.  The Bill is a little bit behind time but I welcome that it will come forward in this session.  I understand from having been involved for many years in drafting legislation that there can be delays.  One can get legislation to 90% completion very quickly but it is the final 10% that can cause difficulties for the parliamentary counsel.  Bills can take time.</p><p>  I hope when we get the Bill that it is a good one.  That is more important.  I would rather get a proper Bill following a three-month delay than to get a weak Bill because we rushed matters.  I look forward to the publication of the Bill.  I have no doubt on foot of what the Chairman said that the committee will have a considered and significant input into the Bill.  I agree with the constructive proposal that the committee would table amendments that we had all discussed and agreed.  It would lead to that particular pillar in the process being put in place.  Significant progress is being made.</p> <p>I do not think it will make any difference in three or four years' time whether the Bill was three months late if it is the right Bill and is enacted correctly.</p><p> Many issues were raised by Mr. Bryan.  We would all like to see something happen at European level because of the sheer size of the multiples.  It is fair to say that I am not alone on the committee in hoping that not only can we take action at a national level but that we could take action at a European level as well because we sell our products into other countries so we want to get our price there.</p><p> An issue which I would like to ask Mr. Bryan to address is one that was raised by liquid milk suppliers.  They are very straightforward.  One is not adding or subtracting anything in that regard.  One is basically providing liquid milk.  One goes through a process and the milk is passed on to the retailer on a daily basis.  Producers raised with me the power and dominance of the multiples in terms of the unbalanced share of profit of the gross price which the consumer pays.  The continued downward pressure of price by the multiples on manufacturers and, in turn, the price they pay for a litre of milk threatens the viability of the production of milk in the winter months.  They believe that if the current situation continues, that it is unsustainable and will leave producers with no other option but to cease or reduce winter production.</p><p> It is not easy to replace a product such as winter milk.  In other words, one cannot bring it in from too far away or it will not be fresh milk.  How are the retailers so dominant in this situation?  One would think that the processors would have significant control because the liquid milk suppliers are feeding the processors and the processors are feeding the multiples.  In recent weeks it has been said that processors in Britain will take the milk out of the south east of this country and bring it over to Britain.  Could Mr. Bryan outline from his experience how the multiples are so dominant?  Is it because farmers in Northern Ireland have a low cost base for production and that they have a choice of market in this country or in Britain for anything they want to move out of the Six Counties?</p><p> Could Mr. Bryan give us an idea of the structure of liquid milk?  If we got our dream of a united Ireland and we had one jurisdiction in the State I would imagine that there would not be much profitability in importing liquid milk every day.  In such circumstances one would think the supplier and the processor would be in a dominant position.  When it comes to liquid milk is the &ldquo;Northern&rdquo; factor the reason for giving the multiples the dominance?  I heard one processor say that they are asked to tender every year.  Obviously, they are not allowed to form a cartel as it would contravene competition law for the processors to get together.  I am sure they are not blind to their costs and if all costs were the same one would think that the processor would have to demand a price that would entail a profit.  Whether they talk to each other, one would think they would come out with give or take the same price.  One would think they would factor into that something that would guarantee profit to the winter milk producers who consistently complain that there is no profit in the business.  From his vast knowledge of the industry it is important for Mr. Bryan to explain where the l&uacute;b ar l&aacute;r is or how the retailers have got so much power.</p><p> Mr. Bryan covered the retail issue quite well in his submission.  A second issue which he might explain, because it affects primary producers hugely, concerns meat factories.  My understanding is that if I go to England that I would get a much better quote from factories that operate in this jurisdiction and in England for similar animals.  Does Mr. Bryan have an explanation for that?  How is it the case that in the United Kingdom factory prices for animals seem to be much higher?  Did Mr. Bryan ever take up the issue of the fact that one can drive a lorry with cattle onto a boat in Larne to the United Kingdom without difficulty but if one goes with the same lorry to cross from Dublin or D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Britain that it is not possible to do so.  However, one can travel back to those ports from Britain with an empty cattle lorry.  Has Mr. Bryan ever raised the issue with the people who operate the boats and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  What is the explanation for the difficulty in getting a lorry on the boat in Dublin or D&uacute;n Laoghaire?  Even if there is a significant difference in the factory price that would justify the extra transport cost, one cannot avail of it.  That is a significant factor.</p><p> I understand that the IFA gets a levy that is collected by meat factories and processors.  It is a significant source of revenue to the IFA.  Could Mr. Bryan outline how much money is involved?  Is it an inhibiting factor for the IFA in dealing with meat factories and processors given that they are a source of a considerable amount of funding?  Did any factory or processor ever threaten the IFA to refuse to collect the levy if too much pressure was applied or if pickets were put in place to highlight their power in the market?  Could Mr. Bryan clarify the issue?</p></speech>

As he said, we have heard it all before.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  It is an indictment of the political system that has failed to deal with the issue.  I concur with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s point that legislation will be forthcoming.  I hope it will satisfy the necessary requirements.  The big issue for everyone now is the state of the farming sector, in particular in the past 18 months.  Each and every electoral representative has been trying to highlight the situation on fodder and how it has made matters much worse than was the case.  The producer on the ground is the one who is suffering most.  He or she is also the victim of increased costs in oil, diesel and feedstuffs.</p><p>  The loopholes in labelling were raised by Mr. Bryan.  If ever the issue was brought home to retailers, consumers and producers it was in the recent debacle with horsemeat and the lack of traceability.  A lack of a proper labelling system was evident.  Various ingredients from different jurisdictions have done enormous damage to the industry.  In fairness, the Government dealt with the matter swiftly.  Does Mr. Bryan concur with the view that all ingredients used as fillers should be clearly labelled, including country of origin?</p> <p>I raise the cartels within that sector.  The people who are at a loss because of those are the producers and the people on the ground, so to speak.</p><p> Mr. Bryan raised the issue of an independent supermarket ombudsman.  Will he elaborate on that?  It is a very good idea.  People are crying out for such an office, and it can only benefit the sector as well as the consumer.</p><p> Mr. Bryan stated also that the United Kingdom legislation is far more advanced than ours and he called on our Government to follow the UK lead and regulate retailers by introducing similar strong legislation and enforcement powers.  Will he outline the enforcement powers he envisages?  Enforcement powers will be needed if this is to work properly.</p><p> We have done all of this previously.  The welcome aspect is that the Taoiseach promised on the floor of the House that the legislation is forthcoming.  It is up to us, as elected representatives, to keep up the pressure to ensure that happens, and my party will not be found wanting in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300011#M00200"><p>I thank the IFA representatives for their presentation.  My first question is on the code of practice.  Mr. Bryan said it should set a limit on the use of own brands by retailers.  Why does he hold that view and will he expand on it?</p><p>  Some of the retailers who came before the committee cited that they only sell Irish beef in their stores but given that 90% or 95% of Irish beef is exported, that would be a very small portion of the amount of beef being produced and therefore the prices they pay would not have a huge impact on the price the producer would pay when so much of it goes to the export market.  What are the witnesses' views on that?</p><p>  An issue that arose from the evidence given by the retailers is that they negotiate a price and the contract price is there but the code of practice will cover issues that arise outside of the contracted price.  Does Mr. Bryan have any figures on those additional costs?  If these practices were stopped and the processor was benefiting from it, how does he see the code of practice leading to the producer achieving some of that benefit also?  Would that be provided for in the code as proposed or would it have to be examined?</p></speech>

With regard to pigs, it has been a very difficult few years, particularly with accumulated debts, food prices and so on coming at the same time as the implementation of legislation requiring changes in housing.  I know there was a consideration, and the late Minister of State, Shane McEntee, was in Clare discussing this issue, that the Department of Finance or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would talk to banks about parking debt or portions of debt to ensure that the entire pig sector is not wiped out.  Does the IFA have any proposals for the Government with regard to ensuring the ongoing sustainability of the pig sector?  I know labelling is an issue but beyond that is there any proposal?</p></speech>

Many issues were dealt with by the previous speakers.  We have had discussions with the different supermarket groups in recent weeks and many allegations were made prior to those meetings about hello money, listed money and so on but the representatives who came before this committee said there was no issue in that regard.  They were very strong on that on some occasions.  Have the witnesses hard evidence of suppliers coming to them directly, be it a beef producer, a horticulture producer or whomever, indicating they are under serious pressure from X, Y or Z, showing the evidence of that and asking what they can do for them?  If that is the case it should be incorporated into any report this committee produces to feed into legislation.  We all know of different cases but it is important that this is up front.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris mentioned the UK independent adjudicator.  I understand the person is in that office only four or five months but have the witnesses any feedback from their equivalent in the UK on the way that process is working?  Is it possible to have a similar process here?</p><p>  As a liquid milk producer I know only too well the difficulties involved.  It is a constant source of irritation that when one goes into different supermarkets one will never find the same price for the same litre of milk, even though I might get 33 cent per litre.  Many litres come from the one tank I produce every day of the week.  That is a constant source of irritation but I welcome the witnesses observations in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300011#M00500"><p>I welcome the delegation to discuss this important topic which affects the food industry.  We all saw what happened with the horsemeat scandal, which was the tip of the iceberg and not the first time issues were raised about the ingredients going into final food products be they agriculture-based or any other food products on supermarket shelves.</p><p>  What has come to the fore is that the legislation in Europe, and the State, are not strong enough to protect the consumer as well as the farming interest.  The primary producer, the farmer, and the consumer must be protected because everyone would agree from what happened in the horsemeat scandal that the people in the middle, the major processors, the importers and the supermarkets, cannot be trusted.  There was a breakdown in the process.  They were given latitude but they were labelling product that clearly was not what it said on the tin.  The consumer deserves to be protected and the only way that can be done is through a code of conduct, which must be backed up by regulations, to ensure the courts can adjudicate in instances where anomalies occur.</p><p>  The UK legislation appears to be stringent, for example, an ingredient that is more than 2% of the product must be indicated on the label.  We all know that is not the case here.  We have products in all the multiples, even after the horsemeat scandal, that are labelled as Irish product yet there is a high percentage of non-Irish ingredients in them.  It is a major issue, and it is affecting Irish agriculture.  There is only one way to deal with it and that is through primary legislation here.  I would be fully supportive of that because it will protect the primary producer but also the consumer.  The farmers want to make sure the consumer is protected because ultimately they will gain from it also.</p><p>  The independent supermarket ombudsman is a very good proposal.  I would go further, and Mr. Bryan might have included this in his proposal, and allow the consumer make submissions to the ombudsman as can be done with the Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, to whom consumers who have a gripe with a supermarket can make a complaint directly.  A period of time should be given for an adjudication to be heard, and statutory powers should be given to the ombudsman also.</p> <p>This is a matter that should be considered by the relevant Minister, be it under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It probably is a mixture of both.  As for what is happening in the United Kingdom, while I have examined the legislation in place there, does Mr. Bryan believe it is working on the ground?  On the face of it, having read the legislation, it appears to at least be protecting the interests of consumers and farmers.  While I could touch on many other issues today, I note the fodder shortage has been mentioned, I will keep to the agenda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300012#N00200"><p>I thank Mr. Bryan for his presentation and will raise a couple of matters.  While others have dealt with the issue, I refer to hello money.  It is very interesting because many of the large multiples have appeared before the joint committee and they all deny it exists.  Can the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, bring evidence before the joint committee to prove it still is being sought?  One reason for abolishing the groceries order in 2006 was to cut out the fact that hello money was being sought.  What was the IFA position in 2006 on the abolition of the groceries order?  My second question relates to proposed European Union legislation and as Mr. Bryan noted, such legislation may take a lot longer to pass than Irish legislation.  Were Ireland to introduce legislation, does Mr. Bryan think it might have a disadvantageous effect on our producers?  One of the large multiples that appeared before the joint committee last week operates in nine countries, while Tesco operates worldwide.  Were Ireland to introduce a legislative Bill, might that affect our producers were the multiples to source the products from areas which did not have such legislation?  Does Mr. Bryan believe it would affect our primary producers in that way?  Unless such legislation was passed on a worldwide or European Union basis, could putting in place legislation in Ireland have a detrimental effect on our producers?  The multiples could then begin to source the products in other countries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Bryan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042300012#N00300"><p>As they were shorter, I will start with the last questions.  On Senator O'Neill's question regarding hello money, I have had discussions with the Chairman on this issue over the past three or four years, when vegetable growers approached the Chairman and told him they were asked for hello money.  Several representatives from the horticultural sector have approached us but they will not make a complaint.  Just as Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has stated she must do it, I have met people, both at that level and at a much higher level, who have told me they were asked to make a substantial contribution at Christmas.  However, were one to ask them to make a complaint, they would not do it because they know they would get delisted regardless of whether they were a small horticultural grower in north Dublin, a chocolate manufacturer like Lily O'Brien's or perhaps a dairy or beef supplier.  They are intimidated by the sheer power of the retailers because to get delisted from organisations like Dunnes Stores, Tesco or the Musgrave Group, which purchase so much of one's product, is a considerable knock to one's business.  This reverts to the IFA's point, which is that retail regulation is required, as is an ombudsman who can investigate.  I would not be concerned that this might affect Ireland because different levels of legislation exist in different jurisdictions and it actually is the legislation which applies in the individual jurisdictions with which one would be obliged to deal.  My only concern would be that some country like France, which is considering a retail code, might go a bit over the top in nationalistic terms, given that we export 90% of our beef and will be exporting more than 90% of our dairy products.  Consequently, at European level, we must watch that to make sure no trade-distorting legislation is brought into any of this.</p><p>  As for the Senator's question on the abolition of the groceries order, the IFA actually had made submissions to the then Department of Agriculture and Food seeking to strengthen it.  At the time when the groceries order was abolished, we were seeking to have more products included in it.  Several of the products the Senator and I both produce were not covered by the groceries order and we were seeking for them to be included.</p><p>  In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, the lessons from the horsemeat scandal certainly must be learned.  Representatives of the IFA were in Leinster House on the day the Minister appeared before the joint committee and I thought that was a good discussion.  However, we must all learn lessons from that.  Moreover, there must be improved legislation.  We cannot simply state that it was a mess and then put it behind us, as much stronger legislation is required.  We need much greater inspection at secondary processor level.  We need much clearer labelling and it is extremely important that labelling is what it says.  It is unacceptable that one could buy something, be it water, alcohol or anything else, in which there could be product from six different countries.  Clear and transparent labelling is required and this is the time for the Government to act.  There is a view, which was expressed by both Ilse Aigner, the German Minister for Agriculture and St&eacute;phane LE Foll, the French Minister for Agriculture, seeking stronger legislation in this regard.  Consequently, Ireland also should be pushing for a much stricter legislation.  Moreover, to take up a point made by the Senator, if the label says something is Irish, the ingredients should be Irish.  Part of what emerged from this scandal was there was a mix and matching process going on and people were using labelling that clearly was designed to mislead the consumer.  This was in addition to all the other things that went on involving unacceptable practices.  Consequently, a tighter level of regulation is required in this regard.  We must learn from this issue and a level of proper legislation must be brought in.</p><p>  As for the Senator's question on a supermarket ombudsman, the IFA believes precisely what the Senator stated, which is that such an ombudsman should be there to represent the consumer, the primary producer and any other third party.  This is because the person who makes a complaint often will be another shop or retailer.  The idea is to put in place an ombudsman that can take complaints independently.  The Senator inquired about the ombudsman in England and the IFA has met its British equivalent, the National Farmers Union, NFU, on this subject.  While it has not been running for long but the NFU is reasonably happy with it.  Its members believe the opportunity to make an anonymous complaint, without being rung by the retailer in question to tell one it is dumping one's vegetables the next day, is extremely important.  Again, in a response that also answers some of the other questions, there must be proper, substantial penalties.  There is no point in having penalties of &euro;100 or &euro;1,000 for an entity with a turnover of &euro;2 billion.  One must have real and meaningful penalties and we also refer to ethics in this regard.  When a product manager's total salary is based on who he or she does along the line, whether he or she does the primary producer or the consumer, his or her salary is based on a bonus based on how much her or she can screw everyone in between.  How can there be ethics when this is the way?  This issue must be dealt with in retail legislation, in that one cannot be paid more for buying from the Senator for nothing and then selling for three times that to the Chairman.  This entire area must be regulated and the payment system in place for individual product managers at present certainly is encouraging them to do everyone along the line.  Moreover, if the penalties are small, they will continue to do this because their salaries are based on bonuses.</p><p>  Deputy Deering noted that representatives of the supermarket groups appeared before the joint committee and asked the reason they are so opposed to a code of practice.  As my predecessor from IBEC stated, they spent a few years stating they were against the voluntary code but now that they think there is a chance of a compulsory code, they are against that but seek a voluntary code, because they know they have a lot to hide.  I have never met a retailer anywhere in the world that did not claim no regulation was needed or sought.  The attitude is there is no need whatsoever for it, that it should be got rid of and is an unnecessary cost on the consumer.  However, food still sells at a higher price in Ireland even as the retailers source much of it more cheaply here in Ireland.  It is similar to the point Deputy Deering made in respect of milk.  He gets his price, which, relative to different markets in Europe is lower than some and slightly higher than others, but yet the retailers here sell at a price that enables them to take a hell of a good margin on it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked some highly in-depth questions to which I will turn in a minute but milk is a sector in which the capacity of retailers to take a huge margin at a time like this shows no respect whatsoever for primary producers.  I refer to the weather and the pressure under which primary producers are operating on foot of the winter that has just passed with the higher costs of meal but yet the retailers pay as little as they can get away with.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle queried the limit on own-brand products.  Probably the main reason the IFA gets concerned about own brands is the retailers use it all the time as a way to push down the price.  I do not wish to name brands -  and it does not matter whether the milk is from Connacht Gold, Glanbia or whoever - but the retailers stock it and the consumer gets used to buying it.  However, if it is Tesco's own brand or Dunnes Stores' own brand, they can substitute the morning after and one does not know from where they sourced it.  Essentially, own-brand products give the retailers greater power.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has left the room but earlier she referred to how the practices come from the United States from entities such as Walmart and so on.  These are the practices they employ to push down prices.</p> <p>Those practices are evident here but we must resist them as best we can and encourage people to do so.  They make it way too easy for the retailer to substitute.</p><p> We export 90% of our beef and 85% of our dairy produce.  As dairy production increases, that percentage will rise substantially.  That is why other markets across Europe are vital to us.  It is vital that there be free trade within Europe and that we have equal access to France and the United Kingdom, for example.  At different times, little barriers can be put in place.  However, the Irish market, particularly the fresh beef market and also the liquid milk, pork and chicken markets, is important.  Members will see our poultry men protesting when they see too many imported products.  They can get a greater margin in their own market.</p><p> Everyone selling into an import market sells at a discount.  If I sell Irish beef in the United States, I do not sell it at the US price.  The same applies to sales in England or France.  There is a little discount.  If English beef comes to Ireland &ndash; there is some &ndash; or English chicken or Northern Ireland milk, it all tends to be sold at a discount.  The domestic market is vital, especially for fresh meat, such as pork, chicken and beef.  Some 10% of the market is at stake but it is a very high-value sector.  It is helpful that the major Irish retailers source only Irish produce.</p><p> I was asked what we expect the code of practice to achieve.  We expect there to be a level playing pitch.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien could not have been clearer.  A business person is expected to bring in a big wad of money.  However, if there were a code of practice banning this, in addition to transparency, it would be useful.  I agree with the Chairman that retrospective action is far worse.  The practice to which I am alluding does take place, as we all know.  If it were banned and if there were a sufficiently large fine for companies, it would be stopped.  It exerts considerable downward pressure.  Horticulturalists have told us a major retailer met them at Christmas and sought 10% or 15% of the turnover.  They will not stand up in front of this committee unless there is anonymity and proper legislation providing for a massive penalty.  Anonymity is very important.</p><p> On Deputy McNamara's point, we have met the banks.  We have told them about the huge pressure on the pig and poultry sectors and others.  There is probably no sector in farming that is not under pressure after the winter we have had.  Huge feed costs have been incurred.  In a normal year, most stock would be out a little after St. Patrick's Day, even in the Deputy's part of the country.  This year we are heading for 1 May.  Every sector has considerable debt built up.  We have asked the banks to be more lenient and to give people more years in which to pay and to spread loans.  We have asked the banks to consider restructuring for some of the pig farmers in serious trouble.  Many of the pig farmers have large loans from merchants, as the members will be aware.  It is not easy to deal with that.  We want to sustain the pig sector in Ireland and address the high cost of feed.</p><p> The retail margin plays a huge role.  The retail margin taken on liquid milk, beef or lamb is much lower than that taken on pork.  A huge margin is taken on pork.  Tightening up in this regard would be of considerable help.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Ferris.  Since 2005 and 2006, I have been coming here talking about labelling.  I met former T&aacute;naiste Mary Coughlan and former Minister Batt O'Keeffe and I have worn a trail on retail legislation.  I spoke to Deputy Michael Creed, present members and the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  There are very few spokesmen on agriculture with whom I have not sat down with over the past five or six years.  We are not talking about three months but about six or seven years.  We need legislation.  I welcome the fact that there is a commitment from the Taoiseach but what I propose needs to happen.  People have been made promises for so long.  Operators in the pig and poultry sectors are so disappointed that the matter has dragged on for so long.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Ferris on proper labelling of all ingredients and the country of origin.  It is totally unacceptable that a pie could have unlabelled ingredients from six countries.  It is not fair to the consumer or primary producer.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned cartels.  Retailers have power over major food companies but the power they have when dealing with small and medium-sized producers is unbelievable.  The latter are sucked into an arrangement on which they become totally dependent.  On supermarket dominance, it would be very helpful to enshrine in legislation the right of people to make complaints anonymously and the right of an ombudsman to impose substantial fines.  Retailers will resist the legislation.  They will resist voluntary and mandatory codes of practice.  However, when the legislation is introduced, most will obey.  When there is no legislation, there is an <i>&agrave; la carte</i>arrangement, but proper legislation will be a big help.</p><p> Deputy Ferris asked about the UK legislation.  We met the NFU several times about it.  It is relatively confident that legislation can force the retailers to be bit more responsible.  I do not like setting my bar too high; I am just saying what I have said already, that is, that there should be substantial penalties.  How product salesmen are treated by product managers and retailers is downright scandalous at times.  They are treated as if they were a lower form of life.  If there were proper legislation in place to find law-breakers, it would be desirable.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked me about eight questions.  I welcome his strong support for the Taoiseach's commitment to a timeframe of three or four months.  I will have to keep the pressure on until the measure is introduced but it is important that it be introduced.  We want action at national and EU levels.  I am a little sceptical of action at EU level based on remarks of Commissioner Barnier the other evening.  It will probably take him two or three more years talking about voluntary codes of practice and then the Commission will proceed to talking about mandatory codes.  This represents a long time.  Some countries, such as Denmark and Holland, will be dragged screaming.  The amazing point is that the United Kingdom has moved ahead.  As Mr. Paul Kelly said, there will be contract legislation, etc., brought into play.  The Danes and the Dutch will put up resistance and that is why it is important that there be a national element.</p><p> I was asked about liquid milk but he answered the question himself.  The reality is that the major processors are spoken to.  The Deputy is in touch with the Cl&oacute;na representatives and a few of the others.  The individuals submit a contract.  They shop around and if they do not, they talk to people in Northern Ireland.  In recent years, the Northern Ireland trade has taken over 25% of the Irish liquid milk market.  That is a substantial proportion.  The market extends all the way to the area about which the Deputy is talking.  It is very hard to regulate the practice.  We work very closely with the National Dairy Council, which brands Irish milk as Irish when it is produced and manufactured in the Republic.  Some of the people in the North came up with a solution to this.  It involved buying a few gallons from someone in the South, bringing it across the Border and then bringing it back down again.</p><p> Winter production is very expensive.  The dairy sector is vulnerable in this regard.  Deputy Deering outlined clearly the costs.  Retailers will do anything to keep the price down.  We have met all the retailers.  The answer to the Deputy's question is self-evident.  Why do the retailers not agree?  All we do is negotiate on behalf of perhaps 2,000 liquid milk farmers and 17,000 dairy farmers.  We had the Competition Authority rampaging up our stairs.  Fifteen of its officials were with us for two days just because one or two of our members said the price may not be realistic.  It is very clear why companies such as Glanbia, Cl&oacute;na and Connacht Gold cannot agree on a price.  If they even thought about it, the Competition Authority would issue a fine of a few million euro.  Retailers, however, will never be fined for manipulating the price downwards.  Competition law, as it exists in the State, is very flawed, to the point where it discriminates against primary producers.  We have no rights at all but if we just say we want a fair price and cover the cost of production, we are deemed to be conspiring to shove up the price.  The competition legislation is wrong.</p><p> Reference was made to the one tender every year.  Some must tender every three months.  With regard to the own brand milk in particular, there is a tendering process, the price is set and one is up and down.  Some processors put in a plant with the intention of supplying a retailer.  If they lose that business, their viability is called into question.</p><p> The Deputy asked me about meat factories.  There are 30 to 33 export plants in Ireland and there are three major operations.</p> <p>The question was asked about supply and demand at different times of the year, and our price in different categories.  I do not have a figure off the top of my head for an R3 steer, but one is probably talking about somewhere in the region of &euro;100 between here and the UK.  One would get &euro;150 more here than in England for a P-minus cow.  Therefore, the price varies on different grades of animal and at different times of the year.  Ireland is currently at 107% of the EU average for our beef prices.  Last October we were at 92% or 93%. </p><p> A question was also asked about the IFA and the levy.  The IFA gets a levy on marts, milk, horticulture, pigs and several other areas.  How does the committee think we run the IFA?  We ran campaigns, the same as Fianna F&aacute;il collects outside the church. </p></speech>

I did not interrupt the Deputy.  We ran a campaign for three years to ban Brazilian beef from Europe.  Several of the factories the Deputy is talking about were involved in importing it.  Therefore, to say that there is a conflict of interest, just means that he has no in-depth understanding of the beef industry.  We have put a huge effort in over the last couple of years to get ships going.  A couple of months ago, I was at the launch of the first boat to Libya in 15 years.  We do not collect any levy off boats but we work daily at international markets.  We work for farmers and run a full-time office in Brussels.  The lobbying we did on the MFF and to get a proper budget on the single farm payment involved working with the French, the Germans and others.  That is what the IFA does.  We are a lobbying organisation, not a political one.  We are not involved in anything else, but we put a huge effort into working to represent 124,000 farmers.</p><p>  At times, one would be concerned that there is an understanding - and that is a very weak word - between factories.  Someone else mentioned cartels.  Of course, one would be concerned when they all pay the same price.  A moment ago, the Deputy asked for all the dairy co-ops to quote the one price.  </p></speech>

It is our job, however, to do everything we can to raise the price.  That is why we work hard on live exports and to encourage the maximum amount of cattle to go through the marts.  That is why we are trying to work with the NFU to get cattle into the UK.  Cattle do go from Larne easily but there is EU legislation on transfers between countries.  When one crosses the Border it is, unfortunately, deemed as a different country.  When one crosses from Larne in Northern Ireland to the UK, it is not regarded as a different country.  The legislation that applies to international exports does not apply from Larne to Scotland or England.  However, we have worked hard to reduce the cost of transferring livestock between countries.  A substantial amount of cattle go North but it is deemed as moving to another jurisdiction, so we have to get the regulations reduced to a minimum when that happens.  Over the last two years, an average of 70,000 cattle per annum have gone north of the Border, varying from weanlings, to store cattle and finished cattle.</p><p>  As regards shipping policy, a boat must be certified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to carry livestock.  It is an expensive process.  I explained how we worked to get boats certified for north Africa, including Libya and other areas.  If one wants to haul cattle from Holyhead to Dublin or <i>vice versa</i>, one must be certified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has very high standards.  I am not giving out about that.  Irish standards for animal transportation are the highest in the world.  That is good because it secures our live export trade and means that cattle will travel in comfort and safety, which is important.</p><p>  The Deputy asked a frivolous question about whether anyone had threatened us.  If he knows anything about the IFA, he would know that threatening us is a waste of time.  </p></speech>

We are pushing hard to get a price increase which is way overdue in the liquid milk sector.  In the context of trying to move the matter on, one of the retailers said he was looking for money off somebody before he could do that.  For anyone to say that type of skullduggery does not go on, is incorrect.  There are only two things that motivate people in life - fear and pleasure.  Retailers work on the basis of fear through delisting.  Some element of retailer regulation is absolutely critical to balance the show in the context of processors and primary producers.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about liquid milk.  Own-brand milk has basically decimated the branded products.  The situation is being abused.  One can spend ten years developing a product - including research, development and innovation - but overnight a retailer can decide to get a replica product to undermine that investment.  It is a drive to the bottom because they will get their margin in whatever way they can.  One of the reasons that liquid milk is under so much pressure is that retailers have allowed so much of a differentiation between the own-brand and branded products.  That is a strategic move by retailers, so effectively the percentage of own-brand is increasing all the time.  The margin left for a processor to pay the farmer back is being diminished.  Own-brand is a significant issue in the context of liquid milk, but also concerning other products.  It was scandalous for the Competition Authority to put an organisation like ours to that cost because a couple of people tried to say they were going out of business producing liquid milk.</p><p>  I want to answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about meat factories.  I have been in the IFA for over 20 years and was responsible for its organisational perspective for many years.  Not once did the IFA ever blink, nor will we.  Other than the IFA, I do not see anyone else who has challenged the meat factories.  They blockaded the meat factories day after day.  We are challenging them on price, as one can read in any newspaper, whether it is Henry Burns or James Murphy.  We are fearlessly on the farmers' side and nobody has put more effort into getting live exports to ensure that there is price competition. </p><p>  In the last week, both the president and myself had meetings with the NFU to see how we can get live exports into the UK.  In the financial context, it is about 5% to 6% of the IFA's total income.  The money comes from farmers and not a red cent comes from the meat factories.  We pay them a commission to collect it, but it is paid by farmers.  To even suggest that we would be bought, is very disrespectful to this association.</p><p>  I wish to make a point about the weather conditions which are very difficult.  It is an unprecedented situation so I ask this committee to use its good offices to get the Government to do a bit more now and appreciate what is going on in the farming community.</p></speech>

As he quite rightly pointed out, he has a lot more resources than I do as an Opposition politician.  Is it possible for us to do so within European law?  I am against it and I will be absolutely blunt about this.  One of the worst decisions that was ever made in Europe was the Sutherland competition law.  It has proven to be a disaster and I blame that law for the collapse of the banks.  They made a god out of competition.  Anybody or anything that stood in the way of competition, as they defined it, was to be steamrolled over.  I have, therefore, never been a great proponent of competition at all costs.  At the end of the day, as we saw in the horsemeat situation, the consumer pays one way or the other.</p><p>  I would be interested in finding out the technical information, if the witnesses have it.  Would the changes they want to see in competition law in Ireland be legal under European law?</p> <p>It is a farce that the vulnerable sector, which in this case is suppliers, cannot muscle up to something so powerful that there can be no competition with it.  They are in the weakest position by far.  It is totally unfair competition.  It is a bit like Wicklow playing Kerry in a football match.  We need to get to the technical realities.  We can all be for and against all sorts of nice things, but the question is whether it is an EU law problem or a domestic law problem.  If it is a problem of domestic law, we can recommend in our report that the law be changed.  If it is an EU law problem, we face a great deal more complexity.</p><p> I want what I said about milk processors to be absolutely clear.  I said they could not get involved in a cartel because the Competition Authority would be down on top of them like a tonne of bricks.  What I said was that even if they never spoke to each other, they all have the same cost base.  If they were to make a profit for their suppliers and themselves, they should end up with the same profitable margin.  It has been confirmed by the delegation that what is happening is that winter liquid milk suppliers are finding that it is becoming uneconomical to supply here.  That leaves us with the issue of the North of Ireland.  How can they produce milk so much more cheaply there and export it down here?  I use the term "export" in a technical sense, which reflects the legal position even if some of us would not like to recognise the Border.  How can they flood the market with cheap milk?  Without forming another illegal international cartel, it would be in the interests of farmers North and South - and no doubt the IFA has talks with the Ulster Farmers Union, as it indicated it has with the National Farmers Union in Britain - to ensure that we do not end up without milk.  If the day were to come that the island of Britain was short of winter liquid milk, to which I am referring specifically, the Northern Ireland farmer could start shoving product handily into the UK market.  We could end up drinking Dutch UHT in the middle of winter if that happened as we would not have enough liquid supply.  If people pull out of the industry, they will not easily return.  Where are we in this triangle?  Apparently that is the explanation of the low price to the winter milk producers.  It is ironic that while we are being flooded with milk from the North, some of the largest suppliers in the south east of Ireland are being lobbied by companies from the island of Britain to put the milk on a boat and bring it there.  We must deal with that issue.</p><p> Perhaps I am a simpleton, but I take it that Northern Ireland cannot supply the whole of the island of Ireland with milk in the winter.  If suppliers refused to allow retailers to put their labels on the product, what could the retailer do?  He would have no milk.  I recognise that would involve a bit of eye-balling, but from what we have been told, the retail multiples are not slow to eye-ball themselves.  Serious issues have been raised with us.  They were raised with me last summer when I become the spokesman for agriculture.  To be fair to the joint committee and the Chairman, in particular, it took the issue on board and widened it to a discussion on the power of the multiples.  We must get to the bottom of it.  In the meat and liquid milk sectors there is a clear connection between the supplier and the supermarket.  It is not a long chain whereas in a very highly processed food, it is difficult to establish the prices of the various ingredients.  The price of 33 cent per litre was quoted.  I understand 2 litres of milk costs approximately &euro;1.49 in a supermarket in the middle of winter.  It can vary from &euro;1.99 to &euro;1.46.  I understand there is no loss of milk during processing.  One wonders where the rest of the money goes, who gets it and whether the distribution is fair.</p><p> I understand that boats will not transport animals even where all the certifications and approvals are in place.  We are talking about a three-hour journey.  It is no longer about bringing the poor animal from Galway to Dublin on a lorry.  It would be nice for us to be able to play the market so that when the British price is up, we go there and when the Irish price is up, we keep them.  They have a little bit of a hermetically sealed container here, which is very handy from them.</p><p> On the levy, there is a story going around, which I am glad the delegation has put to bed once and for all.  In politics, all sorts of stories grow legs and become the truth after a while.  The story is that the IFA put a picket on a well-known factory operator, who invited its representatives in for very useful negotiations.  The story also goes that the parting shot as they went out the door was "Do not do that again, lads, because there will be no levy collected".  I take it that story has been denied and there is no truth to it.  Politics and lobbying is about perception.  If the amount of money collected is only 5% or 6% and the people one is negotiating with on behalf of farmers collect the money, the system should be changed as we had to change our money collecting systems to make them more transparent and referrable to the person actually levied.  It sends all the wrong signals to have the people with whom one is meant to be negotiating prices being the agents for collecting the money.  I know they do not contribute, but they do the mechanical collecting of the money.  As Fianna F&aacute;il does, I suggest the IFA collects the money from the membership directly.</p></speech>

We have often put cattle on boats in Dublin and gone to Holyhead and then through England on the way to France and Italy.  They do not like animals to be transported through the tunnel, however.  There is no legislation stopping animals going over and back.  I cannot tell the Deputy if the boat to which he refers is certified.  In the past we worked with P&amp;O and used to have four containers a week going out.</p></speech>

We had four livestock trucks travelling on each sailing to Holyhead.  That is not a problem at all.  The question is only whether it is viable.  If the boat is to take livestock, the rules are very different with approximately six times as much space having to be allocated for a livestock truck compared to a container.  There is legislation on airflow, etc.  I presume that is the reason for the issue.  Unless the demand is for a substantial amount of trade, the boats will not do it.  They will have to be certified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the effect that each sailing meets the space allocation and the trucks are chained down.  There is a significant raft of legislation.  I was involved in it.  I was on a ferry when the animals were being transported and I could not believe the distances that were being demanded.  It was for airflow to ensure that there is no pneumonia among the animals.  There is no legislation preventing it, however.</p><p>  There are several reasons for the Northern Ireland issue.  As England and Northern Ireland are in one legislative jurisdiction, a great deal of quota flowed to Northern Ireland.  There was a massive increase in production.  However, they do not have drying plants as we have for powder which means that at certain times they have surplus milk.  They would not have the capacity to dry it all, which means it suits them to put a certain amount in here.  I do not know how they can have done it at the price we have seen on some occasions.  I imagine what they were doing was unloading a surplus.  To do it for the whole year suits them, but they could not supply 100% of it.</p> <p>The Deputy's other suggestion would require some level of collusion by many people, which is definitely illegal under competition law, on which the Deputy and I disagree.  </p><p> There are completely different interpretations of competition law in Ireland and France.  As Ireland takes a purist view of competition, it is deemed illegal for six or seven people to sit down and decide that the price of beef or milk is wrong and that they will lean heavily in one direction.  I am informed that it is illegal under Irish competition law for us to discuss the issue of price with retailers or processors.  I am not saying whether I do or do not do this.  In France the right of the FSNA and other bodies to negotiate is accepted.  In the high level milk discussions that take took place in Europe recently the rights of inter-branch organisations and the right to negotiate prices and margins were debated.  There is a grey area between European and Irish law.  No more than in the case of much Irish law, we err on the extremities.  We meet the Ulster Farmers' Union on an ongoing basis and have a very close working relationship with it.  The types of farm and agreements in Europe are similar.  Again, when we talk to it, all it wants to do is send more milk, beef and chickens down here.  It puts the tricolour on them if they are being sent to the Republic of Ireland and the Union Jack if they are being sent to England.  That is its philosophy and it works for it.</p></speech>

Some of the groups associating themselves with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v were self-appointed.  We hold a secret ballot in which our 90,0000 members vote.  We elect our county chairmen at public meetings.  Our Kerry chairman was elected the other night in an election in which 200 people voted.  Therefore, ours is a very democratic association.  Our membership is quite happy to contribute through a levy to support our operations both in Brussels and here, be they retailers, meat factories or dairy processors.  That is what we do as a lobbying organisation.  At times we must mount massive campaigns.</p><p>  Again, I cannot underestimate the effort we have put in in the past three and a half years in Europe.  At conferences I have spoken with Angela Merkel and St&eacute;phane Le Foll.  We have a huge operation, but it runs on goodwill which does not come free.  One must work at it and with other farming organisations to secure delivery for Irish farmers.  I presume members are well aware that the situation in Brussels is much more delicate.  There has been a substantial increase in the number of countries that want to see the budget cut.  In the past one always knew that Great Britain would want to see it cut, but now Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands and even Germany want to see a cut.  Many of them are putting downward pressure on the MFF and the CAP; therefore, it was essential that we carried out a level of work to maintain funding.  I am sure Ms Farrell has sent the committee a copy of our report on the livestock and sheep sector in which the importance of premiums is very clear.  A substantial cut in premiums would result in a huge drop in production and the number of jobs.  From the farmers' perspective, a small levy paid on animals slaughtered, milk processed or cattle going through marts would represent good value for money.</p></speech>

Competition and the Competition Authority have been mentioned several times.  Mr. Kelly made a very relevant point when he said the opposition of the Competition Authority to a statutory code had also been cited in earlier meetings of the committee.  That is the case, but it misses the point that at issue is unfair trading practices, not competition rules.  That sums up what we are about.</p><p>  As part of the proposed new legislation which we all welcome and for which I have been pushing for a long time, it is proposed to merge the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  Reference was made to this issue at another hearing.  The National Consumer Agency will tell us that the consolidation or cannibalisation of the groceries sector is not in the consumer's best interests because it leads to dominance and too few entities having too much control.  Sometimes people cherry-pick which side they want to talk to.  There may be an issue when these two bodies are merged to try to merge their ethics, but we will see how that goes.</p><p>  We thank the delegation for coming and outlining its position.  At this stage, most of us are well aware of the issues involved, with no disrespect to anyone who has fed material to us.  It is important that we try to pick out the points that will give us a productive role in putting a new enforceable code in place that will work in harmony with EU law.  The major danger is that if we do too much, without working in harmony with the European Union, we will lose our competitive advantage.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Tony Smyth, director of engineering services, and Mr. Liam Basquille, principal officer in engineering services in the OPW, and thank them for attending.</p><p>  I draw attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l </i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise you that the opening statement and any other documents you have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The committee has considered the issue of flooding for several weeks and as this is our final public session with witnesses on the topic, it is appropriate that we should finish with the Office of Public Works.  I am very interested in hearing the witnesses' views on the problem of flooding in Ireland and how best it can be tackled.  I hope they will address the issues that have been raised by previous witnesses and, primarily, by the Irish Insurance Federation.  The federation's submission stated: <blockquote>It is also important that the OPW communicates reliable information on flood defences to insurers&hellip;[I]nsurers need to have confidence in OPW&rsquo;s review of standards and commitment to maintenance of flood defences once completed as well as&hellip;access to comprehensive information on all areas vulnerable to flooding showing the status of remedial works...details of the design standards to which flood defences have been constructed, expressed as the return period of an event which the defence is designed to withstand.  The minimum standard required is a return period of 1 in 100 years&hellip;maps in GIS [Geographic Information System] format for all vulnerable areas showing likely flood extent&hellip;maps showing the protections offered by any remedial works; and&hellip;regular updates of all information.</blockquote>I ask the officials from the OPW to deal with these issues in their presentation.  We need to consider the issues in their full complexity and take cognisance of all aspects.  I invite Mr. Smyth to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Smyth" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013042300003#B00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the joint committee on the important issue of obtaining insurance in areas that have experienced the impacts of flooding from extreme weather events.  I thank members for rearranging their schedule to facilitate our attendance at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform shortly.  OPW has a specific role in the transfer of information to the insurance industry on flood risk and flood defences.  We have no responsibility for oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or to insurance matters generally.</p><p>  It may be useful if I briefly outline the role and responsibilities of the OPW in relation to flood risk management.  Following a strategic review of flood risk policy in 2004, the Office of Public Works was assigned the lead co-ordinating role for flood risk management in Ireland.  We deliver services in the following key areas: strategic planning to manage flood risk into the future under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme in compliance with the EU floods directive and under the Irish coastal protection strategic studies; a programme of capital investment to address existing flood risks to properties and infrastructure through major and minor flood relief projects, in partnership with local authorities; and programmed maintenance of those arterial drainage and urban flood relief schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Acts. To support these activities we engage in a number of important information gathering exercises, including in particular collection of hydrometric data to improve the estimation of water level flow and to enhance the quality and reliability of flood relief design and mitigation measures.  We also developed awareness programmes among the public and businesses of the risks of flooding and provided information on how to plan, prepare and protect against flood risk.  We also commission research into areas related to flood risk management activities.</p><p>  In carrying out its functions the OPW works in close co-operation with other State bodies, principally the local authorities who are the other main players with key responsibilities in relation to flood risk management in the country.  In this context it is important to stress that while the OPW and the local authorities work in partnership in many areas, the local authorities are responsible for distinct areas of work in relation to flood risk such as leading the emergency response to flooding, the urban drainage infrastructure and the maintenance of certain water courses and channels.</p><p>  At the core of the OPW's work is the objective of reducing to the greatest extent possible the level of flood risk to people, property, infrastructure and the environment.  At a strategic level it is overseeing the most comprehensive national initiative to systematically identify, assess, document and report on the most significant flood risks throughout the country.  These assessments, known as the CFRAM programme, will generate detailed flood maps showing flood extents and other flood parameters such as depth and velocity.  They will recommend an integrated management plan and prioritised measures to address flood problems in areas of significant risk in each major catchment in the country.  The CFRAM programme will inform the long-term planning of flood risk management measures throughout the country, including structural and constructed flood defences and non-structural measures.  Both the flood maps and the identification and outline design of flood risk management measures under CFRAM will consider a range of potential future scenarios, including the potential impacts of climate change, to ensure capacity for adaptation is built into the flood risk management strategy and measures.  The output from the CFRAM programme in a recent pilot project included the production of 1,100 maps showing flood extents, depths and velocities.  Approximately 250 km of channels were surveyed and more than 275 sq. km. of detailed flood plain modelling was carried out.  This project required the development of nine hydraulic models of the river and its tributaries and the production of various reports, including an inception report, a strategic environmental assessment at scoping level and final report stage, a hydrology report and hydraulic reports.  Ultimately a catchment flood risk management plan was drawn up.  </p><p>  In more immediate terms the OPW is addressing flood risk in critical areas through its capital investment programme for both major and minor alleviation works.  Witnesses at the committee's previous meetings made comments which suggest that the OPW is not spending enough on flood relief works.  The figures will show this is not the case.  Under the Government's infrastructure and capital investment medium term Exchequer framework 2012-16, a total of &euro;225 million has been allocated for capital flood relief measures over the five-year period of the framework.  This allocation, when combined with the amount spent by the OPW on flood relief measures since the introduction of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act 1995 of &euro;320 million, will result in total expenditure of almost &euro;500 million on flood relief up to 2016.  This is a substantial investment by any standard, especially in the current difficult economic environment, and expenditure to date on flood relief works has brought significant benefits to communities and towns throughout the country.  The OPW estimates that over 5,000 properties have benefited from this investment, with the estimated benefit in terms of damage and loss avoided amounting to almost &euro;900 million.  The insurance industry has also benefited from this investment as its large claims payment costs for flooding, which amounted to almost &euro;700 million since 2000, would have been much higher but for the remedial and defence works undertaken by the OPW on behalf of the State and taxpayers.</p><p>  Under its major capital works programme, the OPW currently has nine major flood relief schemes at construction stage.  It is expected that a further five schemes will commence construction before the end of 2013, subject to completion of procurement and other preparatory formalities and the availability of funding.  A further 26 schemes are at various stages of design and planning.  </p> <p>Approximately &euro;30 million is expected to be expended on all these schemes during the year.  Under the minor works and coastal protection scheme, OPW provides funding to local authorities for smaller scale, more localised mitigation measures they wish to undertake in their areas.  It is open to any local authority to submit an application to OPW for funding under this administrative scheme.  Total funding of  &euro;21.6 million has been provided since 2009 in respect of 400 projects.  While it is difficult to know exactly how many properties were protected, we reckon more than 2,400 properties in addition to the ones I mentioned earlier have varying levels of protection from this expenditure.</p><p> Under the arterial drainage maintenance programme, the OPW will continue in 2013 to undertake ongoing maintenance of completed arterial drainage and flood relief measures.  At some of the previous meetings of the committee on this matter some contributors commented on the delays in getting major flood relief projects off the ground and completed.  The OPW appreciates that, especially in the wake of a severe flood event, there can be an expectation that flood mitigation measures can be implemented quickly.  It is important to point out however, that major flood relief schemes involve complex engineering and construction operations that can impact on people's living, built and natural environment and therefore require lengthy planning and decision lead-in times.</p><p> The process, defined by legislation, requires that OPW follow a number of stages from feasibility through procurement and public consultation to construction.  It is important that the work is done correctly and achieves its objectives.  Detailed technical analysis is required to establish the most appropriate solution, technically and environmentally, from a range of possible mitigation options.  Extensive public consultation is required at various stages to ensure that those affected by a scheme have the opportunity to input into its design and implementation.  Ecological and archaeological  issues often require in-depth analysis to inform the technical solution and to enable the necessary statutory consents to be obtained.  Finally, the process and time scales for procuring consultants and contractors, which is governed by EU law, is onerous and has a prescribed methodology.  The OPW at all times strives to expedite and progress capital flood relief works with the minimum delay within the resources available to it.</p><p> I mentioned earlier that there may be a need to clarify the nature of the OPW's current engagement with the insurance industry regarding the difficulties some people are experiencing in obtaining flood risk insurance.  As I indicated, the OPW has no role or responsibility regarding the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry.  The discussions which are taking place between the OPW and the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, have a specific focus and are concerned purely with agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW and the standard of protection offered by those schemes.  The discussions are taking place in the context of a joint OPW-IIF working group which also includes representatives of the main insurance companies operating in the Irish market.</p><p> Good progress is being made in the discussions and while there have been many technical details and issues to work through, the group is nearing agreement on the basis for providing information in an acceptable format which will enable the insurance companies to take this information into account when assessing flood risk to property.  The information being provided is in a readily accessible geographical information system, GIS, format which will show in digital map files the areas benefiting from completed flood defence works.  The initial focus is to provide information on schemes which provide protection for the one in 100 year flood event.</p><p> The OPW is satisfied that the insurance industry is engaging constructively and positively in this process and that there is a strong willingness to co-operate to reach agreement on a sustainable system of information exchange.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works.  As part of the process they are committed to taking the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is hoped that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in areas that are protected by completed schemes.</p><p> Looking beyond the current process, the comprehensive catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM programme to identify and assess flood risk nationally will, in time, provide a level of information which will enable the insurance industry to take decisions on the provision of cover based on the fullest possible assessment of that risk.  In conclusion, the OPW is committed to doing all it can within available resources to identify the measures necessary to manage the risks from flood events, through the CFRAM programme to identify those risks and through capital works to reduce the existing level of risk to properties, infrastructure and the environment.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

This time last year, on foot of peak flooding at that time, it was agreed that a committee be put in place to make recommendations to the OPW as the lead agency in the management of that issue.  That was agreed and put before the House but has not happened.  Notwithstanding that, I am sure Mr. Smyth has seen the report.  Can he respond to it?  We are all frustrated, to say the least, that no progress has been made and no protocol has been put in place to deal with the issue, which arises on a regular basis at this time of year on foot of heavy rainfall.  There is no protocol in place for the management of the levels associated with the Shannon, leading to the callows being flooded, which is expected in winter but not at this time or into the summer.</p><p>  The fodder crisis in agriculture is exacerbated many-fold for those who live in this region.  I ask Mr. Smyth to make a detailed response to the recommendations, which an all-party committee put in place.  If difficulties arise from it, what are they and how can they be resolved?  If there are funding difficulties, how much is it and how can it be resolved?  The report has not been placed on the record of the House and the Minister with responsibility has yet to respond in that forum, despite the fact that this report was published last August.  Can Mr. Smyth inform this committee as to how its recommendations can be adhered to, or if they cannot be adhered to, why not?</p><p>  We are very disappointed, annoyed and frustrated that no progress has been made on this despite the OPW's being given authority as the lead agency in this area to formulate a response and put in place the protocols that can gain the respect and agreement of the stakeholders.  Of all the stakeholders, those who suffer most and consistently, with their livelihoods being threatened to such an extent, are those callow farmers who live along the water's edge.  This is an opportunity that has not arisen in the recent past, despite the fact that we have met the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes and discussed this at length.  There is unanimity on the part of the members here regarding the recommendations in that report.</p></speech>

The previous speaker has raised one of the issues I was going to raise and I will be happy to hear the answer to that.  I want to raise the issue of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  Sometimes very minor works need to be carried out to alleviate flooding on farmland or dwellings, and the NPWS will impose its requirements and set out what it needs in terms of bird surveys, etc.  I have seen it being a problem for local authorities.  How much of a problem is it for the OPW?  Is it delaying any significant OPW schemes?  I have seen it hold up very minor works by local authorities.</p><p>  While the OPW is the lead agency it seems to be under major restrictions.</p> <p>The River Shannon was mentioned and there is an issue with the ESB and other bodies there.  Would the OPW be happy to have the final say on everything relating to flood relief?  In other words, the OPW could trump anyone else who had reasons for delaying works.</p><p> Mr. Smyth mentioned the list of rivers for which the OPW is responsible.  Could he circulate the list on a constituency basis in order that I can determine which are the responsibility of the OPW and local authorities?  At one time, they all came under the old Board of Works.  What way are they divvied up?</p><p> Every year, flooding causing significant problems but in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, I was informed there was a &euro;7.6 million under spend in 2012 on flood relief works.  I was curious about this given the works needed throughout the State.  It is great that &euro;225 million will be available over five years and I welcome that but could Mr. Smyth comment on this?  Is there a ceiling on the amount a local authority can apply for?</p></speech>

I refer to funding which is given to county councils on a certain basis.  Roscommon County Council was given &euro;270,000 to deal with the flooding problem in Athleague.  When it received the money, officials went off and worked out what they were going to spend it on.  Do they not get the money on the basis that they spend it on specific projects rather than subsequently deciding what they will spend it on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Smyth" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013042300005#D00300"><p>We responded to the committee's report on the River Shannon shortly after it was circulated to us through the Minister.  The main points we raised were that much of the work to be done would require the outputs from the CFRAM modelling and understanding of the river flows on the Shannon before some of those issues could be addressed.  There is a protocol in place between the ESB and Waterways Ireland for the operation.  I understand from all stakeholders such as the IFA and so on that this is not acceptable to them but that is there at the moment and, pending the outputs from CFRAM when we will have a proper model of the river and a proper understanding of the water levels and how the water levels in the lake and the callows are interconnected and so on, we will not be in a position to make any recommendations for changes on those levels.  We reported on that and we responded to the committee's report.  We appeared before the committee late last year on that and another issue.</p><p>  We also have frequent meetings with Waterways Ireland and the ESB.  The board has agreed to aim to reduce the starting water levels in Lough Ree by 100 mm. at the start of the summer and to have that as its target but that will be dependent on hydraulic conditions, rainfall, what happens on the river and so on.  We are not always in control of that because there is a limited level of control.  There are only a number of gates in Athlone that can be opened and, therefore, at a certain point the inputs into Lough Ree overwhelm the output and one is not control of the level but we understand the difficulties and our response in a sense is through the CFRAM for that, as it is for other rivers around the country to develop proper warning-----</p></speech>

Met &Eacute;ireann had issued a five-day outlook and the response was poor.  The OPW must abide by the protocol in place - I acknowledge the organisation may be hamstrung - and that is why we wanted that clarified in order that the committee could bring political pressure to bear to rectify that.  However, the ESB and other stakeholders are satisfied that the <i>status quo</i> is as good as it gets and the only amendment that can occur is subject to the completion of the CFRAM study.  In the meantime, the stakeholders we represent such as the farmers and those who derive their livelihoods from these lands are the only ones left out in the cold with no solution to their problems.  They do not agree but they are in the minority and, therefore, they do not have a say.</p></speech>

We have not advanced this.  A fine report was prepared, which made eight or nine recommendations that we feel would address the issue, resolve the problem in so far as they can and appease the stakeholders we represent but, unfortunately, it has not been discussed on the floor of the House.  Responsibility for this straddles different Departments and Ministers have not had an opportunity to respond.  I hope the Whips will engage to bring that to bear.  If Mr. Smyth is telling the committee that the existing protocol is as good it gets, our responsibility is to seek to amend it to meet the demands of those we represent whose livelihoods have been destroyed by the dominance of ESB and others.</p></speech>

As part of our major flood relief programmes we will always carry out a full environmental impact assessment.  Environmental consultants would be engaged at the same time as the engineering consultants in order to examine the possible environmental constraints on the various flood mitigation options and as far as possible building those into the design.  I am not aware of any significant delays on major works.  I am aware that on minor works, certainly in the Shannon area, it has caused delays because there was no economic way to do what locals had requested, which was to move silt and distribute it on the land.  There were concerns about damage to the environment and we were unable to proceed with some of those minor works.  That tends to be more of a problem with minor works rather than with the major ones where we have the resources to do all the various environmental studies and influence the design of schemes in that way.</p><p> I can certainly provide a list of rivers for which we have responsibility.  We will issue that to the committee.</p><p> Last year's outturn was &euro;7.5 million ahead of the allocation.  The allocation was &euro;45 million and we spent &euro;52 million.  So it was more than and not less than.  We found savings from other things. </p></speech>

The benefit of the minor works is that we have developed simplified criteria for the cost-benefit analysis to ensure we are getting benefit for the cost but without having to go to the rigours and expense of a full cost-benefit analysis as we do for the major schemes.  It might run to &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 to complete a full cost-benefit analysis.  In cases where the works will cost &euro;50,000, it does not make sense to spend that kind of money on studies.</p></speech>

Someone needs to have the final say and the OPW, as the statutory agency, should have the final say.  In other words it should be able to trump others.  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy chaired a committee that produced a very good report on the Shannon with good recommendations.  The problem is that the ESB and everybody else seem to be able to call it, with the OPW left merely as bystanders witnessing this.  Deputy Cowen outlined the problems for the farmers.</p></speech>

Last year the committee made a number of recommendations that would not have cost much money.  The witnesses are tiptoeing around the issue.  There were simple solutions that would alleviate considerable hardship for people living in the Shannon catchment area.  A simple one was removing the man-made structure in Clondara.  The OPW cut what was over the water rather than what was under the water.  I know the Minister is frustrated over the lack of joined-up thinking between officials at the top and the personnel on the ground who do not seem to be in line with that thinking.</p><p>  What efforts have been made to keep the water level 2 ft. below the weir wall in Athlone?  Very little effort has been made on the maintenance of the Shannon and its tributaries.  The witnesses said that removing silt and preventing it building up were minor works.  They are major works for the people in the midlands, because they cause considerable hardship.  Removing the debris, including tree branches and leaves that builds up in the river, from the Shannon and its tributaries would prevent a serious amount of flooding in the Shannon basin area.  Simple solutions are not being acted upon and I believe the OPW should have senior personnel down there looking at what is happening on the ground.  The reports coming back to the OPW do not tally with the reality on the ground.  I would really appreciate more effort from OPW senior management and the people working on the ground.  It is a joke to see the man-made structure in the Shannon at Clondara Tarmonbarry still not removed.</p> <p>I know the Minister has been in contact with the farmers, and he is as frustrated as I am that this issue has not been dealt with.  Very little effort is being made to remove silt from the tributaries and waters feeding into the Shannon.  Some old bridges on these tributaries were closed by local authorities for health and safety reasons and the arches are still blocked off.  These bridges were constructed two centuries ago.  The possibility of opening them up to allow water flow through has never been considered.  The view which came across at every public meeting on this issue which I have attended over the past six months is that not enough engagement or local consultation takes place.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service still seems to have more power than the OPW.  People are afraid to take it on but it must be taken on.  A common sense approach should be taken to dealing with this issue.  This is what people want to see.  I would appreciate if the witnesses comment on this.</p></speech>

We have been calling for good flood defence works since then and I pay tribute to the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for providing the money last year following our representations.</p><p>  My concern is with regard to the insurance aspect.  I fully understand the OPW has a limited role with regard to insurance, but it is in talks with the Irish Insurance Federation.  For the 26 or 27 years after Hurricane Charlie, which was a one in 30 year storm, houses and businesses along the River Dargle had no problem obtaining flood insurance or home insurance.  Flood defence works started along the river last year, and it is only in the past year that the insurance companies have stated to people renewing their flood or house insurance that they will not insure homes along the River Dargle.  This is ludicrous, because there was no problem obtaining such insurance after the hurricane.  During the construction of flood defence works the insurance companies are stating they are not prepared to insure.  They state if Bray Town Council or the OPW can come up with an outline of the work being done it might satisfy them.  I understand the works being done are to deal with one in 100 year diluvial events or one in 200 year tidal events, which gives us greater protection.  One would imagine the insurance companies would state that as this work is being done there will be no problem.  I do not have a problem, but my neighbours and people in Little Bray have told me they have been taking out insurance with the same company for years and suddenly they are being told they need to supply this information.</p><p>  I fully understand the OPW has stated it is looking to draw up plans which can be given to the Irish Insurance Federation once schemes are completed.  The work along the River Dargle is in process, and the paperwork has not been done for completed schemes.  The people of Bray are desperate to get something from the OPW to describe the works being carried out and what is intended and to state we have not been flooded since Hurricane Charlie.  The OPW should tell the Irish Insurance Federation it has a responsibility to provide insurance and just cannot stop doing so.  We are very concerned about this.  I welcome this opportunity to hear a response.</p></speech>

Most of my colleagues from the Shannon basin and others have covered much of the ground already.  I chaired a committee and presented a report calling for the OPW to be given management powers with regard to the Shannon.  What is the opinion of the witnesses on this?  While the OPW is the lead agency, it does not appear to have sufficient powers to compel people to take action.  While I respect agencies have their own agendas, we felt very strongly there should be one overarching body which should have the power to invite people to discuss on a formal basis future plans for the River Shannon, particularly when bad weather is forecast.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the ESB has agreed to let off water at Athlone.  People experienced in examining rising water levels felt strongly about this given they were not falling sufficiently there.  How will this happen?  Who will make the decision on it?  Will it be left to the ESB?</p><p>  How prescriptive will the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, report be?  We have received numerous suggestions for solutions, including ideas such as using boglands to hold excess water, abatement works and building up rock armour in particular places along the Shannon.  Who will have the power to decide what to do?</p><p>  The issue with regard to silt has been raised time and again.  I understand restrictions exist with regard to transporting silt, but Bord na M&oacute;na's railway network has huge potential in this regard.  How much consultation has been done with it to see what role it can play?  Of course we must bear in mind the big difference between wet and dry silt.</p></speech>

It is important to understand that at present the OPW has powers for maintenance on completed schemes under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  To get these maintenance powers we need to carry out a scheme under the Act, which means putting it on public exhibition after proper engineering, design, cost benefit and environmental assessments, having it confirmed by the Minister and then constructed.  After this, we maintain it.</p> <p>We do not have the legislative power to do the kind of work in question, namely, take silt or branches out of the river.</p></speech>

Mr. Michael Silke, a representative of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, appeared before the committee a couple of months ago.  Mr. Smyth's statement that people must keep the channels clear makes sense.  As Mr. Silke informed us, though, when a channel near his farm was not cleared for a certain amount of time, a little island developed and became protected despite not having existed 30 years beforehand.  It seems that the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, are adopting what would be called in the US a wilderness strategy.  That is fine in the US, which has massive tracts of land where there are no people, but we cannot live in a wilderness.  This is the problem.</p></speech>

This situation does not necessarily have anything to do with the Bray scheme commencing.  When we go through the process with the insurance industry and provide it with information on the scheme, it will have the full details.  Information can be provided to residents by way of a letter or directly to the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, but a letter in and of itself would not be of help.  In other cases in which letters were given via local authorities or the OPW, the industry asserted that it needed full, robust information, including all of the technical details, if it was to assess risk properly.  An outline of what is being done, even one that includes a reference to a 100-year level of protection, may not carry enough weight with the industry.  However, Bray Town Council or we can provide a letter.</p></speech>

It is a difficult situation, but there could be another flood during construction.  Contractors have been taken on and cannot worsen the current situation, but there could be an act of God like a hurricane.  Some of us who have been living alongside the river for a long time and have been insured.  I have lived there for 28 years and have not experienced a problem with insurance yet, as it is not due for renewal.

However, this is contingent upon rainfall and inputs from the upper part of the River Shannon and the tributaries north of the lake.  The ESB does not have complete control of water levels.  It can open a number of gates to reduce water levels somewhat, but more enters the lake at certain times than can be released through the gates or over the weir, leading to a rise in water levels that overwhelms the ESB's efforts.</p></speech>

Many agencies and local authorities that have a remit over planning, tourism, boating and so forth are involved.  When we identify a scheme of works, we generally put the plans on public exhibition, giving others an opportunity to comment.  We have powers to implement a scheme.  Once it is shown to be technically sound, passes its cost benefit analysis and meets environmental criteria, we recommend it for construction.</p><p>  The catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, process examines flood risk on a river catchment basis and identifies a number of measures, some of which may be constructed flood defences or structural measures and some of which may be non-structural measures.</p> <p>It will identify a lead body to bring each of those measures forward.  If members take a look at <i>leecframs.ie</i> they will see what a catchment flood management plan might look like.  It includes a range of measures for particular areas, including works that might be done and who might undertake them.  In some cases, a scheme will be led by the OPW and in others it will be led by a local authority.  That is the process from plan to outline design stage.</p><p> Silt remains an issue.  Without a scheme that is cost beneficial and can make all of the pieces stack up, it is difficult to invoke powers to do these things.  We have not engaged with Bord na M&oacute;na in regard to transporting the silt on the network.</p></speech>

A particular breed of butterfly will only survive if turf cutting is allowed to continue on some of the SACs.  Who makes these decisions?  What did the butterfly and bird do?</p></speech>

The issue of insurance was also discussed.  Lest the people of Templemore think they have been forgotten, we will not allow that to happen.  People are annoyed because they cannot obtain insurance.  The OPW and Minister announced that the Templemore flood relief management scheme would commence in 2011 but that did not happen.  Meanwhile, people still cannot get insurance cover.  This demands an explanation from somebody.</p><p>  Can Mr. Smyth set out the reason for the delay of the Templemore scheme and say if it will commence this year?  I hope not to hear the words "possible" or "possibility" in his response.</p></speech>

An engineer from the OPW, Mr. Michael Collins, appeared before the committee and answered questions on the matter.  There was then a public consultation process and the scheme was developed and announced.  Mr. Collins stated that the scheme would be commenced and would be done by direct labour.  Surely, the OPW knew at that stage about the elements to which Mr. Smyth refers.</p></speech>

The people of Templemore and surrounding areas are upset at the manner in which they have been treated.  They accepted for years that nothing was being done about the problem and were then happy to hear it was going to be addressed.  As stated by Mr. Smyth, at that stage there had been a consultation process with landowners and so on, following which the people of Templemore were told in the town chamber by the Minister and an engineer from the OPW that direct labour on the scheme would commence at the end of 2011.

I welcome Mr. O'Herlihy and thank him for his attendance.</p><p>  I draw attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l </i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise you that the opening statement and any other documents you have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before the commencement of the presentation, I should say that the Irish film industry is one of our most important, providing investments and jobs directly through its own activities and indirectly through its promotion of Ireland and Irish things.  Therefore, I am particularly glad to have the opportunity today to discuss Mr. O'Herlihy's future role as chairperson of a board in this important sector.  I ask the witness to begin by providing some details of his professional career to date and how this will assist him in his new role.  I am also interested in hearing plans for the future and how the witness sees his role as chairperson contributing to the success of the Irish Film Board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill O'Herlihy" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013042300010#J00200"><p>I take this opportunity to thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to address it and outline my vision for the Irish Film Board, the strategies to realise this vision and the challenges and priorities I have identified in this regard.  I am happy to answer any questions the committee might ask.</p><p>  I was greatly honoured when the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, approached me about taking up the position of chairman of such a well-respected organisation.  It was something that I thought about for a little while before accepting because I wished to be clear in my own mind that I would have the time and energy to ensure that I would be able to deliver in a positive and constructive manner on the strategies.  I believe I can do this.  I also very much welcome the appointment by the Minister of the six other members of the board, all of whom bring a breadth of expertise and experience in film and film production to the table, and I look forward to working with them and with the very experienced executive staff of the board.</p><p>  The Irish Film Board was established under the Irish Film Board Act with a dual mandate of assisting and encouraging the making of film in Ireland and assisting and encouraging the development of an industry in Ireland for the making of films.  This mandate was most recently elaborated and expanded on in the Creative Capital report published by the Minister in July 2011 and the implementation for the recommendations in the Creative Capital report is part of the recently published Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p><p>  The core business of the Irish Film Board is the development of indigenous Irish film making and the majority of funding is dedicated to this objective.  The Irish Film Board supports Irish screenwriters, film directors, actors and crew in realising Irish creatively driven films.  Recent examples include: "The Guard", directed by John Michael McDonagh and featuring Brendan Gleeson; "What Richard Did", directed by Lenny Abrahamson and featuring Jack Rayner; "Pilgrim Hill", directed by Gerard Barrett; and the soon to be released animation feature film, "Song of the Sea", directed by Tomm Moore and produced by the team that produced the Academy Award nominated "The Secret of Kells".  Irish creative talent is the lifeblood of the industry and I will be working with my colleagues on the Irish Film Board, as well as with the executive of the Irish Film Board, in helping to promote that talent both in Ireland and internationally.</p> <p>I joined at an exciting time in the industry.  In 2012 two films which were made possible through the support of the IFB received four Oscar nominations between them.  &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot;, set in Ireland and completely filmed on location in Ireland, was nominated in the categories of best actress, best supporting actress and b<font color="#2F2F2F">est make-up.  &quot;Pentecost&quot;, also s</font>et and filmed in Ireland with a full Irish cast and crew, was nominated for best short film.  This followed on from 2010, which saw Irish talent picking up awards and nominations and some of the industry's highest accolades.  Highlights included the Irish film industry receiving five Academy Award nominations, three of which were for films supported by the Irish Film Board - &quot;The Secret of Kells&quot;, &quot;Granny O&rsquo;Grimm's Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Door&quot; - while Irish animator Richard Baneham and his team picked up the Oscar for best visual effects for their work on &quot;Avatar&quot;.  Back in 2008, there was the Oscar for best original song for &quot;Once&quot;, which was made for only &euro;300,000 with support from the IFB.  Also in 2008, there was the Cam&eacute;ra d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Hunger&quot;, and in 2007 &quot;Garage&quot; won an award at Cannes as well.  These awards helped to give confidence and increased profile to Irish creative talent and are significant evidence that Irish film and talent emanating from Ireland have achieved recognition on the world stage.</p><p> Irish short films funded by the IFB have received eight Academy Award nominations since 2002.  The IFB-funded comedy thriller &quot;The Guard&quot;, starring Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle, has become the most successful independent Irish film in Irish box office history, grossing more than &euro;4.3 million at the Irish box office and more than $5 million in the United States. </p><p> The first Bollywood blockbuster to be shot in Ireland, &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot;, starred two of Bollywood's biggest stars and was filmed on location in Dublin over five weeks.  The film used an abundance of Dublin locations for spectacular dance sequences and stunts.  It was distributed in more than 20 countries, which meant that images of Ireland and Dublin were projected on the big screen across the globe.  All of this provided promotional opportunities for Tourism Ireland to exploit Ireland as a tourist destination.  According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland figures, 20% of all tourists that visited Ireland in 2010 did so because of images of Ireland they saw on film.</p><p> Film is not just about the creative aspects of what is on the screen.  It is also an industry and a business.  It is an industry that raises finances, provides employment and pays for goods, facilities and services.  It creates works that are distributed and promoted in Ireland and elsewhere, are seen by local and international audiences, convey a visual image of Ireland to a wider world, generate exports and revenue from abroad and encourage international tourists to visit Ireland.  All of these activities require financial and business skills.</p><p> The Creative Capital report was commissioned by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and was compiled by a group of industry professionals under the chairmanship of Brendan Tuohy, the former Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It was completed in April 2011 and was published by the Minister in July 2011.  It was included as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and its continued implementation was also included in the recently published Action Plan for Jobs 2013, in which the implementation measure is stated as follows: &quot;Continue to implement actions set out in the Creative Capital Report to double employment in the film and audiovisual sector by 2016.&quot;</p><p> The Creative Capital report envisages that if its recommendations are implemented, turnover in audiovisual production, which is already at &euro;500 million, could be increased to more than &euro;1 billion over a five-year period, and the number of full-time equivalent jobs - already more than 5,000 - could be increased to more than 10,000.  The headings in the Creative Capital report are as follows: develop an industry and build strong companies; build exports; develop skills and talents; a strong domestic industry; mobilisation of the industry and the whole of the Government; and unlocking its potential.  There are 42 recommendations in the report.  Some have already been implemented in full, including the extension of the section 481 film tax incentive to 2020, and many are part of a concerted work in progress.  I can contribute to that work and look forward to working with the various industry stakeholders as well as the Irish Film Board and its executive.</p><p> The particular matters I will focus on will include building strong companies in the sector and supporting a drive for exports of audiovisual works across all platforms.  I will also focus on the development of training for those both behind and in front of the camera.  I am familiar with the broadcasting environment in particular, and can bring my knowledge and experience to the table in addition to my behind-the-scenes experience through my many years working in public relations.  I will also promote the development of the domestic audiovisual industry in all media and look forward to working with the industry in helping to mobilise creative talent in conjunction with the Government and its agencies. </p><p> Section 481 has now been extended until the end of 2020, which will assist in giving the sector continuity and certainty for the future and allow projects to proceed in the knowledge that this important underpinning of the industry will be there for the next seven years.  This demonstrates the commitment and proactive approach of the Government to the future of the Irish film and television production sector.</p><p> With the knowledge and experience I have of both the public and the private sectors in Ireland, I believe I can contribute in a constructive way to the implementation of the Creative Capital report.  The stakeholders in this industry include the IFB itself, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Finance, the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, public and private sector broadcasters including RTE, TV3 and TG4, cinema distributors and exhibitors, DVD distributors and retailers, and online video-on-demand and other film services.  There is a rapidly increasing variety of ways in which audiences now access content.  All of these elements contribute to a cultural industry which is all about creativity and talent, jobs and exports, international revenues and tourists, but it is ultimately about the audience, whether in a cinema or in front of a television or computer screen wanting to be entertained or uplifted, to laugh or cry and ultimately to be engaged in a life-enhancing experience.  It also contributes to jobs created and the exports and revenues achieved, whether at the cinema box office, through television or online subscriptions or through DVD rentals and sales, which, in turn, create further opportunities for Irish talent in what is hopefully a virtuous circle of cultural and economic activity.</p><p> I believe my experience, qualifications and achievements will enable me, as chair of the board, to bring together the diversity of skills and talents on the board and in the executive, to bring a knowledge of business as well as promotion and marketing to that mix, to provide the benefit of what knowledge I have of the ways of government to what is an area of activity much affected by legislation and regulation and, hopefully, to supply some wit and wisdom to what has been described as the most powerful form of cultural and artistic expression in the modern age.  </p><p> The Vice Chairman asked me about my background.  I have been in broadcasting for almost 50 years and I am very familiar with, and have a full understanding of, the television and radio environments.  Through working in news features initially, I think it is fair to say I had a major impact on the development of regional broadcasting in Ireland.  In fact, I was RTE's first regional broadcaster, based in Cork.  As a consequence of working on the programme on which I worked with Frank Hall, the whole culture of filming Ireland outside Dublin changed.  </p><p> I covered current affairs for RTE television at a time of immense importance in establishing the relationship between the Government and public service broadcasting.  I was public relations director to the Cork Film Festival and advised the director Dermot Breen to change the focus of the festival to the promotion of Irish films in order to ensure its long-term development, which was done.  I worked with Seamus Smith, who was managing director of the National Film Studios of Ireland, to promote film-making in Ireland and, along with him, took part in promotional campaigns to Hollywood and the Cannes Film Festival, which successfully brought film projects to Ireland.  I produced and financed independently a series of 13 programmes under the title &quot;Distant Drum&quot;, a ground-breaking film about the diaspora which was filmed in the United States, South America, Australia, the Far East and Europe and was transmitted and bought by RTE over two seasons.  I also produced a documentary on Se&aacute;n Lemass.  I acted as unit publicist on &quot;The Purple Taxi&quot; and &quot;Excalibur&quot;, two major motion pictures made in Ireland.  I have worked for more than 40 years in the communications industry.  I thank the committee for listening to me.</p></speech>

Will Mr. O'Herlihy either give credit to or deny the rumour that Dunphy and Giles will be advising him?</p> <p>I know it is traditional for Opposition members to contribute first, but on this occasion I ask that the committee agree to allow Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy to address the meeting first, as she has to leave soon owing to genuine family commitments.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

His curriculum vitae shows that it is very fitting for him to hold the position.  He is well known in many sectors and will make a very fine chairperson.  I am very keen on the regional aspect of his expertise.  Ireland has great potential in the film industry.  Such is my support for the development of this sector that I proposed the setting up of a film commission in County Offaly when I was a county councillor and I persuaded Offaly County Council to do so.  It is known as Film Offaly and is very active.  An offshoot was the organisation of a film festival, the only one in the county and it is an unusual one in that it targets young film makers.  The regional aspect of encouraging film making is very important.  The handy option is to focus activity on counties Wicklow and Dublin, which was the case in the film industry for a long time, mainly because of the availability of Ardmore Studios, but we have so much more to offer across the country.  I ask Mr. O'Herlihy to outline his views on developing the scheme that was in place previously to fund filming outside the Dublin area.  Is it possible to fund people to film in the regions?</p></speech>

I know, for instance, that there is a very fine film maker in County Kerry and that work has been done in that county.  Certainly, as chairman, I will be looking to develop opportunities outside Dublin.  I will be speaking to board members and the executive of the Irish Film Board about ways to exploit such opportunities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013042300012#L00600"><p>I thank Mr. O'Herlihy for his very interesting presentation.  He has had an interesting life so far, with more to come by the looks of things.  </p><p>  I wish to address the issue of the ability of people around Ireland to see films.  In the town I come from there used to be two cinemas.  Then we progressed and developed and ended up with none.  In County Roscommon as a whole there is one cinema.  There was one cinema in Roscommon town, but it has closed down.  What can the Irish Film Board or Mr. O'Herlihy do to make film viewing more accessible?  When I say "more accessible", I mean the distributors of films should make it viable for community centres or town halls in remote areas to screen films.  Where I come from, one has to make a two-hour round trip to see a film and the experience is ruined as a result.  Does Mr. O'Herlihy envisage the Irish Film Board being able to do anything to address this issue?  The promotion of Irish films is part of the board's remit, but many people do not have access to them.  What does Mr. O'Herlihy believe the board could do to encourage our public service broadcaster to show Irish films in order that we do not have to watch another re-run of "Are You Being Served?" or something equally not up-to date?</p></speech>

The relationship between RTE and the Irish Film Board is very good.  The chief executive, Mr. James Hickey, works closely with RTE to develop that relationship further and ensure greater access to Irish films.</p><p>  To respond to the first question, the Deputy is reflecting the huge change that has taken place in the communications sector.  The cinema is no longer the dominant feature.  RTE recently screened a documentary about the cinema and the influence it had in the past, but that influence has waned enormously.  The Deputy raised a very interesting point about distribution.  My understanding is the executive is looking very closely at furthering its relationship with the distribution companies in order to ensure Irish films receive the projection they deserve.  That issue is very much on the agenda of the Irish Film Board.</p></speech>

In my past life I produced a number of films in which the Irish Film Board invested, lest it comes back to haunt me at a future date.</p><p>  I am aware that Mr. O'Herlihy is chairman designate and, therefore, may not be able to answer some of my questions.  In that context, perhaps we might invite him to address the committee again in a year or so.</p></speech>

One is the continuing tension between developing an Irish film industry and attracting film productions to Ireland.  There may be a conflict between developing a culture of film making and film makers in Ireland and attracting major Hollywood productions to our shores.  I ask Mr. O'Herlihy to outline his thoughts on that aspect.</p><p>  When Mr. O'Herlihy accepted the appointment from the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, an enlightened appointment, was he able to elicit any commitment from him on capital funding in the next few years?  As we know, it is capital rather than current funding that the Irish Film Board requires.  I note that in 2013 the figure is &euro;11.8 million, compared to &euro;13.1 million in 2012.  Given that the budget will be announced earlier this year, in October, and that we know there is a set budget within the Department for three years, has Mr. O'Herlihy been given any indication of what the capital budget for the board might be for 2014?</p><p>  I ask Mr. O'Herlihy for his general view on the commitments made in the recently published report, Creative Capital: Building Ireland's Audiovisual Creative Economy, which referred to a doubling of turnover and creating 5,000 jobs between now and 2016.  These targets are very ambitious, given the current economic climate.  I ask for Mr. O'Herlihy's views on whether they are too optimistic, given the challenging environment to which he has alluded.</p><p>  Again with the caveat of allowing Mr. O'Herlihy to return later in the year-----</p></speech>

Does Mr. O'Herlihy believe these changes will have a negative impact on film making in Ireland?</p></speech>

The position in Ireland is that we have improved the position on tax in the sense that qualifying Irish expenditure has increased from 28% to 32%, while the cost to the Government has been reduced, which is a positive step.  However, there is no doubt that we face enormous competition from Northern Ireland and Britain because of the benefits to be gained there.  To achieve the level of growth in Ireland that is being discussed, there must be a very strong selling of Ireland, in terms of creativity, the strength of our personnel, the attractiveness of locations here and so forth.  That will be of major importance for the board, me as chairman, the chief executive and his team.  There is no doubt, however, that it will not be easy.  </p><p>  To be honest, I have forgotten the other questions posed by the Senator.</p> <p>I have no idea about the capital funding; I have not a clue, because I have not discussed that with the chief executive or the Minister.  The first board meeting, if I am appointed, will take place on Thursday and I have no doubt it will exercise the board members greatly.</p><p> We must bear in mind that I do not pretend to be a film maker, even though I have a background to some extent in the sector.  I understand the environment.</p></speech>

I tried to find out exactly what the score was because I have never been an expert in any of those areas, but I survived.  My job will be to put myself into the shoes of the audience as much as possible, to determine the taxpayer is getting value for money, which is critical in my opinion, and to ensure the remit of the Irish Film Board is followed through.</p><p>  If we look at the appointments that have been made by the Minister, there is a terrific range of expertise on the board.  This board has the capacity to be very strong because it encompasses production, education and acting, all skills that are fundamental to the development of the industry.  I look forward to working with the other board members immensely, and with the very experienced executive staff, because we have big problems and these are the sort of people who are able to solve them.</p></speech>

More importantly, I asked myself if I have the expertise to chair meetings that will deliver on the vision of a board like this.  The board is hugely important, not just in developing jobs but in promoting Ireland.  One in five people who come to Ireland come because of the images they see on the silver screen.  Apart from the cost of the board, this is an immensely important aspect of the job.  I thought about that and wondered if I was good enough to do this.  I also asked if I had the time to do it.  I came to the conclusion that this is a particularly interesting project and that I should give it a lash, in the immortal traditions of poor old Mick Doyle.</p></speech>

There will be a relationship with the Minister as well.  That is where topics like capital funding arise.  The idea we could double numbers in full-time employment in the sector from 5,000 to 10,000 over such a short period of time sounds slightly fanciful.  Some of this, however, would be about commitment on areas such as section 481 relief and real money.  There are tangible benefits to this if 20% of visitors come as a result of films they see.  That means a much greater return than simple box office numbers.  Will there be a focus on the capital investment?  That would be critical in the delivery of such numbers.</p><p>  Has Mr. O'Herlihy identified anything that is not in the Creative Capital report that should be in it or does he have any doubts about elements of it?  Would that question perhaps be better answered in a few months?</p></speech>

From the word go, I will be looking at what exactly must be delivered in the short term.  In talking to the chief executive, and responding to the Creative Capital report, the figure for 100% growth from 5,000 to 10,000 jobs is not apparently unreasonable.  The question is whether it can be done within five years.  It might take a year or two longer but the feeling is that it can be done.  It means certain things must be put in place.  There must be coordination between the universities and institutes of learning and a member of the IADT sits on the board, which is hugely important for the development of the industry.  There are many things that must happen to achieve that but there is no reason to think they will not happen.</p><p>  As far as the capital budget is concerned, we must look at the facts.  The capital budget has fallen over the years and I suspect in the current climate there is no question of it increasing.  I do not know that; the Minister is better placed to answer that than I am.</p></speech>

He is eminently qualified for the role and I wish him every success.  Like Senator Mac Conghail, I am declaring my interest in that I am a director of a film company.  I am not entirely sure and cannot recall the level of funding we might have received in the past from the IFB but that is probably because the amount was so small.</p><p>  Following on from Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's remarks, there is a vital film sector in the regions, it is not exclusive to Dublin, Cork and Galway, as I can verify.  The organisation I am involved with managed to access very important PEACE funding to do North-South projects with marginalised young people.  Every summer an assumption is made by parents that young people want to get involved in sports camps but that is not everyone's cup of tea.  We organise projects like "So You Wanna Make a Movie?", where we extend the film production experience to people who would not ordinarily do that, giving them access to that sort of opportunity.  Having engaged young people at that level, some of them have gone on to work in the industry, which is a credit to that approach.</p><p>  We have a burgeoning film industry at present, much of the credit for which must go to President Higgins and the measures he introduced in the 1990s.  The industry, however, is notoriously difficult to get a foothold in for a variety of reasons.  If we are to continue to succeed on the international scene and to build the indigenous film industry Senator Mac Conghail referred to, we must prioritise young people coming through the industry, whether they be on the creative or technical sides.  Has Mr. O'Herlihy had any chance to consider how the Irish Film Board might go about that critical aspect of the business over the next few years, where it encourages and retains young talent, ensuring we have an indigenous industry for young people coming through the system?</p> <p>What is of major importance on the agenda of the Irish Film Board is training.  Training people so that they develop through the industry.  There is a much greater requirement to develop the educational resources for career building and the realities of working in that marketplace.  I cannot give members the complete answer to the question, for obvious reasons, because I do not really know.  I know that training, education and the creation of a viable industry base in the coming years is a priority for the film board executive.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that he is eminently qualified and a willing partner in furthering the film sector.</p><p>  Has he set specific targets in conjunction with the chief executive and the board of the Irish Film Board against which his success might be measured in the future?  Has he envisaged a process to bring the work of the Irish Film Board to the regions?  The local authorities have sought to instigate such an industry in the regions and County Offaly is a case a point.  The members of the local authorities and to a greater extent the young population could benefit from such a roadshow as this would encourage creativity in our young people and prepare them for openings that might emerge in the sector in the future.  Those in the film sector can be more than successful and a great benefit can accrue to the State by virtue of those who come here.  Visitor numbers can always grow and expand.  The regions are the gems of the country and I hope that Mr. O'Herlihy can lead a campaign to expose them so that we will all benefit.</p></speech>

I have not met the board as such yet, but I know some of the members individually.  My intention is that the board, as a group, would define our objectives for the coming year and be measured against those objectives.</p><p>  I think the Deputy's suggestion of bringing the Irish Film Board to the country is a terrific idea but it might not necessarily be practical from the point of view of the board, but certainly not from the point of view of the executive.  One must bear in mind there is a major workload involved for a small number of people on the executive.  Even in my marginal involvement so far, it is very obvious to me that they have a huge workload and the international and national travel is significant.  The executive is imaginative and I will discuss this suggestion with the chief executive and if it is practical, I am sure it will be done.</p></speech>

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Professor McHale to make his statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013042300003#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today.  This statement provides some introductory reactions to the report of the four Presidents of the EU and also the European Commission's blueprint report.  These documents set out an ambitious, staged project for the development of economic and monetary union, EMU.  The vision is a combination of strengthened disciplines to limit adverse spillovers between member states and improved supports to improve stability and enhance convergence.  The Commission's blueprint is the more ambitious document, with a greater focus on necessary crisis resolution tools.  While the documents are very welcome contributions given the magnitude of the growth and employment challenges, there is a concern that they, and especially the four Presidents' report, focus too much on disciplines relative to supports and too much on supply to the neglect of demand.</p><p>  On fiscal integration, significant steps have already been taken to improve structures for fiscal discipline with the six pack, fiscal compact and, most recently, the two pack.  With Ireland's debt projected to peak this year at an unsafe 123% of gross domestic product, GDP, we have no choice but to reduce our deficit and debt.  The new disciplines reinforce and make more credible a direction in which we have no choice but to go.  However, the crisis has revealed the fragility of a country's debt sustainability and associated access to borrowing within the monetary union even at lower debt levels.  The new crisis resolution tools, notably the European financial stability facility, EFSF, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and the European Central Bank, ECB's, outright monetary transactions, OMT, programme, have been significant steps forward.  These steps have been hesitant, with the early proposals for the design of the ESM undermined by threats of a low trigger for private debt restructuring and official creditor seniority.  While the announcement of OMT has had a significant impact on bond yields, the adequacy of the design has yet to be tested.</p><p>  The proposals for a central fiscal capacity and associated stabilisation fund offer the potential for improved shock absorption capacity, especially if the fund has a capacity to borrow.  These proposals are envisioned as a longer-term reform and not as part of the policy arsenal to resolve the current crisis.  However, more and faster action may be needed.  While it is understandable that there is resistance to a risk sharing debt redemption fund, DRF, and eurobills that were included in the Commission's proposals but not in the four Presidents' report, the revealed fragility of creditworthiness within the monetary union suggests the need for bolder action to prevent self-fulfilling runs on sovereign debt in vulnerable countries.</p><p>  With regard to banking integration, the crisis revealed deep flaws in national level regulation and supervision of banks and also the potential for vicious feedback loops between banks and sovereigns where banks remain a national responsibility.  The plan for a staged process to a European banking union is thus a welcome development.  The envisioned end point is a US style, least-cost bank resolution process, with clear priority for loss absorption running in the order of equity to junior bonds, to senior bonds and finally to uninsured deposits.  The recent Cyprus experience shows that elements of this model can be brought in on an accelerated basis.  The envisioned system would be backed up by a European resolution fund, funded by risk based levies on banks, a capacity to borrow, possibly from the ESM, and <i>ex post</i> risk-based levies to repay such borrowings.  Deposit insurance would remain a national responsibility, although the design of national systems would be harmonised.</p><p>  This system offers an improved end point in terms of minimising moral hazard and sovereign risks.  However, with parts of the European banking system still under significant capital and funding stress, care must be taken in the phasing in of the new system so as not to impair further credit availability in the heavily bank-reliant euro area economy.  While strengthening the claims of insured depositors, least-cost resolution will make other creditors more wary of providing funding to banks and more prone to flee at early signs of trouble.  The tougher resolution framework will need to be complemented by a stronger focus on ensuring banks are adequately capitalised, backed up by rigorous stress tests and ESM involvement in ensuring adequate capital levels where necessary.</p><p>  On economic integration, in its response to weak growth and high unemployment, the plan envisions efforts to further the development of the Single Market and structural reforms to improve supply-side performance.  There are plans for greater co-ordination of structural reforms where the policy changes have potential spillover effects on other members. One promising element is the convergence and competitiveness instrument,<i></i>CCI, whereby member states enter into contractual arrangements for well-defined structural reforms in return for financial support.  Sometimes it appears that European policymakers see the solution to Europe's weak growth as being only on the supply side.  While well-designed structural reforms can bring significant benefits, the process can be difficult and slow, with the impact effects sometimes being negative.  In the case of labour market reforms, a recent review by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, of its policy advice in this area noted: &quot;An important branch of research has focused on the cross-country evidence regarding the effects of specific labor market institutions on the unemployment rate. .. This research has reached two broad conclusions: The devil is in the details (and the details are hard to capture in the rough measures of institutions used in regressions); and the combination of institutions matters very much.&quot;</p><p>  With the ECB's single mandate for price stability and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, focused on national level policies, tools are lacking for aggregate demand management in the euro area as a whole, even if the flexibility present in the SGP is sometimes under-appreciated.  The co-ordination potential of the European Semester process could be better used to ensure an appropriate aggregate stance of euro area fiscal policy.  This should be focused in particular on stronger countries that retain the so-called fiscal space for more stimulative policies.  Given the depth and nature of the recession, Europe may be poorly served by what at times appears as a single minded supply side focus.  In sum, the proposals in the reports set out an ambitious and necessary agenda for the effective functioning of EMU.  Care must be taken, however, that understandable concerns about moral hazard and structural impediments to growth do not overwhelm the emerging design.</p></speech>

In my opening remarks, I will make some brief comments about recent developments in economic governance in the EU and about some of the proposals for the future of economic and monetary union set out in the so-called four Presidents' report and in the Commission's communication on the issue published late last year.  In addition, I will talk about the implications for Ireland of these developments and proposals.  I will also mention some proposals for fiscal and monetary policy actions at the European level that could boost employment and growth.</p><p>  It is well known that the original Stability and Growth Pact failed to prevent a major ongoing crisis in the euro area.  The SGP rules were disregarded by larger member states, and in any event they wrongly focused almost exclusively on budgetary issues while ignoring excessive private capital flows which were the root cause of the crisis.  European leaders have responded to past failures with a new regime of obligations and surveillance.  This regime is built on a dizzying number of new rules and regulations.  We now have six packs and two packs, economic partnership programmes and post-programme surveillance programmes, European Semesters, macroeconomic imbalance procedures and macroeconomic scoreboards.  Highly intrusive oversight of draft national budgets in the euro area by the European Commission will be in place by the end of the year.  Where is all this enhanced oversight leading us?</p><p>  This new regime, in and of itself, will not make for a better functioning monetary union.</p> <p>We will benefit, however, from these recent developments if they pave the way for genuine fiscal union in Europe or, as the four presidents' report put it, "a fiscal capacity for the EMU".  This capacity should include risk sharing, such as an insurance type scheme between member states, and should ultimately lead to some form of eurobonds or euro indemption fund.</p><p> As an aside, I hear a lot of discussion about Ireland regaining its economic sovereignty.  The phrase is used a lot in the political system and in commentary.  It is usually associated with Ireland being able to borrow again from financial markets.  Anybody who thinks that when Ireland can borrow again from financial markets it will mean we have regained full economic independence, should have another look at the treaty and the six pack.  They should look at the two pack also.  </p><p> A more urgent priority is the establishment of a banking union in Europe.  A speedy resolution of problems in the banking sector is a precondition for growth.  The single supervisory mechanism constitutes a first step and its establishment may help to speed up the restoration of a properly functioning banking system in Europe.  However, it is the single resolution mechanism that will potentially yield greater benefits.  In that context, Ireland must ensure that European leaders deliver on their 29 June commitment to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  </p><p> In addition, although in principle the so-called bailing in of uninsured creditors and failed banks - which will likely be part of the final bank resolution and recovery directive - has much to recommend it, in practice it is not clear that policy makers will choose such actions in the absence of a genuine lender of last resort in the banking system.  The experience of Cyprus is informative in that regard.</p><p> As I have said at this committee previously, bolder monetary and fiscal policy actions are needed at European level to end the economic crisis.  The ECB could cut interest rates further and expand its credit programmes to support lending to SMEs.  A European-wide programme of investment in green-tech infrastructure, for example, could boost aggregate demand and employment.</p><p> The pace of fiscal consolidation in some EU countries needs to be readjusted to support economic recovery.  This is especially true of Germany. </p></speech>

There is so much information to digest that it is nice to be able to examine it beforehand and then structure questions accordingly.  Given their expertise, I have a few questions to ask both witnesses.  Knowing the Irish domestic and political terrain as well as both witnesses do, do they think the levels of economic, fiscal and monetary integration proposed by the Commission are likely to secure political support?</p><p>  The President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, has said that for a policy to be successful, it not only has to be properly designed but it also has to have a minimum of political and social support.  How do the witnesses think that smaller member states, such as ourselves, will fare in this genuine Union?</p><p>  In the years leading up to the creation of the single currency, many economists warned that political compromises at the heart of the euro were going to create real economic problems further down the road.  Do either of the witnesses see any potential economic problems that may arise from the political compromises that will inevitably emerge as the Commission's proposals make their way through the European Council?  </p><p>  Given the witnesses' expertise, it would be remiss of me not to mention the topic of austerity.  There have been a number of recent interventions from Ashoka Mody, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton and, indeed, President Barroso yesterday.  In his commentary, Professor McHale said that the new disciplines reinforce and make more credible a direction that we have no choice but to go in, in any case.  Yesterday, President Barroso said that while he thought the austerity policy was fundamentally right, it has reached its limits.  I would like to get the witnesses' comments on that.</p><p>  In advance of the budget, do both witnesses think it would be in the public interest to shift the policy away from such austerity?  Do they think that policy has reached its limits and that we now need to begin making greater investment?  </p><p>  In his comments, Dr. Ahearne said that Ireland must ensure that European leaders deliver on their 29 June commitment to break the toxic link between banks and the sovereign.  Does he think that they can actually do this and, if so, under what conditions will we see this happening?  It has been under consideration for nearly a year, so under what conditions does he think we will finally see the breaking of that link?</p></speech>

First, as ordinary citizens of the EU, we can now see the degree to which the EU was unprepared for the crisis that emerged.  This was referred to earlier by Professor McHale.  Second, a number of remedies proposed to address the emerging issues did not work, or if they did work, they had the opposite effect.</p><p>  I have a question concerning the ongoing discussion on austerity versus economic growth.  What is the best way forward for our economy and, similarly, for all European economies in the current European context?  Given the degree of debt already accumulated in a number of eurozone countries and a number outside the eurozone, what is the best way forward?  The so-called policy of austerity is of course a necessity, not a policy.  It is a question of using resources that are available, or not available as the case may be, so where do we go from here?</p></speech>

A lot of action has taken place since then but information currently being fed into the public arena can have a destabilising effect on European countries across the entire eurozone and beyond it.  That issue must be dealt with sooner rather than later.  From my experience as a public representative, I see signs that are not helpful at present.  There are distinct signs of unrest across Europe.</p><p>  To what extent have European institutions - and national institutions both within and outside the eurozone - addressed the issue of portraying to their respective communities the extent to which resources are available to deal with the situation presenting itself?  In other words, is it feasible to say to the public at large that there is no alternative?  Or is there an alternative?  If there is such an alternative through the hard times we see emerging at present, how do we go about pursuing it?</p><p>  A multiplicity of currencies within the EU will never work.  As long at that remains there will always be scope for predatory activity in the financial markets, thus enabling people to make a lot of money rapidly with consequences ultimately for the economies concerned.  I have held that view for a long time, although not everybody agrees with me.  They may disagree but I still strongly hold that view.  I believe that it will not work without a single currency that has the full support of all EU member states, including those who aspire to accession.</p></speech>

Dr. Ahearne mentioned highly intrusive oversight of draft national budgets.  Considering all that has happened in the EU and within our system, do both witnesses think this is necessary?  Dr. Ahearne also referred to eurobonds.  Given the German concerns regarding this, how realistic is the notion of eurobonds?  Perhaps both witnesses could answer that question.</p><p>  As regards the four presidents' report, there is a discussion on the European deposit insurance scheme, which it says would strengthen the credibility of existing arrangements and serve as an important assurance that eligible deposits of all credit institutions are sufficiently insured.  I would like to hear the witnesses comment on that point and how important something like that would be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013042300005#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and all members for the really excellent questions.  There is quite a lot here.  One theme that came up in a number of members' questions related to the intrusive level of disciplines that have been put in place under the six-pack, the two-pack and so on.  One concern I share with Dr. Ahearne relates to the sheer complexity of the rules that are being put in place.  Even for supposed experts in this area, going through the rules for the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is quite a mindnumbing exercise and, sometimes, trying to figure out how the rules combine together can be extremely difficult.  This goes to the point made by Senator Reilly in terms of political support.</p><p>  Thus far, the process of putting in place these various rules has gone reasonably smoothly, including the success of the fiscal treaty in the referendum.  However, many people are simply switched off and have come to the conclusion they cannot really understand the workings of many of these rules.  This creates a lot of risk in respect of the legitimacy of the process.  One issue with which members probably are very concerned is that of democratic accountability, but legitimacy very much depends on public understanding of what is happening and there has been too much unnecessary complexity built in.  A lot more could be done and while I acknowledge this joint committee plays an important role in this process, at European level a great deal more also could be done to explain to people the workings of these various rules and the reason they are so necessary.</p><p>  Another theme running through the questions related to political compromises and this goes back to a theme in my statement about this balance between these disciplines, which are necessary, and supports.  In some senses, one could think of supports as being the <i>quid pro quo</i> for the disciplines.  This was clearly visible in the context of the fiscal treaty debate, where it was made explicit that access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, depended on having this fiscal compact.  However, I worry that we will get the disciplines, which in many ways are necessary, but that in the process of political compromise, we may not get the supports which really are required for the successful functioning of economic and monetary union, EMU.  I also noted this in my statement but this is evident in respect of the things that fell out on the way from the Commission's blueprint to the four presidents' report.  There is no mention that I can recall in the aforementioned report of the debt redemption fund or the eurobills, for instance.</p><p>  Another theme in the questions pertained to the need for austerity.  What we have seen in this crisis is that in the case of a country within the monetary union with a high level of debt, which in particular is heavily dependent on foreign funding of that debt or on foreign investors to invest in that debt, access to borrowing and basic creditworthiness is incredibly fragile.  This is the reason I stated we really have no choice but to get down to safer levels of debt and deficits.  However, the crisis has shown that we also need effective lenders of last resort within the eurozone or these crises will recur.  This is where the elements that already have been put in place, such as the ESM and the ECB's outright monetary transactions, OMTs, are so important but we must go further.  First, the OMTs must really be shown to be effective and to be really accessible to countries and this is yet to be proven.  However, in the longer term, we probably need to take bolder steps towards moving to something like a debt redemption fund or more in the short term to the eurobill proposals.  This is supposed to be the return for the disciplines and, consequently, we must keep our eye on the process in order that we do not just get the disciplines, and the supports get lost along the way.</p><p>  I will close by responding to another theme in the questions which related to the debate on austerity.  It certainly has exploded in the last while as a result of the comments of Professor Mody, the debate about the Reinhart and Rogoff empirical findings, the comments of President Barroso, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, as well as those of President Higgins and so on.  There has been much discussion and it certainly appears as though austerity is being questioned in this trade-off Deputy Durkan mentioned between austerity and economic growth.  However, it is very important to distinguish between two things from the point of view of what it is that we are criticising.  I refer to a national, domestic view in which we must decide what to do in the context of the arrangements that exist, that is, in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact as it is designed, the context of the supports that are there and the conditionality that exists within the programme Ireland is in.  The judgment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been that because of the vulnerability of our access to borrowing, it is very important that we meet the conditions of the programme.  In a highly uncertain environment, it is important we recognise that because of uncertainties in respect of growth, we may need to have a little bit of a buffer or a margin of safety to ensure we can meet these key targets.  If we hit these targets, we then will be in good standing with official funders and even were we to need another programme, the likelihood is that we would be able to get access to a programme without a restructuring being imposed on Irish debt.  Effectively, the latter would be a default, which I believe would be highly disruptive.</p><p>  The fear of such a default could make the whole thing self-fulfilling, because this is what private investors are looking at most.  They are asking whether, if this country needs another programme, it will be forced to default and to the extent we remain in good standing with official funders, it becomes much less likely that such restructuring would be imposed and our chances of getting back into the markets are significantly greater.  Moreover, as the threat of default recedes, it helps confidence to return and interest rates tend to fall right across the economy, including in the banking system, and that supports this process of a restoration of growth.  Consequently, from a national perspective, it is highly important that we stick with the plan to get the deficit down, to meet the targets and to remain in good standing with official funders.  The process we now are seeing unfold with dramatic falls in interest rates is likely to continue and we have a very good chance of being able to return to market funding.</p><p>  While this pertains to the domestic side, we can distinguish it from what is happening at the European level and I now am talking about the design of the system itself.  One point I made in the statement, which I believe Dr. Ahearne also underlined, is there is a contractionary bias in European policy.</p> <p>I did not talk about it at the monetary policy level but Dr. Ahearne did and one can certainly see it with the single price stability mandate of the ECB.  One also sees it in fiscal policy which is a very national focus on each country reaching its targets under various excessive deficit procedures.  I do not think there is enough attention to the overall aggregate stance of a European fiscal policy, to extend to it what President Barroso was getting at in terms of the overall fiscal policy that gets produced by the process for Europe as a whole.  We must pay more attention to that aggregate fiscal stance, to demand in the European economy in general, and more attention to developing lender-of-last-resort supports to reduce the fragility of individual countries.  They are all reforms that need to take place.  I do not believe it is inconsistent to believe that there is too much of a focus on austerity in the overall design of economic and monetary union while recognising that given the system as it exists, the right course is to continue with the fiscal adjustment policies that are currently being pursued.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Ahearne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013042300006#E00200"><p>One of the main purposes of banking union is to break the link between banks and the sovereign.  The question asked was how that would happen in practice.  That is where the single resolution mechanism comes into play.  It works in two different ways.  One could ask where the money would come from if the Irish banks required more capital.  I do not know whether they will require more capital.  There is supposed to be a stress test done on the banks.  It would be better for the stress test to happen sooner rather than later.  It seems to have been put off more than once.  If the banks are under-capitalised, we need to know about that.  That is true right across Europe.  It is politically convenient to put off the stress tests because politicians do not like putting money into banks but if the banks are under-capitalised, that will weigh on the amount of credit they give out which will affect economic performance.  The sooner we find out the true state of the European banking system, the better.</p><p>  That is one advantage of the single supervisory mechanism.  The European Central Bank has taken over the job and before it begins to supervise banks across Europe, I presume it will do the mother of all stress tests.  At least if I was working for the European Central Bank I would not want to have a situation where in three years time one or more banks fail and then I realise they have failed because of problems that existed before I took on the responsibility.  Let us get it all nice and clean from day one and therefore carry out a very tough stress test.  The European Central Bank will probably carry out a very tough stress test.  Some people fear that but I believe it is positive.  One has to find out the extent of the problem and fix it.</p><p>  Having done that, if more capital is needed in Irish banks, the issue is who puts it in.  The place it should come from is a European fund.  We are not talking about failed banks; we are talking about banks that have a future.  We are not talking about plugging massive holes in the balance sheet.  We are talking about giving them enough capital so that they can function as proper banks.  The State has done more than enough recapitalisation of banks and the money should rightly come from Europe, for example, the single resolution mechanism or perhaps some fund linked to it.</p><p>  That would be very helpful in breaking the link because when one talks to people involved who hope to lend to this country at low interest rates and to buy Irish bonds, they are not worried about the fiscal situation.  The Government has huge credibility in terms of reducing the fiscal deficit.  The State has it because it has been earned since 2008.  Neither the previous Government nor this one have blinked in terms of doing fiscal consolidation.  They have rightly got on and done the job.  The people who buy Irish bonds do not worry about that.  What they worry about is whether more money is needed for the Irish banks and whether that will add to the country&rsquo;s debt levels.  By and large the people who buy Irish bonds understand fiscal and economic issues inside out but they are less comfortable with the banking stuff.  They are worried that there is a further black hole.  The way to resolve the issue is to say that if more capital is needed, it will not come from the State as that breaks the link.  That is very important.  The big risk in terms of this country going back to the market and staying in it is coming from the banking sector.  That was also true in late 2010.  It was not so much the fiscal issue, it was what the recapitalisation and rescue of the banks would ultimately cost.  The people who buy bonds and lend to the Government could not really get a handle on that.</p><p>  A second issue, which is as important, is the legacy issue, that is, getting some fund in Europe to buy shares in the Irish banks and paying a good rate for that, which would allow the State to reduce its debt.  That is also extremely important.  Both of those factors are very important for the economy and the Government should push hard on them.  It is well known that the previous Government did try to have burden sharing with senior bank bondholders in late 2010 and Europe stopped that, and so the State is owed something significant from Europe.  The sort of banking union that is being put in place should have been put in place as the single currency was created.  The Irish can justifiably ask for recapitalisation to be done retrospectively.  That would be an important part in breaking the link. The other point is that at the moment a deposit guarantee system is done nationally and that then links the sovereign to the banks.  If that was done at a European-wide level, again, one would help to break the link.  That is the second component.</p><p>  The question was raised about rules, where they are all leading and if they are all necessary.  In part, the fact that there are so many fiscal rules is based on a misunderstanding of what caused the crisis.  If one goes back two years, certainly in Germany and some other countries in Europe, the argument was that the reason we have this euro crisis is because governments were spending too much, that it was a fiscal policy problem.  It has been shown clearly that it was not the problem.  A hangover of that is the huge amount of rules we now have.  It is also partly a German approach.  When I talk to German economists, there seems to be a belief that there is no problem that cannot be solved by more rules.  If rules do not work, they say that one should make them tighter and have more of them.</p><p>  On whether the rules are useful, they are in the sense that one could not possibly have a fiscal union or eurobonds, which would be a good idea, without such fiscal rules.  One could not possibly have a case where Italy, for example, could issue eurobonds that would be backed by the German Government but yet it could do whatever it wanted on the fiscal policy side.  Germany is not going to tolerate that nor should it or any other country.  If one is going to have guarantees from all the states, which is what would be entailed with eurobonds, from countries borrowing, then one would have to have very tight rules.  They are not a means in themselves but they are a stepping stone to something else that would be valuable.  What would be valuable in terms of making monetary union work is much closer fiscal integration in terms of eurobonds and shared risk.</p><p>  Professor McHale mentioned the United States as a functioning country with monetary union.  If one has a bad shock in the state of Pennsylvania all the unemployment and social welfare benefit is paid by the federal government, so it is a real shock absorber for Pennsylvania that the money is not coming out of the local state finances.  That is the type of shock absorber one needs at European level for the currency to function properly.</p><p>  A number of questions were asked about austerity.  The stance at European level is wrong in the sense that the recession is going on for so long and the numbers coming out, in particular from southern Europe, are so bleak in terms of unemployment and growth.</p> <p>If we think about support for closer integration, that support will only be there if the social fabric can hold together.  I do not think we can have another few years of recession in the EU area without the social fabric breaking apart.  Typically a recession lasts just a few quarters but this one has been going on for years.  There is too much social stress so there needs to be a policy change at the European level and, as I mentioned, both monetary and fiscal stimulus.  The ECB can do more - it can cut interest rates.  It can come from 75 basic points all the way down to zero as has been done in the United States, which would help a bit.  It would be particularly positive if those lower interest rates can be made to feed through to where they are needed, namely, in southern Europe.  That would also be helpful in Ireland.  It costs firms in Spain and Italy a lot of money to borrow.  The ECB interest rates are very low but they are not the transition channel that goes from the ECB to the firms and households that borrow.  That has broken down.  Banking union is in itself a way of fixing that transmission mechanism.  </p><p> There is another thing the ECB can do.  I used to work for a think tank in Brussels called Bruegel and some of my colleagues there recommended that the ECB buy more SME-type loans from banks and not discount them in terms of collateral.  That would help and would make lending by banks to SMEs more attractive.  It is a good suggestion.</p><p> On the fiscal side I mentioned Germany.  I do not think it is appropriate that Germany is being fiscally so tight.  I have spoken to many German economists and policy makers and they will mention two things.  They say we are competing against China and must therefore be very competitive and that is why they are not willing to spend so much or give big pay increases.  They also talk about demographics, saying we have an ageing population and must save for our old age.  From their narrow perspective there may be something to that but the fact that the Germans are being fiscally very conservative when they do not need to be is very negative for the rest of the EU area.</p><p> We can look at the recent numbers and the terms of the next two budgets where a &euro;3 billion adjustment is planned for next June, with a &euro;2 billion adjustment to follow, or &euro;5 billion in total.  These were written down in order to get the budget deficit below 3% before 2015.  For a couple of reasons, two in the main, it now looks as if the Government could hit that 3% target with less than &euro;5 billion in the coming two years.  We will know more in the coming two weeks when the Department of Finance produces its projections for growth.  It might well be that the Government could do &euro;4 billion or &euro;3.5 billion, let us say, over the next two years and still hit that 3% target.  One could argue that the Government should stick to the &euro;5 billion of adjustment, starting with the &euro;3 billion in the next budget and the deficit will then come down to 2% of GDP by 2015, or one could say we can still hit our 3% target without having to do quite as much.  There are arguments for and against on both sides and economists will argue about it.</p><p> For two main reasons I can see things are working out a bit better.  One is the promissory note restructuring, which helped.  The other is that when the programme was initially designed it was quite conservative - it built in a bit of leeway.  It is hard to work out exactly how much tax revenue there will be from growth.  There is no scientific formula so one makes an estimate.  It turns out that quite a bit of leeway was built in because the makers were quite conservative.  What has happened is that while growth has underperformed tax revenues have not - because of that built-in leeway.  All that has helped.  For my part, I believe there is certainly a case for sticking with the 3%, or its like, and doing somewhat less over the next two years in terms of budgetary adjustment.  I would not have said that a few years ago when interest rates were high and there was still a lot of work to be done but interest rates have come right down and a lot of the restructuring and broadening of the tax system has already been done, which opens up some leeway.</p><p> One question might be what would the money be used for if the Government did &euro;1 billion less fiscal adjustment over the next two years.  Who will benefit from that &euro;1 billion - would it be high-paid public sector workers?  What could it be usefully used to do?  </p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to given they are both from NUIG.  It is great to have both of them at the committee.</p><p>  I have a number of questions for both guests.  Dr. Ahearne has described the "dizzy" number of schemes we have which is what many people feel about the language used about Europe and how we interact with it.  They believe that interface is dizzy and that its rules and schemes are changing.  One thing is invented and does not work and then something else comes along.  This may be an over-simplistic question.  If we did not have the euro would we have the problems we now have, and at such a scale?  That question is for Dr. Ahearne.  This time last year when we were looking at the fiscal compact treaty he spoke in advance of others about the need for a banking union.  How close does he believe we are to that?  </p><p>  There is much talk about our having reached the limits of austerity.  The feedback I get from constituents would certainly be that we have.  Do the delegates believe that to be the case?  Dr. Ahearne mentioned that we might not need as big a budgetary adjustment but I wonder how we can even push for the adjustment we still must make.  Is there a case for renegotiation with the troika?  When the troika gives money it comes with so many conditions, oversight and intrusion.  Some of these conditions are very good in terms of structural reforms given that certain matters had gone completely out of kilter.  However, some of it is not so good.  We see Mr. Ashoka, one of the architects of the entire plan, saying that perhaps they got it wrong.  Why did we not impose similar conditions on our banks when we gave them money?  Have we been too lax with our banks?  How have other countries done this?  We have given money to banks for recapitalisation, mortgage debt, etc. but we are not sure if the money went where it was meant to go.  For example, we know some of it was spent on very large pension payouts to failed bankers.  Those questions are for Dr. Ahearne.</p><p>  In his paper Professor McHale stated the problem is not only on the supply side.  Perhaps he would explain exactly what he means in that regard.  Why is the European area not growing at present?  We have some growth in this country but it seems to be negligible because the euro area is not growing.  How would a debt redemption fund work and what would be its benefits to Ireland?</p></speech>

I do not know whether, being a politician, I see the world through a politician's eyes while they, being economists, see it through the eyes of an economist.  I presume we are mutually dependent, one on the other.</p> <p>If I am correctly interpreting what has happened yesterday and today with regard to the President, Michael D. Higgins, the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, President Hollande of France was elected because of the recognition that austerity on its own cannot turn around the community.  We recognise Europe has an important role to play in assisting countries such as Ireland to overcome the austerity trap into which we were locked after the previous Government did its deal with the troika.  I reinforce what Dr. Ahearne stated on the importance for Ireland of holding the European leaders to the commitment they gave us on 29 June to break the link between sovereign debt and banking debt.  The problem is the previous Government locked us into the circumstances in which we find ourselves today.</p><p> I agree absolutely with Dr. Ahearne that it is frightening to consider the possibility of social alienation in Europe.  We see the huge numbers of youth unemployment in Spain.  It is incredible the Italians seem to think comedians are better in parliament than real politicians.  As an Irish citizen I am concerned about growing anti-European feeling.  It is interpreted in various countries in various ways, with some going ultra-right and others going ultra-left.  We have a substantial ultra-leftist simplistic political band of politicians here.  Perhaps the witnesses can explain in further detail European dependence on the German economy and German politicians doing the right thing.  Is this something they also feel or am I paranoid that we are so dependent on the decision-making process in Germany that it can make or break the Union?</p><p> Will Dr. Ahearne explore in greater detail his warning note on whether the Government really believes its suggestion that we could be out of the programme by the end of this year and whether it is conscious of its ramifications?  What are his thoughts on this issue?  As he quite rightly stated, a fundamental tenet of the Government is that we want to break out and regain our economic independence, hence the desire to leave the programme by the end of this year.</p><p> Both witnesses touched on the Cypriot experience, and I ask them to make general comments on the notion, heretofore unheard of, that savers or small investors would have to pay for governmental or banking indiscipline.  Professor McHale reminds us Ireland has a projected debt of 120% of GDP this year, which is a frightening figure.  In various ways we have touched on the re-negotiation of the promissory note and the &euro;20 billion which could be accessed.  Dr. Ahearne suggests we could dip into this to ease the burden of austerity.  Will both witnesses comment on current thinking on the possible extraction of &euro;1 billion from the &euro;20 billion to ease the budgetary situation?  Union leader Jack O'Connor stated we are at breaking point and there are other ways to balance the books other than taking &euro;300 million more this year from public pay.</p></speech>

To continue the theme regarding the causes and limitations of austerity, if financial markets will not lend to a country, or will only lend at a rate which is too expensive for the country, what are the choices open to it?  We need to distinguish between countries which have access to financial markets and countries which do not.  The policy choices available to both types of country are fundamentally and gigantically different.  In the discussion we have on austerity as a policy choice, will the witnesses comment on the choices open to a country which cannot afford to borrow from the financial markets?</p><p>  To dwell on the Cypriot experience, it appears to indicate a euro in Cyprus is not worth the same as a euro in Ireland, France or other countries because of the various events that have occurred since.  Do the witnesses agree with this assessment?  If so, and they, as I do, believe it is a problem, how do we fix it?</p><p>  What do the witnesses see as being the obstacles to generating the common fiscal space we have discussed?  The big development of recent months has been the extension of the recession to countries which thought they were immune.  There is clearly a need for a demand stimulus.  To this point some have believed fiscal policy co-ordination must mean austerity for everybody.  What needs to happen to generate the common fiscal capacity mentioned by the witnesses?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013042300008#G00400"><p>Many questions have been asked so I will be selective and answer those focused on me.  Senator Healy Eames asked about the focus on the supply side.  A narrative has developed that Europe's problems are supply-side problems because labour, product and capital markets are not growing quickly enough and require structural reforms, which often mean measures such as reducing employment protection and changing unemployment benefit systems.  Certainly, important reforms need to take place in labour and product markets, including completion of the Single Market.  When one examines the economics it is harder to bring about the structural reforms which lead to better performance in terms of growth and employment than much of the rhetoric seems to suggest.  It takes a long time and often the immediate effects are damaging to growth and employment rather than helpful.  Measures need to be taken, but the existence of a magic recipe to turn around European growth is exaggerated.  Examining the recent history of European growth, one sees a big drop during the crisis, and recovery when countries were generally pursuing more stimulative policies.</p> <p>With the sharp turn to austerity, which was common right across Europe, one sees quite a significant fall off in growth.  This year, within the eurozone, the projection is that the zone will contract by 0.3% of GDP, coming back slowly next year.  It is hard not to believe that there is a significant demand side element to this and that the co-ordinated austerity that is taking place is a significant component of the European growth problem.</p><p> Added to that is the less than helpful stance of the European Central Bank or, more accurately, the stance of the ECB that is not as helpful as it could be.  While the ECB has certainly brought interest rates down to a low level and provided huge support for banking systems, its stance compares less favourably with that of the US Federal Reserve, which has done things like signalling strongly that it will keep interest rates low for a long period of time and clearly focusing on what is happening not just to inflation, but also to employment.  The single mandate of the ECB has led it to pursue a less stimulative monetary policy than would otherwise be the case.</p><p> There is a need to challenge the narrative that Europe's growth problems are all on the supply side.  There is also a need, in this revamp of economic and monetary union, to make sure it is capable of counter-cyclical action so that the focus is not just at a national level.  We must also look at what the sum total of these national policies amount to in terms of the overall fiscal stance of the eurozone, although I certainly do not see enough evidence of that happening at present.  </p><p> Members also asked about the debt redemption fund and there are different proposals being examined in that regard.  One of the core proposals, which is contained in the European Commission's blueprint, envisions debt above 60% of GDP effectively becoming mutualised.  In Ireland's case at the moment, that excess amounts to about 60% of GDP itself because, as Deputy Byrne pointed out, we will be at 123% of GDP this year.  The proposal essentially means that as debt becomes due to be rolled over or used to finance new deficits, we could finance about 63% of GDP in the Irish case, through this fund.  The funds would be raised collectively, with joint and several guarantees.  Effectively this would give us guaranteed access to low-cost funding up to that amount.  This is combined with disciplines that force countries to bring their debt to GDP ratio down over time.  In the original proposal from the German Council of Economic Advisers, the fund was set up so that at the end of the process, countries would have debt to GDP ratios below 60%.  It was a combination of disciplines and supports, essentially giving countries access to low-cost funding and for that reason, I believe it would be a very effective crisis resolution tool.  The concerns that Ireland has about raising funding over the next few years, which are forcing it to pursue very a tough austerity programme in order to regain access to market funding, would be eased by such a fund.</p><p> I wish to return to something Dr. Ahearne said and which was also raised in a number of questions regarding the particular fiscal policy that is being followed.  Dr. Ahearne mentioned that there might be scope to ease the planned fiscal adjustments of &euro;5.1 billion up to 2015.  I will give a brief recap on the Fiscal Advisory Council's thinking on this issue.  First, the original projections to get our deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015 are a central forecast.  We know there is huge uncertainty around growth so, in that context, we looked at past forecast errors and built confidence intervals around those projections.  Even now, with the central forecast dropping to closer to 2% of GDP, there is about a one in three chance, based on historic forecast errors, and even with the assumption that the &euro;5.1 billion of adjustment will actually take place, that the 3% target will still be missed.  There is a one in four chance that our debt to GDP ratio, which is now 123%, will not have stabilised by 2015.  The reason for the margin of safety and for aiming at something below the 3% target is to give some insurance that the actual target will be met, which we believe is critical to ensuring we retain access to borrowing.</p><p> Deputy Donohoe asked why we are engaging in this austerity programme and about the implications of a situation where the financial markets will not lend to us.  The real rationale for doing these very difficult things and engaging in this austerity is to retain access to borrowing.  It is somewhat paradoxical in the sense that we are pursuing this austerity programme because we fear there will be much greater austerity if we lose access to borrowing, given that we still have a very large deficit.  In essence, we are trying to pursue a plan that allows us to phase out that austerity to the maximum extent possible, given the negative effects that those fiscal adjustments have on growth.  We want to be able to retain access to borrowing so that we can maintain the welfare state we value, in terms of social protection, social services and so on.  It comes back to the importance of access to borrowing.  If we lose that access and the financial markets do not lend to us, we would have much more accelerated austerity and would probably be forced to default.  My reading of the evidence leads me to disagree somewhat with Professor Mooney's thesis, which tends to play down the negative effects of defaults on countries.  That is what seemed to lead him to believe in a different strategy, involving more debt restructuring or default and less austerity.  What we see from episodes of default is that although countries can often regain market access surprisingly quickly after defaults, the outward costs, particularly coming through mechanisms of the banking system, but also confidence effects and so on, can be significantly negative.  The likelihood is that the crisis would go into another vicious phase if we ended up in default.</p><p> Therefore, in order to be able to phase out this austerity without a highly disruptive default taking place, we need to be able to borrow.  Of course, we have not been able to borrow from the financial markets until quite recently.  We have, instead, relied on official lenders but, of course, to retain access to official funds, we had to meet the conditions of the loans, which require that we meet the targets.  The most important element for secure future market access is that investors believe we will have access to official funding, should we need it.  The world is an uncertain place and shocks that occur in other countries could spill over to us and uncertainties remain about future growth prospects.  Investors are uncertain what the future will bring.</p> <p>They are considering whether we will be in good standing with official funders and particularly that we would get that funding without them forcing us to restructure our debt as, for instance, occurred in Greece.  If a country's debt is not on a sustainable path, they will not lend to it without a restructuring, which is likely to have quite negative effects on the economy in the short to medium term.  Any programme is likely to have much tougher conditionality as we have seen in Greece if a country is not in good standing because it has not met targets in the past.  This is why the fiscal council has emphasised the importance of meeting those targets in this highly uncertain growth environment just to give some sort of cushion.  We previously thought that cushion would only come by making adjustments of more than &euro;5.1 billion.</p><p> Coming to Deputy Eric Byrne's question, the good news is that because of a number of developments, particularly the promissory note development, we can now have that margin of safety without doing any more than the Government is already planning.  The fiscal council's strategy has remained the same but we can now have that margin of safety without having to impose even more difficult and damaging austerity on the economy.</p></speech>

That is just arithmetic.  The country then has to close its budget deficit instantly because nobody would lend.  In the case of Ireland, with a big budget deficit, it would be simply catastrophic and would mean considerably more austerity.  For that reason it is very important to be able to borrow either from financial markets or from a programme.</p><p>  We probably have some leeway in the budgetary adjustment in coming years if one thinks about access to financial markets.  The Government might confirm it was going to hit its target of 3% of GDP target by 2015 but from that it would back out the adjustments it needs in the next two years.  If that number was four rather than five, then it would do four and thereby reach the target.  How would financial markets respond?  I do not believe they would respond badly.  Provided that the financial markets view the debt as sustainable and would start to reduce, I believe they might well be relaxed.  In order to ensure they feel relaxed about it, we could give them certainty about the next few years.</p><p>  I am somewhat surprised there has not been an update to the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  That plan set out what the Government was going to do and was helpful for financial markets.  It shows not just what the debt will be but also the measures the Government will introduce to achieve that.  If that was updated to go out to 2017 at the same time as announcing that we would stick to the 3% target, I do not believe the markets would react negatively.</p><p>  Professor McHale is right that there are big risks involved in the coming years.  I am not sure those risks would reduce significantly by, for instance, another &euro;1 billion in budgetary adjustments that are not necessary to reach the 3% target.  There are two big risks.  One is from a possible recapitalisation of the banks which would require more money.  That goes back to what we were discussing today, namely, Europe.  If there is, it is not possible to do ever-increasing amounts of fiscal consolidation to put aside yet more money - that money would need to come from Europe.  That is a risk, but one that cannot really be solved through fiscal consolidation here.  The solution to that must come from Europe.</p><p>  It is also true of the other big risk, which is that the euro area will not grow but stay in recession.  That is a big risk for the Irish economy.  I am pretty sure that if the euro area economy was growing robustly now, the Irish economy would be growing robustly.  The euro area staying in recession would be a big problem for the Irish economy and for Ireland's fiscal outturn.  Again, is that something the Irish can do something about?  That seems to be a problem that needs to be solved in Europe through the measures I discussed earlier.  If it is not solved how do we get around that one?  The State now owes more than &euro;40 billion to the EU and presumably there is leeway in terms of concessions.  This is what has been happening.  In recent years interest rates have been reduced and the loans have been pushed out.  These are official concessions that are helping to keep things sustainable.  If they had stuck to the initial rate and not pushed things out, Irish debt might well have been unsustainable by now.  My guess is that if things do not pick up in Europe, they will just do more of that.</p><p>  Things have turned 180&deg; since the Deauville agreement, which insisted that private sector lenders to an economy should be subordinate to official lenders.  This meant that if something went wrong with an economy, official lenders should get all the money back, but the private sector - people holding the bonds - would get a haircut.  Since then, that has completely flipped and essentially the private sector lenders are senior to official lenders.  If something is going wrong and the economy is not picking up, the EU - the official sector - is giving the concessions, which makes the private sector position better.  If a troubled borrower has two creditors and one creditor is given concessions, that is good for the other creditor.  That is a major part of the reason for our interest rates having come down.  There is more leeway - in theory &euro;42 billion worth of leeway.  If we do not get a recovery and things in Europe remain bad, I would not be surprised to see even more concessions on that.  If it is a problem in the euro area - in Europe - it has to be solved at a European level.</p><p>  There was a question about Cyprus.  The initial plan for Cyprus was very problematic in that it was going to hit depositors with more than &euro;100,000.  The real problem with the second plan is that they have had to put in capital controls.  I mentioned that in my statement.  Two countries have bailed in private creditors in the crisis - Iceland and Cyprus - and in both cases they had to impose capital controls.  That is what it means going into this brave new world with new bank resolution involving bailing in private creditors.  If that is done on a large scale - as may be necessary with some country in the future - it is also necessary to impose capital controls, which are terrible for economic growth.  If banks are recapitalised, the ECB should be willing to lend to them.  It looks like they were not prepared to do that in this case.  Now the lesson seems to be while we will have this resolution involving bailing in, it must be accompanied by capital controls.  In the Irish case the banks' creditors were bailed out, which was very expensive and bad for the sovereign.  In Cyprus they were all bailed in which is also very bad and destructive to the economy.  The lesson from Cyprus is that a country with many bad investments on banks' balance sheets will have a bad outcome.</p><p>  There was a question on the troika programme.  The country has been in a programme since 2008 and will be in a programme for some time.  The programme from 2008 was a programme imposed by Government and funded by markets until 2011.  Then it was a programme funded by the official sector.  The country will probably be able to borrow from markets again but will still be in some sort of programme, by which I mean reducing the budget deficits, and restructuring our tax system and economy.  That is all part of our programme.  The reason for fiscal consolidation is not that there is a troika.  It is because we had a very large budget deficit that has to be reduced.  I believe there will be a programme regardless of what happens.</p><p>  I was asked how close we are to banking union and the answer is not close enough.  I believe it needs to happen much faster.  It is very difficult to see how the euro area economy will grow unless credit is flowing properly and that will not happen until the banking systems are sorted out at a European level.  The member is absolutely right to point out that the banks have been very slow to deal with the impaired loans.  The Government and the Central Bank have set them targets for the mortgage arrears, which hopefully will force them to up the pace.  They have undoubtedly not acted as fast as they should have to reduce that problem.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Item No.1 on our agenda is the consideration of the Revised Estimates for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform 2013 Vote group.   The D&aacute;il ordered that the following Revised Estimates for the public services be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 11- Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; Vote 13 - Office of Public Works; Vote 14 - State Laboratory; Vote 15 - Secret Service; Vote 16 - Valuation Office; Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service; Vote 18 - Shared Services; and Vote 19, Office of the Ombudsman.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and his officials to today's meeting.

I am opposing any time for the Minister to make an opening statement on the Revised Estimates as presented.  The Government, through the Department of the Taoiseach, informed the Opposition parties last week in the D&aacute;il that the 2013 Revised Estimates for public services largely follows the budget day allocations, with the pay deal recommendations by the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, having been programmed into the Department's Estimates.  It might have escaped the Minister's attention but the pay deal recommended by the LRC has been rejected by two thirds of public sector workers who were asked by the Minister to vote on it.  The pay deal no longer exists and it is an affront to all public servants that the Minister should be in here today while calling for a period of reflection.  He has suggested that we must consider the next step while simultaneously ploughing ahead with these Estimates.</p><p>  I repeat that the memo from the Department of the Taoiseach indicates that the budget day allocation includes the pay deal recommendations by the LRC.  Those recommendations have been programmed into the Department's Estimates.  I am refusing to discuss any Estimates at this point that include the rejected recommendations of the LRC.  I cannot believe that the Minister has gone ahead with the Revised Estimates with the LRC proposals in them.  I could understand the Minister coming forward with an overall global figure of what he would like to achieve.  It is ironic that this is coming from the Minister who threatened public servants during the critical voting period with across the board pay cuts.  Now he is coming here with the LRC recommendations.  Why did he ask people to vote if he intended to come in here today with those recommendations in the Estimates?  It is ironic that he is in here so quickly.</p><p>  I am opposing the timetable proposed for today's meeting.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013042300003#B00100"><p>I also object to the taking of this Estimate.  The Minister was very prominent in the media, proclaiming to the nation that he was about to run out of money at the end of the year.  He has identified a &euro;300 million shortfall in the budget - I know he anticipated that from Croke Park II.  As has been said workers were invited to ballot on that matter and they have decisively rejected those proposals.  I understand the Government is in reflective mode over the next step, but it is a queer kind of reflection when the Minister goes ahead with the very proposals that have been rejected and hard-wires them into the figures.  This is no way to do business.  It is certainly no way to treat people working in the public service.  It is also no way to treat this Oireachtas.  The Minister clearly needs to identify a plan B.  If, as he claims, he needs to find an additional &euro;300 million then he needs to establish from where that will come.  It cannot come from Croke Park II because in accordance with the democratic process undertaken by the workers through the unions, those proposals have been rejected.</p><p>  Therefore, I object to the ordering of speaking time for this debate and also to the taking of this Estimate.</p></speech>

I understand that the figures to come before us represent approximately &euro;300 million in savings baked into them according to the proposed and now defeated Croke Park II proposal.  Clearly that has not been agreed by public sector workers.  I would be willing to discuss Estimates which had them taken out of them and would be very much willing to engage in a discussion with the Minister about where that additional saving could be found.  However, we know that the Estimates to come before the committee, if they have Croke Park II baked into them, are incorrect.  Given that the public sector workers voted against Croke Park II, it would be wrong for us to engage with these numbers, which have the Croke Park II proposal baked into them.  I also suggest that we cease this session and discuss how the committee can do some very important work on the Estimates as we see them for this year and not based on a rejected proposal.</p></speech>

It is not &euro;300 million, obviously.  The pay savings are the apportioned savings we would have expected had the Croke Park II proposals impacted on my Department and the agencies under my purview.  In essence, last week I was faced with a decision on whether I should publish the Estimates on the basis of apportioning, as I thought, in a fair way the &euro;300 million of savings that are implied in the budget arithmetic or not publish the Estimates.  They are everybody's Estimates.  Taking Deputy Fleming's logic, we cannot advance on any Estimate in any Department until we have reached a resolution in regard to the &euro;300 million for this year.</p><p>  That would be well and good if we had no responsibility.  We could approach it as the Republicans did in America and shut down government.  However, agencies need to be funded and, for example, the shared service, PeoplePoint, needs a Vote this week to ensure it can continue to function.  Ultimately every agency of State - all the ones under my purview - over time will need to have a formal Vote in order to continue in existence.  It is extraordinarily reasonable that we would go through the full Estimate of my Department and all the agencies under my remit.  If and when we have alternative proposals on the savings in pay and pensions, we will come back and have those approved separately.  It is not unusual to have that done.</p><p>  I understand that some of the Deputies opposite want to grandstand on the particular issue of the Croke Park II proposal, which is an important issue.  During the negotiation period, the only utterance I heard from Deputy Fleming was that the &euro;300 million was not sufficiently ambitious and that he wanted &euro;350 million taken out of the public pay bill for this year.  I reread his pre-budget submission which detailed how that would be done by the end of March.  If we did not have an agreement by the end of March, he laid out, in fairness, the forced measures in regard to the public service for which he would have legislated, as his party did twice when last in government.</p><p>  I am conscious that we are using up time now.  As we will have a debate in plenary session in the D&aacute;il tonight on all these matters, let us park Croke Park II until that forum.  Let us now do our normal business for all the agencies that depend on us.  We should go through line by line the voted moneys required to fund services within my Department and its associated agencies for this year.  When alternatives are determined - if alternatives are determined - for the &euro;300 million, I will come back to the committee seeking approval for that proportion of it that applies to my Department in a timely fashion, as is normal.</p></speech>

The same will happen at all the other Oireachtas committees dealing with Estimates in coming weeks.  As the Minister has said it would make logical sense to come back with a revision of those figures later.  He wants to pass these with the rejected Croke Park II recommendations in them.  However, they cannot stand up as the final agreement because they have been rejected.  If the Minister believes in democracy, he will accept that and come back with a revision of those figures later.  I am saying he should have brought to the committee today the Estimates not including the Croke Park II proposals.  He should have dealt with the rest of his Estimate which was not contentious and had not been rejected by the public servants and, as he said, come back at a later date to discuss that element of the &euro;300 million that affects his Department, as he seems willing to do.  He should just remove the Croke Park II element from this today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013042300003#B00800"><p>The Minister is being disingenuous when he says we are just dealing with those elements that affect his Department.  Of course we are, but this procedure will be mirrored across all other Oireachtas committees.  The total will amount to &euro;300 million as envisaged under Croke Park II - that is what he has accounted for in this Estimate.  What is the message to public and civil servants, and their unions?  Is this a ruse or is it phase 1 of forcing Croke Park II through even though it has been rejected?  Is this the preamble to unilateral action in respect of legislation?  That is the question that arises.  The Minister sounded the siren bell suggesting that the Government would run out of money and that it had a &euro;300 million gap in its Estimates.  Why would he come before the committee to seek approval for these Estimates, knowing that there are gaps within it?  That does not make any sense.  The politics of this is that the Minister is saying via this committee and other Oireachtas committees to public service workers that they may have rejected the proposal, but the deal - as he calls it - is going ahead anyhow.  That is deplorable and is an abuse of this committee and its elected members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.329" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Steven S. Donnelly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013042300003#B00900"><p>While I understand the Minister's difficult position, it is unreasonable to put it to this committee that the expenditure must be voted on so that services can continue.  We are nearly one third of the way through this year and we are now considering expenditure, almost one third of which has, presumably, been incurred.  While I may be wrong, I believe Ireland is the only country in the OECD that examines and agrees expenditure one third of the way through.  The analysis I have seen suggests we are on our own and in many other countries as in most companies, as I am sure the Minister will appreciate, the expenditure gets agreed before the start of the year.</p> <p>I am not grandstanding or simply engaging in politics but I honestly believe that to proceed with this in light of the rejection of Croke Park II would be taken as an insult to many of the approximately 300,000 public sector workers.  Therefore, I ask that this discussion be postponed, hopefully for a short amount of time.  I would welcome a discussion by this committee of how the &euro;300 million could be found.  I believe the premise of Croke Park II is incorrect and that the money, or certainly a chunk of it, could be found through non-pay sources.  I ask the Chairman, the Minister and my colleagues on the committee to postpone this meeting, because I believe it will be seen as a kick in the teeth by many of the 300,000 public sector workers in the context of Croke Park II.</p></speech>

However, we spent the first 20 minutes of the debate on 2% of the Vote, which is the pay changes as they impact on my Department and its agencies.  I cannot present a fraudulent Vote.  I must apportion where I think the money should be got across the system.  I have done that in a reasonable way.  If there is a change in that 2%, I will return to the committee.  All I have asked is that we go through the normal way of dealing with this.</p><p>  Deputy Donnelly spoke about the <i>post facto</i> way we do Estimates.  That will change this year, as he knows.  We had a very good exchange with Deputy Fleming on this on Question Time last week.  Under the new two-pack arrangement, we will have the budget on 15 October and all Estimates for next year will be expected to be passed before the end of December this year.  That will keep this and all the committees quite busy for the latter part of this year.  It is a better system and we are moving to that.  However, to date it has always been done this way.  We are changing it and have been working on that change for the last two years.</p><p>  With regard to our business today, I have instanced shared services that will run out of money.  That is the pay for people working in the PeoplePoint centre in Clonskeagh, for example.  We must be clear that we are continuing the business of providing for public services in the normal way.  There is an issue to be resolved with regard to making additional savings of &euro;300 million this year.  I made no bones about the requirement for that.  I repeatedly said the arithmetic has not changed and I must represent that &euro;300 million across all Votes in some way.  Bluntly, had I come to the committee and simply expunged that &euro;300 million, there would be a different row here on a different premise.  I ask members to be reasonable about this.  Accept that we will deal with the normal Estimates by going through them line by line under all the Votes in the normal way.  If and when there is a change in the structure of any element of the Votes, whether it is pay or anything else, we will return in the normal way to seek the approval of the committee and the D&aacute;il for that.</p></speech>

This is an attempt to strong-arm public service and Civil Service workers and it amounts to giving them the two fingers and turning a deaf ear to their wishes.  It comes in the aftermath of all of the threats and bullying to which the Minister subjected them and their representative unions in recent months.  I will also not participate in the consideration of an Estimate which contains cuts that have been comprehensively rejected by those workers and their unions.  The Minister was part of the process under which those to whom I refer were invited to ballot on the proposed cuts.  What is happening here is disgraceful and I am very shocked that the Labour Party, in particular, would facilitate this farce.</p></speech>

The point raised by the Minister and Deputy Kevin Humphreys to the effect that if the Revised Estimates are not agreed, the organisations involved could be shut down is a substantive one.  I propose that it would have been preferable to explore whether a ministerial order or legislation could have been used to resolve this issue.  I really am of the view that proceeding with our business, in light of the rejection of the Croke Park II proposals, is simply unacceptable.  I reiterate that it is with regret that I will not be participating.</p></speech>

We need to ensure that public servants will continue to be paid and that business will proceed as usual.  Deputy Donnelly inquired whether I should introduce legislation in order to put matters right.  How could I draft and pass legislation?  The committee and the D&aacute;il must do their business and discuss and vote on the Estimates.  If adjustments are subsequently agreed, either on foot of negotiations or by some other means, then I will be back before the committee.  I think my position on this matter is extremely reasonable and fair.</p></speech>

They also complain about the power of the Executive.  The very function of this meeting is to provide all Deputies with an opportunity to hold the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to account and to scrutinise his spending plans.  The fact that the Opposition comprises one party which failed to engage in scrutiny when it was in government - if it had done so, we might not be in the mess in which we find ourselves - and others which prefer to scrutinise matters on the national airwaves rather than in the Parliament is really an indictment of the Opposition rather than of the process.</p><p>  It is worth noting that what has been announced by the Government in respect of the Croke Park II process shows that concrete progress has been made in a matter of days.  For the Opposition to try to derail a process which brings certainty to the public finances is both scurrilous and grandstanding in nature but, I suppose, not atypical.</p></speech>

However, I wish to state for the record that the agenda for this meeting was issued on Thursday last to every Member of the House.  It was not possible to take an amendment to it today because if we had done so, the meeting would, by default, have had to be suspended as a result of the requirement to issue notification to members.  The position of public servants and their unions on the Croke Park II proposals was well established by Wednesday afternoon last.</p> <p>Certainly, it was known by Thursday and if any Opposition party or member of the committee, or any member of Government for that matter, wished to put an amendment or notice to the Chair for consideration, it may have been taken on board.  However, for the record, there was no notification whatsoever from the Technical Group, Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in with regard to the business to be conducted today or any suggestion of alternatives prior to the commencement of this meeting at 1 p.m.</p></speech>

It has an important role in this democracy to hold the Government to account and to participate in this.  It is unfortunate that Deputy Fleming has left.  He proposed a reduction of &euro;350 million, which included a reduction in sick leave, including uncertified sick leave; an average cut of 5% in allowances, saving &euro;75 million; a deferral of increments in 2013; and accelerated targeted redundancies.  I am committed to public services but he was looking to take more people out rather than provide the necessary public services in hospitals and schools, as well as seeking additional working hours and changes to work practices.  We negotiated at the Labour Relations Commission.  These were Deputy Fleming's pre-budget proposals but he has now walked out of an Estimates meeting which will be in fact far easier on the public service than what he proposed.</p><p>  It is worth noting that Sinn F&eacute;in dismissed the Croke Park II proposals negotiated at the Labour Relations Commission before any document was published.  It participated in the fantasy economics of hitting &euro;100,000 public sector workers.  In fact there are only 6,000 such public sector workers and the idea was they alone would pay for the &euro;300 million reduction.  We have seen what I believe is the worst in democracy: there is no participation and, in fact, it is almost going back to the old days when there was opposition for opposition's sake.  It is not a case of working hard.  As Deputy Mathews said, we are in a deep hole and we are all trying to work our way through this but the answer from the Opposition today is to walk away.  I am very disappointed.</p></speech>

What normally happens is that there is a level of political grandstanding.  That takes place on the political scene and everyone understands that there is an element of drama and theatrics.  However, normally when one comes into these chambers the jackets are taken off, the sleeves are rolled up and we dig deep into the situation that the Government presents and try to find solutions and some costed alternatives.  What occurred today was done purely for cameras, for notice, and for political grandstanding reasons.  It is the very reason the people have turned away from a connection with the political process and the very reason the people are tired of the political system.  It makes the people and those new to these Houses wonder whether we will ever get out of this mess when the best thing some people can hope to get out of today is a headline, a newspaper clip or a piece in "Oireachtas Report" of themselves walking out.  There is one party that got us into this mess and another party that does not even have the sense to get its proposals costed.  There is someone else who is more interested in writing newspaper columns than finding costed alternatives.  It is pathetic and I am embarrassed to be sitting here today as an Irish parliamentarian.</p></speech>

There is work at hand to be done this afternoon.  I propose that the Minister makes his opening statement and then we can move on with the individual subheads and their associated Votes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013042300006#E00500"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to present the 2013 Estimates for my Department's group of Votes.  The group comprises a significant number of Votes.  In addition to my Department's Vote and a new Vote for shared services, the group contains the Votes for several offices under the aegis of my Department, including the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the Valuation Office and the Ombudsman's Office.  It also contains the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances and for the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining Office under the aegis of my Department, that of the Office of Public Works, will be taken separately by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.</p><p>  Before dealing with the individual Votes in the departmental group I wish to draw the attention of the committee to several general issues.  The first issue is the matter of performance budgeting and D&aacute;il oversight.  In recent years I have revised the format of the Estimates presented to the committee as part of the implementation of performance budgeting.  Under this format the Estimates before the committee and all committees present better information in order that Members, members of the public and decision-makers generally can see at a glance the financial and human resource input costs, the key outputs and the impact factors for each expenditure programme.  This is part of the reform to create a more coherent and integrated planning and performance management framework for public expenditure.  Within this performance budgeting framework the overarching strategic policy for each Department is set out in its statement of strategy, which explains through clear and integrated key objectives or high-level goals the rationale and purpose for each programme area.</p><p>  The new Estimates format is designed to expand on this high-level strategic document to provide for each departmental programme a clear presentation of the financial and staffing resources allocated to that area, the main activities undertaken and the key outputs delivered.  The intention is to give committees a clear sense of what exactly public funds are being spent on and what is being achieved with that spending.  Also included in the Estimates document is a section showing the content and impact indicators.  These indicators are intended to give a sense of whether the public service outputs are having a positive impact on citizens and on Irish society in general.  This approach brings a streamlining and clarity to a process that was previously spread across several documents and allows D&aacute;il committees to better understand what public service outputs and impacts are being delivered through the expenditure of public funds.  In addition, my Department will now be working on expanding the expenditure and performance information contained in the Ireland Stat website, which was successfully piloted during the past year.  The content of Ireland Stat will be broadened to capture more information about public services.  It already provides details of performance in areas such as job creation, research and development, road and food safety.  The feedback from our general consultations has been very positive.</p><p>  This year's Estimates process continues the important structural reform that is intended to assist the committee in its task of scrutiny and holding the Government to account.  Much progress has been made on this front.  The challenge over the coming period is to bed down this new way of performance monitoring and reporting and, through the expansion of the Ireland Stat website in particular, to make available up-to-date and easily accessible information on what the public service is delivering on the money we are voting and how well it is doing.</p><p>  In the context of my broader programme of reform in the area of accountability, performance and D&aacute;il oversight, the committee will be aware that I wrote to the chairs of all the Oireachtas committees in January 2012 to advise them of the new arrangements and the opportunities for greater engagement by public representatives in the Estimates formation process.  In the second half of last year meetings took place between Ministers and the relevant Oireachtas committees concerning the prospective Estimates for 2013, framed in the context of the expenditure ceilings set out in the comprehensive expenditure report 2012-2014.  This was the first time that there was a systematic process of considering future Estimates matters by the Oireachtas in advance of the Government deciding on its expenditure Estimates to present to the D&aacute;il.  The purpose of the exercise was to enable committees to engage with line Ministers and their Departments to exchange views on how the fixed allocations would be apportioned.  We knew about the amount of money allocated and we knew the options in the comprehensive review of expenditure and people may have had their own views.  That was a new and useful departure.</p><p>  As the Committee is aware, the hearing in regard to my Department's group of Votes took place last October and I found the exercise useful.  Arrangements are in train to ensure that the process becomes further embedded in the work of the various committees this year.</p><p>  Within the overall framework of recent EU fiscal reforms, I have introduced several improvements to Ireland's budgetary architecture since taking office.  These measures are designed to improve the management of public resources and to ensure public funds are used effectively in a transparent manner.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill was published late last year and, when enacted, will give legal standing to the existing multi-annual departmental ceilings.  This legislation will anchor other reforms to multi-annual budgeting and will allow for sensible, structural planning and prioritisation within each area of public expenditure, encompassing full public input and parliamentary oversight, while affording Government the flexibility to ensure that the appropriate fiscal stance is taken.</p><p>  Naturally, my Department is not simply focused on ensuring that Government meets its public expenditure targets, although these are important; it is keenly aware of the need to achieve value for money in public expenditure as well.</p> <p>The new public spending code, which was developed last year, sets out the rules and procedures underpinning value for money, bringing together in one document an updated guide to value for money best practice.  The code aims to ensure both current and capital expenditure are subject to rigorous value for money appraisal in advance of public moneys being spent and, where programmes are already advanced, that they too are subject to interim assessment and evaluation.  I envisage that committees will be presented with these assessments in due course to aid the former's work in scrutinising departmental allocations and to contribute to their new role in engaging in the Estimates deliberations at an earlier stage.</p><p> In order to enhance the economic and evaluative capacity of the Civil Service, which is a matter on which many people commented recently, the Government has established the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  Under the stewardship of my Department, specialist economic and evaluation staff were recruited into the new service last year.  They are actively engaged in policy work.  The service will support enhanced policy analysis across the Civil Service with the new expertise being shared among Departments as requested.  Many of my colleagues are interested in having specialist economic evaluators working in line Departments.  We are also strengthening our ties with policy experts outside the service, for example, the ESRI, universities and similar government economic units in other jurisdictions.</p><p> The type of work involved is illustrated by the analytical papers contained in the 2013 expenditure report, published last December.  These concerned, respectively, the reduction of public expenditure on legal services, the expenditure impacts of climate change and the implications of demography for spending in the education field out to 2030.  More assessments are under way and I am committed to publishing them.  The papers are designed to provide sharper, more focused assessments of specific policy issues to help inform the Government when it is making policy decisions.</p><p> Turning to the details of my Department's Vote, the committee will have noted that it comprises two main programmes, namely, public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.  The first programme has a focus on the promotion of value for money and performance information and the implementation of policies to reduce public service numbers.  It also includes the management of EU co-funded structural programmes and the fostering of North-South economic co-operation.  The second programme is focused on the delivery of public service reform in line with the programme for Government and the public service reform plan, which I published in 2011.  The implementation of ICT and e-Government programmes and the development of policies to minimise the public service pay bill and maintain industrial relations stability in the public service also form part of the overarching Vote.</p><p> I draw the committee's attention to the fact that my Department's Estimate for this year involves a net funding allocation of &euro;36.364 million compared with &euro;37.1 million last year.  In effect, expenditure will be maintained at broadly 2012 levels despite additional funding requirements in light of, for example, the tendering of the national lottery and additional expenditure on essential IT upgrades required to support Government networks.  These have been funded within existing resources.  Similarly, employee numbers have been maintained at 2012 levels while additional services and reform objectives have been delivered.</p><p> On this aspect, I wish to outline a number of initiatives that have been taken by my Department.  The committee will have noted the presence in the public expenditure and reform group of Votes of a new Vote, which I mentioned in our discussion on the timing of today's debate.  I am referring to Vote 18 - Shared Services.  This new Vote has been created to support the Civil Service shared services programme set out in the reform plan.  My Department established this Vote in January to support the significant progress being made in shared services across central government.  Prior to this, the expenditure allocation was contained in my Department's own Vote.  The gross Estimate for this Vote amounts to &euro;21 million this year, which covers the initial implementation stage for the HR and pensions shared service centre, which will see the transition of 14 Departments this year and a total of 40 Departments and offices before the end of next year.  The Estimate also contains provision for the initial implementation stages of a payroll shared services centre and a further shared service - financial management and banking - is under consideration.  It is envisaged that shared services in the HR, pensions and payroll areas will, in time, generate time savings of up to &euro;20 million per annum.</p><p> I also draw the committee's attention to the work of my Department in respect of procurement reform.  In line with the recommendations of the Accenture report that I commissioned last year, entitled "Capacity and Capability Review of Central Procurement Function", an experienced chief procurement officer, CPO, was recruited into my Department and took up his appointment in late January of this year.  The CPO is charged with leading reform of the central procurement function and will be accountable for national procurement strategy, all aspects of procurement policy, including EU and national procurement law, and the implementation and the establishment of an effective compliance framework.</p><p> Since the CPO's appointment, he has engaged extensively with key stakeholders across the public sector and has developed a plan for Government consideration.  The plan sets out ambitious but achievable targets for migration to a new and more centralised model for procurement across the public service, for significant savings to be achieved and for new governance structures for oversight to be introduced.  As I mentioned last year, we discovered when we drilled down that many State agencies and Departments were buying the same product from the same supplier at different prices.  There is significant scope for improvement.  The new procurement office that the CPO will establish will be a separate body under the aegis of my Department.  The procurement reform plan was considered by the Government today.  My proposals were adopted and I will make public comment on them later today.</p><p> In addition, officials from my Department are taking a leading role in the development of a number of procurement directives at EU level.  These directives are aimed in the main at the following: streamlining procurement procedures and increasing flexibility; increasing the scope for consideration of environmental and social objectives, including local employment and recruitment for significant projects, an issue that many people are concerned about; and improving procedures and governance.  The goal of the Irish Presidency is to achieve a first reading agreement with the European Parliament on all three proposed public procurement directives by the end of June.</p><p> As well as these new initiatives, my Department has been heavily involved in one of the key issues facing the Government.  The Government is committed to delivering the pay savings as set out in the EU-IMF programme of financial support.  Continued reductions in public service numbers in line with Government policy will go a considerable way towards achieving these savings.  Significant progress has already been made in that regard.</p><p> The end of 2012 returns show that serving numbers in the public service were 290,800, some 30,000 below 2008 levels.  The Government is committed to reducing public service numbers further by 2015 to below 282,500.  To this end, a ceiling of 287,000 has been set for the end of this year, which represents a reduction of some 3,400 from the end of last year.</p><p> Delivering a leaner, more efficient public service is a key feature of my public service reform programme.  The timeframe under which we are doing this is challenging.  There will be pressures, but the Government is clear that front-line services will be protected and that we can deliver on this target by continuing to focus on improving systems and procedures, by making better use of shared services and by restructuring operations to deliver more efficient services.  In that regard, my Department is active in the workforce planning area, with the objective of helping organisations to deploy staffing resources more optimally in the context of the planned reduction to which I have referred.  It is an interesting matter.  I have also met the CEOs of a number of State agencies.  While I will not identify the one with whom I spoke this week, that person mentioned the value of being able to redeploy people to the areas of most need from those areas that were overstaffed.  This valuable tool has been utilised across the public service in recent times.</p><p> The challenge for each sector is to manage the reduction in staffing levels while maintaining a high level of service delivery to clients and policy support to the Government.  The bulk of the reduction in staff numbers is being achieved by a combination of the non-replacement of staff leaving under natural retirement and a moratorium on the filling of posts by way of recruitment or promotion.  I am conscious of the fact that this has become a pressure point in some areas that need to be renewed.  I hope to give detailed consideration to this matter and would welcome members' opinions in this regard.</p></speech>

The figure is down by 37%.  Is that because of the ability to be able to acquire cheaper properties or have leases come to an end?

Within the Department there is an overview of all State property and, unfortunately, bad decisions were made, particularly around the time decentralisation was topical.  In some cases long-term leases were taken.  Where we can get out of leases not fit for purpose and where we can amalgamate or transfer facilities, we are doing that on a structured basis.  To answer the Chairman's question, the decrease is down to taking advantage of expiring leases.</p></speech>

As somebody who worked in the public sector, I know there was a great chestnut that came in the first week of September when my line manager would send me a note telling me &euro;5,000 had to be spent before 31 December.  In my case, it would often go to buying IT equipment which would be cheaper at any other time of the year.  Christmas has always been the most expensive time to buy IT equipment and if I could wait until January, I could achieve a cheaper purchase.</p><p>  Is reform envisaged in such operations that will allow purchases to go into January?  What sort of flexibility in the budget would allow this?  Local authorities, VECs and others buy equipment at the end of the year but it is the worst time of the year to do so.  Conversely, the money may just be used because the same amount would not be allocated the following year if money remained in the budget.</p></speech>

That used to apply only to the capital side but I have migrated it to the current side as well, so there is now a three year envelope of money where unspent funding can be carried over in order to get better value.  Purchasing can be targeted to the right time of year if there is an advantage to it.</p></speech>

As there was an allocation of money to the Department, a new wiring system was installed in the school that was to be demolished, which was extraordinarily wasteful.  The multi-annual envelope of money process seeks to end such wasteful expenditure.</p></speech>

There is a limit.  For example, in the capital budget there will be a percentage of carry-over but we need to have a capital spend because that generates jobs.  When we set out to build a certain number of schools, health centres, hospitals, etc. - none of which is germane to my budget - we expect the money to be spent largely in the year.  If there are technical, planning or other reasons for funding to roll over, that can be accommodated in a multi-annual framework.</p></speech>

I have had discussions yesterday with Commissioner Hahn regarding the new multi-annual financial framework being discussed in a co-decision model with the European Parliament.  We are anxious to get the Structural Funds agreed so we can implement national policies from 1 January 2014.  We operate through two regional bodies, a south and east structure and a Border, midlands and west structure.  In view of the time slot within which the new round of moneys was predicated, there was a reduction in the amount of money available to the Border-midlands-west and I and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach were very anxious that this would be addressed.  An additional sum of &euro;100 million was provided in the MFF for the Border-midlands-west.  This means that overall, despite a reduction in the amount of money for Structural Funds across the Union, Ireland will have a slight increase.  The moneys that were voted here are to maintain the existing structure.  We will have to look to next year when the new round comes in.  We will debate what new structures should be in place to monitor the next round of Structural Funds after the budget in October.</p></speech>

This is difficult because it is a joint programme.  The bid is made jointly with the United Kingdom, in terms of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and there was a strong view by the British authorities that they wanted to decrease the overall envelope of expenditure within the Union so they did not want to ask overtly for an additional allocation.  I have recently engaged in extensive dialogue with members of the British Government about that and I am very glad that there will be a PEACE IV programme.  It is very important in terms of North-South co-operation.  There are still residual issues that need to be addressed in bedding down peace.  We cannot take that for granted.  The programme to date has been hugely successful in terms of bedding down the peace in communities.  One of the initiatives taken by the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn, was to consider a number of projects in Brussels and I made a presentation there.  I was very privileged to be there.  Also in attendance were the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.  The peace funding is administered by the Special EU Programme Body, SEUPB, and that is the funding we have provided for here.  It has 62 staff and they monitor the programmes.  They have done a very good job to date.</p></speech>

We seem to be in an era of many referenda and it would be a good idea to have a permanent commission because a certain expertise is required.  I previously informed the Joint Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform about the work my Department did following this referendum.  The Government lost it and we did a great deal of analysis as to why.  It will be instructive in structuring the information campaign for future referenda.</p></speech>

For example, as can be seen from the explanation of office equipment and external IT services, this subhead provides for the ongoing development of ICT and geographic information systems in the Valuation Office.  We are doing a huge amount of work.  All of this relates to the Valuation Office.  New legislation is going through the House.  Much revaluation is taking place and we are providing sound systems, for example, in IT and so on.  Therefore, there is an increase in the sums available for office equipment and external IT services.</p><p>  The increase in office premises expenses was, I understand, for repairs needed which were not carried out in 2012, as expected, but are carried over to this year.  The amount for fees to counsel is a token figure and is the same amount as for last year.  We did not spend any money on counsel.  It is clear that the outturn figure of &euro;73,000 compared to zilch is a 100% increase but is exactly the same as the provision last year.  Most of the subheads are reduced compared with the original 2012 voted figure.</p></speech>

In the past, there have been situations where reports of the Ombudsman were not acted upon or did not even get a platform to be debated.  That has given the Ombudsman's office a new status in recent times and it is an important one.</p><p>  I should also state that the Ombudsman's office worked closely with my office in the drafting and advancing of that legislation and an interesting initiative was taken in that an officer of the Office of the Ombudsman was seconded to my Department to work on the legislation until it was enacted.</p></speech>

It goes up, from the voted figure last year of &euro;178,000 to &euro;230,000.  There is an entirely new focus on environmental information.  I was certainly of the view that it is an area on which the Information Commissioner needs robust legal opinion and legal support because there will be more appeals on environmental information grounds.  I acceded to the request.  It looks like a significant increase, certainly on the outturn figure for last year.</p></speech>

I welcome my colleagues from the Office of Public Works who have joined me for this presentation.</p><p>  Before I refer to some of the key elements of the 2013 Estimate I will bring the committee up-to-date, as I did last year, on some of the areas where the OPW is a key driver in the Government's public sector reform agenda.  The public sector, not unlike the OPW, carries out myriad functions and is spread throughout the country.  The OPW has for years performed as a catch-all organisation for a vast array of public service activities.  Flood risk management, property management and maintenance, heritage services and procurement all form key parts of the ambit of our office.  In essence, these are all forms of shared services provided to the wider public service or directly to the public at large.  In this respect the OPW is well-positioned to be one of the central drivers of the reform agenda.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works is the lead agency and actively engaged in two main areas of reform set by Government, procurement reform, which is soon to be devolved to the new office of Government procurement, and property asset management, where the Chairman of OPW is the senior responsible owner for this aspect of public service reform.</p><p>  The reform of public procurement is a critical element of the Government's public service reform plan.  Procurement of supplies and services accounts for approximately &euro;9 billion of current expenditure by the State per annum.  This represents a significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the public service avails of the maximum value-for-money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.  In 2012, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The report of the review, which was published in September last, found that significant savings could be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.  Last year on foot of the findings of the report the Government agreed to a range of actions for the reform of the central procurement function, including the appointment of a chief procurement officer, CPO, Mr. Paul Quinn, and the establishment of the office of Government procurement.  This new approach to public procurement will involve: integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office; strengthening spend analytics and data management; greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value-for-money and lower administrative overheads; examining the specifications set out for goods and services; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and strengthening supplier and category management.</p><p>  One concern of this committee in the past was the possible restriction of opportunities to small suppliers under the new arrangements.  The office of Government procurement will continue to engage with the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in this regard and in the past two years several significant steps have been taken to improve SME access to public procurement.  Seminars and workshops have been held and in excess of 4,500 SMEs have been hosted to help demonstrate the procurement process.  The National Procurement Service has established an industry collaborative working group involving major business representative groups and the various public sector groupings.  The working group aims to identify the challenges for SMEs when transacting business with the public service and, most importantly, to come up with practical solutions to these challenges.</p><p>  The question of property is a key part of the work of the Office of Public Works.  We are also leading the way with reform in this area.  The number of staff in the public service will fall by approximately 40,000 by the end of next year, 2014, and this creates an opportunity to significantly reduce the cost of office accommodation, which is one of central government's greatest administrative overheads after pay and pensions.  OPW has already made progress in this area and departmental rents have fallen from &euro;130 million to &euro;107 million in the period from 2008 to 2012.  Coupled with further organisational rationalisations, such as shared services and the abolition of agencies, this will continue to facilitate further reductions in the amount of accommodation required by the public service.  As a leader of this area of reform the OPW is taking a whole-of-government perspective on how best to manage public service property to ensure optimal value-for-money is achieved.</p><p>  The Chairman of the OPW is finalising a property management plan currently and I hope to be in a position to present it to Government shortly.  One critical element of the plan is to progress the development of a map-based public service property inventory.  This issue has also been raised by this committee in the past.</p><p>  In my brief as Minister of State with special responsibility for public service reform I am taking the lead on shared services and Ireland Stat, two crucial areas of public sector reform.  As Deputies are aware, the Government considers the implementation of shared services to be a key enabler to reduce the cost and labour intensity of back-office support functions in the public sector.  Significant progress has been made in establishing a human resources and pensions shared services centre for the Civil Service and the first Departments and offices have recently moved to the new service.  A business case for payroll shared services will be presented to Government shortly and work is under way evaluating the suitability of our financial management and banking functions for shared services.  The publication of the OPW Estimate today shows the maintenance of State accommodation being centralised on the OPW vote.  The rationalisation of this service will produce savings, directly by the OPW prioritising the operation of planned and preventative maintenance and indirectly on staffing in Departments in off-loading their property maintenance responsibilities.</p><p>  Ireland Stat is a new whole-of-government performance measurement system, currently in pilot mode, which aims to meet those commitments and to answer the question of how Ireland is doing in a range of areas.  A key commitment in this e-Government area is to ensure that data held by public bodies is made available and easily accessible online for reuse and redistribution.</p><p>  The 2013 Estimates process we are engaged in today is yet another example of reform.</p> <p>The Government is committed to being transparent, accountable and efficient in the provision and consumption of Government funding.  In addition, this reform will see the budget for 2014 brought forward to October of this year, thereby allowing greater opportunity to consider and plan for the 2014 expenditure commitments.  Before members today, the Office of Public Works, OPW, having been involved in the pilot of this performance budgeting process, is presenting a clear plan for expenditure in 2013 with a summary review of what was achieved in 2012 with the funding provided.  2013 will be a critical year in terms of delivering on OPW objectives, the thrust of which was set out in my appearance before this sub-committee last October.  Given the timing of this appearance, it must be acknowledged that resources allocation for the current year is already well established, with 94% of this year's capital allocation and more than half of the 2014 allocation contractually committed at this stage.  Capital unitary payments for the convention centre in Dublin, flood relief projects and building works to maintain the fabric of buildings and deal with the ongoing office rationalisation programme will absorb the medium-term OPW capital allocation.</p><p> On the current side, wage payments for the 1,700 permanent staff, unitary payment commitments and contractual commitments for rent on buildings occupied by Departments account for the most part of the 2013 allocation.  The remaining allocation will be required to fund property maintenance, drainage maintenance and the heritage service programme, which is a critical component in the Government's efforts to revive and develop the tourism sector.</p><p> The most significant part in monetary terms of the 2013 allocation is &euro;70 million on the flood risk management programme.  I expect members to welcome the fact that the Government and the OPW have prioritised this area of funding to ensure greater protection is provided to the public.  The capital part of the allocation, which is largely committed for the coming years, will allow for the provision of both major schemes and the continuation of a highly successful scheme of minor protection works through local authorities.  Major schemes to be advanced in 2013 include Waterford, Carlow, Bray, Fermoy, Mallow, Ennis and Clonmel.  Further funding will be provided to local authorities in 2013 to progress minor works schemes in addition to the &euro;21.6 million that has been provided to local authorities since 2009 in respect of 402 approved projects.  The 2013 allocation also will allow for the continuation of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme of studies.  This important programme involves detailed assessment of the most significant flood risk areas nationally and based on these assessments, the development of a prioritised set of options to manage that risk in the future.</p><p> I am pleased to announce the Government has provided the additional investment required to expand on the successful Optimising Power at Work campaign, which now is achieving savings in excess of &euro;4 million per annum across Departments.  The new energy conservation initiative will broaden its scope from such Departments to target initially 500 large buildings from various public sector organisations.  My office will lead a campaign to achieve ambitious saving targets of up to 18% of consumption within three years.  While my office will lead the campaign, the service requirement will be outsourced in the main, thereby providing approximately 25 high-quality employment opportunities for suitably qualified specialists from various disciplines.</p><p> I hope I have given a flavour of the commitment the OPW and its staff demonstrate to me on a daily basis while playing their part in reforming public services and have assured the sub-committee that the funding to be approved today will be put to the best possible use in the furtherance of reform objectives.  I obviously will be glad to answer any questions from the Chairman and members.</p></speech>

As members commence the business of taking the Votes, I note no Opposition opening spokespersons are presenting and will move on to Vote 13, Office of Public Works.  Are there comments or questions on programme A, flood risk assessment, subheads A1 and A2, administration, pay and non-pay?  No.  Are there comments or questions on subhead A3, plant and machinery or subhead A4, hydrometric and hydrological investigation and monitoring?  No.</p><p>  I have a question on subhead A5, flood risk management.  A lot of money under that heading is going into many positive works.  In my previous capacity as Chair of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I note the Minister of State appeared before it on foot of his relationship with the OPW and so on.  I refer to a problem that both this sub-committee and certainly the aforementioned joint committee must consider.  The issue is that the State is spending an incredible amount of money on flood remedial works, flood engineering works, flood improvements and so on.  However, the difficulty is that areas of the country still are geocoded by the insurance industry as flood risks.  Moreover, even after the OPW and the local authorities have carried out works in those areas, there is no recognition by insurance companies that such work has been done.  In effect, some households cannot take out domestic home insurance at present.  It is a problem for them at present and will be a problem in the future for them because such houses cannot be sold.  While I acknowledge this issue does not come directly under the Minister of State's expenditure remit, I would like to see its resolution as an output, in that it should be one of the objectives.  While the Estimates outline the bricks and mortar aspect of what is being done by the OPW, relief for the domestic owners does not appear to be an output therein, but I believe it should be.</p></speech>

It is fair to state this is very much part of the work programme within that office.  The Chairman rightly pointed out the substantial investment the State has expended in recent years and I take this opportunity to thank the Government for the capital envelope of expenditure, which effectively is approximately &euro;45 million per annum over a five-year period.  Progress is required from the Irish Insurance Federation.  I am glad to be able to report to members that we have had this conversation with it each month this year.  I am relatively optimistic that we will be able to come to agree on a memorandum of understanding by the summertime.  Moreover, I hope such a memorandum of understanding will do two things.  First, it should agree that the Irish Insurance Federation will accept that in the great majority of cases, the works the OPW has carried out are to the 101-year standard.  That is the first point, namely, where the Government has expended the money, the insurance companies would know the works it has carried out have actually met that standard.  Second, there should be an ongoing dialogue between the Office of Public Works and the insurers on the pipeline of other developments and schemes the OPW intends to bring forward and other schemes.  While the Government cannot give comfort to people in locations where a scheme has not been put in place, where such a scheme has been implemented and the State has expended substantial sums of money, it is only right and proper that the insurance industry would recognise that fact, given the standard this office has brought to bear in its work.  Consequently, I am hopeful and optimistic that such an understanding can be reached.  I believe it will help to give some comfort to people where the OPW has completed schemes in locations such as Clonmel and Fermoy, where all these works have been brought to the exacting standard the OPW has now ensured.  In such cases, it is important, right and only proper that the insurance industry would take note of this and provide insurance accordingly.</p></speech>

In Germany, for instance - this came up in my discussions with some of these stakeholders in the area - a protocol or code of conduct, which is called a certification process, is in place.</p> <p>Given that some major insurance companies are based in Germany it is a framework with which they are familiar.  At the end of a process the insurance companies, the OPW and the local authorities could have a certification process on which everyone signs off to ensure compliance.  The insurance companies would be right to say that it is fine to build, for example, a culvert to rectify the problem but the local authority has a responsibility to manage it on an ongoing basis.  It is not sufficient just to build a culvert if it is filled up with debris, including sofas and tyres, in six months&rsquo; time, as was the case in Blackpool recently.  The certification process must include a monitoring element.  Is the Minister of State thinking along the lines of a certification process to which the insurance industry would have to subscribe in terms of his proposed meeting with the Irish Insurance Federation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-23a.488" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013042300015#O00200"><p>My thinking is twofold.  First, we must work out practical issues between the OPW and the insurers in terms of a flow of information.  The Irish Insurance Federation must be confident that the information we give its members is the full picture and that it would disseminate the information to its member companies.  There is, however, a wider issue.  We will be in a better space when we have all signed off on the catchment flood risk assessment and management studies, CFRAMS.  The entire country has been divided up into river basin catchment areas.  There is a more corporate view on flooding maps and all of the issues that surround the potential occurrence of flood risk.  When I first went to the office in Trim two years ago I asked the engineers about the size of the problem.  It was said to me in a direct way that there are 250 hot-spots around the country where at any given time we could have flooding or a major event with significant loss to business and homes.  Putting the CFRAMS in place and signing off on the process following agreement at European level will provide a corporate view.  We are not there yet.  We have to sign off on the process by the end of 2015 and the maps must be in place by the end of this year.  We will all be able to say then that at least we know where the risks are and where the potential work must happen.  It will be important for the insurance industry to know our schemes in the future so that we will be able to continue to roll out the schemes, as long as we have money to do that.</p></speech>

We should examine that approach.  This process is new to us as well.  It is an output of the office.  In fairness, the Office of Public Works has been leading on the issue and I have been pushing the insurance industry to accept our maps and the standard.  I fully accept the Chairman&rsquo;s point.</p></speech>

I note that further funding will be provided to local authorities in 2013 to progress a minor works scheme.  Was there a particular focus or are there criteria relating to the scheme?  Could a drainage scheme be introduced in conjunction with local farmers in the context of the flooding of farm land?  It would improve the quality of a lot of land that is affected by flooding.  Much of the flooding on land comes onto the road and it can cause a serious problem.  Has there been any focus in that regard?  Would the Minister of State consider community projects in conjunction with farmers?</p></speech>

The minor works scheme is very important.  We have an open-door policy in the Office of Public Works.  The local authority is the key body which applies to the office to draw down funds, up to a maximum of &euro;500,000, which is a significant sum of money.  Some of the schemes could cost &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 but many of them cost &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 which are significant amounts of money.</p><p>  For example, Carlow County Council, or in the case of Deputy Humphreys, Monaghan County Council, can apply on a 24-7 basis to the Office of Public Works and the information obtained in the application is put through a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.  The criteria covering the scheme are on the website and are available for the public to peruse at any given time.  The system churns out a number, for example, on a spend of &euro;300,000, and tells us whether it provides value for money.  The system is open and transparent.  If the number is good we will then write back to the local authority and tell it to get the work done and we will provide funds.  The system is working well.</p><p>  I will provide a note of caution.  I do not wish to dump on local authorities but it can be frustrating when the office provides expenditure for a local authority only to find that at the end of the year the money has not been spent.  I accept there are contractual issues for local authorities but I wish to use the opportunity provided by the committee to get the view out that local authorities must spend the money they are given.  We work in a strong partnership approach with local authorities on a range of issues.  We have offices around the country where we work with them on flooding and hydrological issues.  This is an important scheme and I would encourage local authorities to use the funding provided.</p><p>  We have responsibility under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 to look after some schemes but the great majority of schemes are under the control of local authorities or private landowners.  Our key responsibility is under the Arterial Drainage Act and that is where our priority lies, notwithstanding the fact that budgets are always difficult.  The minor works scheme is a very effective means of sorting out little problems.  The key priority is, first, whether someone could die if a flood occurred, second, the number of houses that would be affected, and, third, the number of commercial properties affected.  Farm land is important but I will not pretend that it is as important as someone&rsquo;s house.</p></speech>

I have had experience of it in the past when I worked with ICC Bank.  I was aware of much of the work it did and the property portfolios it managed.</p><p>  I commend the Minister of State on the flood risk fund and the work that will be addressed in that regard.  Could anything be gained from a conversation with Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited, which has a lot of underwriting experience with public bodies and their properties and liabilities with a view to risk appraisal for flood risk management?  Perhaps if it has a lot of surplus that it does not require in the reserves it might like to contribute something towards the &euro;70 million fund.  It is just a thought.</p></speech>

The argument made by insurance plcs when I speak to them is that they have taken a significant hit following the serious weather events we have had since 2008 and 2009 and it makes the Irish market less attractive.  They tell me that the Irish market is effectively the same as Manchester in the United Kingdom in terms of its size and scale and that there are significant risks involved because of the weather events.  We would encourage any insurer, public or private, who would want to move into the space of insuring risk.  I will take up the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion and propose to meet the company.  I do not see any difficulty with doing that and it might be useful to do so.</p></speech>

Other ways of managing risk include the provision of culverts, building up the banks of rivers and doing whatever else is required, including relieving flows on rivers during flash floods.  All such activity manages the risk and while the investment to prevent them is upfront it can have a big pay-off.</p></speech>

Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited is one such example.</p> <p>I will put it this way.  If funds exist in various ways in different State accounts we must get maximum benefit from them, which we are not doing at present.  We need to start procuring banking facilities and services on a much more corporate basis.  That is one of the tasks for the shared service model.  It dealt first with HR, is now dealing with payroll and pensions and will look at banking.  There is no reason we cannot make enormous savings in this area, as the British have done in recent years.  We have to follow that example.</p></speech>

Up to now, there was an amount contained in their Estimates which they spent on maintaining their own buildings.  We recently got a decision of Government, in consequence of which we are going to maintain their buildings and they have given us this money to do so.  They put us in funds for that purpose.  For that reason there is now much greater demand on our work, as one might expect.  The big saving is that where there were up to six people in a Department managing its maintenance, we are now doing this for them which frees up a group of people to do many other tasks in that Department.  We are also getting savings by aggregating the work and having greater economies of scale.  That is the reason the amount has increased so much.</p></speech>

I come to subhead B4, the procurement service, which is given a headline increase of 89%, from &euro;1.190 million to &euro;2.260 million, an increase of more than &euro;1 million.  There is another figure contained for the non-pay section showing that the administration cost is moving from &euro;330,000 to &euro;957,000, an almost threefold increase.

The Bill as it currently stands would expressly provide that the Minister can, by written direction, amend or revoke any direction issued by him or her under section 10(1)(<i>c</i>).  It might be inferred from that express provision that the Minister could not amend or revoke other directions issued by him or her, which would not be the case.  Accordingly, the proposed amendment will ensure that all directions issued by the Minister can be amended or revoked by the Minister.  The amendment brings the position back into line with the current position under the Health Act 2004.</p></speech>

The executive is being abolished and more power and responsibility is being vested in the Minister of the day.  I have argued consistently, including on Second Stage, that there must be balance, openness and transparency and this forum is the appropriate forum to achieve that.  The explanatory memoranda to the Bill state it is &quot;essential the HSE is properly accountable to the Minister for its performance&quot;.  So it should be but my question is what about the accountability of the Minister to the Oireachtas and, through the Oireachtas, to the people.  That is not provided for and it is important that consultation take place.</p><p>  I mentioned the Minster of the day, to divorce Deputy Reilly from being the holder of the position now.  The opportunities we have during the monthly engagement on ministerial questions and the quarterly engagement here cause a limiting of the committee's role.  Only during the latter engagement does the committee have an opportunity to engage with the Minister on matters of the day.  The amendment would enhance all the Minister is proposing in the Bill while making it a more inclusive engagement.  It would rightly give this Oireachtas committee its place in the consultation process.  I commend the amendment to the Minister and hope he will accept it on its merit.</p><p>  Amendment No. 17 states:<blockquote>In page 19, line 43, after &quot;Executive&quot; to insert the following:&#8220;and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children&#8221;.</blockquote>This seeks a role for the Oireachtas committee in dealing with the service plan.  That would be most particular in that section of the Bill - that there be a requirement for more thorough engagement.  We only have an opportunity after the event to reflect on the contents of the annual service plan of the HSE.  We are invited to regional presentations for our respective constituencies but the current arrangement is deficient.  We, as elected voices, have a role to play and a contribution to make.</p><p>  This amendment would improve consultation and allow for an engagement. although we appreciate where the final say rests; that is not being questioned.  It would, however, be a good practice to establish not only during the Minister's tenure but for the future Ministers.  All the arguments support the proposition.</p></speech>

The purpose of section 10(<i>a</i>) is to enable the Minister to specify priorities to which the HSE must have regard in preparing its service plan and establish performance targets in respect of those priorities.  This is not done in isolation.  Pending the establishment of the new child and family support agency, the Minister must consult with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in respect of HSE functions that relate to the functions of that Minister.  The Minister must also consult with the HSE.</p><p>  Amendment No. 2 is concerned with a role for the joint committee where the Minister is determining priorities and setting performance targets.  Priorities and target setting for the HSE seem to me to be matters for the Minister to address in the context of Government policy because the Government sets the policy.  The joint committee has an essential role in exercising democratic oversight, bringing any concerns to the attention of the Minister, and monitoring how Government policies affect people.  Rightly, the Minister can be held to account by the Oireachtas for the performance of the HSE but that is entirely different from having the Oireachtas committee being involved in the formulation of policy, which is a Government prerogative.</p><p>  Amendment No. 17 is similar in concept to amendment No. 2 in that it proposes a role for the joint committee in regard to amending the HSE service plan.  Any necessary amendment to a service plan submitted to the Minister under section 31 of the Health Act 2004 is essentially a matter for the Minister in consultation with the HSE.  It is, however, for the committee to inform matters through evaluating policy and acting as a watchdog.</p><p>  I am concerned there are also practical difficulties in regard to the amendment given the tight deadline in which the Minister must respond to a service plan submitted by the HSE.  This is the subject of a later amendment for discussion today so I do not propose to accept either amendment.</p></speech>

I served on the HSE regional forum and it was not worth the paper it was written on.  There was no accountability and we were fobbed off with answers that were unsatisfactory.  In the context of the HSE, the Minister's presence in office notwithstanding, there is a need for political involvement at local level, whatever about us in the Oireachtas.  The health boards may have been misused by certain politicians but a great disservice was done to the body politic in taking away that function of the elected representatives of the people.  I say that as someone who has been involved in the Health Service Executive in terms of the forum and this committee.  At times, dealing with the HSE is like dealing with the Vatican; it can be very frustrating, although there are very good people there.</p></speech>

While I was not involved in politics when the Health Service Executive was established, I was concerned at the time about the democratic deficit to which the HSE gave rise.  Notwithstanding the many problems associated with the health board system, at least the health boards held local health officials to account and there was a public forum in place to engage with them.  That is not, however, the subject matter of the amendments.</p></speech>

The joint committee has a good relationship with the HSE, although it is not a one-way street.  The picture at local level is different, however.  If I were a councillor who was not on a health forum or an Oireachtas Member who was not on this committee, I wonder what would be my relationship, as a practising politician, with the HSE.  The health forums were established as a political sop to keep politicians happy and maintain their involvement in the process.  They do not have any function or power, which is wrong.</p></speech>

The establishment of the Health Service Executive ensured there would be little or no accountability of the HSE, either locally or nationally.  The local health committees were very helpful to local communities and the health boards.  Health staff were members of both the committees and health boards, which provided  valuable democratic accountability to local people.  We should support Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's amendment and avail of every opportunity to ensure accountability is provided.  Accepting this amendment would be a start.</p></speech>

However, the issue under discussion is the establishment of a new directorate and the abolition of the board of the Health Service Executive.  These measures will be a stepping stone towards the end of the HSE, which, under my plan, will cease to function either next year or in early 2015.  The Chairman is correct to express concern about the democratic deficit.  The new structures will have to address this issue because it is important to have accountability and transparency in the operation of the health service at local and national level.  However, such accountability must be balanced with the need to avoid the interference which sometimes occurred at local level in the past.  This dynamic is at play irrespective of what one does.  As soon as establish a new structure, people will find away to enable them to pursue their interests or agendas.  I fully accept the concerns the Chairman raises and will take them on board when replacing the current HSE with new structures.</p></speech>

I am seeking a consultation which will enhance the role of this committee and the committee system in general.  It would be appropriate for members to be consulted as would give us an opportunity to inject ideas and thoughts and perhaps exert influence when the national service plan and other policy matters are being prepared.  The ultimate decision would still rest with the Minister.</p><p>  It is inappropriate that we are always reacting after events and everything is presented as a <i>fait accompli</i>.   In such circumstances, members will obviously focus on what they consider to be the flaws or holes in the final document presented to the committee.  It would be worthwhile to grant us an opportunity to put forward ideas for consideration, even if few, if any, are ultimately accepted or considered.  This consultation process would be available to Ministers and members of the joint committee now and in future and would create a better relationship between the Minister and other elected representatives who have a specific interest in health.  The amendments would achieve this objective without threatening anybody. </p></speech>

One of the main reasons I will not accept the amendment is that there are no precedents in legislation for involvement by an Oireachtas committee in regard to amending service and business plans of agencies or setting priorities for agencies.  It would not be wise for us to set such a precedent.</p><p>  Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Minister for Justice and Equality may set priorities and performance targets for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  There is no provision in the Act for other consultation.  While several organisations are required to prepare business plans which must be approved by the relevant Minister, for example, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Dublin Transport Authority, provision is not made in any legislation in regard to ministerial consultation with an Oireachtas committee in this respect.  I regret that I will not be able to accept the amendment.  </p></speech>

There is concern among people involved in the mental health services and several non-governmental organisations operating in this area that the legislation does not include a stated commitment to ensure one of the directors is a director of mental health.  A later amendment refers to the position with regard to the appointment of the holders of directorships and the requirement, as matters stand, that new directors appointed to the Health Service Executive will already have exercised the function of national director within the HSE.</p> <p>We welcome the Government's intention to improve accountability of the HSE but Mental Health Reform has stated that the Bill does not ensure a director of mental health has the competence to drive the implementation of health policy, including A Vision for Change, and that it should be enshrined in the legislation.  In regard to amendment No. 3, I argue for a specific reference to the appointment of director of mental health.  I will have to defer my comments on amendment No. 4 until the Chairman asks me to move it.</p></speech>

It is unnecessary to specify mental health on its own in this regard.  I do not believe we need to have it spelled out.  Section 8 provides that the directorate will consist of a director general and other persons referred to in the Bill as appointed directors.  To offer flexibility and allow the size of the governing structure to adapt to changing circumstances, the Bill does not specify a fixed number of members for the directorate, instead providing for a maximum of seven and a minimum of three.  I will be bringing further amendments on Report Stage to allow for flexibility in allowing people who are not directors to serve on the directorate, such as the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer.  I am happy to confirm that the directorate will include the director of mental health services, the director of primary care, the director of hospitals, the director of social care and the director of health and well-being.  There is no issue in this regard.  Why specify one without all the others?  It is not something that makes a lot of sense.  I appreciate what the Deputy is saying in regard to emphasising mental health and I concur that for far too long mental health has been the Cinderella of the health services.  That is certainly not going to remain the case but there is no question of the directorate not including the director of mental health.  If I named one person above everybody else, that would lead us into a strange place.  I understand what the Deputy is trying to achieve but I would prefer not to take this amendment.  I ask him not to press it because I do not want to send the wrong message that we are not regarding mental health as important as every other directorate.</p></speech>

We have seen ample evidence of this across a succession of Administrations.  I do not have to cite instances, even in our current circumstances, in regard to the failure to ring fence mental health and A Vision for Change.  There is understandable nervousness in this regard.  It might have been a better idea to have named them all, as the Minister has just done, and I welcome that he has confirmed there will be a director of mental health.  Perhaps, however, that is just the Minister's call at this point in time.  If the legislation does not specify and confirm this, it will be open to change in the future when the same degree of acceptance of the importance of mental health might not apply.  That would be absolutely tragic and I hope it never comes to pass.  The Minister has the ball at his feet in terms of guaranteeing the position not only during the course of his own tenure, but also beyond it.  We would safeguard the importance of mental health by specifically referring to a director of mental health within the new directorate.  That is the purpose of the amendment and I am in the Minister's hands.</p></speech>

I take the Minister's assurance that such will be the case but down the road who is to know what will happen with a different Minister?  Approximately 12 months ago the HSE transferred acute inpatient psychiatric services from south Tipperary to another hospital and we are now finding that the two hospitals, south Tipperary and Kilkenny, will be in two different networks.  That seems an odd situation and it might have helped if there was a director of mental health.  It is an important provision.  I accept the Minister's assurance but I wonder what would happen under a different Minister with a different view.</p></speech>

With regard to this Bill, however, if we are specifically stating a particular directorate we should set out every directorate, and top of the list should be finance given how much we spend in this area.  I know the intention is honourable but I am not sure it will have a benefit singularly given all the other directorates on the management team and the amounts we spend.</p></speech>

This is the first time that a separate and distinct director of mental health will be appointed.  The person appointed will be responsible to the director general for the budget and resources applied to mental health and for advancing the Government's stated policy of implementing A Vision for Change.  The idea is to create transparent lines of funding for the various directorates.  We all know that mental health crosses a range of areas, which means there is not only a vertical line but also a horizontal line passing through primary care, hospital care, social care and community care.  The expert advice I have received indicates this amendment will cause more problems than it will solve.  I absolutely accept the good intentions behind it but I ask that it be withdrawn because I do not want to send a negative message on mental health.  I believe mental health is critical to everybody's well being and people do not know how strong it is until it breaks.  I will not be in a position to accept the amendment and rather than have a vote on it, I would prefer it to be withdrawn.</p></speech>

I would be of a mind to be not only greatly sympathetic to that view and the application of it in most circumstances but I have it to say that I believe there is a basis for concern in respect of the area regarding mental health and this is the focus of my amendment.  It is imperative that we appoint the best available person to take up this role and responsibility and that person might not be currently within the HSE service.  That person may have been previously or may have been in any other walk of life as things are but he or she may have the necessary feel for it, commitment to it and the abilities and the unquestionable interest.  There are people available who would certainly fit that bill and there have been instances of appointments recently of people from roles that have given them great expertise.  At the meeting of this committee last week we heard of the instance in respect of the child and family agency, as it will be known, and the appointment of a former senior face and voice within the non-governmental sector.</p><p> There is merit in not holding strictly to what section 16A(3) seeks to achieve and that the criteria should stipulate someone who is absolutely committed and with the proven track record of interest in and support for not only the development of mental health services but the successful roll-out at the earliest possible time of A Vision for Change.  I commend amendment No. 4 to the Minister and the committee.</p></speech>

As the directorate is to be the new governing structure of the HSE it is essential that its members come from senior management in the executive.  I should also clarify that it was not the intention that appointed directors be drawn only from current HSE employees.  In other words the intention was that appointed directors be drawn from HSE employees irrespective of when the person may have been appointed to the grade.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 4.</p><p>  Deputies will be aware from my amendments that I am no longer proposing that membership of the directorate should be limited only to persons holding the grade of national director.  In this regard amendment No. 5 deals with eligibility for appointments to the directorate.  The Bill currently provides that appointed directors must be HSE employees holding the grade of national director.  However, as I signalled on Second Stage, in light of the approval of some new necessary top management positions covering issues other than service areas I believe that eligibility for membership of the directorate should be widened to give a greater degree of flexibility in determining the ideal composition of the directorate and enable other relevant employees as well as employees in charge of service areas to be part of the governing body of the HSE.  Specifically, the amendment provides that appointed directors must be employees holding the grade of national director or another grade not less than the grade of national director.</p><p>  I wish to inform the committee of a potential amendment relating to directorate membership on Report Stage to which I alluded earlier.  Amendment No. 5, which I have just outlined, widens eligibility for membership of the directorate to allow senior employees in addition to national directors to be members of the directorate.  Under the Bill, however, the maximum number of directors of the directorate, including the director general, is seven.  However, under the Health Act 2004 the number of board members was 12.  I am still in favour of a tight ship when it comes to the directors but I believe there is scope for a slight increase in the total number of directorate members.  I believe this will allow relevant service heads and a small number of other key senior employees to form the governing body of the HSE.  Accordingly, and subject to legal advice, I will be bringing an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.  However, I wish to assure the committee that there will be no additional costs associated with this amendment.</p><p>  Amendment No. 7 is consequential on amendment No. 5.  Amendment No. 14 is to ensure the Minister can appoint an appointed director's second-in-command to act as a temporary member of the directorate during an extended absence, for example, through illness, of the appointed director.  Section 16L(2) currently allows the Minister to appoint a HSE employee to the directorate where, by reason of an extended absence by an appointed director, there is not in the opinion of the Minister a sufficient number of appointed directors of the directorate available to enable the directorate to perform its functions effectively.  However the Bill provides that only employees in the grade of national director or, with the amendment recently discussed, another no-less-senior grade are eligible to serve on the directorate.  Should there be an extended absence of an appointed director, amendment No. 14 will allow another HSE employee to temporarily replace the appointed director on the directorate, the governing body, even though that employee may not be a national director or a person holding an equivalent grade.  This flows from a common sense approach to management and the need to consider practical situations that might arise.  My amendments, if accepted, will have no financial implications.</p></speech>

We had heretofore understood the number would be seven, but clearly the Minister will extend that.  Has the Minister made a decision on what number he intends to propose?</p><p>  It is welcome that the Minister is willing to look at others within the HSE rather than only current holders of national director roles but the Minister goes on to state in amendment No. 7 that if such a person ceases to be employed by the executive then he will also cease to be an appointed director.  The Minister is holding absolutely rigidly to the situation that members of the board, the directorate, will be employees of the HSE.  The Minister has widened the scope of possible appointees from the national director role to any other level - this is clear from what he has put forward - but I believe he should take the further step.  I do not believe we should be harnessing it in respect of current employees of the HSE.  The expertise is what we require.  We need the best person and he or she maybe outside the HSE loop at this point and the Minister should be willing to consider that.</p><p>  My concerns are principally in the mental health area but it is equally applicable to any and all of the positions.  It cannot be beyond the Minister's gift to accept that it should be an open application.  Clearly, people within the HSE would have a distinct advantage because of their knowledge, experience and direct involvement within the service, but we could be surprised by the capacity and abilities of those who might express an interest coming from outside the HSE.  I do not believe we should close the door on that experience and interest.  I believe it is all to the good and that it should be an open opportunity.  That is my position and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider.</p></speech>

This is one of the occasions we agree although perhaps not in the same way.  I am happy to share with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in my thoughts on the Report Stage amendment because I am clear in what I am trying to achieve.  Its purpose is to accommodate precisely what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was talking about and it alludes to what I was talking about some moments ago.</p> <p>Currently we have the director general, the hospitals director, the primary care director, the social care director, the mental health director and the director of health and well-being.  That is six people.  We also have a chief operations officer in place, bringing the total to seven.  We are advertising for a chief financial officer, who has not yet been appointed.  This comes back to the point that they must be employees to go on the directorate, and most people here would agree that any organisation would want its chief financial officer involved at the directorate or managerial level, which is precisely why I am talking about a Report Stage amendment to accommodate that.</p><p> In essence, I am in agreement but the language is a little different.  People must be employed first before going on the directorate.  It is a technicality but I have highlighted the area in the past as there is a great deficiency in that regard throughout the system concerning a lack of people with financial training being involved in the control of the finances of an organisation.  If memory serves, approximately 10% of people in charge of accountancy functions within the HSE have financial training, which is a cause of grave concern.  We have set about addressing that and we have appointed somebody new in the Department, through the four regions and in the primary care reimbursement service.  We need a new chief financial officer in the new directorate.</p></speech>

Far from it, I would not be party to such a process.  I hope that by opening up this matter we would be able to ensure the best possible choice and selection.  That is in the interest of the service, mental health in particular and best practice.</p></speech>

I availed of the opportunity to ask the T&aacute;naiste about matters concerning Croke Park II.  Of course, he did not answer but at the end he asked me if I would support legislation to cap public service pay.  I responded that it is an absolute given and we have argued this consistently.  At this first opportunity following that debate, I am expressing the same sentiments.  With all the difficulties currently applying, it is very important that salaries at the highest levels within the public service are capped and I am making the case very clearly that we should ensure that higher pay levels are curtailed at a particular level.  The &euro;100,000 figure is the one we have argued for, as have other voices in society, trade unions and elsewhere.  I do not anticipate the Minister will accept, as he has demonstrated a contrary view time and again, but so be it.</p></speech>

An appointed director will be remunerated for his or her substantive post of national director or other senior grade.  Posts at national director level in the HSE are senior management positions which encompass significant responsibilities and accountability.  These senior managers will collectively be responsible for managing a budget of approximately &euro;13 billion and staff of almost 100,000 people.  They will be expected to achieve significant savings and system reform.  In these circumstances and cognisant of Government policy on public service pay, the posts have been approved at national director level 2, with a salary of &euro;158,296.  That salary level, as with other salary levels in the public service, has been reduced in recent years.</p><p>  The remuneration package for the director general must reflect the fact that the position encompasses significant and onerous responsibilities.  As well as chairing the directorate, the director general will be responsible for the management and control of the HSE.  The director general will also be required to ensure the achievement of national performance targets, prepare the HSE for further change and deliver on Government reform plans for the sector.  Having regard for current Government pay policy, the cap on public sector salaries of &euro;200,000 and the need for appropriate headroom between the levels of senior management, the intended salary level for the post is &euro;195,000, subject to final agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It must be noted that this salary is significantly lower than the salary levels paid to previous HSE chief executive officers, which were upwards of &euro;300,000 per annum plus additional benefits.</p><p>  The Deputy is quite right that I will not be accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

The issue of concern here is that we are hamstringing the appointment process in view of the fact that those who can be appointed to this new directorship, the director general and the directors, can come from the existing positions.  The Minister has announced that he intends to table an amendment but that is only in the context of additional directors being appointed, like the chief financial officer or one or two others whom the Minister may wish to appoint.</p><p>  The Minister held the same view as me.  He once described the HSE as a dysfunctional and self-serving organisation.  I do not want to make overtly political points but that is the fact of the matter.  By virtue of this legislation the Minister is ensuring that the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 is bypassed and there will not be an open recruitment process whereby people would make an application, present their credentials and the best person would be selected.  This is not casting any aspersions on any individual who is entitled under this proposal to put his or her name forward.  With an issue of such importance and with such a large budget and such significant responsibilities being placed on people, surely there should be an open recruitment process.</p><p>  The Minister intends to abolish the HSE in the near future but in the meantime it has an onerous task, with which the Minister has charged it, to present a proper health Estimate every year to carry out the functions and the running of the HSE.  It is completely unacceptable.  I am amazed that more people are not concerned about this.  In the context of this and some of the provisions in section 7 with regard to the removal of directors, this is allowing the Minister extensive and sweeping powers.  It is making people who have very serious decisions to make beholden to the Minister.  To quote one section: &quot;The Minister may issue a direction to the Directorate in relation to the delegation of the Executive's functions to the Director General.&quot;  The Minister, by issuing a direction to the directorate, can bypass it, and the director can make the decision because of delegation of powers.<br />The Bill also states: &quot;The Minister may at any time remove an appointed director from office as a member of the Directorate if ... the removal of the person as an appointed director appears to the Minister to be necessary for the Directorate to perform its functions in an effective manner.&quot;  This goes to the heart of issues.  No Minister should have this authority, unless there are serious breaches of ethics and standards, to remove somebody of senior significance.  It is akin to giving the Minister authority to remove the Secretary General of a Department.  It is akin to giving the Minister authority to sack senior officials in the Department of Health.  I have major concerns about this.  This is not casting aspersions on the Minister.</p></speech>

On a point of order, we are discussing an amendment relating to the appointment of the first director, not the issues the Deputy is raising.</p></speech>

I can be repetitive if people want me to be.  I will stick directly to the amendment in this case, but it is the general thrust of the appointment process.  We are now charging a person who is running the HSE, which has a budget of &euro;13 billion every year, and we are saying there should be no open recruitment process.  We are recruiting from an organisation that the Minister has previously described as dysfunctional and self-serving, and in the context of what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others said, there should be an open recruitment process for the director general and directors, and it should be done at one remove from this very constrained legislation.  It is the case in almost every other area that a person who is charged with this kind of accountability would be appointed through the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act of 2004.</p></speech>

Subsequent directors general will be appointed by the Minister following a recruitment process under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  There are precedents in legislation which provide that the first person appointed to a new office may be appointed as envisaged in subsection (4).  This is the most practical way to advance the new director's arrangements, which are temporary.  I do not, therefore, intend to accept amendment No. 10 and consequently will not accept the related amendment No. 8.</p></speech>

We are restructuring the health services, as is the Minister's right and he said he received a mandate to do so.  However, I am very concerned that while the Minister says it is temporary, we cannot foretell what will happen in the future.  In the meantime, there must be one remove at least in the appointment process to ensure it would be open, transparent and would go to the person most eminently qualified who applies for the position.  That is the key issue at stake.  I will refer to the broader issues in section 7 but I am pressing the amendment because I genuinely believe, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, that we should allow anybody who feels they are eminently qualified to apply for the positions through the recruitment process.  There may be precedents, but the Minister is subsuming the HSE into the Department of Health.  In the context of the precedents the Minister mentioned, he would be taking functions from a Department and moving them out, sometimes with a board and accountability.  Here it is the exact opposite and that is something on which people should reflect.</p></speech>

There is nothing new in this and we all know this is a short, temporary arrangement that will last a couple of years at most and I want to expedite it, ensure we have a smooth transition and ensure services are maintained.  That is why I have gone about it as I have, and no other reason.  We have in position an individual who is excellently suited to the role.</p></speech>

These include managing and controlling the business of the HSE.  In these operational aspects of his or her role, the DG is answerable to the directorate as the governing authority for the HSE.  Section 16G(1) provides that in addition to his or her functions as a member of the directorate and as the chairperson of the directorate, the DG shall carry on, manage and control generally the administration and business of the HSE, perform such other functions as may be delegated to him or her by the directorate and perform such functions as may be assigned to him or her under this Act or any other enactment.</p><p>  Under section 16G(2), the DG is responsible to the directorate for the performance of his or her CEO type functions, that is, carrying on, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the HSE, performing such functions as may be delegated to him or her by the directorate and preform such other functions as may be delegated to him or her by the directorate and perform such functions as may be assigned to him or her under this Act or any other enactment.  He or she is also responsible to the directorate for the implementation of its policies.</p><p>  However, under section 16G(3), this responsibility to the directorate does not apply to the DG's functions as a member of the directorate and as the chairperson of the directorate.  Legislation generally provides for a deputy to act in the absence of the CEO or when the office of CEO is vacant.  Section 16G(4) currently provides that in the extended absence of the DG or if the office of DG is vacant, the functions of the DG may be performed for such period not exceeding six months by an appointed director, that is, a member of the directorate designated by the Minister.  This came about in part because the Department did not want to give weight to the idea of a standing grade of deputy DG.  However, the HSE has expressed a concern that in any event there should be provision in the Bill for the DG to be able to nominate a stand in even where he or she is absent for only a short period.</p><p>  Amendment No. 12 deals with the absence of the DG and a vacancy in the office of DG and provides for designation by the DG options and the Minister to address those situations.  Amendment No. 13 is consequential and deals with the chairing of meetings of the directorate in the absence of the DG or a vacancy in that office where a designation has been made.</p></speech>

The wording the Minister seeks to amend includes, importantly, under section 16G(4), "...the functions of the Director General referred to in subsection (1) may be performed, for such period not exceeding 6 months".  The amendment and the Minister's comments make no reference to that important point.  It is not included for no good reason.  The Minister is seeking to delete this but he did not refer to this in his commentary and it is not addressed in the substitute subsection, which states, "may be performed by such appointed director as may be designated by the Director General from time to time, with the consent of the Minister".  The DG might not be in a position to do so from time to time.  This is a loose and open provision.  We have had all sorts of time-related concerns in public life in recent years and I thought that was a particular protection that the Minister had presented initially because he was time constraining this provision.  It was not open and the position could not be abused or carried on indefinitely.  He needs to clarify and explain why he is taking away this important requirement.</p></speech>

However, on further reflection, there is a need to address absences by the DG that are not extended absences and it is important that even a short absence by the DG should not leave the executive without someone who could clearly and authoritatively exercise the important functions of the DG.  Given this proposed change to cover short absences, from an operational and practical perspective, the DG is better placed to designate someone to act in his or her absence.  However, such designation is subject to the consent of the Minister.  For completeness, when the DG returns to duty, the designated director automatically ceases to perform the functions of the DG.</p><p>  In the different scenario of a vacancy in the office of the DG, the amendment provides that the Minister will designate the appointed DG who will act in an interim capacity.  The designation of an appointed director to act as DG in the event of a vacancy is temporary.  Under section 16L(1), the Minister is required to take steps to fill the vacancy as soon as may be practicable.  Amendment No. 13 is consequential.  When the DG is not present or the office is vacant, the appointed director designated by the DG for the purpose of his or her absence or in the case of a vacancy, or the appointed director designated by the Minister, if any has been so designated, will, if present, chair meetings of the directorate.</p></speech>

We have many examples across the public service of people in high office who are merely acting in the respective role that they occupy.  Several local authority county managers are acting up and they have not been designated.  Their predecessors have not been properly replaced.  I fear that someone could be in such a position for an extended period.  Six months is a long time and the HSE is responsible for the largest chunk of public money in the context of the overall health budget.  Where somebody is acting in the capacity of the DG, a safety net is required in order there are not extended periods of stewardship where people for whatever reason have not been appointed to the position.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the DG duly appointed could be<i> in absentia</i> for a variety of reasons for much longer periods.</p></speech>

The extended period is not qualified here and, therefore, the amendment is seeking to cover the shorter periods where, say, the DG is on holidays for two weeks.</p> <p>It says no longer than six months but it does not cover the shorter period.  It is only for the clarity of that.  Not exceeding six months is still in there.</p></speech>

Section 16D(3) states, &quot;The Minister may at any time remove an appointed director from office as a member of the Directorate if ... (<i>c</i>) the removal of the person as an appointed director appears to the Minister to be necessary for the Directorate to perform its functions in an effective manner,&quot;.  I have no difficulty with a Minister having powers to remove persons at certain juncture but in the context where the Minister deems it necessary for the Directorate to perform its functions in an effective manner, who decides what is an effective manner?  Clearly, this is important.</p><p>  If there was a situation whereby the Minister had the power to remove the Secretary General of a Department, many Members of the House would have major concerns.  It is important that there are lines of demarcation where staff are not beholden to the Minister in the context of their stated employment, which is the case under this Bill where the Minister can remove them.  Under the Bill as drafted, persons who are in very senior positions and who are charged with significant responsibilities are beholden to the Minister of the day.  Whereas the Vatican may be run by an infallible person, I am not suggesting the Minister is always infallible.  He may be fallible from time to time.  It is important that staff have the confidence, and are not beholden to a Minister, to be able to say to the Minister they believe what he is doing is wrong for obvious reasons.</p></speech>

The section gives the Minister of the day sweeping powers to dismiss a director, and a person who is appointed by whatever mechanism should be in a position where he or she does not feel beholden and can safely say to the Minister that the advice he or she is giving to the Minister is not in accordance with his or her wishes for stated reasons.

It is a large section.</p><p>  Section 16C(8) states, "The Minister may issue a direction to the Directorate in relation to the delegation of the Executive&rsquo;s functions".  If the directors have a concern about a certain issue, the Minister can bypass them and delegate the functions of the directorate directly to the director general.  Am I misreading it?  There must be certain lines of demarcation.  That is my issue of concern.</p><p>  There is one other issues about which I have concerns.  The section states that a person shall not be eligible for appointment as director general if he or she "has made a composition or arrangement with his or her creditors".  I can understand it in the context of bankruptcy, but does that mean that there has been a readjustment of his or her mortgage?  Is his or her mortgage split and put in abeyance, and a certain amount of it warehoused for a period of time?  What exactly is meant by "a composition or arrangement with his or her creditors"?  It could be the grocery shop down the road with whom he or she has made a settlement?  We need clarity on this.</p><p>  This is in the context of where we are as a people.  We are trying to encourage persons back into society and the Minister is saying here, in this subsection, that a person shall not be eligible if he or she has made a composition or arrangement with his or her creditors.  Ones creditor could be anybody.  They are not specified here and I do not think they are specified anywhere else.</p><p>  Surely this is bizarre in view of the fact that the Government has just announced a personal insolvency scheme where a person can have a composition or arrangement with his or her creditors and we are saying that they should be able to partake in normal everyday society.  That is a matter on which I seek clarity.</p></speech>

A Minister would always act with responsibility in these matters because he or she is open to challenge.

The Bill allows a Minister to direct the director general to prepare and submit a service plan if the HSE has failed to submit a service plan in accordance with various provisions of the section.  This is based on a similar provision in the Health Act 2004 with regard to the CEO.  The intention of the 2004 Act was that the CEO would be directed to prepare and submit a service plan only if the HSE had not submitted one in the specified time period and not for other reasons.  This will be clarified by amendment No. 15.  Amendment No. 18 provides that the director general must comply with such a direction.</p><p>  With regard to amendment No. 16, section 31(8) of Health Act 2004 provides that within 21 days of receiving the service plan, the Minister must either approve it or issue a direction to amend it.  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill amends section 31.  Under the Bill the Minister must, having consulted with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, approve the service plan in the form in which is was submitted, or approve the service plan with such amendments as the Minister, having consulted with the HSE, may determine, or issue a direction to the HSE to amend the plan.  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill does not specify a time period within which the Minister must take one of these three steps.  To address this situation, amendment No. 16 provides that the Minister must act within 21 days of receiving the service plan from the HSE.  This time period is in line with current provisions in the 2004 Act.

The amendment has been tabled because of issues raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Martin and others with regard to people who, to all intents and purposes are ministerial special advisers but have been engaged through a consultancy.  Such people are involved in legitimate tax avoidance.  The amendment would address this issue with regard to people who are, in everything but name, advisers to the Minister.  They provide consultancy through companies not registered in the country for this purpose.  It leads to cynicism and is not in accordance with what we should be trying to encourage.  If a person is an adviser, he or she should be called an adviser and we should not faff around the edges and pretend the person is a consultant.  We should call these people what they are, and disentangle this web whereby they are able to provide a consultancy service and avoid the taxation code of the State.</p></speech>

It reflects the overwhelming opinion of ordinary decent Irish people who are greatly offended by such incidents.  In the past people were employed directly within agencies of the State but avoided paying tax because of arrangements they had cleverly devised with their advisers.  That is simply unacceptable.  The health service budget should not be a party to this, nor any other public moneys.  It should be stamped out.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

Can I correct any misapprehension?  People who are hired by the Department to be advisers to the special delivery unit are not my advisers.</p><p>  The amendment, as worded, seems to suggest that all officers and employers engaged by the HSE must be tax resident in the State before they are engaged by the HSE.  If that is the case then the proposal would fall foul of EU anti-discriminatory legislation.  </p><p>   If the concern here is that the income arising to individuals engaged by the HSE who are not resident in the State would fall out of charge to tax in the State, the following is the likely tax treatment of such income.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the tax Acts, the income would be chargeable to tax by virtue of section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as an "annuity, pension or stipend payable out of public revenue of the State."  This charge is unfettered by considerations of residence of the individual or where the duties are performed.  </p><p>  Where the individual is tax resident in a country with which this State has a tax treaty, the income will generally remain taxable in the state where the duties are performed.  I can only assume that in the vast majority of cases the HSE employees will perform their duties in this State.</p><p>  Where the individual is tax resident in a country with which this State does not have a tax treaty, the income will be taxable in this State.  Some individuals employed by the HSE may have non-HSE income.  The taxation of such income is provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act.  Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>
