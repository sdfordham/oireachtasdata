    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eilis McCann" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#D00300"><p>Dr. David McGrath, Ms Paula Hogan, who is in the Visitors Gallery, and I are here on behalf of Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland.  To give a short history of our group, Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland was formed by owners, breeders and trainers of track greyhounds who were becoming increasingly aware of a perceived drugging problem in performing dogs.  Members are predominantly but not exclusively from the south-east of Ireland.  There appeared to be a culture of altering the performance of certain greyhounds, that is, slowing them for trials and subsequently &quot;driving&quot; them for races.  There was widespread concern that cover-ups were the norm when certain dogs were tested and their samples proved positive for banned substances.  As the group grew, we established an excellent working relationship with Ms Geraldine Larkin, former CEO, and Ms Hilary Forde, head of racing and governance of the Irish Greyhound Board.  Ms Forde attended our AGM and also liaised on our behalf to have our committee included in discussions with Professor Morris, who gave us a very generous hearing and mentioned our proposals in his report.<br/><br/>We are delighted to say the IGB took on board the majority of our proposals, including out-of-competition testing, sales testing, publishing of analytical findings, increased security in kennelling areas and increased testing on all dogs of kennels where there have been multiple positive findings.  Sales of Irish greyhounds were suffering due to the perceived low image of our dogs, so much so that the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, the British governing authority, issued more or less an ultimatum stating <i>caveat emptor</i>, or buyer beware, and that if one is going to buy Irish dogs, one should proceed very cautiously.  To us, that truly was an insult and a slur.  In the past, Irish greyhounds enjoyed the respect of a worldwide sporting audience.  With a concerted effort from all stakeholders, they can soon resume their rightful place at the top of the racing world.  Latterly, real progress has been disappointingly slow, due perhaps to the fact Ms Forde can no longer meet with us, unless at a forum which is organised by the IGB.<br/><br/>The ordinary owner feels that the credibility of the current board is compromised as it is felt that it does not keep its own rules.  We appreciate the opportunity to come here today to meet with Oireachtas Members and we appeal to those in power to strive to provide a level playing field for all involved in this wonderful sport.</p><p> The following are our proposals.  Integrity is at the core of every successful sport, therefore, those involved at all levels must be people of the highest integrity.  Rules must be implemented with the welfare of the greyhound taking precedence, to the benefit of all, not just the few.</p><p> As regards the purchase of new equipment for the laboratory in Limerick, if tests are covered up, this purchase is a total waste of money.  Time-finding and time-losing dogs are to be tested and results are to be published.  Stud dogs are to be fully tested before a litter is sired and findings published.  Without this breeders are taking a shot in the dark, which is a very costly move in some cases. </p><p> As regards greyhounds that break track records, before the record is ratified that dog should be sampled and the results published.  The same goes for bitches who are going to retire to the breeding paddocks.  A case can definitely be made that they also need to have their full history logged publicly.</p><p> The control committee has to be truly independent without any conflict of Interest.  Is this currently the case?  Classic winners' and track record breakers' samples should be taken and sent to an independent laboratory, for example, in Newmarket.</p><p> Fines must be large enough to act as a deterrent.  Owners and trainers with multiple offences should be banned.  The minimum fine should be &euro;5,000.  The same should apply to those whose dogs test positive for steroids, cocaine, etc.  A red flag should appear by their names on the race card. </p><p> The administration of such substances is a highly serious breach of welfare.  Most greyhound people are horrified by these actions, which are clearly animal abuse.  If full confidence is to be restored to the sport, the IGB cannot tolerate or cover up such events.  There should be a full ban on a trainer's licence and no transfer of the same licence to a family member.  </p><p> All novice greyhounds should be tested in first round of major unraced stakes, as heat winners are quite often sold for large sums of money.  In the case of any greyhound returning from Britain testing positive for any performance altering substance, the person in whose care the dog is should be fined.  If the offence is found to have been repeated, a ban should be enforced until the dog tests clear.  It should be published when the dog is cleared to run. </p><p> Payment of fines should be published and owners or trainers should not be allowed to run dogs again until the fine is paid.  Prize money should always be aimed at the many and not the few.  We are looking for a fair distribution of the prize money pool.</p><p> The grassroots of any sport should be recognised for what they are  - the lifeblood and backbone of the sport.  The rules must be clear, concise and adhered to fully.  No exceptions should be made for anyone if a performance-altering substance is found.  The penalty must act as a deterrent.  Specific drug teams of up to ten independent people should be available to test greyhounds.  In addition, it is vital to have an independent laboratory to which samples may be sent.  Positive and negative results should be published to prove that all samples have been tested.  This is absolutely vital to restore trust and confidence.</p><p> All of the above points I have raised are representative of the views of members of the Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland Group.  </p></speech>

Before calling on members for questions, I just want to declare for the record my own involvement in the greyhound industry.  I am a personal friend of the chairman of the Irish Greyhound Board.  I do not own any dogs.</p> <p>  I will call first on Deputy Penrose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#E00300"><p>I thank Ms McCann for her presentation.  The representatives of Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland are strong advocates of imposing strict penalties and sanctions.  Can McCann outline a range of sanctions that she feels would be appropriate?  Section 14 of the Bill is somewhat deficient in terms of sanctions, so Ms McCann could help the committee by outlining them.</p> <p>  Does she advocate the strict liability principle if, for example, a banned substance is found in the course of an investigation or test?  There could be a pre-race investigation or a test arising as a result of a race.  Whether a test if pre-race or post-race, a strict liability principle would presume that a positive result is an offence.  The onus would then shift to the owner or breeder, whoever is involved, to negative that and set out the reason a particular substance was found.  Is that what Ms McCann advocates and, if not, what system does she advocate as being the most appropriate?</p> <p>  Ms McCann mentioned absolute integrity in racing, which is very important for this committee as it considers the Greyhound Industry Bill 2017.  We all subscribe to the idea of absolute integrity and Ms McCann will not find anyone opposing that view in her presentation.  How can such a system be established, however?  It could become a legal quagmire unless a "do and don't" list is set out.  In the normal course of events things are black and white, but sometimes something may innocently appear.  If a dog is fed something which contains a contaminated substance, for example, then under the strict liability principle one is there.  As the saying goes: "Once you're explaining, you're losing."  One is losing because one will have to explain that.</p> <p>  Could Ms McCann outline the type of sanction regime she thinks should be in place in order to ensure that the integrity of the dog racing industry is sacrosanct?  She made an important point that the British authorities seem to be very alert to things when all is not kosher.  Does Ms McCann have evidence that this has had a significantly negative impact in terms of the industry going forward?</p> <p>  I thought that a lot of money had been spent on a laboratory in Limerick which was the be-all and end-all.  In fact, the Morris report placed a lot of emphasis on that, as Ms McCann's presentation mentioned.  I am glad she did.  If significant funding went into that laboratory as a first step, why is Ms McCann saying it may well be important to refer some cases - for example, if a dog does a super, abnormal time and the result does not stand up - to an independent laboratory outside this jurisdiction?  Is that what Ms McCann is advocating?  Why is she saying that in regard to record-breakers?</p> <p>  Could she expand on the idea of bitches being tested before retiring to become broods?  Is there any level of offence that warrants a full-time ban?  For example, some steroids are well known as being massive stimulants, so does their use warrant a full-time ban or a graded ban?  I appreciate that the sanction must be proportionate.  </p> <p>  Ms McCann referred to red flags appearing next to a dog's name on a race card, but for how long would such a flag appear?  If my dog has a problem and is red flagged for one race, will the red flag be carried on to the next race?  Does it cover a season or two years?  Will it be for six months, a year or two?  </p> <p>  Sports Ireland may impose a two-year or four-year ban on athletes.  The European sports arbitration body can either uphold such bans, or not, on appeal.  I would like Ms McCann to indicate what she has in mind, including time limits for bans and the nature of offences involved.  Is a gradation system involved and is there any offence for which a permanent ban would be warranted?</p> <p>  I absolutely concur with Ms McCann when she said: "Fines must be large enough to act as a deterrent.  Owners and trainers with multiple offences should be banned."  Why, however, is she referring to multiple offences?</p><p>In terms of multiple offences, anything more than two is multiple.  If three or four offences attract the maximum of the &euro;5,000 fine that is fair enough.  All penalties should act as a deterrent to make sure infringements do not happen.  It is very useful for the witnesses to come in.  I am interested in the reference to the independent laboratory.  It has been indicated that we must travel outside the jurisdiction.  Is that for specific areas or in general?  I thank the witnesses for the presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00200"><p>The witnesses are both very welcome.  It is useful to have people come in and give us a broad range of views on the Bill.  The greyhound industry has gone through much upheaval in recent years and we have been very aware of lobbies coming from all parts of the country to committee members and others in elected office on various issues, many of which have been raised today, especially in regard to doping and cheating the system.  I seek clarity on a couple of issues.  It was said that integrity is at the core of the group's focus, to the extent that it is included in the name of the organisation.</p> <p>  I am also interested in the new equipment in the lab in Limerick.  We have heard a great deal about the cost of the lab in Limerick, the total inefficiency, and its inability to provide any kind of useful service.  It does not seem to be able to test to the required levels and from what I have heard - the witnesses alluded to it in the opening statement - even if the best equipment was there if the people running it do not want to use the equipment properly or do the job properly it will not be done properly.  That seems to be the inference that was made by the witnesses and I would like them to clarify that.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned that the prize money should be aimed at the many and not the few and that there should be a fair distribution of prize money.  I would like to understand what exactly the witnesses mean by that.  Does it imply that there is some kind of golden circle or a little group that takes all and leaves the rest behind?  What exactly is meant by that?</p> <p>  I wish to follow on from what Deputy Penrose said.  What is the view of the witnesses on what can be done in terms of the level of sanction that is possible to deal with people who break the rules or consistently offend?  Witnesses from various organisations have come before the committee and one issue that has come up is the traceability of dogs and the position in that regard and the export of dogs to other countries.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on that matter also.</p> <p>  Previous witnesses mentioned the number of litters a bitch can have and what is appropriate.  I would like to hear the view of witnesses from the point of view of breeders because we have heard the animal welfare perspective.  I do not suggest breeders are not concerned with welfare but I refer to the animal welfare lobby specifically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  Some of the questions I wanted to ask have already been asked by other members.  I was interested to read in the opening statement about the work with Ms Forde and the good working relationship with her but then it was said that real progress has been disappointingly slow due perhaps to the fact that Ms Forde can no longer meet with the witnesses.  Could the witnesses expand a little on that?</p> <p>  I accept everything that has been said about integrity.  Head 21 of the Bill sets out the make up of the control committee and the criteria for people involved in it.  Do the witnesses think that is adequate in terms of providing for the integrity of the control committee and the work it does?</p> <p>  Reference is made on the second page of the presentation to an independent laboratory for sampling.  Is that independent of the Limerick laboratory and if that is the case why is the Limerick laboratory even there?</p> <p>  Head 14 proposes to remove the criminal sanction for breaches of the racing code and the intention is to replace it with financial penalties.  How do the witnesses feel about that?  Do they believe penalties are adequate or that the criminal sanction should be retained for people who interfere with dogs?</p> <p>  Last week when it was before the committee the ISPCA said its recommendation is that a bitch should have no more than five litters and the legislation proposes nine.  Do the witnesses have any views on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses here today and thank them for their presentation.  They have focused in particular on drugs and ensuring the matter is addressed.  It is important that under the legislation there is a system in place to ensure best practice and that the industry has a strong and credible track record.  Would the witnesses like to see any amendments to the structure of the Bill, as presented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David McGrath" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00500"><p>I will start with Deputy Penrose.  He asked a single question but he had about 12 different questions in it.  I will try to give him as brief a r&eacute;sum&eacute; as I can.  The first part of the question was about the type of substances, how they should be managed and if they should be managed differently.  It is important for the committee to know that we are owners and breeders and we represent owners and breeders who are focused on bringing transparency and integrity to the industry.  If the IGB had published all the negative tests it would be really helpful because people would understand that more than 99% of all tests that are taken are negative.  That is very reassuring to most people and it is very reassuring to us but that is a message that it not coming out.  It is the 1% of tests that are not negative that is the problem, and it is how those tests are managed.  Overall, 99% of dogs that are running and being tested are being run fair and square and you should know that the dog running next to you has tested negative but a small number of dogs are testing positive and they are undermining the integrity of the whole industry and that is a problem.</p> <p>  The first question Deputy Penrose asked was about the type of substances.  There is an attempt in the Bill to differentiate between prohibited substances and controlled substances.  Essentially, prohibited substances can never be present in the sample.  An example might be stanozolol, which is an anabolic steroid, a Ben Johnson-type anabolic steroid or cocaine.  They would be two very straightforward examples.  Neither of those drugs is licensed in Ireland in any veterinary situation so if stanozolol is used in a greyhound as an anabolic steroid it means it came into the country illegally and then it was administered to a dog.  It is not licensed by any medical or veterinary agency in Ireland.  We have to go back and say there is a small number of such cases but they undermine the integrity of the whole industry.  That is a very serious incident and from the point of view of our committee members any dog that tests positive for stanozolol should get a lifelong ban because that is an anabolic steroid and it gives an unfair advantage to the dog compared to any other dog and it cannot have got into the dog by any other method than being imported into this country and given to the dog.  The same is true of cocaine.  How else could cocaine have got into a dog other than it being imported illegally into the country, procured through some illegal source and given to a dog, horse or whatever it is?  It seems really clear to us that use of those prohibited substances should result in a lifelong ban for the greyhound running and it is also a serious issue for the person who administered it.  That is the serious end of the spectrum.</p> <p>  The Bill identifies the other group of substances as controlled substances, which may have got into a greyhound through any number of ways.  A greyhound might have had tonsillitis and been put on an antibiotic.  We can all understand that.  With advanced testing, maybe six weeks later a minuscule level of the antibiotic might show up in a specimen.  We could all understand and accept that is not going to affect the performance of the dog.  Similarly for anti-inflammatories, if a greyhound had an injury and was treated by the vet with an anti-inflammatory several weeks down the line that might show up at a very low level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.18" nospeaker="true" time="16:00:00" ><p>The board have now made an attempt to regulate this and make it more transparent.  It has introduced a medication booklet which is greatly appreciated.  Any vet who sees a dog now will be asked to fill in the medication that was prescribed on that day.  If a dog were tested six or eight weeks later and that came up in a hearing, it would be reflected in the hearing that the vet had prescribed the medication for a good veterinary reason.</p><p>There are two different situations: the prohibited substances and the controlled substances.  The member alluded to things coming through the feed chain.  There is some evidence that tiny residues of certain drugs can come through the food chain.  That is similar in horse racing.  As far back as the 1980s, Tied Cottage won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and he lost it subsequently because of a food contamination issue.  That is common across many sporting organisations.</p><p>The way to manage that is to have very low thresholds for these contaminants that can come into the system.  The issue is that certain contaminants have been found in greyhounds.  One was procaine four or five years ago.  Procaine is a local anaesthetic but it is also a cocaine-type analogue.  It can be prescribed as a local anaesthetic and in theory it could have come through the food chain.  Many dogs tested positive for procaine, however, details of the levels of procaine in the samples were never published, which was the critical thing.  One could imagine that very low levels of procaine could be residues of feeding or something like that, whereas one would not expect very high levels to come through the food chain.  One would expect the sanction to reflect the levels.</p><p>The member asked about strict liability.  We have a slightly different way of managing it than the GBGB does in the UK.  In the UK a person running a dog as a trainer or owner essentially becomes a member of a club and accepts the rules of the club when signing.  At the moment that is not how things are managed here under the 1957 Act and there is an opportunity to change things now.

I do not think anybody here would have any issue whatever with the staff working in the laboratory in Limerick.  I am sure they are very professional people.  They have been extremely professional in any dealings we have had with them.</p> <p>  A laboratory can only process the samples that arrive there.  It can only process samples in a way that they are advised by the board.  Laboratories do not devise tests.  The board issues to a laboratory the list of drugs to be tested.  That is how it should happen in any organisation; the governing body should inform the laboratory that is doing its testing as to what it should be looking for.</p> <p>  I do not think there is any issue with staff in Limerick, who are very professional people.  The issue really is with the sampling itself.  Even now if a sample is taken at a track we have no idea whether it is ever processed, which is a big issue.  People read of positive findings but never hear of the negative findings.  The only way to know that all the samples are processed at a track is for all samples taken to be reported as positive, negative or not processed.  It would be a great bonus to the integrity of the industry if all negative samples were published.  It is a really simple thing to do.  On most race nights, at least two dogs are sampled.  I ask Ms McCann to confirm that.</p></speech>

It is really simple to publish all the negative samples; it is just a matter of uploading the results on to the IGB website.  That would be a huge boost to the integrity of the industry.  It means that an owner who ran a dog in Enniscorthy, Youghal or Shelbourne Park that was tested along with other dogs, could go back two weeks later and see it printed up on the wall that his or her dog was negative and the other people's dogs were also negative, which gives a great boost to the industry.  As we know that 99% of the tests are negative, why do we not publish the negative results?</p> <p>  The issue with the lab is not really an issue with the lab itself.  There were some technical issues with the lab prior to the purchase of its current equipment.  However, it is really about what happens to the sample.  We do not know what percentage of the samples that are taken are tested.  The only ones we know about are the ones that turn up positive.</p></speech>

Until recently the sample would go to Limerick and we would never know whether that sample was positive or negative.  It is only for the past 18 months or 15 months that if a sample is positive, it is published on the IGB website under an adverse analytical finding.  Prior to that, it did not have to be published.  In fact, the control committee under its own rules only had to publish a positive finding as it saw fit; that was what was in its determinations.  Even if it went to the control committee it did not have to be published.  Publishing the adverse analytical findings is a welcome change and the control committee findings are also to be published.</p></speech>

It is a question of whether they are allowed to do their job or not.  That is really important.  I am sure they are excellent at their job; they are technically excellent people I am sure.  They have recently purchased new equipment.  One of the major issues was that the previous equipment they had could not test for a particular type of anabolic steroid, oil-based stanozolol.  Certain samples that went to Limerick could be found negative because they could not be tested for the steroid.<br/><br/>Irish dogs were going to England to run in big competitions, particularly the English Derby and were failing the test for stanozolol, which was very disquieting in Ireland.  People were running their dogs in big competitions on Saturday night in Shelbourne Park against these dogs and then those dogs were going to run in England in the English Derby.  They were passing their tests when running in Shelbourne Park on a Saturday night, and then going to Wimbledon and failing.  That did not inspire confidence in the industry here and led the GBGB to give a <i>caveat emptor</i>warning to people to be wary about buying dogs from Ireland that were testing positive in the UK while testing negative at home.</p></speech>

The lab, like any lab, will need to be continually upgraded.  Whether it is meldonium or any other drug, there is always a race to stay ahead of the testers.  It depends on how the lab is funded in future.  As it stands, I am sure it now has a state-of-the-art machine that, if it is allowed to do its work and the technicians are allowed to do their work, will be adequate.  Obviously, it will need to be upgraded as things go on.</p></speech>

Following enactment and implementation of this legislation a line will be drawn in the sand and we will be able to move on from all of the nonsense we have had up to now.  If there is need for a higher percentage of testing, with a set percentage of tests being sent to different laboratories to ensure integrity in the process, then that should be done.  However, providing for that in legislation will be a challenge.  It can be difficult to ensure we do not provide in legislation measures that are difficult to implement.  We will need to tease out this issue further before we can move forward.</p></speech>

In terms of the board being compromised, what we are saying is that it is important that the board lead from the top in terms of integrity.  In that regard, the Greyhound Act 1957 sets out rules that the board must follow but it has not been doing that in a number of situations, be that in regard to the length of time people have served on the board or the number of sessions people have served on the board and so on.  If the board itself is not implementing the Greyhound Act 1957 then it is difficult for it to police that Act.  Another big issue in terms of that Act is separation of the operation side of the industry from the integrity side.  In terms of horse racing, there are two separate organisations in the form of Horse Racing Ireland and The Turf Club.  There is a glaring anomaly in one of the heads of the Bill in relation to the definition of "club".  Head 15 deals with investigations by Greyhound Racing Ireland.  It provides that where Greyhound Racing Ireland considers that there are matters of concern to the club it may notify such matters to the club.  That, to me, appears to be a provision lifted from measures related to Horse Racing Ireland or The Turf Club.  It is similar to the dual control system in the UK.  I do not understand how it came to be included in this Bill because as far as I am aware there is no club in this area.</p></speech>

The agenda has been driven by the board for the first couple of fora.  No agenda was issued prior to any of the fora, rather it was laid out on the day.  I think we did have an agenda for the third forum.  The attendance of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, at the last forum gave the the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation, IGOBF, Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland, GRII, and other stakeholders a chance to communicate directly with the Minister, which was very helpful to us and, I think, the Minister of State.</p><p>He stayed for two and a half hours at that forum.  I am not saying the forum is hopeless but much more face-to-face contact is needed for getting business done or going into any kind of detail, such as we are able to do here with the committee.  Ms Forde was instrumental in driving Professor Morris to issue the Morris report.  We were very involved in that report.  We were interviewed for four hours in Limerick and had a lot of input into his evidence prior to him writing the report.  About 15 months ago, we were here at the launch of the committee's report on the horse and greyhound industries.  It was very disheartening for us that the Morris report was never actually published, although it was referenced in the committee's report.  At the launch, we asked the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle if the committee had actually seen the Morris report.  It had never been shown to the committee even though it was referenced in its report.  To his credit, Deputy Doyle gave an undertaking that he would put the Morris report into the Houses of the Oireachtas Library.  A few weeks later he was given ministerial responsibility for greyhounds and he went ahead and published the Morris report.  It was very helpful for all those who are involved in the welfare and integrity of greyhounds.  The Morris report is an extremely detailed, excellent piece of work.</p></speech>

The previous committee issued the report.  To my information, the Morris report was not published at the time the committee here was doing its business.  I am open to correction on that point.  That is my understanding as to why it was referenced rather than being specifically addressed.  Since then, the committee members have received copies of the Morris report but that was only in the past few months, as far as I remember.</p></speech>

The reference in the committee's report also stated, I think, that the committee fully supported the findings of the Morris report and that it would support its implementation.  That was without ever seeing the Morris report.  That is why the question was brought up at the time.</p></speech>

They have very extensive powers.  Our view has always been that the testing should really be one separate issue.  At the moment, the control stewards are doing a wonderful job.  Most of them are doing their best to try to police the situation.  It is very difficult.  They could be at Ms McCann's house in the afternoon marking up her pups and having a cup of tea, and then in the evening they could be testing samples on her dogs.  That is a very difficult position for them to be in.  It seems much more appropriate to have teams that just do the testing and leave the control stewards to manage the control of the industry.</p></speech>

A breeder is with a bitch seven days a week and knows her inside out.  For some bitches, two litters are nearly enough for them, while others could very easily go on to have nine litters, be as young and fresh delivering the ninth litter as the first, and rear the pups perfectly well.  Personally, I have to say I think nine litters are too many.  I do not know what Dr. McGrath or Ms Paula Hoban would think.  Can a bitch really put her all into a ninth litter?  I do not know.</p></speech>

I do not think it is really an issue with greyhound breeders.  I cannot imagine how many bitches in the country breed nine litters.  The vast majority of bitches breed zero litters and the majority of those that breed have three litters or less, I would say.  This is probably coming to the greyhound domain from other areas of dog breeding.  I do not think it is an issue.  I would be very interested to know from the Irish Coursing Club how many greyhound bitches actually bred an eighth or ninth litter last year.   I imagine it would be in the single figures.</p></speech>

This falls into that area.  Greyhounds are the most traceable dogs in the country.  Every greyhound has a microchip, an ear tattoo and an identity card.  There is no comparison with a dog in the street or in somebody's house.  The greyhounds are getting a bit caught up in the discussion of pet dog breeding issues.  A Sunday newspaper recently stated that some greyhound breeders in Ireland have 500 breeding bitches.  What was all that about?  That was in one of the main Sunday newspapers.  It was an article about puppy farms, which have nothing to do with greyhounds.  It does not represent what is happening on the ground.</p></speech>

A dog that tests positive for cocaine did not lick it up in the street.  How did that cocaine get into the possession of the person who gave it to the dog?  That information is already being passed on to the Garda and the Department of Agriculture.</p></speech>

Say, for example, that a supermarket or agricultural co-op sponsors a stake starting Thursday night in Enniscorthy for 24 greyhounds, with a winners' pool of &euro;2,650.  Say there is a greyhound entered that falls within the grades of A3 or A4, and is no better than A2 grade.  It could do its very best and maybe just barely qualify in the first two rounds.  It might win the semi-final and get &euro;50.  It would go on into the final but might then only get &euro;40 for being unplaced.  The people we represent might have a couple of greyhounds in training and may be a brood bitch.  Then again, after the last few years, fewer of them would have a brood bitch.  If the prize money was stepped up so that the heat winners got &euro;100 and dogs unplaced in the final got &euro;75 or &euro;80, it would keep the wheels turning and the show on the road for another week or two.  It has been pointed out to us that the &euro;50 does not cover a whole lot nowadays with microchipping and everything that has been introduced in the last few years.  We are not finding fault with microchipping; it is definitely good.  It is the law now and we abide by it.  However, it all incurs expense on the average owner.  That was our point.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to present the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill for the consideration of the select committee.</p> <p>  As Members will be aware from the debate on Second Stage, the main purpose of this Bill is to confer an explicit power on Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for inland fisheries offences.  It achieves this by amending the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 by the insertion of a specific provision that provides for the IFI to have the power to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under the Acts specified.</p><p>It will ensure that Inland Fisheries Ireland can fully enforce the inland fisheries Acts.  The Bill also makes some additional corrections to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 to ensure that minor omissions in that Act are fully resolved.</p><p> Before we discuss the individual sections, I wish to share the background to the Bill.  Inland Fisheries Ireland is the State agency responsible for the protection, conservation, development and promotion of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  Inland Fisheries Ireland was formed on 1 July 2010, following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards into a single agency.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment received advice from the Office of the Attorney General in February 2017 to the effect that Inland Fisheries Ireland does not have the power to bring prosecutions under the inland fisheries Acts.  It was advised that an explicit power to prosecute should be inserted in the 2010 Act as a matter of priority.  The impact of this advice is that until the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 is amended, prosecutions brought by Inland Fisheries Ireland for which proceedings have been initiated cannot be proceeded with.  There are approximately 150 cases that fall into this category.</p><p> In light of the advice received, the amendments to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 are being pursued as a matter of priority.  There are no amendments to the Bill.  The Bills Office advised that the single amendment tabled has been ruled out of order as, in the context of Standing Order 1793, it would involve a potential charge on the Revenue.</p><p> I look forward to a constructive debate and to the assistance of members in facilitating the Bill's early passage into law to safeguard our valuable fisheries resources.</p></speech>

I am concerned about how we arrived at this situation.  The explanation provided by the Minister of State and the Department as to how this problem arose in the first instance does not go far enough.  I had hoped to be able to table an amendment to the Bill, seeking a report on it, but I was caught unawares by the timing of Committee Stage and missed the deadline.  I will table an amendment on Report Stage requesting that a report on how the problem arose should be laid before both Houses.</p> <p>  I understand that the jurisdiction of Inland Fisheries Ireland to bring and prosecute summary proceedings before the District Court was raised with the Attorney General  in 2015.  It took almost two years for the opinion to reach the Department and for this Bill to be brought forward.  It is important that a full explanation of this issue should be provided to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

There was a court case in 2014 following an incident of pollution and a fish kill on the River Tolka.  Following that case, Inland Fisheries Ireland advised that a weakness had been highlighted in the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 in respect of its power to prosecute offences and that it was necessary to rectify this by means of a legislative amendment.  The original legal advice in 2015 was that Inland Fisheries Ireland's powers to prosecute were susceptible to challenge and that the Department should introduce amending legislation to confirm the powers of the organisation.  At that time the legal advice was that it would be achieved by way of an amending provision in the normal course, that was an amendment to the Inland Fisheries legislation that is ongoing in the Department.</p> <p>  Subsequently at a meeting on Thursday, 9 February 2017, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment were notified by the Office of the Attorney General that Inland Fisheries Ireland did not have the power to prosecute.</p><p>This necessitated a Bill and that is why we have fast-tracked this Bill since.</p></speech>

In 2010, when the amalgamation of the eight separate boards took place, this matter was not noticed.  We are where we are and the Minister of State has given an explanation.  The important thing is that the legislation moves on.  The existing gap is not in anyone's interest, be they angling clubs, tourism interests or environmentalists.  It is not in anyone's interest to allow a situation to continue where people destroy fish stocks and cause harm to the rivers that affects local bailiffs and local fishing clubs.  This matter has caused problems throughout the country.  We must push on with legislation in the interests of this resource and local communities.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle's point was well made.  It is now 2017 and seven years have elapsed.  I was curious to learn the sequence of events that had led to this situation.  We have the legislation in front of us and we should move it on.</p></speech>

We do not need to go into the preamble again.  I need to leave the meeting for approximately 15 minutes at 4.45 p.m. to go to the D&aacute;il, so I suggest Deputy Martin acts as Chairman during that time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I am also conscious the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has to leave to go to the D&aacute;il at 4.25 p.m, but I ask that the committee conclude this meeting by 5 p.m.  We appreciate the fact the Ministers and their officials have come back to us for a second time and I ask that questions be brief, focused and based on the briefing material.  At the last meeting, we strayed into areas of policy and I ask that we not do that today because every member is at liberty to table parliamentary questions.  We can arrange further meetings on matters of policy with the Ministers and their officials.</p> <p>  I ask members, officials and those in the public Gallery to please ensure that their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of this meeting which has been convened to resume consideration of the Revised Estimates for Vote 26 - Education and Skills.  We will start with programme B because we completed programme A at our last meeting.  This was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee with an instruction to report back.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and their officials and thank them for the open and constructive dialogue with the committee secretariat's financial scrutiny team in developing the briefing documents for this meeting.  I remind the Ministers that the committee agreed at the last meeting to proceed programme by programme and we will initially focus on specific subheads before broaching any questions on the remainder of the programme.  I refer again to the briefing document prepared by the financial scrutiny team of the committee's secretariat to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimates.  We will resume on programme B.  The Minister made his opening remarks at the last meeting and we do not need to go through those again.  We will go straight to subhead B5 on grants to SOLAS and further education and training.</p> <p>  I invite members to ask questions.</p></speech>

What is the position in regard to emphasising apprenticeships and traineeships at post-school level as opposed to PLC courses and general types of further education?  Is there a plan there?  Has the Minister set out any kind of a strategy on this?</p></speech>

The objective is to reach between 40,000 and 50,000 new apprenticeships.  At one stage, before the recession, there were approximately 30,000 to 32,000 apprenticeships, which came all the way down to approximately 2,500 to 3,000.  This figure covered apprenticeships at all levels, including basic apprenticeships, and there are many reasons for this drop.  The objective is to bring the number past the 30,000, which it was in the past.  For instance, there are already 2,400 places in existing traineeships and 800 registrations for new apprenticeships for 2017 alone.  There were no questions on the FET programme but I would like to inform members there have been 320,000 beneficiaries of this programme across a wide range of provisions, both part-time and full-time, from levels 1 to 6.  If Deputy Thomas Byrne wants any information, I will get him the booklet explaining everything in the action plan.  There will be a much wider range of apprenticeships on offer as a result of new calls for proposals over the next few years. One such call went out only last week.  I met a business group today, which I cannot name, and it was asking for a new call for apprenticeships in the business in which it is in.  I am confident we will reach the proposed target by 2020.</p></speech>

There is a combination of apprenticeships.  The programme for Government, as the Deputy knows, includes a commitment to increase the cumulative number of apprenticeships to 31,000.  There are a number of new apprenticeships.</p><p>What we do is we regularly call to businesses, and it would not be unusual for a particular business group to ask to meet either the Minister for Education and Skills or myself.  We both believe apprenticeships are needed within the industry.  That applies to the basic apprenticeships, for example, plasterers or bricklayers, right up to the new apprenticeships we recently launched with insurance brokers and companies.  We are getting calls from businesses right across the board.  We are able to fill the apprenticeships based on the quota and it looks very positive for the next number of years.</p></speech>

The committee recognises that it is hugely important for a modern economy that we do all we can to help support skills development and the skills development system.  </p> <p>  Regarding subhead B5, the metrics are very useful in terms of looking at this.   There were 12 key high level metrics for programme B, nine of these alone related to the National Training Fund, and only one related, partly, to this particular allocation.  Despite the numbers mentioned, there was a decrease in the target for the number of further education and training beneficiaries, although there was an increase in allocation.  The Minister of State can come back to this at a later point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017051600002#B00300"><p>I will.  Deputy Thomas Byrne spoke about it.  The new apprenticeship we started is the insurance practitioner apprenticeship, which has a big take-up.  There are also two further programmes, for example, one is in the international financial services, the IFS, which is interesting.  The point the Chairman makes is that because there appears to be fewer people unemployed, the take-up among those who are unemployed will be a little less.  The biggest take-up for apprenticeships, in particular for basic and starting apprenticeships, has essentially been from people coming from an unemployment base.  It is not that the number has dropped, but that it has dropped  in a particular group, that is, the unemployed.  There has been a bigger uptake from that, however.</p></speech>

Subhead B9 addresses the Regional Skills Fora.  Can the Minister advise if each forum has a specific budget for the provision of programmes or initiatives to further its aims, and can the Minister advise as to the size of these budgets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017051600002#B00600"><p>The delivery of the Regional Skills Fora is through the mainstream providers, so it is still the education and training boards, the institutes of technology or the colleges which provide.  The Regional Skills Fora is a move to establish more clearly what needs there are, to create a greater connection and to develop programmes through partnerships with local enterprise.  There are some very good examples of where that has been done.  Cavan-Monaghan, where a traineeship was developed with one of the very prominent agricultural engineering companies, is one such excellent example.  The role of the fora at this stage is to try to build that bridge to enterprise.  They are not budget holders in that sense.  Their role is to identify what is on offer, identify what is needed and then to try to adapt one to the other.  We recently had the first meeting of the National Skills Fora and there is wide recognition that this is an area with real potential.  We have not yet built connections to the provision, but there is scope there to do that.</p></speech>

It is predicted that there will be a surplus of over &euro;270 million at the end of 2017.  Has there been any consideration of applying some of that funding, if possible, to the alleviate the crisis we have in third level?</p></speech>

We are currently discussing increasing the contribution to the training fund from 0.7% to 1%, which would provide additional money that would, in turn, be deployed to contribute to higher education and to apprenticeships.  While the fund carries a surplus we cannot just spend that surplus.  It is still within the Exchequer ceilings that we have to agree with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not have the flexibility to just spend more from the fund because it still has to be approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the normal budgetary process.  It is like a surplus in the Social Insurance Fund in that it still has to be deployed by a budgetary decision.  We envisage wanting to use more money from this area for these purposes but to do so, we need to increase the contribution to the fund.</p></speech>

Is he satisfied with that and with the drop in the international rankings that has resulted from the terrible level of funding in this sector?  What exactly is being proposed to deal with this?  Having set us the task of looking at the Cassells report, the Minister appears to be doing some work parallel to this that was not apparent until he was questioned in the D&aacute;il.  Will the Minister expand on this as well?</p></speech>

Some students appeared before this committee in the past year who are really struggling and doing their best to get through third level, but need access to the SUSI grants.  </p> <p>  The Fine Gael manifesto mentioned &euro;100 million of additional funding just to stand still.  What supports there are fall way short of what is needed to significantly boost the standing of the sector.  I would ask the Minister to address this.</p></speech>

This is a little too late, however, given that funding per student has fallen by over 20%.  The institutes of technology are experiencing a funding crisis and there is talk of redundancies in at least one institute.  Can the Minister confirm that there will be no forced redundancies in this sector and can he advise on the implementation of the Cush report?  Can the Minister also advise on how much of the current general grant to universities is spent on pay?</p></speech>

One thing that struck us was that the CAO form does not specify that these colleges are not covered by SUSI grants.  That places students and their families in a particular situation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017051600002#C00200"><p>There are a number of questions there.  This year, for the first year in about ten years, we have increased the funding to higher education.  We have recognised that a funding deficit had built up over a number of years.  There had been virtually no new funding for a decade, along with a declining amount of Exchequer funding which was partly compensated by rising student grants over an extended period.  This meant that while student numbers grew, the cost per student came down, and that undoubtedly put a funding squeeze on the colleges.  In order to redress that, we have put in place investment this year, and we also have secured from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform a commitment that there will be a demographic element in our funding formula.  This means that as colleges expand their student numbers in the coming years, as wholly envisaged by the Cassells's report, we will see an increasing Exchequer contribution, something they lacked throughout that period.  On top of that, as I mentioned to Deputy Catherine Martin, we have introduced consultation on a new source of funding, namely, an employer contribution, which was one of the elements recommended by Peter Cassells in his report and by the group he led.  Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to idea of an income contingent loan, and I have always acknowledged that there needs to be a political consensus on this issue before we can move forward with it.  My Department is doing the prudent thing and is preparing the ground should the Oireachtas decide that this is something we would like to go ahead with.  We are putting the necessary framework in place for this idea to be implemented and have thought through what it would take to do so.  That is all that has been done.  We have not commissioned expensive outside work.  What we have is a group looking at how this idea would work in practical terms should the Oireachtas decide to go with it.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan said that funding is insufficient.  What is encouraging is that the recently published performance framework for the third level colleges showed improvements across all of the indicators, including quality indicators and indicators such as their success in extending recruitment to people from disadvantaged backgrounds, people with disabilities and mature students, and their capacity to win additional research funding.  There is a whole matrix of performance indicators.  This last period, despite being very constrained, showed very significant progress by the third level institutions.  Like many parts of the education system, there is no doubt that third level did things above and beyond at a time of crisis, and has had very significant achievements.  That, as recognised by everyone, is not an option for the future.  We have to plan on the basis of continued expansion and the new challenges ahead.  Our third level sector is not perfect in every dimension.  It has had some very big successes but there are other areas in need of improvement.  That is the context in which we have committed to this investment trajectory, and we want to work with it to achieve more.</p> <p>  On the issue of private colleges and those who enrol in them, this would mark a significant change from the existing programme and would need a significant budgetary provision.  At the moment, SUSI grants apply only to approved programmes in approved institutions and, by in large, it follows a very competitive CAO process for gaining access and so on.  The private colleges are obviously fee-paying, for-profit colleges, and are a different type of institution.  Policy to date has not been to extend the student supports to private colleges.  I know the case has been made for this, but there are pros and cons that we would have to evaluate in terms of whether we take the step of going beyond the publicly funded colleges, with their known types of enrolment and attractions, to supporting for-profit colleges, and this would have to be done in a budgetary context.  This would be a sales element in their approach.  There is a for and against - I am not saying I am coming down on either side - that we would have to weigh up in public policy terms.</p> <p>  In terms of numbers, 80,000 students are supported on these grants and this year we have been able to extend them in a small way to postgraduate grants at the lowest level of income support.  However, this scheme has not been reviewed in a number of years and I suppose people will have to decide what is the priority here in terms of what we do with scarce grant funding for grants.  Do we look at extending the grant to private colleges or do we look at people who are coming into the system at a huge disadvantage and try to improve their terms of access?  There are choices here - I am not trying to prejudge them - that would have to be made in a budgetary context.</p></speech>

In the event of a hard Brexit, we may have to cater for these extra numbers.  Approximately 2,000 of those students currently avail of SUSI grants.</p></speech>

Obviously, the hope and expectation is to protect the common travel area which would leave their studies uninterrupted.  It is also the ambition of the British colleges to leave them uninterrupted, but the Chairman is right, and this is a contingency we have been looking at.</p></speech>

There has been reduction from &euro;8.4 million to &euro;6.4 million.  What are the reasons for this particular reduction?  Has there been a reduction in teacher training places?  Where have the savings been made?</p></speech>

In regard to budgetary allocations, I had a meeting with principals in my constituency of Kildare South last Monday week and one of the key things they felt was needed was far more training in the teacher training colleges and afterwards around mental health, supporting positive mental health in schools, special needs and autistic spectrum disorder, ASD.</p><p>Increasingly, mainstream schools have more children with special needs in an inclusive setting, and rightly so.  A higher budget needs to be allocated for the training colleges to provide the appropriate training for teachers at that point, and this should be carried through to when those teachers are teaching.  They need to be given adequate resources and supports at that time.</p></speech>

It is because the Church of Ireland College of Education, which had been separately funded, is now funded through DCU due to its incorporation there, in that it has merged into a new college operating out of St. Patrick's as part of DCU.  I will get the figures for the Deputy but, to my knowledge, there is no reduction in the number being educated from year to year.</p> <p>  The Chairman made a good point about the investment in upskilling across the system.  While we do not want to stray into matters of policy, this is an area that deserves more thought.  There is a role for the training colleges, but much of the upskilling and in-service training is run through the education training centres, which recruit experts to deliver programmes.  I will provide the details of the programmes that are being delivered in the mental health area and the special needs area.  The Chairman is right that an investment in the area of upskilling is worthy of assessment in regard to whether we are up to best practice and what else we could do.</p> <p>  A positive development committee members might have read about is that we launched a postgraduate programme for principals which is to be jointly delivered by the University of Limerick, NUI Galway, UCD and Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  It is a bit of a pillar in the ground in that it is a programme for principals at work to upskill themselves, in part through distance learning.  There is a good case to be made in this regard and I will get some of the raw data for the committee.</p></speech>

For the Minister's information, we had a committee session around the whole area of positive mental health and we invited a number of witnesses.  We will be in the process of finalising our report to the Minister in the coming weeks and we look forward to sending that on to him for his observations.</p> <p>  We now move to programme D, capital services, which is on page 26 of our briefing.

I do not expect the Minister to talk about individual transactions, although if he can, all the better, because it is a lot of money.  I want to make clear that we support the provision of schools and we understand the predicament in which the Minister finds himself with regard to finding sites for schools.  How much of the capital budget is being eaten into by land costs?  This seems a massive amount of money, and while I understand the Department is forced to pay such an amount in that part of Dublin, is this having an impact on the building of schools?  Is the Department looking at the whole issue of land costs and what can be done about it?  There is also the question of what needs to be done beyond the Department.  I do not think it is sustainable that sites are bought for that amount of money because it eats into the Department's budget for building schools.</p></speech>

However, I have not heard much about it recently and I wonder whether it is still being used to the same extent.  It certainly seemed to be a very good use of money.</p> <p>  I am conscious that subhead D3 also provides for grants towards rental of temporary school premises, and I presume this means prefabs.  It was stated policy a short few years ago to get rid of all temporary accommodation, particularly prefabs, because the amount of money that has been expended on prefabs in the past 20 years is exorbitant.  It would seem that, with better forward planning, we should be in a position not to have those temporary buildings.  I will not say they are a waste of money because it is important students have an adequate place in which to be educated, but at the same time, it would seem not to be the appropriate way of allocating resources.</p></speech>

As members can imagine, land costs fell off and even halved at one point in 2013, but they have increased substantially since then.  This is taking up a little more than one twentieth of the budget but that figure is rising and it can wax and wane, depending on the year.

We continue to increase the number of places we are providing.  Last year we provided 22,288 places, so when compared with the previous year's 19,300 places, we increased the number of places by 3,000 in the year.  It is becoming more expensive, both due to building costs and site costs, but we are getting additional budget to respond to population pressures.  Nonetheless, this does inhibit our ability to do other things, which is just the way it is.</p> <p>  There has been a very significant reduction in the number of prefabs.  In December 2011, there were 1,525 rented prefabs and that figure dropped to 950 in December 2016.  As part of the six-year capital plan, there is a programme to unwind that and to move on.  That will start in 2019, so it is further down the road.</p> <p>  The devolved building programme is still very much alive and well, with 182 projects last year and 179 the previous year.  It is still there and there is also the new model of rapid build, so there is an effort to speed up that process and different models are being tried out to deal with that.</p></speech>

When the Department provides a new school for an existing national or voluntary school that is in the ownership of a patron, what happens the ownership of the old school building or old school site if the original school has moved on?

That would be the arrangement in most of these cases.  More recently, I understand that new schools are not being built on patron's sites - they are being built on State sites where we have full ownership, which gives us that additional flexibility.

The rumour is that a hotel is moving in, although I cannot verify that.  There should be some programme in the Department to examine this matter, because they all have a value.  It would seem to me that if the Minister is providing a new school and a new site, as he is now in many cases simply because sites are unaffordable and most of the newer patrons do not have any land-banks, surely it would significantly help the Department's capital budget, as a condition for providing the new school, to take over the old site and sell it to reimburse the coffers.</p></speech>

Sometimes there is a lack of consultation with local communities about the proposed use of an old school.  I have, however, seen really good results.  For example, in Rathangan where I am from, the old vocational school became a day care centre.  Step-down housing was also built for old people, which was fantastic.  The new boys' school is due to be opened on 16 June this year.  They moved from a boys' school that was built 30 years ago and which has been flattened.  It is interesting to note that we have an old boys' school which was built around the 1850s that is still in use for a community purpose.  It is regrettable that more exploration was not done with the community on possible uses for a building.  To be fair, part of the reason was that it was for a sports field.  There was a use for the land but there could have been more negotiation on the idea of providing adjacent land and using the building for something else.  I just wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

Obviously, if an old school had a future use we would pursue that.  If an old building had very limited value at that stage, we had a lien on the building and the land was in the patron's ownership, we would have very little by way of an asset to pursue.  As regards the issue of whether we can deploy them for community purposes, which would be outside the terms of the lien, that would have to be re-examined on its merits.  The land, however, would still be in private ownership.</p> <p>  These are arrangements which predate all of us.  The model then was that the land was owned by the patron, the building was built by the State and they put a lien on the use of the building.  It is therefore a question of when the change arises.  The Department has to evaluate what value it can recover and how best to deploy that for educational purposes.  The approach taken is that each case would be decided on its merits.</p></speech>

Should there not be some arrangement, however, simply to help replenish the coffers?  If the State is going to provide a new school site and replace a school building, we should be asking the patron to sign over the existing building when all that is done and we would then monetise it, or secure money for it which would contribute towards building the new premises.</p></speech>

Most new schools will be built on greenfield sites where we might have a competition for the patron.  We would then own the school and the site, which would be a different situation whereby we retain ownership.  Where there is an old, disused school and we are moving to a new site, the Department would look afresh at that in order to protect the taxpayer's interest.</p></speech>

It would certainly seem appropriate to look at further educational use if a building is being deployed for a particular reason.  If not, however, a possible further community use should be the fall-back position.</p> <p>  I think we have concluded this part of the meeting, so I wish to thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and their officials for attending the meeting.  We appreciate their attendance here.  I know that they will come back to the members on particular issues.  </p> <p>  I would like to ask Deputy Byrne and Deputy Martin some quick question, if they do not mind.  This is the first time we have used the briefing document prepared by the financial scrutiny team.  They went to a lot of trouble to use extensive charts and graphs in presenting the financial and performance-related information.  Do the Deputies feel that has been of benefit and, if so, is that way in which we should proceed?  </p></speech>
