    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eilis McCann" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#D00300"><p>Dr. David McGrath, Ms Paula Hogan, who is in the Visitors Gallery, and I are here on behalf of Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland.  To give a short history of our group, Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland was formed by owners, breeders and trainers of track greyhounds who were becoming increasingly aware of a perceived drugging problem in performing dogs.  Members are predominantly but not exclusively from the south-east of Ireland.  There appeared to be a culture of altering the performance of certain greyhounds, that is, slowing them for trials and subsequently &quot;driving&quot; them for races.  There was widespread concern that cover-ups were the norm when certain dogs were tested and their samples proved positive for banned substances.  As the group grew, we established an excellent working relationship with Ms Geraldine Larkin, former CEO, and Ms Hilary Forde, head of racing and governance of the Irish Greyhound Board.  Ms Forde attended our AGM and also liaised on our behalf to have our committee included in discussions with Professor Morris, who gave us a very generous hearing and mentioned our proposals in his report.<br/><br/>We are delighted to say the IGB took on board the majority of our proposals, including out-of-competition testing, sales testing, publishing of analytical findings, increased security in kennelling areas and increased testing on all dogs of kennels where there have been multiple positive findings.  Sales of Irish greyhounds were suffering due to the perceived low image of our dogs, so much so that the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, the British governing authority, issued more or less an ultimatum stating <i>caveat emptor</i>, or buyer beware, and that if one is going to buy Irish dogs, one should proceed very cautiously.  To us, that truly was an insult and a slur.  In the past, Irish greyhounds enjoyed the respect of a worldwide sporting audience.  With a concerted effort from all stakeholders, they can soon resume their rightful place at the top of the racing world.  Latterly, real progress has been disappointingly slow, due perhaps to the fact Ms Forde can no longer meet with us, unless at a forum which is organised by the IGB.<br/><br/>The ordinary owner feels that the credibility of the current board is compromised as it is felt that it does not keep its own rules.  We appreciate the opportunity to come here today to meet with Oireachtas Members and we appeal to those in power to strive to provide a level playing field for all involved in this wonderful sport.</p><p> The following are our proposals.  Integrity is at the core of every successful sport, therefore, those involved at all levels must be people of the highest integrity.  Rules must be implemented with the welfare of the greyhound taking precedence, to the benefit of all, not just the few.</p><p> As regards the purchase of new equipment for the laboratory in Limerick, if tests are covered up, this purchase is a total waste of money.  Time-finding and time-losing dogs are to be tested and results are to be published.  Stud dogs are to be fully tested before a litter is sired and findings published.  Without this breeders are taking a shot in the dark, which is a very costly move in some cases. </p><p> As regards greyhounds that break track records, before the record is ratified that dog should be sampled and the results published.  The same goes for bitches who are going to retire to the breeding paddocks.  A case can definitely be made that they also need to have their full history logged publicly.</p><p> The control committee has to be truly independent without any conflict of Interest.  Is this currently the case?  Classic winners' and track record breakers' samples should be taken and sent to an independent laboratory, for example, in Newmarket.</p><p> Fines must be large enough to act as a deterrent.  Owners and trainers with multiple offences should be banned.  The minimum fine should be &euro;5,000.  The same should apply to those whose dogs test positive for steroids, cocaine, etc.  A red flag should appear by their names on the race card. </p><p> The administration of such substances is a highly serious breach of welfare.  Most greyhound people are horrified by these actions, which are clearly animal abuse.  If full confidence is to be restored to the sport, the IGB cannot tolerate or cover up such events.  There should be a full ban on a trainer's licence and no transfer of the same licence to a family member.  </p><p> All novice greyhounds should be tested in first round of major unraced stakes, as heat winners are quite often sold for large sums of money.  In the case of any greyhound returning from Britain testing positive for any performance altering substance, the person in whose care the dog is should be fined.  If the offence is found to have been repeated, a ban should be enforced until the dog tests clear.  It should be published when the dog is cleared to run. </p><p> Payment of fines should be published and owners or trainers should not be allowed to run dogs again until the fine is paid.  Prize money should always be aimed at the many and not the few.  We are looking for a fair distribution of the prize money pool.</p><p> The grassroots of any sport should be recognised for what they are  - the lifeblood and backbone of the sport.  The rules must be clear, concise and adhered to fully.  No exceptions should be made for anyone if a performance-altering substance is found.  The penalty must act as a deterrent.  Specific drug teams of up to ten independent people should be available to test greyhounds.  In addition, it is vital to have an independent laboratory to which samples may be sent.  Positive and negative results should be published to prove that all samples have been tested.  This is absolutely vital to restore trust and confidence.</p><p> All of the above points I have raised are representative of the views of members of the Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland Group.  </p></speech>

Before calling on members for questions, I just want to declare for the record my own involvement in the greyhound industry.  I am a personal friend of the chairman of the Irish Greyhound Board.  I do not own any dogs.</p> <p>  I will call first on Deputy Penrose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#E00300"><p>I thank Ms McCann for her presentation.  The representatives of Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland are strong advocates of imposing strict penalties and sanctions.  Can McCann outline a range of sanctions that she feels would be appropriate?  Section 14 of the Bill is somewhat deficient in terms of sanctions, so Ms McCann could help the committee by outlining them.</p> <p>  Does she advocate the strict liability principle if, for example, a banned substance is found in the course of an investigation or test?  There could be a pre-race investigation or a test arising as a result of a race.  Whether a test if pre-race or post-race, a strict liability principle would presume that a positive result is an offence.  The onus would then shift to the owner or breeder, whoever is involved, to negative that and set out the reason a particular substance was found.  Is that what Ms McCann advocates and, if not, what system does she advocate as being the most appropriate?</p> <p>  Ms McCann mentioned absolute integrity in racing, which is very important for this committee as it considers the Greyhound Industry Bill 2017.  We all subscribe to the idea of absolute integrity and Ms McCann will not find anyone opposing that view in her presentation.  How can such a system be established, however?  It could become a legal quagmire unless a "do and don't" list is set out.  In the normal course of events things are black and white, but sometimes something may innocently appear.  If a dog is fed something which contains a contaminated substance, for example, then under the strict liability principle one is there.  As the saying goes: "Once you're explaining, you're losing."  One is losing because one will have to explain that.</p> <p>  Could Ms McCann outline the type of sanction regime she thinks should be in place in order to ensure that the integrity of the dog racing industry is sacrosanct?  She made an important point that the British authorities seem to be very alert to things when all is not kosher.  Does Ms McCann have evidence that this has had a significantly negative impact in terms of the industry going forward?</p> <p>  I thought that a lot of money had been spent on a laboratory in Limerick which was the be-all and end-all.  In fact, the Morris report placed a lot of emphasis on that, as Ms McCann's presentation mentioned.  I am glad she did.  If significant funding went into that laboratory as a first step, why is Ms McCann saying it may well be important to refer some cases - for example, if a dog does a super, abnormal time and the result does not stand up - to an independent laboratory outside this jurisdiction?  Is that what Ms McCann is advocating?  Why is she saying that in regard to record-breakers?</p> <p>  Could she expand on the idea of bitches being tested before retiring to become broods?  Is there any level of offence that warrants a full-time ban?  For example, some steroids are well known as being massive stimulants, so does their use warrant a full-time ban or a graded ban?  I appreciate that the sanction must be proportionate.  </p> <p>  Ms McCann referred to red flags appearing next to a dog's name on a race card, but for how long would such a flag appear?  If my dog has a problem and is red flagged for one race, will the red flag be carried on to the next race?  Does it cover a season or two years?  Will it be for six months, a year or two?  </p> <p>  Sports Ireland may impose a two-year or four-year ban on athletes.  The European sports arbitration body can either uphold such bans, or not, on appeal.  I would like Ms McCann to indicate what she has in mind, including time limits for bans and the nature of offences involved.  Is a gradation system involved and is there any offence for which a permanent ban would be warranted?</p> <p>  I absolutely concur with Ms McCann when she said: "Fines must be large enough to act as a deterrent.  Owners and trainers with multiple offences should be banned."  Why, however, is she referring to multiple offences?</p><p>In terms of multiple offences, anything more than two is multiple.  If three or four offences attract the maximum of the &euro;5,000 fine that is fair enough.  All penalties should act as a deterrent to make sure infringements do not happen.  It is very useful for the witnesses to come in.  I am interested in the reference to the independent laboratory.  It has been indicated that we must travel outside the jurisdiction.  Is that for specific areas or in general?  I thank the witnesses for the presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00200"><p>The witnesses are both very welcome.  It is useful to have people come in and give us a broad range of views on the Bill.  The greyhound industry has gone through much upheaval in recent years and we have been very aware of lobbies coming from all parts of the country to committee members and others in elected office on various issues, many of which have been raised today, especially in regard to doping and cheating the system.  I seek clarity on a couple of issues.  It was said that integrity is at the core of the group's focus, to the extent that it is included in the name of the organisation.</p> <p>  I am also interested in the new equipment in the lab in Limerick.  We have heard a great deal about the cost of the lab in Limerick, the total inefficiency, and its inability to provide any kind of useful service.  It does not seem to be able to test to the required levels and from what I have heard - the witnesses alluded to it in the opening statement - even if the best equipment was there if the people running it do not want to use the equipment properly or do the job properly it will not be done properly.  That seems to be the inference that was made by the witnesses and I would like them to clarify that.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned that the prize money should be aimed at the many and not the few and that there should be a fair distribution of prize money.  I would like to understand what exactly the witnesses mean by that.  Does it imply that there is some kind of golden circle or a little group that takes all and leaves the rest behind?  What exactly is meant by that?</p> <p>  I wish to follow on from what Deputy Penrose said.  What is the view of the witnesses on what can be done in terms of the level of sanction that is possible to deal with people who break the rules or consistently offend?  Witnesses from various organisations have come before the committee and one issue that has come up is the traceability of dogs and the position in that regard and the export of dogs to other countries.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on that matter also.</p> <p>  Previous witnesses mentioned the number of litters a bitch can have and what is appropriate.  I would like to hear the view of witnesses from the point of view of breeders because we have heard the animal welfare perspective.  I do not suggest breeders are not concerned with welfare but I refer to the animal welfare lobby specifically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  Some of the questions I wanted to ask have already been asked by other members.  I was interested to read in the opening statement about the work with Ms Forde and the good working relationship with her but then it was said that real progress has been disappointingly slow due perhaps to the fact that Ms Forde can no longer meet with the witnesses.  Could the witnesses expand a little on that?</p> <p>  I accept everything that has been said about integrity.  Head 21 of the Bill sets out the make up of the control committee and the criteria for people involved in it.  Do the witnesses think that is adequate in terms of providing for the integrity of the control committee and the work it does?</p> <p>  Reference is made on the second page of the presentation to an independent laboratory for sampling.  Is that independent of the Limerick laboratory and if that is the case why is the Limerick laboratory even there?</p> <p>  Head 14 proposes to remove the criminal sanction for breaches of the racing code and the intention is to replace it with financial penalties.  How do the witnesses feel about that?  Do they believe penalties are adequate or that the criminal sanction should be retained for people who interfere with dogs?</p> <p>  Last week when it was before the committee the ISPCA said its recommendation is that a bitch should have no more than five litters and the legislation proposes nine.  Do the witnesses have any views on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses here today and thank them for their presentation.  They have focused in particular on drugs and ensuring the matter is addressed.  It is important that under the legislation there is a system in place to ensure best practice and that the industry has a strong and credible track record.  Would the witnesses like to see any amendments to the structure of the Bill, as presented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David McGrath" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017051600002#F00500"><p>I will start with Deputy Penrose.  He asked a single question but he had about 12 different questions in it.  I will try to give him as brief a r&eacute;sum&eacute; as I can.  The first part of the question was about the type of substances, how they should be managed and if they should be managed differently.  It is important for the committee to know that we are owners and breeders and we represent owners and breeders who are focused on bringing transparency and integrity to the industry.  If the IGB had published all the negative tests it would be really helpful because people would understand that more than 99% of all tests that are taken are negative.  That is very reassuring to most people and it is very reassuring to us but that is a message that it not coming out.  It is the 1% of tests that are not negative that is the problem, and it is how those tests are managed.  Overall, 99% of dogs that are running and being tested are being run fair and square and you should know that the dog running next to you has tested negative but a small number of dogs are testing positive and they are undermining the integrity of the whole industry and that is a problem.</p> <p>  The first question Deputy Penrose asked was about the type of substances.  There is an attempt in the Bill to differentiate between prohibited substances and controlled substances.  Essentially, prohibited substances can never be present in the sample.  An example might be stanozolol, which is an anabolic steroid, a Ben Johnson-type anabolic steroid or cocaine.  They would be two very straightforward examples.  Neither of those drugs is licensed in Ireland in any veterinary situation so if stanozolol is used in a greyhound as an anabolic steroid it means it came into the country illegally and then it was administered to a dog.  It is not licensed by any medical or veterinary agency in Ireland.  We have to go back and say there is a small number of such cases but they undermine the integrity of the whole industry.  That is a very serious incident and from the point of view of our committee members any dog that tests positive for stanozolol should get a lifelong ban because that is an anabolic steroid and it gives an unfair advantage to the dog compared to any other dog and it cannot have got into the dog by any other method than being imported into this country and given to the dog.  The same is true of cocaine.  How else could cocaine have got into a dog other than it being imported illegally into the country, procured through some illegal source and given to a dog, horse or whatever it is?  It seems really clear to us that use of those prohibited substances should result in a lifelong ban for the greyhound running and it is also a serious issue for the person who administered it.  That is the serious end of the spectrum.</p> <p>  The Bill identifies the other group of substances as controlled substances, which may have got into a greyhound through any number of ways.  A greyhound might have had tonsillitis and been put on an antibiotic.  We can all understand that.  With advanced testing, maybe six weeks later a minuscule level of the antibiotic might show up in a specimen.  We could all understand and accept that is not going to affect the performance of the dog.  Similarly for anti-inflammatories, if a greyhound had an injury and was treated by the vet with an anti-inflammatory several weeks down the line that might show up at a very low level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.18" nospeaker="true" time="16:00:00" ><p>The board have now made an attempt to regulate this and make it more transparent.  It has introduced a medication booklet which is greatly appreciated.  Any vet who sees a dog now will be asked to fill in the medication that was prescribed on that day.  If a dog were tested six or eight weeks later and that came up in a hearing, it would be reflected in the hearing that the vet had prescribed the medication for a good veterinary reason.</p><p>There are two different situations: the prohibited substances and the controlled substances.  The member alluded to things coming through the feed chain.  There is some evidence that tiny residues of certain drugs can come through the food chain.  That is similar in horse racing.  As far back as the 1980s, Tied Cottage won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and he lost it subsequently because of a food contamination issue.  That is common across many sporting organisations.</p><p>The way to manage that is to have very low thresholds for these contaminants that can come into the system.  The issue is that certain contaminants have been found in greyhounds.  One was procaine four or five years ago.  Procaine is a local anaesthetic but it is also a cocaine-type analogue.  It can be prescribed as a local anaesthetic and in theory it could have come through the food chain.  Many dogs tested positive for procaine, however, details of the levels of procaine in the samples were never published, which was the critical thing.  One could imagine that very low levels of procaine could be residues of feeding or something like that, whereas one would not expect very high levels to come through the food chain.  One would expect the sanction to reflect the levels.</p><p>The member asked about strict liability.  We have a slightly different way of managing it than the GBGB does in the UK.  In the UK a person running a dog as a trainer or owner essentially becomes a member of a club and accepts the rules of the club when signing.  At the moment that is not how things are managed here under the 1957 Act and there is an opportunity to change things now.

I do not think anybody here would have any issue whatever with the staff working in the laboratory in Limerick.  I am sure they are very professional people.  They have been extremely professional in any dealings we have had with them.</p> <p>  A laboratory can only process the samples that arrive there.  It can only process samples in a way that they are advised by the board.  Laboratories do not devise tests.  The board issues to a laboratory the list of drugs to be tested.  That is how it should happen in any organisation; the governing body should inform the laboratory that is doing its testing as to what it should be looking for.</p> <p>  I do not think there is any issue with staff in Limerick, who are very professional people.  The issue really is with the sampling itself.  Even now if a sample is taken at a track we have no idea whether it is ever processed, which is a big issue.  People read of positive findings but never hear of the negative findings.  The only way to know that all the samples are processed at a track is for all samples taken to be reported as positive, negative or not processed.  It would be a great bonus to the integrity of the industry if all negative samples were published.  It is a really simple thing to do.  On most race nights, at least two dogs are sampled.  I ask Ms McCann to confirm that.</p></speech>

It is really simple to publish all the negative samples; it is just a matter of uploading the results on to the IGB website.  That would be a huge boost to the integrity of the industry.  It means that an owner who ran a dog in Enniscorthy, Youghal or Shelbourne Park that was tested along with other dogs, could go back two weeks later and see it printed up on the wall that his or her dog was negative and the other people's dogs were also negative, which gives a great boost to the industry.  As we know that 99% of the tests are negative, why do we not publish the negative results?</p> <p>  The issue with the lab is not really an issue with the lab itself.  There were some technical issues with the lab prior to the purchase of its current equipment.  However, it is really about what happens to the sample.  We do not know what percentage of the samples that are taken are tested.  The only ones we know about are the ones that turn up positive.</p></speech>

Until recently the sample would go to Limerick and we would never know whether that sample was positive or negative.  It is only for the past 18 months or 15 months that if a sample is positive, it is published on the IGB website under an adverse analytical finding.  Prior to that, it did not have to be published.  In fact, the control committee under its own rules only had to publish a positive finding as it saw fit; that was what was in its determinations.  Even if it went to the control committee it did not have to be published.  Publishing the adverse analytical findings is a welcome change and the control committee findings are also to be published.</p></speech>

It is a question of whether they are allowed to do their job or not.  That is really important.  I am sure they are excellent at their job; they are technically excellent people I am sure.  They have recently purchased new equipment.  One of the major issues was that the previous equipment they had could not test for a particular type of anabolic steroid, oil-based stanozolol.  Certain samples that went to Limerick could be found negative because they could not be tested for the steroid.<br/><br/>Irish dogs were going to England to run in big competitions, particularly the English Derby and were failing the test for stanozolol, which was very disquieting in Ireland.  People were running their dogs in big competitions on Saturday night in Shelbourne Park against these dogs and then those dogs were going to run in England in the English Derby.  They were passing their tests when running in Shelbourne Park on a Saturday night, and then going to Wimbledon and failing.  That did not inspire confidence in the industry here and led the GBGB to give a <i>caveat emptor</i>warning to people to be wary about buying dogs from Ireland that were testing positive in the UK while testing negative at home.</p></speech>

The lab, like any lab, will need to be continually upgraded.  Whether it is meldonium or any other drug, there is always a race to stay ahead of the testers.  It depends on how the lab is funded in future.  As it stands, I am sure it now has a state-of-the-art machine that, if it is allowed to do its work and the technicians are allowed to do their work, will be adequate.  Obviously, it will need to be upgraded as things go on.</p></speech>

Following enactment and implementation of this legislation a line will be drawn in the sand and we will be able to move on from all of the nonsense we have had up to now.  If there is need for a higher percentage of testing, with a set percentage of tests being sent to different laboratories to ensure integrity in the process, then that should be done.  However, providing for that in legislation will be a challenge.  It can be difficult to ensure we do not provide in legislation measures that are difficult to implement.  We will need to tease out this issue further before we can move forward.</p></speech>

In terms of the board being compromised, what we are saying is that it is important that the board lead from the top in terms of integrity.  In that regard, the Greyhound Act 1957 sets out rules that the board must follow but it has not been doing that in a number of situations, be that in regard to the length of time people have served on the board or the number of sessions people have served on the board and so on.  If the board itself is not implementing the Greyhound Act 1957 then it is difficult for it to police that Act.  Another big issue in terms of that Act is separation of the operation side of the industry from the integrity side.  In terms of horse racing, there are two separate organisations in the form of Horse Racing Ireland and The Turf Club.  There is a glaring anomaly in one of the heads of the Bill in relation to the definition of "club".  Head 15 deals with investigations by Greyhound Racing Ireland.  It provides that where Greyhound Racing Ireland considers that there are matters of concern to the club it may notify such matters to the club.  That, to me, appears to be a provision lifted from measures related to Horse Racing Ireland or The Turf Club.  It is similar to the dual control system in the UK.  I do not understand how it came to be included in this Bill because as far as I am aware there is no club in this area.</p></speech>

The agenda has been driven by the board for the first couple of fora.  No agenda was issued prior to any of the fora, rather it was laid out on the day.  I think we did have an agenda for the third forum.  The attendance of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, at the last forum gave the the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation, IGOBF, Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland, GRII, and other stakeholders a chance to communicate directly with the Minister, which was very helpful to us and, I think, the Minister of State.</p><p>He stayed for two and a half hours at that forum.  I am not saying the forum is hopeless but much more face-to-face contact is needed for getting business done or going into any kind of detail, such as we are able to do here with the committee.  Ms Forde was instrumental in driving Professor Morris to issue the Morris report.  We were very involved in that report.  We were interviewed for four hours in Limerick and had a lot of input into his evidence prior to him writing the report.  About 15 months ago, we were here at the launch of the committee's report on the horse and greyhound industries.  It was very disheartening for us that the Morris report was never actually published, although it was referenced in the committee's report.  At the launch, we asked the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle if the committee had actually seen the Morris report.  It had never been shown to the committee even though it was referenced in its report.  To his credit, Deputy Doyle gave an undertaking that he would put the Morris report into the Houses of the Oireachtas Library.  A few weeks later he was given ministerial responsibility for greyhounds and he went ahead and published the Morris report.  It was very helpful for all those who are involved in the welfare and integrity of greyhounds.  The Morris report is an extremely detailed, excellent piece of work.</p></speech>

The previous committee issued the report.  To my information, the Morris report was not published at the time the committee here was doing its business.  I am open to correction on that point.  That is my understanding as to why it was referenced rather than being specifically addressed.  Since then, the committee members have received copies of the Morris report but that was only in the past few months, as far as I remember.</p></speech>

The reference in the committee's report also stated, I think, that the committee fully supported the findings of the Morris report and that it would support its implementation.  That was without ever seeing the Morris report.  That is why the question was brought up at the time.</p></speech>

They have very extensive powers.  Our view has always been that the testing should really be one separate issue.  At the moment, the control stewards are doing a wonderful job.  Most of them are doing their best to try to police the situation.  It is very difficult.  They could be at Ms McCann's house in the afternoon marking up her pups and having a cup of tea, and then in the evening they could be testing samples on her dogs.  That is a very difficult position for them to be in.  It seems much more appropriate to have teams that just do the testing and leave the control stewards to manage the control of the industry.</p></speech>

A breeder is with a bitch seven days a week and knows her inside out.  For some bitches, two litters are nearly enough for them, while others could very easily go on to have nine litters, be as young and fresh delivering the ninth litter as the first, and rear the pups perfectly well.  Personally, I have to say I think nine litters are too many.  I do not know what Dr. McGrath or Ms Paula Hoban would think.  Can a bitch really put her all into a ninth litter?  I do not know.</p></speech>

I do not think it is really an issue with greyhound breeders.  I cannot imagine how many bitches in the country breed nine litters.  The vast majority of bitches breed zero litters and the majority of those that breed have three litters or less, I would say.  This is probably coming to the greyhound domain from other areas of dog breeding.  I do not think it is an issue.  I would be very interested to know from the Irish Coursing Club how many greyhound bitches actually bred an eighth or ninth litter last year.   I imagine it would be in the single figures.</p></speech>

This falls into that area.  Greyhounds are the most traceable dogs in the country.  Every greyhound has a microchip, an ear tattoo and an identity card.  There is no comparison with a dog in the street or in somebody's house.  The greyhounds are getting a bit caught up in the discussion of pet dog breeding issues.  A Sunday newspaper recently stated that some greyhound breeders in Ireland have 500 breeding bitches.  What was all that about?  That was in one of the main Sunday newspapers.  It was an article about puppy farms, which have nothing to do with greyhounds.  It does not represent what is happening on the ground.</p></speech>

A dog that tests positive for cocaine did not lick it up in the street.  How did that cocaine get into the possession of the person who gave it to the dog?  That information is already being passed on to the Garda and the Department of Agriculture.</p></speech>

Say, for example, that a supermarket or agricultural co-op sponsors a stake starting Thursday night in Enniscorthy for 24 greyhounds, with a winners' pool of &euro;2,650.  Say there is a greyhound entered that falls within the grades of A3 or A4, and is no better than A2 grade.  It could do its very best and maybe just barely qualify in the first two rounds.  It might win the semi-final and get &euro;50.  It would go on into the final but might then only get &euro;40 for being unplaced.  The people we represent might have a couple of greyhounds in training and may be a brood bitch.  Then again, after the last few years, fewer of them would have a brood bitch.  If the prize money was stepped up so that the heat winners got &euro;100 and dogs unplaced in the final got &euro;75 or &euro;80, it would keep the wheels turning and the show on the road for another week or two.  It has been pointed out to us that the &euro;50 does not cover a whole lot nowadays with microchipping and everything that has been introduced in the last few years.  We are not finding fault with microchipping; it is definitely good.  It is the law now and we abide by it.  However, it all incurs expense on the average owner.  That was our point.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to present the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill for the consideration of the select committee.</p> <p>  As Members will be aware from the debate on Second Stage, the main purpose of this Bill is to confer an explicit power on Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for inland fisheries offences.  It achieves this by amending the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 by the insertion of a specific provision that provides for the IFI to have the power to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under the Acts specified.</p><p>It will ensure that Inland Fisheries Ireland can fully enforce the inland fisheries Acts.  The Bill also makes some additional corrections to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 to ensure that minor omissions in that Act are fully resolved.</p><p> Before we discuss the individual sections, I wish to share the background to the Bill.  Inland Fisheries Ireland is the State agency responsible for the protection, conservation, development and promotion of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  Inland Fisheries Ireland was formed on 1 July 2010, following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards into a single agency.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment received advice from the Office of the Attorney General in February 2017 to the effect that Inland Fisheries Ireland does not have the power to bring prosecutions under the inland fisheries Acts.  It was advised that an explicit power to prosecute should be inserted in the 2010 Act as a matter of priority.  The impact of this advice is that until the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 is amended, prosecutions brought by Inland Fisheries Ireland for which proceedings have been initiated cannot be proceeded with.  There are approximately 150 cases that fall into this category.</p><p> In light of the advice received, the amendments to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 are being pursued as a matter of priority.  There are no amendments to the Bill.  The Bills Office advised that the single amendment tabled has been ruled out of order as, in the context of Standing Order 1793, it would involve a potential charge on the Revenue.</p><p> I look forward to a constructive debate and to the assistance of members in facilitating the Bill's early passage into law to safeguard our valuable fisheries resources.</p></speech>

I am concerned about how we arrived at this situation.  The explanation provided by the Minister of State and the Department as to how this problem arose in the first instance does not go far enough.  I had hoped to be able to table an amendment to the Bill, seeking a report on it, but I was caught unawares by the timing of Committee Stage and missed the deadline.  I will table an amendment on Report Stage requesting that a report on how the problem arose should be laid before both Houses.</p> <p>  I understand that the jurisdiction of Inland Fisheries Ireland to bring and prosecute summary proceedings before the District Court was raised with the Attorney General  in 2015.  It took almost two years for the opinion to reach the Department and for this Bill to be brought forward.  It is important that a full explanation of this issue should be provided to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

There was a court case in 2014 following an incident of pollution and a fish kill on the River Tolka.  Following that case, Inland Fisheries Ireland advised that a weakness had been highlighted in the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 in respect of its power to prosecute offences and that it was necessary to rectify this by means of a legislative amendment.  The original legal advice in 2015 was that Inland Fisheries Ireland's powers to prosecute were susceptible to challenge and that the Department should introduce amending legislation to confirm the powers of the organisation.  At that time the legal advice was that it would be achieved by way of an amending provision in the normal course, that was an amendment to the Inland Fisheries legislation that is ongoing in the Department.</p> <p>  Subsequently at a meeting on Thursday, 9 February 2017, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment were notified by the Office of the Attorney General that Inland Fisheries Ireland did not have the power to prosecute.</p><p>This necessitated a Bill and that is why we have fast-tracked this Bill since.</p></speech>

In 2010, when the amalgamation of the eight separate boards took place, this matter was not noticed.  We are where we are and the Minister of State has given an explanation.  The important thing is that the legislation moves on.  The existing gap is not in anyone's interest, be they angling clubs, tourism interests or environmentalists.  It is not in anyone's interest to allow a situation to continue where people destroy fish stocks and cause harm to the rivers that affects local bailiffs and local fishing clubs.  This matter has caused problems throughout the country.  We must push on with legislation in the interests of this resource and local communities.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle's point was well made.  It is now 2017 and seven years have elapsed.  I was curious to learn the sequence of events that had led to this situation.  We have the legislation in front of us and we should move it on.</p></speech>

We are starting later than we had anticipated.  I am sorry about that but am looking forward to having a timely and efficient briefing from all the witnesses.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode because they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report on the meeting.</p><p>The purpose of today's meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders who have made submissions, for which I thank them, to assist the committee regarding our review of the skills and apprenticeship schemes.  This will be an exciting event.  We are conscious that the effective development of a skills system and apprenticeship model is hugely important in helping to prepare young people for employment.  We have had a good deal of engagement with universities and other third level institutions and we believe more emphasis needs to be put on the development of skills and apprenticeships to suitably equip young people with the skills they need to go out into the world and seek suitable employment.</p><p>On behalf of the committee I welcome the following witnesses to today's meeting: Tim Fenn and Michael Vaughan of the Irish Hotels Federation; Des Murphy and Martin G. O'Brien of Education and Training Boards Ireland; Michael Hourihan of Cork Institute of Technology; Andrew Smith of the Building &amp;amp; Allied Trades Union; Tom Parlon, former esteemed Member of this House, and Dermot Carey, both of the Construction Industry Federation; as well as Paul O'Toole and Dr. Mary-Liz Trant of SOLAS.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise the witnesses that their opening statements and submissions to the committee will be published on the committee's website this afternoon.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call Mr. Fenn to make his opening statement.  I advise everybody that while we asked for briefing documents and opening statements, we suggest to the witnesses that they curtail their opening remarks to five minutes.  We will hear from representatives of the different groups following which members will have the opportunity to ask questions or seek clarification on matters.</p></speech>

We have submitted a detailed document and I will now endeavour to cover the main points in the next five minutes.<br/><br/>The IHF is the national representative organisation of the hotel and guest house sector in Ireland.  As a key stakeholder in Irish tourism, we work with our industry partners to ensure the right conditions are in place for tourism to grow and prosper, thereby contributing to recovery and job creation in the economy.<br/><br/>Tourism is one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industries.  In 2016, tourism generated total revenues of &euro;8.25 billion for the economy and accounted for 4% of gross national product.  It contributed an estimated &euro;1.9 billion in taxes to the Exchequer.  Having supported the creation of over 50,000 new jobs during the past five years, tourism now employs more than 220,000 people throughout the country, which is equivalent to 11% of total employment.  The industry is creating approximately 10,000 additional new jobs each year.  The IHF plays an active role in developing strategies for sustainable training to address this growing demand.  We promote excellence in human resource management and development across the hotels sector and support innovation in attracting, motivating and developing employees at all levels.  This includes working with State agencies and education providers at a national level to develop appropriate training and education models for the industry.<br/><br/>On behalf of the IHF, Michael Vaughan, on my left, currently chairs the hospitality skills oversight group, which was established by Government last year to monitor progress on the implementation of recommendations of the report by the expert group on future skills needs.  This oversight group provides a valuable forum for ongoing collaboration among industry stakeholders and State bodies.<br/><br/>With regard to career opportunities in tourism and hospitality, with tourism now on track to create a further 40,000 new jobs by 2021, the industry offers tremendous employment and development opportunities for people across a variety of skills levels, backgrounds and interests, particularly for young people entering the labour market.  Career paths include chefs, accommodation assistants, receptionists, positions in food and beverage, sales and marketing, personnel management, catering, leisure centre management and roles in management, IT and finance.  The industry, however, now faces serious challenges in sourcing suitably qualified staff with the right skills, including an annual requirement to recruit 3,000 qualified employees at craft level.  <br/><br/><b></b>With regard to promoting careers in tourism and hospitality, the federation works closely with our industry partners and State bodies to increase awareness of the wealth of employment opportunities in Irish tourism.  In September 2016, the IHF and the Irish Hospitality Institute, IHI, launched a national tourism careers programme in partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to highlight the many career entry options available.  The programme, which is being run in close collaboration with tourism and hospitality businesses, is designed to enable second level students aged between 15 to 18 to explore the full range of exciting career paths and educational and training options available throughout the country.  The programme includes tourism insight,<b></b>which is an interactive online programme for students and teachers; the Get a Life in Tourism<b></b>magazine, copies of which were given to members; student work experience programmes; and school talks and career events, which industry professionals attend.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to education and training requirements, a wide range of third level courses in tourism and hospitality are provided throughout the country, particularly by the institutes of technology, IOTS.  However, they do not fully satisfy industry requirements for semi-skilled labour, particularly in certain areas of culinary preparation.  The expert group on future skills needs documented the shortage of suitably qualified chefs in Ireland and the wider economy. The group projected that the hospitality sector will require approximately 13,000 extra chefs by 2020.  This skills shortage should be addressed through a greater focus on apprenticeships and other forms of work-based learning.<br/><br/>With regard to the development of culinary apprenticeships, although the IOTs currently train in excess of 1,300 chefs annually, their output is quickly absorbed across many diverse areas of hospitality and catering.</p><p>To address the significant shortfall, the Irish Hotels Federation has been working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, SOLAS and industry partners to devise a commis chef apprenticeship programme that will provide an alternative training mechanism for trainees to develop and progress their culinary skills.  The programme has been designed to meet the skill needs of employers, while delivering sustainable careers and high-quality training experiences for apprentices.  This development is supported by the hospitality industry consortium, a steering group formed by the IHF that consists of representatives from various hospitality and catering bodies, including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hospitality Institute, Euro-toques Ireland, the Catering Management Association of Ireland, training providers such as the education and training boards and institutes of technology, as well as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and SOLAS.  The consortium has specifically sought and considered the views of learners and, accordingly, consulted existing learners in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board.  The IHF has also engaged with SIPTU which has expressed support for the apprenticeship and earn-and-learn model of training.  This dedicated culinary apprenticeship programme will deliver a clear route for apprentice commis chefs to obtain a recognised trade qualification.</p><p> We aim to have the apprenticeship programme ready to commence later this year.  On successful completion of the programme after two years, apprentices will qualify as commis chefs certified at level 6 of the national framework of qualifications.  Those who wish to continue studies will be eligible to progress to the chef de partie apprenticeship programme at level 7.  This will provide for a seamless progression for graduates from commis chef level to higher level qualifications.  On successful completion, graduates will be eligible to progress to further training at levels 8 and 9.</p><p> The IHF has also been working in partnership with SOLAS and the ETBs to develop a national framework of career traineeship programmes that will lead to recognised qualifications at levels 4 to 6.  A total of five trainee programmes in the hospitality sector have been piloted by the education and training boards and SOLAS.  The pilot programmes have been supported by an advisory group that includes the federation and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  To date, the programmes have had 45 attendees, of whom 82% were employed after completion.  Of these, 21 trainees were employed in the host company, ten were employed in other hotels, while six trainees were employed in another sector.</p><p> We have a commitment to training and education.  The IHF is a strong advocate in support of developing national skills programmes that deliver high-quality training and education experiences for employees in the tourism and hospitality industry, while meeting the skill needs of employers.  We are committed to continuing to play an active role in developing apprenticeship and traineeship schemes that support the transition of young people from education to employment to enable them to take full advantage of the career opportunities in the industry.  We call for a detailed review of the training and education requirements of the tourism and hospitality sector to be carried out with a view to agreeing a comprehensive long-term plan of action to tackle the current deficiencies and provide greater clarity on how future requirements will be met.  We recommend that a dedicated national programme be put in place for hospitality training and education to be overseen by a tourism and hospitality training directorate set up within SOLAS.  This would involve greater collaboration with the industry and better use of existing resources from the ETBs, VECs and IOTs.</p><p> I again thank the Chairman for giving us the opportunity to participate in this review by the committee of the role of apprenticeships and skill schemes.  We will endeavour to answer questions committee members may raise.</p></speech>

As the representative body for Ireland's 16 education and training boards which are the main providers of further education and training and developing interesting apprenticeships, our view is based on many years of experience and operations in the sector.  I will outline our views for the committee.</p> <p>  In line with the national skills strategy 2025, the action plan to expand apprenticeship and traineeship and the current programme for Government aim to significantly grow work-based learning in the next five years using apprenticeship and traineeship modes of learning and skills development, the programmes formally combine alternate company-based training with centre or college-based education and training and lead to nationally recognised qualifications on successful completion.  There is considerable stakeholder agreement in Ireland and throughout Europe on the benefits to society of an effective work-based learning model of training directly linked with enterprise or industry.  The quality of apprenticeships is important.  It is important to ensure the provision of apprentices with high levels of skills continues to be a top priority as the range of apprenticeships and traineeships grows and expands.  Currently, our apprenticeship system is recognised as a world leader.  It is important not to lose sight of this as we try to roll it out further.</p> <p>  It is critical for the future of skill-based training in Ireland to retain the work-based learning element of the current system.  This will require investment in the development and maintenance of the infrastructure to ensure the quality involvement of employers in the process.  There will be a need to transfer resources to support the expansion of apprenticeships and traineeships.  It is essential that this reform is not seen as a means of cutting costs.</p> <p>  We have identified that progression routes are key.  Those entering an apprenticeship or traineeship should be able to see, at whatever level they enter, exactly how they may progress to higher education.  This will require close collaboration between the higher education and further education and training sectors.  With the representatives of the institutes of technology, the Technological Higher Education Association and the ETBI are working to put together a policy.  We also need to build progression and transfer routes between traineeships and apprenticeships.  Ultimately, graduates of any education and training programme should have clear routes to higher levels in the qualifications framework without having to retrace their steps.  This is critical if we are to convince the parents of Ireland and career guidance teachers that this is an alternative route that does not have stops or blockages.</p> <p>  Attracting, incentivising and supporting employers are all important.  If Ireland is to achieve its goal of expanding the range of apprenticeships and the number of young people opting for apprenticeships, it must attract more employers, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, that may never have been involved in apprenticeships.  Crucial supports to incentivise and support employers should include a coherent programme to promote the benefits of apprenticeships to employers, as well as incentives for employers, SMEs, in particular, to encourage involvement in apprenticeships.  The potential use of the national training fund should be looked at.  Start-up kits and information and administrative toolkits for prospective hosts of apprentices are important.  A service to facilitate the matching of aspiring apprentices with those seeking to host apprentices is critical.  Some who may not come from a craft background may not know the rules.  Currently, an apprentice needs a sponsor or an employer in order to be taken on.  Establishing quality frameworks and professional development opportunities for those who provide on-the-job support and training for apprentices is important.  In parallel, there is an urgent need to improve career guidance for apprenticeships and traineeships.  We need to amend the eligibility requirements for traineeships, in particular.  The lifting of the current restrictions to allow young people under the age of 25 years who have left formal education for more than four months to take up traineeships and qualify for a training allowance would be a practical way for the State to meet its obligations under the Youth Guarantee scheme, while providing opportunities for these young people to become skilled and gain sustainable employment.  Currently, qualification is based on ability or whether a person is in receipt of a Department of Social Protection allowance, regardless of whether he or she receives a payment.</p> <p>  Raising the minimum entry standards for apprenticeships is another option that we believe would raise the status of apprenticeships.  It may also be expected to raise the standards of those who complete their apprenticeships successfully.  We need alternative routes to apprenticeship for those who do not thrive in the senior cycle.  A two-year pre-apprenticeship programme based on the apprenticeship model should be put in place.  Those who successfully complete this programme would qualify for entry to a full apprenticeship programme.  There is also the potential for early school leavers to undertake a traineeship in an area suited to their aptitudes and aspirations.  On successful completion, the potential to progress to a related apprenticeship should be provided for.  There also appears to be real potential for accelerated transfers between traineeships and apprenticeships, especially in the construction industry, and for many other proposed new apprenticeships.  We are keen for the models to complement one another rather than replacing apprenticeships or crafts by traineeships.</p> <p>  ETBI believes education and training boards have the potential, if appropriately resourced, to play a leading role in the provision of cost-effective off-the-job training for apprentices and trainees across a wide range of career areas and in the communities where the apprentices and trainees reside in every parish and town in Ireland.  However, resourcing the further education and training sector appropriately, especially in the areas of recruitment and retention of suitably qualified staff and access to state-of-the-art training facilities and equipment, is crucial if the sector is to support work-based learning in 21st century industry and commerce.</p><p>ETBs can provide pre-apprenticeship programmes, traineeships and apprenticeship programmes on a nationwide basis in their schools, colleges and centres of education, which are located in nearly every Irish community, so trainees and apprentices could receive their off-the-job training locally.  This goes back to the tradition of the VECs when they were set up.  </p><p> ETBs could expand their already existing capacity to oversee and quality-assure the on-the-job phases of new training initiatives as they come on-stream.  It should be possible to generate economic synergies between the existing FET and institute of technology programmes and an expanded apprenticeship programme: the potential savings to the trainees or apprentices, their families and the State through the provision of off-the-job training programmes in local centres; the possible use of IoT teaching and training facilities for the provision of off-the-job training at times when these facilities are not being used for third-level students; the possible use of ETB schools and centres to provide off-the-job education and training at times when these facilities are not being used for mainstream education purposes; the possible redeployment of some staff currently delivering FET and third-level programmes to provide off-the-job training to apprentices; potential for up-skilling some ETB staff to support enterprises involved in apprenticeship or traineeship programmes; and savings due to the reduction in welfare payments currently made to young people should be diverted to support traineeship and apprenticeship training.</p><p> It should be possible to harvest other synergies between mainstream education and training and the reformed apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.</p><p> A significant proportion of future jobs will be neither particularly high-tech, nor towards the top end of the occupational ladder but all jobs, at all levels, will require increasingly higher levels of knowledge, skill and competences.  The big skills challenge for Ireland will be in the provision of low and medium skills and qualifications &ndash; in further education and training, where an effective work-based learning model can play a vital role.  I believe we can answer this call.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Mary-Liz Trant, who is the SOLAS executive director with responsibility for skills development.</p> <p>  In the broadest sense, skills are an essential requirement for every person, and society as a whole, and are integral to success, both in economic and social terms.  In the words of Angel Gurria, secretary general of OECD, "skills have become the global currency of the 21st century".  </p> <p>  Skills formation of individuals happens in many ways; through personal experience and development, in the workplace and, of course, through education and training.  In Ireland, the Department of Education and Skills leads on this aspect of skills formation in conjunction with the education bodies, such as the 16 education and training boards, and supported by its agencies, including SOLAS.</p> <p>  The role of SOLAS is to plan, co-ordinate and fund further education and training, FET, utilising the resources provided by the Department of Education and Skills.  Provision is largely delivered by education and training boards and includes programmes such as apprenticeships, traineeships, post leaving certificate courses, literacy and numeracy programmes and community education.</p> <p>  The nature and aims of FET provision are guided by the action plan for education, the national skills strategy and other Government policies.  The central ambition of the action plan for education is that Ireland&rsquo;s education and training system will be the best in Europe within ten years and FET intends to make a full contribution to realising this goal.  SOLAS is working in partnership with the public sector, employers and the community and social inclusion sector to deliver improved outcomes and experiences for FET learners across the spectrum of provision.</p> <p>  As referenced already, FET provision embraces a wide range of programmes that have been designed for many different types of learner and learning environment.  Apprenticeship is one such programme and given the focus of this meeting of the committee, I will concentrate on this aspect of FET in the remainder of this opening statement.</p> <p>  Apprenticeship is defined as a programme of structured education and training which formally combines and alternates learning in the workplace with learning in an education and training centre.  Apprenticeship is employer led, and every apprenticeship starts with a training employment contract with an employer.  Apprenticeship registrations have made a welcome recovery in recent years, principally in the traditional craft apprenticeships.  These numbers are expected to increase significantly; both in these existing craft apprenticeships and as the number of available apprenticeships expands through implementation of the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016 to 2020, which was launched by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, in January this year.  This plan sets out an ambition to register 31,000 new apprentices in the period 2016 to 2020.  This would see an increase in annual registrations; from a low of 1,200 in 2010 to over 9,000 in 2020.</p> <p>  Achieving this increase will require strong collaboration between employers and the relevant State agencies, including SOLAS, the Higher Education Authority and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  Good progress is now being made with five new apprenticeships launched in recent months, a further 19 in development and a new public call for apprenticeship proposals being made earlier this month. </p> <p>  SOLAS has a number of responsibilities in respect of apprenticeships.  As the statutory body for apprenticeship, we are responsible for enabling economic sectors to undertake apprenticeship programmes through the provision of statutory instruments termed industrial training orders; we are responsible for ensuring that employers meet the required conditions to recruit apprentices and for maintaining a register and supporting these apprentices.  We achieve this through designated authorised officers in each of the 16 education and training boards; with regard to the existing 25 craft apprenticeship programmes, we are the co-ordinating provider.  We work with employer bodies, trade unions, education and training providers and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that these programmes remain up to date in terms of their curriculums and teaching methodologies.  </p> <p>  With regard to new apprenticeships, we collaborate with the Department of Education and Skills, the apprenticeship council - to which we provide a secretariat - the Higher Education Authority and Quality and Qualifications Ireland in our shared responsibility to advance the introduction of new apprenticeships.  We provide a range of supports to the consortiums of employer groups and providers who lead the individual new apprenticeships.  All apprenticeship programmes are subject to validation by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p> <p>  Apprenticeship is one of the oldest and most durable forms of learning.  Its essence, which is the skills formation of individual apprentices through their "master" or employer passing on their skills, is as relevant today as it has been over the centuries of apprenticeship systems around the world.  The Irish apprenticeship system has demonstrated its worth for many decades, including, for example, through our continuing successful participation in the World Skills Competitions.  Having come through a difficult period during the recent recession, this system is on a welcome upward trajectory, both in the existing craft apprenticeships and the new ones which have already been introduced or are in gestation. </p> <p>  SOLAS is confident the ambitious targets for apprenticeship are achievable through employer demand and commitment, with the necessary accompanying support and investment of Government and its associated State bodies.</p></speech>

Having begun my own apprenticeship in the late 1970s, then moving on to apprenticeship education in the early 1990s, I feel that I am in a unique position to comment on this topic in a meaningful and focussed manner.  Furthermore, I have been involved in the World Skills Competitions for the past 17 years I have a good understanding of the education and training of apprentices from all over the world.</p> <p>  The traditional Irish apprenticeship system is excellent.  Since 2003 at the World Skills Competitions 74% of the Irish competitors who have travelled to competition have won medals.  At the competitions we regularly hear positive comments about our competitors and we receive regular requests for joint training sessions with Irish competitors.  Furthermore, Irish trades qualifications are recognised and respected all over the world and, as we are all aware, Irish tradespeople have no problem getting work when they travel abroad.  It is important to note that myself and other colleagues in the higher education system do not view apprenticeship provision or other skills schemes referenced in this discussion as alternatives to higher education programmes provided by the CAO system.</p><p>Rather, higher education institutes such as Cork Institute of Technology regard apprenticeship and skills schemes as an integral part of the higher education system.  Institutes of technology, for example, provide phases four and six off-the-job training for the majority of the existing 27 craft apprenticeship programmes and all the off-the-job training for the new higher education apprenticeship programmes.  Unfortunately, from my experience many leaving certificate students, their parents and some career guidance teachers do not know how the Irish apprenticeship system works, including, for example, how to get an apprenticeship, how long an apprenticeship lasts for, what trades are available and sometimes even what is involved in the individual trades or what the job actually is.  The view is that apprenticeship leads only to a trade qualification and that following the leaving certificate, the only real option is to look at the CAO system.  Nothing is further from the truth.</p><p> It should be noted that standard CAO entry to higher education is not for everyone, as is highlighted by high drop-out rates in certain disciplines.  The earn-and-learn apprenticeship model would be a successful option for many of those young people who do not want to further their studies through the CAO process.  Within the engineering and manufacturing industries, tradespersons have many progression paths available to them including supervisory roles, training and junior engineering positions, among others.  There are many options available to apprentices and qualified tradespeople who want to continue in higher education on completing an existing craft apprenticeship.  From my experience, apprentices and qualified tradespersons excel when they progress onto additional higher education programmes.  Their past practical experience and work ethic mean that they normally deal with assignment deadlines and exam pressure in a very measured and focussed manner.  </p><p> New apprenticeships have been developed recently and many more are in the pipeline.  It is particularly encouraging to see the large number of higher education apprenticeships that have been developed or are in development as the State seeks to expand apprentice provision across all levels of the national framework of qualifications.  This can only be a good thing as it gives greater exposure and strengthens the earn-and-learn model.  Indeed the Department of Education and Skills, the HEA and SOLAS need to be congratulated for implementing and supporting this development.  </p><p> The Irish apprenticeship system is employer-led.  During the Celtic tiger period, this led to a very high number of apprentices in the system and in recent years during the downturn there were very few apprentices in the system.  At present there is a shortage of tradespeople, especially in the construction industry, due to the fact that apprentices were not employed during the downturn.  Thankfully, because of the commitment of State agencies such as the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS, the HEA, ETBs, Cork Institute of Technology and all institutes of technology, we are in a position to cater for the increase in apprentice numbers that is inevitable if the economy is to grow.  </p><p> For apprenticeships to thrive, we should consider several options.  There should be an aggressive promotion of apprenticeships and trades at national level with input from well- known large employers, Government and training agencies.  There should be engagement with second level students, their families and career guidance teachers on apprenticeships and the apprenticeship system.  A national portal to facilitate connectivity between prospective apprentices and approved employers, which would greatly enhance the profile and opportunities available in apprentice education, should be developed.  The national and world skills competitions should be promoted.  Tradespeople and apprentices are well respected in most countries. We should examine apprenticeship training in other countries with a view to building respect for apprenticeship in Ireland.  The world skills competitions would be a good starting point for this process.</p><p> Further development of new apprenticeships, particularly in higher education and promotion of the earn-and-learn model, is required.  While the new developments in apprenticeship are welcome, the pace of development of new apprenticeship programmes is slower than desired.  One contributory reason is the legal basis for the development of apprenticeship.  I understand the HEA has recommended, in line with the recommendations of the apprenticeship review, that existing legislation should be reviewed or amended to enable greater flexibility.  We should encourage industry to highlight the advantages and progression paths within industry for apprentices and tradespeople and should highlight the existing progression paths and further develop new progression paths for tradespeople within third level institutions.  </p><p> CIT and other institutes of technology incurred huge expense during the downturn to keep apprentice workshop and laboratory facilities fully maintained and to retrain lecturing staff when it was necessary.  This was necessary in order that we would be fully prepared for the increase in the number of apprentices in the system that is now evident.  Apprentice numbers should not be allowed to rise or fall dramatically due to economic factors, which is the case with the employer-led system.  We should perhaps consider a parallel system whereby there would be control over the maximum number of apprentices in the system and where the minimum number would not drop below a critical value.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Smith" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#J00200"><p>The committee has my submission so I will summarise it.  I realise that the committee has a wide remit but I would like to focus on construction.  The number of apprentices in the construction industry has fallen to a level that cannot serve the current and future needs of the Irish construction industry.  In 2005 there were 599 new bricklaying apprenticeships.  By 2015 the number had fallen to 26.  Last year there were 52.  This was not confined to just the bricklaying trade.  Carpenters, painters, plasterers and other construction trades were also decimated.  Most people would say that the reason for this was the crash in the construction industry and to a certain degree they would be right.  However, while the industry is on the road to recovery - anyone looking at the Dublin skyline can see this - young people still do not want to become construction apprentices.</p> <p>  In the submission I sent to the committee, I stated that being a construction apprentice today was a mug's game and I stand over that assertion.  When I became an apprentice in 1978 I went to An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na, AnCO, for my first nine months.  I then worked on construction sites and went one day per week to Bolton Street for the four years.  Today an apprenticeship is made up of seven modules.  The first module is on-site.  The second is 20 weeks in a training centre.  The third, fifth and seventh are on-site, and the second and fourth are in an educational college.  Today, for the privilege of taking up an apprenticeship the young person has to pay &euro;1,000 for module two and module four.  The main reason that becoming an apprentice today is a mug's game is bogus self-employment.  Bogus self-employment is spreading at an alarming rate through the construction industry.  It is when a contractor gives the work out to a subcontractor and he then forces the workers to work on an electronic relevant contracts tax, ERCT, basis.  There were always subcontractors in the industry, and a small amount of bogus self-employment.  In 2005 approximately 24% of construction workers were self-employed.  Today that number is almost 40%.  In 2007 the trade unions met with the Revenue Commissioners to address this growing curse on our industry.  Both sides agreed that steps had to be taken and the code of practice for determining employment and self-employment status was revised.  We in the trade union movement expected a fall in bogus self-employment, but this did not happen.  In fact, the opposite happened.  The code was not implemented.  The rules were relaxed, and in 2012 the Revenue Commissioners went online.  By doing this they gave the power to unscrupulous contractors and subcontractors to classify the status of another citizen. </p> <p>  What does all this mean?  To give an example, when I was a bricklayer and went looking for a job, the main contractor - usually the name on the hoarding or the gate - was the employer and would employ me on a PAYE basis on that site.  The contractor might employ 30 bricklayers and in turn would probably have approximately six apprentices.  This is not the case at present.  A third party subcontractor will now hire me on a site.  He will then inform me that I work on an ERCT basis.  He then contacts Revenue and changes my tax status.  If I object, I lose my job.  I am then self-employed and as such I do not get PRSI, PAYE, holiday pay or pension.  If it rains, I am sent home without pay.  If something breaks down on site I am sent home.  I can be fired without notice.  I get no redundancy regardless of the length of time I have worked for the subcontractor.</p><p>When I am laid off I must go to social welfare and be means tested.  I have a zero-hour contract and in reality I have no rights.  The State has put in place a situation where I am now treated like a second-class citizen.  A site with 30 brick layers who are all bogus self-employed do not meet the criteria to have apprentices on the site.  For the 30 bricklayers there will be no apprentices.  The contractors and the sub-contractors make larger profits from operating in this way.</p></speech>

Many reports have been carried out on bogus self-employment.  All the reports have shown that as a result of this the State, the industry and training have all suffered.

Rebuilding Ireland sets a target of 25,000 annual housing output by 2021.  The public capital programme outlines some &euro;40 billion in activity including road, rail, water and broadband up to 2021.  Foreign direct investment has specific requirements for hi-tech construction projects.  The Government has committed to delivering 47,000 social housing units up to 2021.  Based on these targets, DKM Economic Consultants and the SOLAS labour market research unit, predicts that the sector will require 112,000 additional skilled people up to 2020 to deliver on this target.  This figure includes replacing the 36,000 people who will retire from the industry during this period.  This is an enormous challenge.</p> <p>  We are here today with a very clear warning; there is an urgent need for the Government and industry to collaborate in attracting more people into the industry and to invest in construction skills training.  The alternative is that we will fail to meet these targets, our housing crisis will continue and our infrastructure deficit will stall economic progress.  Foreign direct investment confidence to deliver will also be hit.  This is a huge threat to Ireland Inc and the long-term capacity of the industry and the State.</p> <p>  We need to address this by attracting people into the industry from the live register, through the education system and from those with construction experience in the diaspora and by upskilling those currently working in the industry.  We also need to begin to address the apprenticeship system to ensure we have a steady stream of skilled employees to sustain the construction activity our economy and society requires.  The industry is hiring 1,000 additional employees per month since 2013 and by 2020 if we achieve our targets we will have more than 200,000 people working in the industry, plus 80,000 indirect jobs.  It is against this pressing demand that we have to examine apprenticeships and skills in the industry.</p> <p>  The first key point to articulate is that the construction sector has been the principal industry sector in Ireland for employment of apprentices.  At its height the sector employed nearly 27,000 apprentices.  Following the decline of the economy from 2008 onwards, this number fell to around 7,000 in 2013.  The figures I have included in my submission to the committee indicate the collapse of apprenticeship registrations from 2007 to 2013.  There is, therefore, a resulting skills gap that has been created from almost ten years of stagnation.  The extent of the collapse in registrations is more specifically highlighted in the figures and outlines the difference in registrations in the wet trades between 2006 and 2016; bricklaying and stone laying registrations were 679 in 2006 and 56 in 2016; floor and wall tiling registrations were 43 in 2006 and zero in 2016; painting and decorating registrations were at 161 in 2006 and at 27 in 2016; and plastering registrations were at 310 in 2006 and 18 in 2016.</p> <p>  In the context of the need to ramp up residential construction to meet current and rising housing needs, the figures outlined point to a major concern regarding the ability to deliver the emerging needs of the State, especially as the residential sector is labour intensive and requires high levels of input from the wet trades.  Urgent and innovative thinking is required to address this skills need in the short term in addition to increasing apprenticeships in the medium term.</p> <p>  The Construction Industry Federation commissioned DKM Economic Consultants to develop a skills demand forecast in conjunction with SOLAS's labour market research unit based on the Government's strategy and the residential infrastructure provision.  The extract from the document, which we submitted to the committee, highlights the forecast demand of existing employment within the construction industry.  This demand indicates that there is a huge opportunity to increase apprenticeships into certain categories.  We are working with SOLAS and others to address issues within the apprenticeship and traineeship system.  Intake into the mechanical, electrical, carpentry and joinery trades are increasing at a reasonable pace.  The difference, however, between apprenticeship registrations for the wet trades and the projected needs indicate an alarming scenario.</p> <p>  Our house building members, particularly outside the greater Dublin area, are reporting a very fragile recovery.  In addition, those house builders who are emerging from recession are in recovery and survival mode.  The recession has also fundamentally changed the nature of employment in the sector, rendering these apprenticeships unsuitable for the sector.  For example, there is a predominance of sub-contracting where much of the work is done by smaller contractors who are not confident enough to take on apprentices at this time.  The current phase format also causes operational difficulties for smaller companies when phase two is 20 weeks duration off the job and the employer is missing that person for all this period.   This causes difficulties for a small business.  There are costs associated with employment such as the removal of redundancy rebates and initial training costs with uncertain outcomes for this initial investment.  There are also the low margins that still exist in the sector.</p> <p>  Apprenticeships are critically important and valuable to the construction industry so we are highly motivated to have a thriving model.  To examine how apprenticeships can be made more relevant and attractive in the changed environment in the industry, we have commissioned Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, to carry out research into the barriers to entry into apprenticeships.  We will feed the results of this research into SOLAS with a view to addressing this issue.  In advance of this research there are two potential solutions we would wish to comment on.  The first is the promotion of apprenticeships as a valid path to a fulfilling career in construction and second is the particular issues with the wet trades.  Our experience has shown that apprenticeships are poorly regarded among the public.  The reporting of school league tables lauds those schools with 100% of students going on to university, even though drop-out rates are very high in first year at up to 70% on some courses.  Apprenticeships are poorly promoted at second level.  There is a lack of understanding of career progression opportunities for apprentices.  Apprenticeships have been predominately construction focused, and the fear of a boom and bust economic cycle impacts on registrations.  There is a lack of choice of apprenticeships limits entry; if one is not interested in construction, motor mechanics or printing, then there is no route available.</p><p>However, we accept that this is being addressed.<br/><br/>Therefore, what is required at this point is a promotional campaign to raise awareness of the career potential of the apprenticeship route, as was suggested in the 2013 report, &quot;Review of Apprenticeship Training in Ireland&quot;.  We are actively supporting SOLAS in the delivery of such a programme in the coming months.  The CIF also believes that Government and industry should embark on a construction careers campaign to promote careers in the industry targeted at young people and those in the diaspora.  The industry's attractiveness as a career destination must be highlighted through a targeted awareness campaign.  As for the wet trades, we believe radical intervention is required to increase the registration numbers, particularly if the emerging needs of the economy are to be met.  We have been a supporter of the employer-led nature of apprenticeships.  However, the business model of employers in this sector has fundamentally changed.  Therefore, we propose: a non-sponsored route into the wet trades for a limited time, that is, a scheme where apprentices would be taken directly into training centre for two phases of the apprenticeship and then taken on by employers once they have gained some skill; and re-introducing day release for these specific trades where small employers could release the apprentice one day a week rather that the current system, which takes the apprentice away for up to 20 weeks at a time.<br/><br/>Finally, by 2013, the CIF was forecasting recovery in the construction industry and that we needed to be proactive to address the skills needs of the sector.  To this end, the CIF's manpower, education and training committee developed initiatives to ensure adequate talent was available to the sector, including engaging with career guidance counsellors through the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and <i>careersportal.ie</i>; launching a new website, <i>apprentices.ie</i>; revising the <i>gradireland</i>construction careers booklet to include apprentices; engaging with schools nationally to promote entry; engaging with the TechnoTeachers Association to promote entry; engaging with Waterford and Wexford ETB and SOLAS to run a pilot apprentice sharing scheme.  In addition, companies, such as Castle Ceilings, Errigal Contracts and Designer Group have invested heavily in the development of training academies to develop in-house skills.  However, all these measures are incremental and in the face of a demand of 112,000 additional employees over the next three years, a quantum shift in support for the apprenticeship model and more collaboration between our industry and the relevant State bodies are required.  A high level implementation framework for the action plan for apprentices must be put in place involving all stakeholders.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#L00300"><p>I will be brief.  There are a number of summary points I want to make, to some of which perhaps the presenters might come back with more data later and to which the committee could also return.</p> <p>  First, I thank all those present this evening for the presentations they made and sent in.  Frankly, having listened to both the previous speaker from the construction industry and the first speaker from the hotels federation, the ambition in the programme for Government for 31,000 apprentices between now and 2020 is grotesquely inadequate in the context of both the opportunities and the challenges that face Ireland.</p> <p>  One of the issues the committee would need to address is the number of apprenticeships.  As was stated by the representative from BATU and, indeed, the Construction Industry Federation, during the years of the crash apprenticeships, particularly in the wet trades, largely died off, as did most of the firms that employed them.  However, that is behind us now.  We have a situation where we have a constrained, albeit nonetheless significant, infrastructure programme plus a housing programme and my honest view is the numbers of apprenticeships being planned for are grotesquely inadequate.  I am not saying that is the fault of anybody here but the committee could do something useful by asking the Government to focus on the number.</p> <p>  If I heard the hotels federation correctly, Mr. Fenn stated that we need 13,000 chefs by 2020 and currently we are training 1,300.  This means that, inevitably, we will repeat some of the worst and most stressful elements of the boom period.  Inevitably, if we have that kind of a shortage in a growing economy, we will have to pass over Irish people and people who have come to live in Ireland and who are unemployed in favour of taking in skilled workers from abroad.  Taking in some skilled workers from abroad is inevitable but if we are to bypass the unemployed and those who have immigrated who are also unemployed, that is a waste of human resources here on the island of Ireland to whom we can offer opportunities.  I note that nobody mentioned one of the elephants in the room regarding apprenticeship, that is, the serious absence of women apprentices.  While I accept in certain elements of the building trade there might be constraints, there are not many, if any, in the hotel and hospitality trade.  I would appreciate more comment from the various organisations about how we move from the 31,000, which, in my view, will not be achieved, to a minimum of 50,000 to 60,000 by 2020.</p> <p>  I compliment the various elements of the sector on some of the new apprenticeships, particularly the electrical and mechanical ones.  I had the pleasure last week of visiting DG, one of the big electrical contractors in the sector.  I met 100 apprentices there, most of whom will probably go on to complete degrees and masters.  From my work on the steering group looking at how apprentices move to degrees, I am aware CIT has a good track record in this respect.  In a way, that is the key element missing for many parents.  If one does an apprenticeship and that apprenticeship also has a route to further qualifications, as in a ladder per the Bologna principles, one can say to people that as in Germany and Austria - a small country like Ireland - this is a dual system whereby one can go straight into college, university etc. or one can go into an apprenticeship.  Ultimately, one has a choice of being employed, starting a business or perhaps going the academic route in respect of universities.</p> <p>  I also want to comment briefly on the point made by the BATU representative.  As then Minister for Social Protection, I set up a review with the Department of Finance in respect of bogus, phantom or phoney self-employment.  A great deal of self-employment in the construction sector is genuine and mechanisms or structures in both the construction sector and other sectors have changed.  There is a growing trend of workers being employed as contractors who traditionally were in employment.  The speaker from BATU is correct in identifying that if those jobs are precarious jobs and they do not last long, those involved may end up with little or no access to certain types of social welfare payment.  Most important of all, however, they may end up inadequately provided for in terms of pension and illness cover at certain stages in their lives.</p> <p>  Finally, members should give consideration to the levy and how it is utilised and the fact that it is significantly underspent.</p><p>The role of employers needs to be examined to see if that can be assisted.  If employers can take an apprentice, particularly those - whether small or large - that have a precarious financial history in recent years, I would favour employers having a higher level of assistance.  A reference was made to the possibility of a non-sponsored route for a period of time, particularly for the wet trades in the construction industry.  I certainly think that if housing alone were to be taken, that makes sense.</p><p> We are coming to almost full employment in the country now.  Mr. Dan O'Brien recently said that Ireland has created more jobs in the past five years than in the first 70 years of the independence of the State.  We are creating many jobs, but if we look to Austria, Germany and a number of other countries, they have massively higher performance for apprenticeships and the establishment of the reputation of apprenticeships as a really good model for developing somebody's future and prospects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1384" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#M00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.</p> <p>  I will address the Irish Hotels Federation first.  My own background is in the hospitality sector, so I am aware of the shortage of chefs, commis chefs, etc.  From my experience of the training centre, and I know Mr. Vaughan has experience of it in Limerick, it targeted people from unemployed areas where it has been a great success story.  I would love to see more of them, and I recently raised this with the Minister.  It could be replicated throughout the country, targeting areas of unemployment.  There were people there who had never worked and one person was out of work for five years.  They have now been placed in employment.  It was a buy-in from the local hospitality sector, where hotels, pubs and restaurants all signed up to take on a number of the employees.  It has been a great success story.  I know from speaking with people in the hotel industry that they are finding it very hard to get staff because people do not have the necessary skills and training.  Some in the industry are bringing people in and trying to train them.  I would like to see an example of what is happening in the Limerick Enterprise Development Partnership, LEDP, centre in Limerick being replicated around the country.  It is something that even the committee should look at.  To see so many people from unemployed backgrounds being put back into employment is phenomenal.  A very good video was put together which sells the message of it and what a success story it has been.</p> <p>  On the training centres, I would like to welcome Mr. Des Murphy.  Having served in the education and training board, ETB, in Limerick myself for many years, I know what Mr. Murphy brings to the table with regard to experience and such.  Is there not enough choice for apprenticeships?  I know that money has been granted by the Minister and the Department for skills, apprenticeships and training.  Do we need to expand the amount of courses and what is on offer?  Is there enough collaboration between industry and the training centres to find out what are the needs of the different industries?  The same could be said for the construction industry.  I know that courses are tailored to meet the needs of the employer in some places.  Is this happening across all sectors?  That is a question for all the witnesses representing the different sectors.  In some cases, some of the traineeships or apprenticeships can be quite focused on a particular area.  Is there much co-operation between employers and trainers on what are their needs?  Is it an area that should be looked at further?</p> <p>  I was recently speaking to someone in the construction industry, and that person was saying that many people who have the skills and training seem to abroad.  Are employers targeting the diaspora enough to try to bring people back?  Should it be looked at more?  A question for witnesses from all the sectors is on second level schools.  Third level education is not for everybody.  There are some people who will never go to third level.  Should there be more talks in second level schools about different apprenticeships and traineeships that are available, to encourage people?  On the amount of people that study technical graphics, woodworking and so on, I am not sure of the level of co-operation between trainers and teachers.  Is there much co-operation between both sides?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#M00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.</p> <p>  I certainly agree with Mr. Dermot Carey.  It sounds like some sort of nationwide campaign to promote apprenticeships is needed, perhaps on social media or television, and it needs to happen soon.  My question for all groups is about what could be done to attract more women to apprenticeships.  Mr. Michael Hourihan from Cork Institute of Technology says that there is a need to examine apprenticeship programmes in other countries.  Is the German dual programme one that he thinks we should be working towards?  What are his thoughts on how career guidance could be improved?  What sort of links do the different sectors have with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors?  I presume that the cuts to guidance counsellors in 2012 must have had an impact, because there would have been schools which could afford to pay for those hours, and unfortunately the schools which would traditionally have the students that might be attracted to apprenticeships are those that did not have guidance counsellors or could not afford to pay for a guidance counsellor.  Did that have an impact in the past five years?</p> <p>  My question for Mr. Des Murphy of Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, is on the two-year pre-apprenticeship programme.  How would that work alongside the leaving certificate applied programme?  Is it time to totally overhaul that?  That was introduced 22 years ago so is that something we need to look at?  My final question is whether there are aspects of the education system which negatively affect the perception of apprenticeships, for example, the points system and the league tables.  We are all aware of certain schools that might suddenly decide to drop the leaving certificate applied option because they want to be able to attract parents who want to put students into a school that might perform better on the league tables and do not really want the leaving certificate applied programme there.  How do we get that shift in cultural mindset that is so badly needed to serve our children better?  Rather than serving a league table, surely we should be serving the education of our children better.  Do we need to shift the leaving certificate applied option into a proper apprenticeship programme for students?</p></speech>

I say that as somebody who has visited Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, and the National Skills Competition, and seen at first hand the high calibre of talent there.  We have a skills gap and we need a change of culture.  How can we do this?  Do we think effective marketing for apprenticeships and traineeships would be enough to counteract this trend, or are there other initiatives that we could take?  On the demand for apprenticeships, do we have any idea of the demand that exists in the sector?  We know there is a huge skills gap.  I know a stakeholder mentioned that there were previously 27,000 apprenticeships at the height of the sector.  How long would it take us to get back there?  What do the speakers think we need to do to attract mature learners into traineeships and also the apprenticeships sector?  As many speakers mentioned already, we need greater participation among females.  A culture change is needed there too.</p> <p>  On the presentation by Mr. Dermot Carey from the Construction Industry Federation, what is the level of anticipated demand for apprenticeships in the construction sector?</p><p>Do new areas of the construction sector offer potential for developing apprenticeships?  What would be a more realistic entry requirement for apprenticeships bearing in mind the importance of keeping them accessible to a broad range of people?  What incentives or initiatives would it be worthwhile offering to entice subcontractors to take on apprentices?  There is an element of fear involved to the extent that many subcontractors do not have enough confidence to take on apprentices.  This will have to change if we more people are to enter into apprenticeships.</p><p> Reference was made to the resources available to enterprise and training boards.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the level of resources required to develop apprenticeships and traineeships?  How much could this area develop if appropriate resources were provided?  How many apprenticeships or training places could be provided?</p><p> Reference was made also to the cost effectiveness of traineeships.  Should the development of traineeships be a priority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#N00200"><p>I thank Mr. Smith for his comments.  The Chairman is correct that bogus self-employment is not the subject of today's discussion.  Nevertheless, Mr. Smith hit the nail on the head in respect of apprenticeships and I will take his point on board.</p> <p>  Reading the submission from the Irish Hotels Federation, is it the case that it can take an eternity to develop an apprenticeship.  What are the blockages?  It seems obvious that action needs to be taken in this regard.  The Irish Hotels Federation has engaged in advocacy for five years and is now working with various partners in this area.  The same issue appears to arise in the construction industry where it also seems to take an eternity to develop apprenticeships.  Is there a problem in the system?  In the United Kingdom, apprenticeships are much more broadly based than in Ireland where we have very few apprenticeships.  What is the problem?  We hear on the grapevine that if efforts are made, especially in the construction industry, to develop a new apprenticeship or trade, vested interests will seek to block them.  Will the witnesses from SOLAS comment?  Is that a factor?</p> <p>  What action can be taken to broaden the apprenticeships system?  I am impressed by the insurance apprenticeship because it offers a level 8 qualification, which is a degree.  This should be the model for many more apprenticeships.  If I was an employer who came up with an idea for an apprenticeship and was able to get an education partner on board, how long would it take to get the apprenticeship up and running?  How long would it take to get someone employed or into training under that apprenticeship?</p> <p>  I thank Education and Training Boards Ireland.  Mr. O'Brien established a college in Monaghan which is doing tremendous work.  I will work with him to try to put a similar model in place in County Meath.  If anyone from the Department of Education and Skills is listening, Dunboyne College of Further Education badly needs a vision to put more people into traineeships, provide more support for apprenticeships and become an educational partner in the further education and training sector. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#N00300"><p>I thank all the witnesses for their statements.  They will have an opportunity to respond to questions in a moment.  I will not delay proceedings much further.  However, having heard the figures on what is needed in hospitality and tourism and construction, it appears we are facing a bottleneck in terms of having adequately trained and prepared staff to service these industries.  A major problem lies ahead, one which should have been dealt with yesterday, as it were.  It is time to address it.  The witnesses have given us much food for thought.</p> <p>  Parity of esteem is needed for apprenticeships in second level education and among parents.  There is a major issue with career guidance.  It seems information on career paths that are readily available through apprenticeships is not being provided for young persons. </p> <p>  I compliment Education and Training Boards Ireland.  A great deal of work is being done on training and apprenticeships in Kildare and west County Wicklow, particularly in Athy and Crookstown.  I am seeking to have schemes provided in north west County Kildare.  I am concerned by the comment about raising minimum entry standards for apprenticeships.  If entry standards are to be raised, will it give rise to the introduction of another Central Applications Office, CAO, process?  Cork Institute of Technology also suggested controlling numbers and keeping them on an even base, rather than increasing or decreasing them.  The evidence suggests many more apprentices are needed.  </p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin referred to collaboration between businesses and employers and those providing the trades, whether through the education and training boards, SOLAS or another body.  This is very important.  Will the witnesses outline how we can attract greater numbers to the apprenticeship scheme?  A fair point was made on fears among smaller industries about taking on new apprentices.  More supports are clearly required in this area. </p> <p>  It is great that the Construction Industry Federation has commissioned research.  The committee will be interested in receiving the results, which will be directed towards SOLAS.  I commend SOLAS on the work it is doing.  I met some of those involved in the sector and I am very impressed with their work.</p> <p>  Witnesses will have an opportunity to send written responses to some of the questions members raise.  The WorldSkills competition is held every year and it is great to see our apprenticeships do very well in it.</p> <p>  On innovation and trying to find new areas, I visited Espoo in Finland many years ago.  The city has an innovation centre and the Finnish department of education supports think tanks to develop apprenticeships in new and innovative areas.  Perhaps we are not doing enough of this type of work in this country.</p></speech>

We floated this idea and discussed it with some organisations but it was not received favourably because it was felt it would result in the introduction of tiers in various trades, in other words, someone would become more qualified than someone else.  We kept this in mind when developing new apprenticeships.  To give an example, Cork Institute of Technology has received provisional approval for a level 7 apprenticeship in engineering services management.  While this does not appear to be related to a trade, the idea is to develop middle management competencies for craftspersons  Rather than having them become better at their trade, we give them a new set of skills to complement their trade.  We are not taking the route of having a tiered system.</p> <p>  The development of guidance counsellors was mentioned.  Work is needed in this area because in my experience guidance counsellors are very well informed about level 7 and 8 degree programmes but much less informed about apprenticeships.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p><p>What is the answer?  Other than sorting it out by getting everyone into a room, I am not sure, but something must be done to try to develop this.</p></speech>

There are guidance counsellors out there who are well informed but some are not.  This just needs to be clarified because I think many people assume the apprenticeship system follows the traditional level 7 and level 8 approach, but it does not.  It is a completely different system.  That needs to be made known to all concerned.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan spoke about initiatives.  I thank her for visiting the skills competition.  I am involved in it heavily at national level.  We run the skills competitions in CIT and DIT mainly.  They happen every year but few people are aware of them.  We are considering developing them and working with people to hold the competitions in the RDS, perhaps, as an annual event.  That is the way forward.  An event on its own promoting apprenticeships would put such competitions and apprenticeships out there.  That is the answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Parlon" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#O00400"><p>I wish to make just a few general remarks.  First, it is very positive news that both the Irish Hotels Federation and the construction industry have such a positive projection for the industry and that we are seeking 100,000 people and the Hotels Federation is seeking a large number as well.  It reflects the what is happening in tourism, the growth of the economy and what is happening in construction.</p> <p>  Clearly, construction had, and has, a great record in apprenticeships and there was an apprenticeship culture in the industry.  There were 27,000 apprenticeships at the peak.  Clearly, we went over a cliff, but there are new skills now.  We have been involved with the ETBs through Solas.  Formwork is significant in that many of the new buildings and office blocks are built with mass concrete and forms need to be made for those.  We have been involved in traineeships, which do not take the same length of time but need significant involvement by employers and on-site, on-the-job work.  The trainees get intensive training.  A number of companies provide these traineeships, and Deputy Burton referred to one.  Michael Stone, our former president, now of Designer Group, has appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Designer Group has hundreds of apprentices on the M&amp;E side but also in steel fixing, dry lining and formwork.  Specialist contractors need such people.  The flexibility is just coming now through Solas and the ETBs to provide this specialist training.</p> <p>  In response to the representative from BATU, times have changed.  There was a time when individual contractors hired workers with all the different skills.  Now it is entirely specialist skills that are sought, whether groundworks, steelworks, formwork, blocklaying or bricklaying.  The negative perception of these trades is odd because bricklayers and blocklayers can practically name their price.  Most work on piecework.  These are highly paid skills but my members are having a major problem getting those skills.  Likewise, we see there are nearly 1,000 electrical contractors at present and, I think, about 500 in plumbing and 300 or 400 in carpentry, yet there are only perhaps less than 20 in the wet trades.  Unfortunately, designers and architects are now designing bricks and blocks out of buildings on site in order to get over this problem.  However, there are many new skills there.</p> <p>  We need to be fast on our feet.  The industry is changing.  We need to embrace the innovations.  We now have new building regulations.  We are nearing NZEB, nearly zero-energy buildings, standards, which represent an entirely new quality of housing in terms of energy efficiency and so on.  We must move.  In fairness to Solas, the ETBs and the technical colleges, I think we are in a good place.  We are moving in the right direction.  Our industry and our members need to keep up with this innovation as well.  I think there is a culture of individual employers, be they big or small, committing themselves to taking on apprentices for a particular period.  It is a changing landscape.  It is the specialist blocklayers and bricklayers, plumbers and M&amp;E contractors who need to employ these people now.  They are finding they need to do so because the quality of the work of people coming in from the rest of Europe and from elsewhere outside of the country is not nearly as good as that of the homegrown craftspeople.  Just as was said earlier, if a blocklayer, bricklayer or electrician is taken on and trained up, chooses to go on to third level and works his or her way up to be a foreman, he or she is a terrific asset and, generally, very loyal to the company.  We are therefore very keen to support this area.  However, the unfashionableness of apprenticeships or, as Deputy Nolan said, the fact that apprentices are undervalued is an issue.  Regarding how we and the Department of Education promote apprenticeships, everything leads to third level, and colleges are very good at promoting themselves and filling all their places.  We need a counter-campaign to encourage people into the skills and crafts because there is a very good lifestyle and a very good livelihood for them there.</p> <p>  Our industry has suffered a little like the tourism industry but much more and with massive peaks and troughs.  We reached an outlandishly high level of activity before the peak and then fell to an outrageously low level.  We need to get that levelled out.  We have been looking to Government lately to get a commitment to a construction sector that would have cross-party support, a fairly level and fairly constant capital investment programme, a fairly constant housebuilding programme and a fairly constant refurbishment programme, all the while continuing to be able to attract foreign direct investment.  The optimum level of activity would be about 10% to 12% of GDP.  We have been down to 6% and were previously up to 23%.  The figure is now rising.  By 2020, our DKM projection, to which Mr. Carey referred, suggests we will be worth about &euro;20 billion and about 10% of GDP.  The challenge for everyone is, when we get to that level, to try to hold it.  Then the people who qualify in skills or otherwise and have jobs in the industry will be able to be maintained in the industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Murphy" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#O00500"><p>I will respond to Deputy Nolan's comments about the two-year pre-apprenticeship and the applied leaving certificate.  We see the importance of the latter in a wide range of areas, so the two-year pre-apprenticeship is in no way a matter of replacing the applied leaving certificate.  We are talking about the two-year pre-apprenticeship as a potential route for people who may not reach leaving certificate standard or who feel the senior cycle is not for them.  At present, this is provided through the CTCs, the community training workshops, or Youthreach, but we are trying to bring that into a more structured format which allows progression to apprenticeship.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan raised the issue of raising the minimum standard but over 80% of current apprenticeship entrants are at leaving certificate level in what would have been the standard crafts.  When many companies advertise, they clearly seek people with leaving certificates.  People need to be aware that in order to get through the curricula as they are being developed and as the new skills are coming in, they need good base levels.  There was the issue during the recent downturn that people in the industry who perhaps came in without being at leaving certificate standard found it more difficult to cross-train or retrain.  The leaving certificate also opens up the potential for progression into third level in the future.  There is that progress route there and it is important apprenticeships not be seen as a dropout or whatever else from education.  That is where we are coming from.</p> <p>  I also wish to clarify the question of resources.  What we are talking about in this regard is very much that we need to attract skilled technicians and skilled craftspeople if they are going to be able to deliver at that level.  We are talking about people who would have the potential to reach supervisory level within the industries involved, so there is the issue there of examining the whole salary and recruitment structure and the inability to recruit to permanent positions.  In addition, if we are talking about having state-of-the-art training programmes, we need state-of-the-art facilities and equipment on which to train people.  These are what we would identify as the resources required.</p> <p>  The league table Deputy Martin mentioned is a major issue.</p><p>When we talk about career guidance and everything else, the problem is that a principal of a school is judged on where the school is on the league table.  It is very important for parents sending their children to the school.  If a principal has 100 leaving certificate students and 20 of them achieve very good apprenticeships, it is a disaster for the principal because the school is seen as only having 80% of students going on to third level education.  That is a critical thing to change.  The student is going on and doing a level 6 or 7 course, but if that is not clearly identified and seen as being progression it is difficult to get the entry or buy-in into schools.  It is detrimental to the progress of the school.  There is an issue in that regard at present.</p></speech>

He is right.  The construction industry is starting to recover at present.  BATU and all the other unions very much welcome that.  We keep up with the times.  We are well aware that the major construction companies have changed, have become more management level and are using sub-contractors.  We have embraced that too.  I spoke about self-employment and I will not go over that again, but the problem we have is PAYE for workers.  The member referred to piecework.  I was a brickie all of my life and worked on piecework all of my life.  I worked on piecework on a PAYE basis.  The words "career", "future" and "livelihood" have been bandied around here with regard to the future of an apprentice, but if a young man rings me, tells me he would like to be an apprentice brickie and asks me what happens when he serves his time I will tell him he will be forced into self-employment.  He will say he does not want that and that he wants to be able to go to a bank and borrow and so forth, so it will turn him off.  We are seeing it reflected in the numbers.</p> <p>  As regards the diaspora, guys are ringing us in the union to ask if there is PAYE work available in Dublin.  We have to tell them the truth, that it is not available in the majority of cases.  The main companies are doing their business correctly, as Tom Parlon knows because they are members of the CIF and have been around for a long time.  However, they are at a major competitive disadvantage because of what is taking place.  All we are saying is that the industry should be policed.  Young people will come back into it and we welcome that.  We are not asking for anything else.  We just want the industry to be policed properly, whether that is registered employment agreements, REAs, sectoral employment orders, SEOs, or PAYE.  We are asking for Scope in the Department of Social Protection to get its inspectors out and about.  That is all.</p></speech>

With regard to hotels and catering, we had a formalised apprenticeship system for a number of years.  However, in 2003, by dint of the withdrawal of the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training, CERT, we lost a very good agency that promoted training and development in the industry.  There was a lacuna of approximately ten years in which the State had no formal involvement in training in hospitality and catering.  We have had to re-learn that.  In Limerick, we went into the nascent ETB that was forming there, the LCETB, and told it there was a need for trainees and to train people in the old fashion.  We took over the old CERT building in Roxborough and it was one of the positive examples of six or seven State agencies coming together to make something happen.  Every agency involved, such as SOLAS, ETB, Intreo, all the other Departments and the Limerick Integration Working Group, pulled together.  We have had a great success story there.  It is mainly because, and this is interesting, we had employers involved in interviewing candidates as they came in, so we knew the type of person who would work well in the industry.  Then the ETB gave tremendous assistance to people before they entered into that formal training where they had, perhaps, learning difficulties or other issues.</p> <p>  One of the big issues in apprenticeships, and this speaks to the number of women in apprenticeships in particular, is that we do not treat apprentices in the same way as we would treat third level students.  We do not give them the same type of accessibility, for example, in terms of getting to places and allowances they might have to travel.  There are some requirements for implements and tools in various apprenticeships that would have to be considered.  We also must consider matters such as child care and other facilities that would allow women to participate to a greater extent.  In the hospitality industry we have always had great success with women in the industry, but the problem has been the retention of people over a longer term.  A longitudinal study is required to find out the reasons for that.</p> <p>  We started five years ago on the apprenticeship system we have developed.  We had hoped to be training 500 or 600 people a year.  It has taken a tortuous amount of time.  The system is arcane.  We have had to re-learn and learn what qualifications are.  In the third level, there is delegated authority to the institutes of technology so they can develop their own education system and have the programmes up and running quite fast.  It was a learning curve with the ETBs.  QQI had particular standards and quality standards had to be implemented.  A centralised system had to be put in place.  This has required a great deal of patience on the part of the employer, but we are sticking with it.  We will start this apprenticeship, hopefully, in September or October and we will have many employers available to do the training.  However, one aspect we could consider is helping employers.  The employer who takes on an apprentice is an employer who has a long-term vision for employment, the success of their employment and the success of the apprentice.  In the current system, however, the State gives no recognition to those employers in respect of possible benefits they might get on PRSI or other credits.  We could part fund some of this by recognising quality employers.  The Irish Hotels Federation has a quality employers scheme.  If good employers were recognised in that fashion, we would create centres of excellence within employment and we would promote apprenticeships in a more valid way.</p> <p>  The traineeships link in extremely well to this.  People coming into apprenticeships will not always have the ability to do the learning that they require.  The traineeships might give them a chance to sample an employment and decide where to go.  This is critical to what we need to do in the area.  With regard to what we are trying to achieve, not every employer will be able to take on the rigours of the new apprenticeship system.  The old apprenticeship system in the construction industry was much simpler.  There was much less in terms of the type of certification and pre-certification required.  The ongoing quality standards have had to be changed.  Apart from anything else, there is an amount of documentation and rigour involved in assessing the apprentice as they go along.  Employers currently do not have that capability.  They will have to be trained, so this is taking some time.</p> <p>  The work that is taking place at present is ground work.  I believe we will do a tremendously good job with apprenticeship systems, but it is not turning around fast enough.  To reply to Senator Byrne, I am not sure that it should be as fast because we are laying down the ground work for something that will be with us for a long time and will benefit the apprentices and the employers.  I must compliment the ETBs in particular.  They have been tremendous in their application to this and the learning that has been involved.  The support from SOLAS has certainly been visible.  Although it has been a really frustrating time for us as employers, we can see at this point that what we are doing is something the State and the employers will benefit from for a long time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Toole" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017051600002#P00400"><p>A huge number of points were made by fellow contributors but I will concentrate on the points made by the Chairman, Deputies and Senators.  I wish to make one observation to start.  When I attended previous manifestations of this committee under previous Governments during the recession, the narrative was about how to help unemployed people in a time of recession and deep trouble.  While the challenges are huge now, it is a much more positive time because the challenges are about positive opportunity and how to maximise and leverage them, as distinct from no opportunity at all.</p> <p>  A number of points were made about the level of ambition for apprenticeship.  I would fold traineeship into that as well.  Consider some of the numbers provided by Tom Parlon and Dermot Carey.  In 2007, at the peak, there was a population of 28,500 apprentices in the system.  In 2013, there 5,700.  That was a fall of 80%.  Today, there are over 11,000 in the system and the number is growing.  The ambition is that between now and 2020 there will be a registration of 50,000 in a combination of apprenticeships and traineeships.</p><p>We are coming from a very low base off the recession, and it will take the collective will of employers, providers, the representative bodies here today, the trade unions, ourselves and others in the education system to realise this.  There is very strong ambition for apprenticeship and traineeship, and I want to reinforce this.  Even though the journey is challenging, this is our aim.</p><p> A number of comments were made in respect of female apprenticeship, and the numbers are stark.  There are very few female apprenticeships in the existing cohort.  While new occupations are opening up which will create opportunities, it is important we try to understand why this is the case.  We have done some research with young men, young women, parents and guidance teachers about why this is so.  The truth of it is apprenticeship is not even on the radar of young women.  They do not think about apprenticeship.  They do not see themselves there.  If we think of subject choices that might be taken when people enter secondary school and the opportunities to get experience in craft-type learning, it just does not happen.  There are deep rooted issues we have to tackle, but one of the biggest, which links to points made by a number of members and others, is the need to promote.  Apprenticeship is not as understood as it should be.  We, along with employers, trade unions and others, have a job to do to make information available in an accessible format, so school leavers, whose immediate familiarity is with the CAO system, can potentially look at an apprenticeship and think of other opportunities.  Apprenticeship is not a course.  It is a period of learning that starts with an employer and then migrates to the State in terms of off-the-job training.  We really have a job to do on this.</p><p> A number of people mentioned WorldSkills and how important this is and how very well we do.  We work collaboratively with Cork Institute of Technology and others on this.  It is a wonderful window into the skills of our craftspeople and others, and there is an opportunity to grow it and use it as a vehicle of promotion to the possibilities of apprenticeship of which we want to be part.</p><p> The Chairman mentioned parity of esteem.  Many of the other commentators spoke about how well we regard apprenticeships and what we value.  With better information and promotion of apprenticeship, and the reality that apprenticeships create the possibility of work for life, there is the opportunity to rebalance this.  When I was growing up apprenticeships were highly valued and people sought them.  This is still there, but maybe not as manifest as it should be.</p><p> Another point was made on innovation and how we have a more innovative approach to expanding the range of apprenticeships and looking at new areas.  I look at innovation in two ways.  There is innovation within each apprenticeship.  We systematically review each existing apprenticeship, mindful of changing processes, technologies and ways of working in each of the crafts, trying to ensure the new curriculum reflects the new realities of ways of working so we keep abreast of the type of skills required for the future.  It was suggested that as the new apprenticeships start rolling, and we have five already with 19 in development, we will see a range of occupations open up for new possibilities of apprenticeship, mindful again of the point of tying in traineeship to this.  We have a number of challenges, including the challenge of securing the necessary resources, and we are part of the process of the review of funding taking place in higher education and further education and training as we speak.  While there is this challenge for resources, there is a more positive climate to try to generate more apprenticeships and better quality opportunities for our learners.</p></speech>

We do not need to go into the preamble again.  I need to leave the meeting for approximately 15 minutes at 4.45 p.m. to go to the D&aacute;il, so I suggest Deputy Martin acts as Chairman during that time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I am also conscious the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has to leave to go to the D&aacute;il at 4.25 p.m, but I ask that the committee conclude this meeting by 5 p.m.  We appreciate the fact the Ministers and their officials have come back to us for a second time and I ask that questions be brief, focused and based on the briefing material.  At the last meeting, we strayed into areas of policy and I ask that we not do that today because every member is at liberty to table parliamentary questions.  We can arrange further meetings on matters of policy with the Ministers and their officials.</p> <p>  I ask members, officials and those in the public Gallery to please ensure that their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of this meeting which has been convened to resume consideration of the Revised Estimates for Vote 26 - Education and Skills.  We will start with programme B because we completed programme A at our last meeting.  This was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee with an instruction to report back.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and their officials and thank them for the open and constructive dialogue with the committee secretariat's financial scrutiny team in developing the briefing documents for this meeting.  I remind the Ministers that the committee agreed at the last meeting to proceed programme by programme and we will initially focus on specific subheads before broaching any questions on the remainder of the programme.  I refer again to the briefing document prepared by the financial scrutiny team of the committee's secretariat to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimates.  We will resume on programme B.  The Minister made his opening remarks at the last meeting and we do not need to go through those again.  We will go straight to subhead B5 on grants to SOLAS and further education and training.</p> <p>  I invite members to ask questions.</p></speech>

What is the position in regard to emphasising apprenticeships and traineeships at post-school level as opposed to PLC courses and general types of further education?  Is there a plan there?  Has the Minister set out any kind of a strategy on this?</p></speech>

The objective is to reach between 40,000 and 50,000 new apprenticeships.  At one stage, before the recession, there were approximately 30,000 to 32,000 apprenticeships, which came all the way down to approximately 2,500 to 3,000.  This figure covered apprenticeships at all levels, including basic apprenticeships, and there are many reasons for this drop.  The objective is to bring the number past the 30,000, which it was in the past.  For instance, there are already 2,400 places in existing traineeships and 800 registrations for new apprenticeships for 2017 alone.  There were no questions on the FET programme but I would like to inform members there have been 320,000 beneficiaries of this programme across a wide range of provisions, both part-time and full-time, from levels 1 to 6.  If Deputy Thomas Byrne wants any information, I will get him the booklet explaining everything in the action plan.  There will be a much wider range of apprenticeships on offer as a result of new calls for proposals over the next few years. One such call went out only last week.  I met a business group today, which I cannot name, and it was asking for a new call for apprenticeships in the business in which it is in.  I am confident we will reach the proposed target by 2020.</p></speech>

There is a combination of apprenticeships.  The programme for Government, as the Deputy knows, includes a commitment to increase the cumulative number of apprenticeships to 31,000.  There are a number of new apprenticeships.</p><p>What we do is we regularly call to businesses, and it would not be unusual for a particular business group to ask to meet either the Minister for Education and Skills or myself.  We both believe apprenticeships are needed within the industry.  That applies to the basic apprenticeships, for example, plasterers or bricklayers, right up to the new apprenticeships we recently launched with insurance brokers and companies.  We are getting calls from businesses right across the board.  We are able to fill the apprenticeships based on the quota and it looks very positive for the next number of years.</p></speech>

The committee recognises that it is hugely important for a modern economy that we do all we can to help support skills development and the skills development system.  </p> <p>  Regarding subhead B5, the metrics are very useful in terms of looking at this.   There were 12 key high level metrics for programme B, nine of these alone related to the National Training Fund, and only one related, partly, to this particular allocation.  Despite the numbers mentioned, there was a decrease in the target for the number of further education and training beneficiaries, although there was an increase in allocation.  The Minister of State can come back to this at a later point.</p></speech>

Deputy Thomas Byrne spoke about it.  The new apprenticeship we started is the insurance practitioner apprenticeship, which has a big take-up.  There are also two further programmes, for example, one is in the international financial services, the IFS, which is interesting.  The point the Chairman makes is that because there appears to be fewer people unemployed, the take-up among those who are unemployed will be a little less.  The biggest take-up for apprenticeships, in particular for basic and starting apprenticeships, has essentially been from people coming from an unemployment base.  It is not that the number has dropped, but that it has dropped  in a particular group, that is, the unemployed.  There has been a bigger uptake from that, however.</p></speech>

The Regional Skills Fora is a move to establish more clearly what needs there are, to create a greater connection and to develop programmes through partnerships with local enterprise.  There are some very good examples of where that has been done.  Cavan-Monaghan, where a traineeship was developed with one of the very prominent agricultural engineering companies, is one such excellent example.  The role of the fora at this stage is to try to build that bridge to enterprise.  They are not budget holders in that sense.  Their role is to identify what is on offer, identify what is needed and then to try to adapt one to the other.  We recently had the first meeting of the National Skills Fora and there is wide recognition that this is an area with real potential.  We have not yet built connections to the provision, but there is scope there to do that.</p></speech>

We are currently discussing increasing the contribution to the training fund from 0.7% to 1%, which would provide additional money that would, in turn, be deployed to contribute to higher education and to apprenticeships.  While the fund carries a surplus we cannot just spend that surplus.  It is still within the Exchequer ceilings that we have to agree with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not have the flexibility to just spend more from the fund because it still has to be approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the normal budgetary process.  It is like a surplus in the Social Insurance Fund in that it still has to be deployed by a budgetary decision.  We envisage wanting to use more money from this area for these purposes but to do so, we need to increase the contribution to the fund.</p></speech>

Could the Minister comment on the fact that this money is totally insufficient in terms of educating our young people?  Is he satisfied with that and with the drop in the international rankings that has resulted from the terrible level of funding in this sector?  What exactly is being proposed to deal with this?  Having set us the task of looking at the Cassells report, the Minister appears to be doing some work parallel to this that was not apparent until he was questioned in the D&aacute;il.

This is a little too late, however, given that funding per student has fallen by over 20%.  The institutes of technology are experiencing a funding crisis and there is talk of redundancies in at least one institute.  Can the Minister confirm that there will be no forced redundancies in this sector and can he advise on the implementation of the Cush report?  Can the Minister also advise on how much of the current general grant to universities is spent on pay?</p></speech>

One thing that struck us was that the CAO form does not specify that these colleges are not covered by SUSI grants.  That places students and their families in a particular situation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017051600002#C00200"><p>There are a number of questions there.  This year, for the first year in about ten years, we have increased the funding to higher education.  We have recognised that a funding deficit had built up over a number of years.  There had been virtually no new funding for a decade, along with a declining amount of Exchequer funding which was partly compensated by rising student grants over an extended period.  This meant that while student numbers grew, the cost per student came down, and that undoubtedly put a funding squeeze on the colleges.  In order to redress that, we have put in place investment this year, and we also have secured from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform a commitment that there will be a demographic element in our funding formula.  This means that as colleges expand their student numbers in the coming years, as wholly envisaged by the Cassells's report, we will see an increasing Exchequer contribution, something they lacked throughout that period.  On top of that, as I mentioned to Deputy Catherine Martin, we have introduced consultation on a new source of funding, namely, an employer contribution, which was one of the elements recommended by Peter Cassells in his report and by the group he led.  Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to idea of an income contingent loan, and I have always acknowledged that there needs to be a political consensus on this issue before we can move forward with it.  My Department is doing the prudent thing and is preparing the ground should the Oireachtas decide that this is something we would like to go ahead with.  We are putting the necessary framework in place for this idea to be implemented and have thought through what it would take to do so.  That is all that has been done.  We have not commissioned expensive outside work.  What we have is a group looking at how this idea would work in practical terms should the Oireachtas decide to go with it.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan said that funding is insufficient.  What is encouraging is that the recently published performance framework for the third level colleges showed improvements across all of the indicators, including quality indicators and indicators such as their success in extending recruitment to people from disadvantaged backgrounds, people with disabilities and mature students, and their capacity to win additional research funding.  There is a whole matrix of performance indicators.  This last period, despite being very constrained, showed very significant progress by the third level institutions.  Like many parts of the education system, there is no doubt that third level did things above and beyond at a time of crisis, and has had very significant achievements.  That, as recognised by everyone, is not an option for the future.  We have to plan on the basis of continued expansion and the new challenges ahead.  Our third level sector is not perfect in every dimension.  It has had some very big successes but there are other areas in need of improvement.  That is the context in which we have committed to this investment trajectory, and we want to work with it to achieve more.</p> <p>  On the issue of private colleges and those who enrol in them, this would mark a significant change from the existing programme and would need a significant budgetary provision.  At the moment, SUSI grants apply only to approved programmes in approved institutions and, by in large, it follows a very competitive CAO process for gaining access and so on.  The private colleges are obviously fee-paying, for-profit colleges, and are a different type of institution.  Policy to date has not been to extend the student supports to private colleges.  I know the case has been made for this, but there are pros and cons that we would have to evaluate in terms of whether we take the step of going beyond the publicly funded colleges, with their known types of enrolment and attractions, to supporting for-profit colleges, and this would have to be done in a budgetary context.  This would be a sales element in their approach.  There is a for and against - I am not saying I am coming down on either side - that we would have to weigh up in public policy terms.</p> <p>  In terms of numbers, 80,000 students are supported on these grants and this year we have been able to extend them in a small way to postgraduate grants at the lowest level of income support.  However, this scheme has not been reviewed in a number of years and I suppose people will have to decide what is the priority here in terms of what we do with scarce grant funding for grants.  Do we look at extending the grant to private colleges or do we look at people who are coming into the system at a huge disadvantage and try to improve their terms of access?  There are choices here - I am not trying to prejudge them - that would have to be made in a budgetary context.</p></speech>

In the event of a hard Brexit, we may have to cater for these extra numbers.  Approximately 2,000 of those students currently avail of SUSI grants.</p></speech>

It is also the ambition of the British colleges to leave them uninterrupted, but the Chairman is right, and this is a contingency we have been looking at.</p></speech>

In regard to budgetary allocations, I had a meeting with principals in my constituency of Kildare South last Monday week and one of the key things they felt was needed was far more training in the teacher training colleges and afterwards around mental health, supporting positive mental health in schools, special needs and autistic spectrum disorder, ASD.</p><p>Increasingly, mainstream schools have more children with special needs in an inclusive setting, and rightly so.  A higher budget needs to be allocated for the training colleges to provide the appropriate training for teachers at that point, and this should be carried through to when those teachers are teaching.  They need to be given adequate resources and supports at that time.</p></speech>

It is because the Church of Ireland College of Education, which had been separately funded, is now funded through DCU due to its incorporation there, in that it has merged into a new college operating out of St. Patrick's as part of DCU.  I will get the figures for the Deputy but, to my knowledge, there is no reduction in the number being educated from year to year.</p> <p>  The Chairman made a good point about the investment in upskilling across the system.  While we do not want to stray into matters of policy, this is an area that deserves more thought.  There is a role for the training colleges, but much of the upskilling and in-service training is run through the education training centres, which recruit experts to deliver programmes.  I will provide the details of the programmes that are being delivered in the mental health area and the special needs area.  The Chairman is right that an investment in the area of upskilling is worthy of assessment in regard to whether we are up to best practice and what else we could do.</p> <p>  A positive development committee members might have read about is that we launched a postgraduate programme for principals which is to be jointly delivered by the University of Limerick, NUI Galway, UCD and Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  It is a bit of a pillar in the ground in that it is a programme for principals at work to upskill themselves, in part through distance learning.  There is a good case to be made in this regard and I will get some of the raw data for the committee.</p></speech>

For the Minister's information, we had a committee session around the whole area of positive mental health and we invited a number of witnesses.

I do not expect the Minister to talk about individual transactions, although if he can, all the better, because it is a lot of money.  I want to make clear that we support the provision of schools and we understand the predicament in which the Minister finds himself with regard to finding sites for schools.  How much of the capital budget is being eaten into by land costs?  This seems a massive amount of money, and while I understand the Department is forced to pay such an amount in that part of Dublin, is this having an impact on the building of schools?  Is the Department looking at the whole issue of land costs and what can be done about it?  There is also the question of what needs to be done beyond the Department.  I do not think it is sustainable that sites are bought for that amount of money because it eats into the Department's budget for building schools.</p></speech>

However, I have not heard much about it recently and I wonder whether it is still being used to the same extent.  It certainly seemed to be a very good use of money.</p> <p>  I am conscious that subhead D3 also provides for grants towards rental of temporary school premises, and I presume this means prefabs.  It was stated policy a short few years ago to get rid of all temporary accommodation, particularly prefabs, because the amount of money that has been expended on prefabs in the past 20 years is exorbitant.  It would seem that, with better forward planning, we should be in a position not to have those temporary buildings.  I will not say they are a waste of money because it is important students have an adequate place in which to be educated, but at the same time, it would seem not to be the appropriate way of allocating resources.</p></speech>

As members can imagine, land costs fell off and even halved at one point in 2013, but they have increased substantially since then.  This is taking up a little more than one twentieth of the budget but that figure is rising and it can wax and wane, depending on the year.

We continue to increase the number of places we are providing.  Last year we provided 22,288 places, so when compared with the previous year's 19,300 places, we increased the number of places by 3,000 in the year.  It is becoming more expensive, both due to building costs and site costs, but we are getting additional budget to respond to population pressures.  Nonetheless, this does inhibit our ability to do other things, which is just the way it is.</p> <p>  There has been a very significant reduction in the number of prefabs.  In December 2011, there were 1,525 rented prefabs and that figure dropped to 950 in December 2016.  As part of the six-year capital plan, there is a programme to unwind that and to move on.  That will start in 2019, so it is further down the road.</p> <p>  The devolved building programme is still very much alive and well, with 182 projects last year and 179 the previous year.  It is still there and there is also the new model of rapid build, so there is an effort to speed up that process and different models are being tried out to deal with that.</p></speech>

If not, I will call the Minister to reply.</p></speech>

That would be the arrangement in most of these cases.  More recently, I understand that new schools are not being built on patron's sites - they are being built on State sites where we have full ownership, which gives us that additional flexibility.  That seems to be the pattern.</p></speech>

The rumour is that a hotel is moving in, although I cannot verify that.  There should be some programme in the Department to examine this matter, because they all have a value.  It would seem to me that if the Minister is providing a new school and a new site, as he is now in many cases simply because sites are unaffordable and most of the newer patrons do not have any land-banks, surely it would significantly help the Department's capital budget, as a condition for providing the new school, to take over the old site and sell it to reimburse the coffers.</p></speech>

Sometimes there is a lack of consultation with local communities about the proposed use of an old school.  I have, however, seen really good results.  For example, in Rathangan where I am from, the old vocational school became a day care centre.  Step-down housing was also built for old people, which was fantastic.  The new boys' school is due to be opened on 16 June this year.  They moved from a boys' school that was built 30 years ago and which has been flattened.  It is interesting to note that we have an old boys' school which was built around the 1850s that is still in use for a community purpose.  It is regrettable that more exploration was not done with the community on possible uses for a building.  To be fair, part of the reason was that it was for a sports field.  There was a use for the land but there could have been more negotiation on the idea of providing adjacent land and using the building for something else.  I just wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

Obviously, if an old school had a future use we would pursue that.  If an old building had very limited value at that stage, we had a lien on the building and the land was in the patron's ownership, we would have very little by way of an asset to pursue.  As regards the issue of whether we can deploy them for community purposes, which would be outside the terms of the lien, that would have to be re-examined on its merits.  The land, however, would still be in private ownership.</p> <p>  These are arrangements which predate all of us.  The model then was that the land was owned by the patron, the building was built by the State and they put a lien on the use of the building.  It is therefore a question of when the change arises.  The Department has to evaluate what value it can recover and how best to deploy that for educational purposes.  The approach taken is that each case would be decided on its merits.</p></speech>

Should there not be some arrangement, however, simply to help replenish the coffers?  If the State is going to provide a new school site and replace a school building, we should be asking the patron to sign over the existing building when all that is done and we would then monetise it, or secure money for it which would contribute towards building the new premises.</p></speech>

I am second Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, where I head the division dealing with international, EU and British-Northern Ireland affairs.  Brexit represents a huge challenge right across Government, involving every Department to a greater or lesser extent.  My role in the Department of the Taoiseach includes supporting the Taoiseach in his capacity as chair of the Cabinet Committee on Brexit and in his role as a member of the European Council.  In this context, my main focus is on the EU negotiation process where I also serve as the Irish sherpa.</p> <p>  Given that Brexit raises policy issues for all Departments, I have asked colleagues to join me based primarily on the areas of interest highlighted in the letter inviting me to appear here today.  I am accompanied by Mr. Liam Irwin of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; Mr. James Martin from the Department of Justice and Equality; Mr. Ronan Gargan and Ms Sarah McGrath from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Mr. Brendan O&rsquo;Connor and Mr. Oliver Gilvarry from the Department of Finance; and Ms Pauline Mulligan and Mr. Eugene Forde from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p> <p>  I propose to give a brief overview of the Government&rsquo;s approach to and preparations for Brexit before we move on to questions.  The Government has been preparing for Brexit for over two years, and certainly well in advance of the UK referendum on 23 June 2016.  A detailed contingency framework was prepared in the run-up to the referendum.  It had been hoped, of course, that the outcome of the referendum would be different but, as we know, the people voted for the UK to leave the EU.  Early on, the Government identified four headline priorities arising from Brexit - protecting the Northern Ireland peace process, maintaining the common travel area, minimising the negative impact on trade and the economy, and contributing to the future direction of the EU.</p> <p>  In the period after the referendum, the Government intensified its preparations, building on the work already done.  A new Cabinet committee dealing specifically with Brexit was established, chaired by the Taoiseach.  A significant part of the EU division in the Department of the Taoiseach was moved back to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to ensure that the latter Department was adequately resourced to deal with the challenge of Brexit.  The Department of the Taoiseach was restructured, bringing the remaining staff dealing with international, EU and British and Northern Ireland affairs together under a new second Secretary General post, to which I was appointed in August 2016.  An interdepartmental group of senior officials was reinforced with a number of working groups set up to look at specific issues in more detail.  Departments and agencies with significant Brexit issues allocated additional resources as needed.</p> <p>  The work on preparing for Brexit was organised under a number of streams.  The analysis done under the contingency framework was deepened.  Stakeholder engagement was intensified through a stakeholder group that had been set up before the referendum and, later, through the all-island civic dialogue process, which so far has seen two plenary sessions and 14 sectoral events.  Departments and agencies also used existing forums or created new ones to ensure that they were engaging with their key stakeholders.</p> <p>  The Government set about a detailed process of engagement in four interrelated directions, namely Northern Ireland, Britain, each of the other EU member states and the EU institutions.  In Northern Ireland, this consisted of engagement through the North-South Ministerial Council, with the individual parties, and with the Northern Ireland civil service.  In London, existing channels of engagement were intensified, either through the mechanisms of the Good Friday Agreement or other bilateral channels.  A campaign was put in place to ensure that each of the other 26 member states was aware of our particular challenges and understood the extent of Brexit's impact in Ireland, with every member state targeted for engagement at both political and official level.  Similarly, detailed engagement took place with each of the EU institutions, including in particular the EU task force led by Mr. Michel Barnier.  Finally, all this work was supported by a broad-based communication effort, to ensure that the scale of the Brexit challenge was recognised, that the Government&rsquo;s priorities were clear, that stakeholders were being consulted and informed, and that the complicated process that would unfold was understood as broadly as possible.</p> <p>  The Government realised very early that Brexit was likely to impact Ireland more than any other member state, in terms of the economic and trading links between Ireland and the UK, and due to specific or unique factors arising from the history and geography of these islands.  It became clear that a major campaign would be needed to ensure that each other member state appreciated these unique or specific factors and was prepared to support Ireland in addressing them, irrespective of how significant Brexit was for their own country.  This involved explaining in clear terms the history of these islands, the evolution of the peace process, the specific features of the Good Friday and subsequent agreements, the history and rationale for the common travel area, the nature of the trading relations and patterns both on this island and between Ireland and Britain, and the sensitivities and risks associated with the Border on this island.  In particular, it was necessary to establish the politically sensitive nature of these issues, and the need for political solutions ahead of any rush to an overly legalistic or technocratic approach.</p> <p>  It was also clear that the way in which these issues would be addressed would have to fit into the evolving overall approach of the remaining member states to the Brexit negotiations under Article 50.  This meant there would be a united approach to the negotiations; there would be no separate or parallel negotiations with the UK; and issues specific to the withdrawal would have to be dealt with first while issues to do with economy and trade were likely to come later.  In particular, a full trade agreement with the UK could only be concluded and implemented after the UK had left, and this, in turn, would almost certainly mean that transitional arrangements of some sort would be required.  In the withdrawal phase, the focus would be on the financial settlement, the rights of citizens, relocation of EU agencies and specific border area challenges.</p> <p>  Against this backdrop, the Irish approach was to press for maximum recognition of our particular issues and challenges in the various documents being prepared, while also pushing for discussion on the future relationship to begin as soon as reasonably possible, including economic and trade issues and a smooth transition.  The overall campaign involved over 400 separate meetings with the other member states and the EU institutions at political, diplomatic and official level.  The approach has borne fruit.  Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter triggering Article 50, dated 29 March, contained strong references to Ireland and to our particular challenges.  The resolution of the European Parliament adopted in early April makes clear that the Irish challenges are high on the agenda of the Parliament, which under Article 50 must give its consent to any withdrawal agreement.  The EU negotiation guidelines, adopted by the European Council on 29 April, set out clearly the objectives of supporting the peace process, protecting the Good Friday Agreement, working to avoid a hard border and retaining the common travel area.  In addition, the minutes of that European Council will include an important statement by the 27 member states recognising the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement regarding Irish unity and confirming that EU membership is assured in such instance.  The draft EU negotiation directives, which are due to be adopted by the General Affairs Council next week, build on the language in the guidelines regarding Irish issues.  They also recognise the particular challenges for Ireland in terms of the proportion of goods to and from Ireland that transit via the UK.  These are very important acknowledgements of our particular circumstances and challenges.  Of course, this is just the beginning but it is a good start.  In particular, it confirms that the approach of focusing primarily on the elements most relevant or appropriate at any given stage in the process is paying off.</p> <p>  There have been a number of recent milestones in the Government&rsquo;s preparations and actions, apart from key events on the EU meeting calendar.  On 15 February, the Taoiseach gave a keynote speech at an International Institute of European Affairs event in the Mansion House, setting out the Government&rsquo;s overall approach which includes reaffirming Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the EU, protecting the peace process, and minimising the impact of Brexit on our economy and jobs.  The second plenary meeting of the all-island civic dialogue was held in Dublin Castle on 17 February.  In March, a booklet was published explaining the Government&rsquo;s four headline priorities in an attractive, easy to read manner.  Following the recent European Council meeting, the Government launched a document on 2 May setting out more detail on its approach to the upcoming negotiations.</p> <p>  While the initial focus of the negotiations is on the so-called exit issues, a greater emphasis on economy and trade issues will inevitably develop in respect of how the future trading relationship between the EU and UK evolves, and in light of the fact that even in the most benign Brexit scenario, a negative impact on our economy is anticipated.  That impact is likely to be varied across the country.  While there may be some economic opportunities from Brexit, they will not make up for the overall impact that is expected.  Mitigation action will therefore be required.  That is why, at the time of publication of its approach to the negotiations earlier this month, the Government also made clear that over the coming weeks it will publish a second document outlining its approach to mitigating the impact of Brexit on the economy, trade and jobs.</p> <p>  Work on those economic impacts and challenges will be complemented by efforts to take advantage of any economic opportunities.   We are already seeing significant signals of jobs moving to Ireland in the financial services sector.  Other sectors may follow.  The Government is presenting Dublin as a strong candidate for the relocation of the two EU agencies currently in London, namely the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority.</p><p>Returning to the forthcoming negotiations, which is the area with which I am primarily concerned, it is clear that they will be complex and challenging for us.  We have made a good start and the extensive campaign of engagement is paying off but we will have to continue, and intensify, this effort in the weeks and months ahead in order to identify and deliver satisfactory solutions to our specific concerns.  I thank members for their attention.  I and my colleagues will now be happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I will ask a few questions of Mr. Callinan, one of which is related to the issue raised by the Chairman, namely, trade.  Mr. Barnier reiterated the approach of the EU last week, namely, that the priorities in the first phase for the EU relate to border issues, citizens' rights and the financial settlement, in other words, the terms of the exit, and it is only after the terms of the exit are agreed that the EU will engage on the question of the future and the future trading relationship between the UK and the European Union.  Could I ask the Irish perspective on that?  Given that there is a real risk that the negotiations will simply run out of time, and if the ECJ finding today does have relevance in relation to any transitional arrangement, for example, any future trade deal between the EU and the UK, and it has to be ratified by every single national parliament and regional parliament within the European Union, how concerned is Mr. Callinan that we will not be able to avoid the cliff effect of the UK falling out of the European Union and no transitional arrangements being in place to prevent the automatic default of WTO trade terms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Callinan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051600002#E00900"><p>The way the negotiations are structured and sequenced means it is correct to say they begin with the exit issues the Deputy mentioned, but it is not quite as clear cut as saying they must be fully agreed before we move on.  The language in the guidelines talks about sufficient progress being made, so I think there is room there for the talks process to make a certain amount of progress.  People talk about the tone and the goodwill factor as much as the detail of the talks.  The expectation is that if reasonable or sufficient progress is made early on those issues the discussion on the future framework can get going reasonably early.  Realistically, people are thinking in terms of maybe before the end of the year - probably not much earlier than that.  Certainly, we have argued that it is absolutely important that we can get those discussions going as early as possible, but it is a matter of law that even if those discussions move on and make good progress, legally, a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU can only be finalised and implemented as and when the UK is a third country so there will inevitably be some moment between the UK's departure and the new free trade agreement coming into effect, and that of course argues on the need for transitional arrangements.  While obviously the devil is in the detail and that remains to be seen, we have worked on the basis that it is most likely, and consistent I suppose with the ECJ judgment today, that the likely shape of a future free trade agreement would be what is known as a mixed agreement and would probably require national member state ratification in any event.  We have been working on that assumption.</p></speech>

Is that the position of the Government?</p></speech>

If the UK leaves the customs union, which seems certain at this stage, there will be a customs border &ndash; there will be some form of interface, and how seamless and frictionless it will be is a matter for negotiation.  Could he tell us about the work Revenue is doing with its counterparts in the UK to ensure the Border is as invisible as possible?</p></speech>

Clearly, any negotiation will be the between the European Union and the UK.  We are not in any form of negotiation or even having any discussion with the UK at this point.  What we are doing is scenario planning and looking at what the options may be.  Much of that will clearly depend on what form of future arrangements will take place.  It can be expected that the UK will be outside the Single Market and almost certainly outside the customs union.  Assuming the UK is outside the customs union, it will be a third country for customs purposes.  We are working on that likely assumption and within that there is a very broad spectrum of a very close trade arrangement with the European Union.  Clearly, it could be much worse but we hope that will not be the case.</p> <p>  We are doing a lot of work.  In the first instance, one thing we are examining in very close detail at present is our IT infrastructure.  The number and the value of customs declarations &ndash; the number even more so than the value of customs - will clearly increase, possibly by a factor of ten.  Therefore, our IT systems need to be examined for scalability, and we are doing that.  As it happens, those systems are being reviewed in any event in the context of the UCC, the union customs code.</p></speech>

Many of those would be cross-Border in Ireland of a small value but big in number.  We are looking at our IT systems and what we need to do to scale those to deal with that eventuality, which is to some extent a likelihood assuming the UK is outside the customs union.</p> <p>  We are looking at border arrangements in various external borders of the EU, particularly in the context of the Irish Border and how small local trade is facilitated.  Apart from looking at that, we have not seen anything that we would attach to and say that is the way to go, but we are studying what arrangements are there and what opportunities there might be in the customs code.</p> <p>  Generally, whatever happens it is clear that a border with the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, would not be what we saw in 1993 just because customs have moved on and become electronic.  We are looking at what types of arrangement might be there and to what extent they can facilitate trade.  The initial thinking is more or less on trade facilitation and making sure trade moves north, south, east and west and using the landbridge across Ireland the UK.  That is the work we are doing at present - scenario planning, scaling, looking at what particular arrangements we may be able to do - but any negotiation on that clearly will be with the European Union and the UK.</p></speech>

In practice, what does that mean in a scenario where some tariffs apply, for example?  What is the best case scenario in terms of maximum use of technology and so on?  Are we looking at trucks not being stopped at all, at any point, in terms of crossing the Border, and what is the worst case scenario?  What are we looking at in practice?</p></speech>

The scenario I envisage is electronic declaration - electronic approval or non-approval.  In terms of routing, what is in place already is green, which is go, orange, which is a documentary check, and red, which is usually a physical check.  Currently, that is of the order of 6% to 8% of traffic.  I cannot see that changing in any significant way.  Goods that are routed need to make some form of presentation; it depends on the particular routing.  That could be done at the Border, but it does not have to be done at the Border and possibly will not be done.  The facilitation stations will be somewhere in the proximity of the Border.  It depends hugely on the type of exit that happens and as Mr. Callinan said, we are almost certainly likely to need a transition.  It is difficult to see this switching overnight on Brexit day.</p></speech>

What is the position of the Irish Government on the way in which the United Kingdom is used as a land bridge, as such, for Irish exporters accessing markets across the rest of the European Union?  While tariffs may not apply, a very significant administrative burden could be placed on companies that are having to deal with that issue.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the application of state-aid rules within the UK post-Brexit.  There is a concern within the business community here that if the UK will be free of the constraints of EU state-aid rules, in many respects it will be in a position to compete unfairly for businesses with Ireland and other EU countries because the State will be able to intervene and directly provide supports and subsidies to attract investment into the UK, which could have a very serious and direct knock-on consequence for Ireland.  What is the Government's position on the common transit area and the application of state aid in the UK post-Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Callinan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051600002#F00500"><p>To take the common transit area first, the Government is very concerned about the importance of transit through the UK for goods from Ireland to the rest of Europe and <i>vice versa</i>.  Our concern is to have as little complication as possible in that regard.  One of the things we have managed to do is that in the move from the negotiating guidelines agreed by the European Council to the next document currently being negotiated - the negotiation directives - we succeeded in getting into the draft a specific reference to the unique geographic issues in terms of transit for Ireland and that this would have to be recognised and addressed.  In much the same way as many of the other points I was making earlier, while we have a good hook on which to build, we have managed to assert that as a critical unique factor for Ireland.  It is something of which we are highly conscious.<br/><br/>In terms of the concerns relating to state aid that the Deputy mentioned, the negotiating guidelines provide for the possibility of a close trading agreement between the UK and the European Union but, to use the Deputy's phrase, they are very much conscious of need for a level playing field.  They make clear that they will not be keen to facilitate an agreement that would have, for example, a much more lax approach under state aid, tax provisions or whatever it might be to give a competitive advantage to the UK.  That is anticipated in the EU guidelines and is recognised as something that would have to be prevented, but that in turn becomes part of the negotiating process with the UK.</p></speech>

On the issue of a veto, we have an unprecedented situation in British-Irish relations where all through history, through the good times and the bad, the relationship was always negotiated between Ireland and Britain.  For the first time in history, the future of Ireland's relationship with the UK will be negotiated between the UK and a third party.  We have one seat at a table of 27 and while we have some warm words, we are nonetheless one of 27, and it represents an unprecedented risk to us.</p> <p>  The Spanish got a veto on the future relationships with Gibraltar.  I take the point that if the future relationship is a mixed agreement, it is possible that member states, including Ireland, will have a veto.  However, the ECJ ruling today lays out, in its agreement with Singapore, that on practically every issue there would be no member state veto.  The ECJ ruling is important because it lays out where Ireland would not have a veto, assuming the same legal opinion is used.  That would include access to EU markets for goods and services including transport, procurement, energy generation, foreign direct investment, intellectual property rights, anti-competitive activity, sustainable development, exchange of information and so on.  What the ECJ is saying is that in all of these areas, member states do not have competence.  Following that, in all of those areas Ireland would not have a veto on any future relationship between the UK and the European Union.</p> <p>  The ECJ ruling goes on to state that only in two areas does the agreement with Singapore encroach into member state competence.  One of them is portfolio investment, or non-direct investment, and the second is dispute resolution between investors and the states.  That is reasonably technical bureaucratic stuff, but on the day-to-day issues that will affect Irish farmers, business people and citizens looking not just to travel to the UK but also to work and reside there, the ECJ ruling would suggest that we will not have a veto.  This is an unprecedented situation where, essentially, Ireland is not a lead negotiator in its own future relationship with the UK.  I am hearing from numerous sources who are talking to groups around Europe, that, at a minimum, France, Germany and some other member states have a fairly hostile view of these negotiations.  They see it as an opportunity to teach the UK a lesson.  Did the Irish Government seek a veto on any aspects of our future relationship with the UK?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Callinan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051600002#F00700"><p>The point I would make is that, essentially, these arrangements are governed by the legal framework.  I take the Deputy's points about the ECJ ruling.  I have not had a chance to read it and other colleagues may have so I will respectfully reserve judgment on that as to what exactly it would mean.  However, with regard to the Irish-UK issues and the Gibraltar one, the position is quite different in that the Irish Government approach in respect of the Northern Ireland situation essentially has been that the Good Friday Agreement governs the issue.  There is no such framework governing the UK-Spanish situation on Gibraltar.  That was the key difference between those two issues.</p> <p>  More generally, the Government did not seek specifically a veto in respect of it, but if we are talking about exercising a veto on the withdrawal, the net point is that we would end up with a worse situation because if we do not have a negotiated withdrawal, we have a hard exit.  That is something to be avoided.</p> <p>  In terms of what the future trade negotiation would ultimately look like, the detail of that will determine the voting rules on it.  Colleagues with more expertise on this might wish to add more detail, but that would be my sense of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051600002#F00800"><p>There are two obvious issues in respect of which to seek a veto.  One is a veto on the withdrawal only as it pertains to Northern Ireland.  The second would be to seek a veto, which is what the Spanish have achieved, on the future relationship only in so far as it pertains to Anglo-Irish relations.  I will give Mr. Callinan an example of where European law and existing Anglo-Irish agreements may bump against each other.  The common travel area is widely supported.  However, diplomats I have met from EU member states have explained that the common travel area is not about Irish people and UK citizens being able to visit each other's countries.</p><p>It is a full bilateral reciprocity of rights, including the right to vote.  Therefore, when we talk about full ongoing implementation and recognition of the common travel area, CTA, what we mean is that every Irish citizen will enjoy the right to work, as UK citizens, in the UK regardless of whether that same right is afforded to any other EU member state.  When one explains it like that, one gets a very different response.  Now the response from foreign diplomats is, "Hang on a second.  Are you suggesting that you should have the right to work in London, but my colleagues in Spain shouldn't?"</p><p> That is an obvious place to seek a veto because it is a unique agreement between Ireland and the UK.  Was any veto and any additional leverage, other than being one of 27, sought on the future relationships specifically around issues like the common travel area and the right of Irish citizens to work in the UK?</p></speech>

Everything we have produced, both in our documentation and in discussions with our partners, has made that clear.  For the reasons that Deputy Donnelly correctly illustrated, we have been unambiguous in this regard.  I think that is understood and recognised, so the issue of seeking a veto in respect of it did not arise.  However, the net point remains of what the effect would be of exercising such a veto.</p></speech>

The point of a veto is that it gives one leverage.  What concerns me is that the British have very little leverage in these negotiations and the Irish have even less.  By far the most important economic, political and cultural relationship Ireland has ever had, or is ever likely to have, is with the UK.  That, however, is now being largely negotiated beyond our control.  Any leverage such as a veto would have been useful.</p></speech>

Despite that, only three in 20 companies have done anything about it and only five in 20 intend doing anything about it, which suggests a big skills gap.  These are sophisticated businesses that live in the real world.  If they know something is going to harm them yet most do not intend doing anything about it, it is not because they are stupid but because, I would imagine, they do not know what to do or do not have the resources or capability.</p><p>A report in the <i>The Times</i>published new European and UK data which show that 50% of EU companies using British supply chains are beginning to rewire their supply chains out of the UK.  The report also shows that one in three UK firms with EU supply chains are rewiring their supply chains back into the UK.  I know that both surveys cannot be compared perfectly, but they suggest that while Irish businesses are the most exposed to Brexit of the EU 27, they are certainly not ahead of the curve in preparing for it.  We have two of the best State agencies in the world in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, yet we are not seeing a response on the ground.  I know that Enterprise Ireland is engaging with its clients.  Based on conversations I have had, it would seem that some of the engagements are good but others are not.</p><p>While this is not a criticism of Enterprise Ireland, there has yet to be a national response on the ground.  We will know there is a national response when we hear advertisements on the car radio saying, &quot;If you've any exposure, come to your local office.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Callinan referred to a new strategy that he will be bringing out shortly.  Will he give us a sense of the scale of the response the Government intends embarking on in having a direct engagement not just with the big 400 companies or EI clients, but also with every farmer and business that has any exposure to the UK and Brexit?</p></speech>

It is not a one day moment.  It is an ongoing process that is gradually building up.  A number of measures have already been introduced in last year's budget, and it was made clear that would be the first of a sequence.  The Government has said it will publish a comprehensive approach to this in the coming weeks.  There are specific actions happening through the various agencies the Deputy mentioned and others, including An Bord Bia.  It does not lend itself to a simple big bang on day one, but measures are being prepared right across the economic agencies and Departments.  Some of them have already been rolled out.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Mulligan, from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to say a little bit more about what is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pauline Mulligan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051600002#G00700"><p>As Mr. Callinan said, from our perspective the Department has had a two-pronged approach to responding to Brexit.  The first is about support for companies through the enterprise agencies.  It is also about analysis and research to ensure we are doing what we need to do to support companies through the agencies.  In addition, it is about preparing for the negotiations, so I might talk about that separately.</p> <p>  I will talk specifically about Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, IDA Ireland, and InterTradeIreland which deals with companies in the Border regions.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, secured additional funding in budget 2017.  Enterprise Ireland has been working with 1,500 companies exporting to the UK but with specific attention to the 600 that are most exposed to the UK market.  We saw the results from Enterprise Ireland yesterday.  While some work has been done, there is a lot more to do in terms of helping companies to prepare for Brexit.</p> <p>  The scorecard introduced by Enterprise Ireland, which is not just for EI clients, has been a great innovation.  It has been broadly welcomed as a diagnostic tool to help companies.  They fill out the form online and the system helps them to identify areas where they have prepared but could do better compared with best practice.  The scorecard is open to all companies and not just EI clients.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to engage with companies.  Its strategy is about diversification, innovation, product lines and diversifying markets outside the UK.  The new eurozone strategy was announced yesterday along with the results.  Enterprise Ireland is working closely with companies.</p> <p>  The impact of currency fluctuations was a particular concern for companies, so we engaged in qualitative and quantitative research analysis earlier this year.  We interviewed more than 1,000 companies to see what their needs were in the context of Brexit, both in the short and medium term.  That is the survey launched recently by the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.  The results of that survey showed that while the short-term impacts were not felt as much, companies are saying that more impact will be felt in the medium term.</p> <p>  In response to that, the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, secured the agreement of the Cabinet committee on economy and jobs to do three things.  The first is to develop proposals for a short-term working capital guarantee scheme for SMEs.  My Department is working on that.  The second thing is to scope out the development of a modern medium-term business development loan scheme.  My colleagues are working on that with colleagues in other Departments, including the Department of Finance.  Both schemes would be rolled out through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The third and final thing was to scope out this idea of a financial advisory hub for SMEs.  All those are specific policy responses that we are putting in place based on the evidence we have gathered from companies we have spoken to.</p> <p>  As regards the next steps, we are involved in a range of other analysis and research.  This includes looking at sectors which are most exposed and the impact on cross-Border trade.  We funded InterTradeIreland to do a specific piece of research which is due to be published soon.  It will examine the impact of a hard Brexit on cross-Border trade, with the UK being outside the Single Market and the customs union.  It will also look at the impact on goods and trade.</p> <p>  We are also looking at the 18 sectors that are most exposed, based on their percentage of exports as a proportion of overall exports to the UK.</p><p>We are looking at the most exposed sectors by reference to the percentage of total exports and imports in each case.  We are also profiling trade between the United Kingdom, Ireland and other member states and looking at all possible scenarios, from a hard Brexit to a comprehensive free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  This will inform our deliberations on further supports for companies and positions in the negotiations to come.</p></speech>

"Special status" is just a phrase which means different things to different people.  Some think it means keeping Northern Ireland in the Single Market, but it is not in the gift of the Dublin Government to decide that this should happen, if it is not the wish of the people of Northern Ireland.  It would also have to be negotiated with the United Kingdom.  There are different interpretations of what the special circumstances are, but we have secured a commitment from the European Union to look at them imaginatively and flexibly.  The meaning of "special status" has not been universally agreed.</p></speech>

It is not for me to comment on the relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas, to which the Senator referred.  We have not specifically sought special designated status because it is not clear what we would mean by it.  We have said we have to work collectively on the challenges for the island and Northern Ireland.  We sought to have detailed discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland parties to reach a consensus on how to deal with the particular challenges.  That is the right way to do it as we will not be able to deliver a solution to which significant groups are opposed.  We have to arrive at a format that will make sense for as many people as possible.  We have to be more precise on what "special designated status" means.</p></speech>

I am really concerned about the earlier discussion in which it emerged that we had not even asked for a veto on certain aspects.  This is a card we have to play.  Without doing so, everything is just words, grand intentions.  Mr. Callinan says we have been working on this issue for two years, but it worries me that we have not even asked for a veto, let alone asked for one and been turned down.</p></speech>

Article 50 is the legal framework which allows for the withdrawal process.  If we do not arrive at a negotiating outcome, there will be a hard exit; therefore, the exercising of a veto would not safeguard the interests to which the Senator referred.</p></speech>

The only mention of Ireland is in a restatement of support for the peace process which has always been there and is, of course, very welcome.  There is a vague statement about flexible and imaginative solutions being needed to avoid a hard border, but there is nothing concrete.  "Flexible and imaginative" is diplomatic-speak for "We have no idea".  Mr. Barnier has been honest with us and told us that the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union will have consequences.  He said he had a duty to tell the truth in this regard and that customs controls were part of EU border management.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and I have made freedom of information requests on what the imaginative and flexible solutions might be, but we have hit a brick wall.  We cannot accept that Border communities be kept in the dark about what Brexit might mean for them.</p> <p>  Mr. Irwin said there were ten times more declarations and paperwork for people trading across a border and that we were looking for better facilitation stations or IT solutions, but that provides no reassurance for companies trading across the Border.  How many extra IT staff have been brought in for this purpose?  I cannot get my head around how it might be approached without talking to the UK revenue authorities.</p></speech>

The question is how we manage and control this and what arrangements can be put in place.  That leads to the question of whether we will need border controls between Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction, but the broader issue is whether there will be two customs regimes.  We have secured agreement on finding a creative and flexible way of dealing with the matter in order that we will not have the hard border we used to have on the island, with frontier and customs control posts.</p></speech>

We are all looking for the same thing and want to avoid a hard border.  Whether it is with special designated status or by arriving at flexible and imaginative solutions, it amounts to the same thing.  If the specific proposal is for Northern Ireland to effectively remain in the Eurpean Union or the Single Market, it is much more complicated because it is not in Dublin's gift to demand this.  It relates to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and the relationship between Dublin, Belfast and London, before one even starts to talk about the role of the European Union.</p></speech>

There is a cost, clearly.  We are already deeply engaged with trade.  One of my colleagues, who is the assistant secretary in this area, was in Galway this morning talking to the Irish Exporters Association about the training and registration processes which might apply in the event of these things happening.  So we are engaging.</p><p> The Senator asked about the additional resources we had in IT.  At this stage we do not need them; our existing resource is examining and scaling the system with some consultancy assistance.  We have a commitment from Government for whatever funding we will need to scale our IT systems.  As I mentioned earlier, in the context of the Union customs code, we need to undertake significant investment between now and 2020 on that and the changes to what we call our AEP system would be included in that overall programme.  Until we do the scaling we are not quite sure what the level of investment is.  It may actually not be significant because the systems were built for scalability anyway.  Details of exact costs and resource requirements will come when we conduct that study which is ongoing at present.</p></speech>

There is a balancing act between pursuing our clear objectives in the negotiations on the one hand, and then recognising that there are still risks and downsides.  Therefore there is a timing issue in how to deploy that.  If it is deployed too soon, it looks like having more or less given up on what the overall negotiating outcome would be.  There is a balancing act to be struck there.  We are looking at the state aid rules and what further measures might be possible.

I want to tease out further some of the earlier questions.  Deputy Michael McGrath asked about effect of border customs controls if the UK were outside the customs union.

When Commissioner Moscovici appeared before the committee and I asked him, he said it does not exist anywhere in Europe.

Customs arrangements de facto arise once there are two different customs regimes, but whether they are reliant on actual border controls is a second-order issue and that is where we are saying we will need to have maximum creativity and flexibility.</p></speech>

We also hear European language that is militarised - the language of hard customs controls in Europe where borders are actually armed, whereas soft borders are where there are just normal customs controls.  What do we mean by minimising?  What would have to happen in order to have no customs controls?</p></speech>

It is important to think of this in the broad sense.  Obviously, if there are tariffs we will have a very particular situation to deal with.  However, independent of the question of tariffs, there is a range of regulatory issues.  It is important not to exclude the possibility that we could arrive at a satisfactory all-island approach to much of the regulatory stuff.  Much of this depends on the UK's approach and the extent to which, for example, devolved powers to the regional assemblies would be part of the post-Brexit scenario.  Across a range of areas, including animal health, energy and other areas, we are investigating ways in which we can arrive at an all-island solution that works and meets everyone's needs.  It not easy, simple or obvious as to how that would be done.  That is the kind of thing we are looking at.  Solving those kinds of things would go a long way towards removing some of the other complications that inevitably arise in the way the Deputy is describing where we might have to look at a hard border.</p></speech>

They were never on the Border; they were just off the Border on the Irish side or the British side or whatever side.  That is how customs will operate; it will be on the territory.

I received 31 documents containing that type of records in reply to that query .  A number of them are from the Revenue Commissioners.  They include presentations to several Departments and email exchanges.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has said that the Revenue Commissioners are making contingency plans.  In view of the fact that we cannot dictate the outcome of Brexit, why would it not do so?  The Revenue Commissioners are, therefore, looking at all possibilities.  That includes the establishment of possible customs posts along the Border, as indicated by the documents I received.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

None of us is naive enough to think that it is planning before Brexit negotiations have begun.  I asked if it is the case that Revenue has contingency plans in regard to customs posts along the Border.  Until I referred to the freedom of information document I received which quotes 31 records, the witness said it was trade facilitation.  That is not my main point.  My main point is to ask why we cannot see the 31 records?  What is so top secret that we cannot see what Revenue is thinking about if we do not get the type of agreement with our EU partners or Britain in regard to Brexit we would like?  I cross the Border on the way to the Oireachtas.  Businesses will have to cross it.  We need to speak the truth here and tell people what is possible and what one of the likely outcomes is.  We must then outline how we will counteract that or work towards a different outcome.  Why does the Revenue not release its briefing documents to Members of the Oireachtas?  Why are we being kept in the dark in regard to contingency planning?  What is so secret about it?  This issue is not part of negotiations but is preparing for a potential outcome of the negotiations.  It has nothing to do with a negotiating strategy.  I do not understand this.  Why would this type of information not be provided to an Oireachtas committee on finance which is trying to deal with these issues and holding hearings over the next few days on this issue?</p></speech>

Based on current experience, most of those items would be diverted for a documentary check and a small number sent for physical inspection.  There would not be customs stops on the Border such as applied until 1992 as described by the Deputy.  That is not the process we envisage.  Declarations will be electronic.  The stations will be there mainly for trade facilitation to clarify issues.  There would be some form of customs intervention but not at those stations.  It would probably comprise mobile intervention of some consignments, either randomly or randomly with risk rating.  The trade facilitation station will be very different from the customs stations the Deputy remembers.</p></speech>

That is welcome information that this committee should have.  It brings some clarity.  Language is being used which is not getting to the substance of the issue.  What is meant by the phrase, "no return to the borders of the past"?  Is it that no British soldiers will be standing at a customs post as customs officers check if a person has two pounds of bacon in the back of the car?  That is what people remember.  However, the scenario outlined, which I acknowledge is contingency planning rather than an plan for certain implementation, in terms of Border patrols and spot checks and so on, including a facility which could lead to up to 8% of traffic being diverted to it, is a major worry for businesses, particularly in Donegal, the county from which I come.  People and companies there such as haulage companies have to cross the Border.  While we are preparing contingency plans on this side of the Border, a similar process may be taking place on the other side.  Is that not the case?  Travelling from Buncrana or Gweedore, a person might reach a trade facilitation post 8 km from Lifford and then have to pass another one 8 km from Strabane.  By the time that person reached Aughnacloy, he or she could have been stopped twice more.  That could be problematic, in particular if fresh product was being transported.</p> <p>  My colleague asked Mr. Callinan about special status for Northern Ireland within the European Union.  I appreciate he said it does not matter what we call it.  There is some truth in that.  However, the Oireachtas has voted that the Government should seek special status for Northern Ireland with the European Union.  I understand the witness's role and that he is responsible to the Taoiseach.  However, in a democracy one must have regard to the will of the majority of the people.  Mr. Callinan mentioned that it is not his place to demand special status.  In reality, it is, and he has that authority.  The Oireachtas has given him, or at least the Taoiseach, that authority.  He is not able to ensure the special status is secured but neither can he ensure we do not have a hard Border or hard Brexit and so on.  There is a requirement for special status for Northern Ireland within the European Union.  As we are dealing with 26 other member states in addition to Britain, who obviously have their own opinion on this matter, the only way we can prevent what Mr. Irwin has spoken about, which could decimate industries across the Border community which must cross the Border daily, is by Northern Ireland being within the customs union.  That would require it to be in the EU and special designated status is therefore required.  Although Mr. Callinan works under direction, I ask him to bring that back.  I make that point to him again.</p> <p>  The witnesses said that fiscal exceptions are being reviewed and that they will work within the fiscal rules.  They are aware of the now widespread Sinn F&eacute;in position, which is that the fiscal rules do not work and need to be renegotiated.  However, there is leeway to deviate from the fiscal rules in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Are we going to argue or are we willing to make the argument that the outcome of Brexit should be deemed an exceptional circumstance under the fiscal rules?  That could allow us to invest in areas where normally we would not be allowed to invest in the case of no exceptional circumstances.  If Brexit is not an exceptional circumstance for this country, God knows what is.</p><p> I have two further small questions.</p></speech>

We have to be careful not to prejudge the outcome in a bad way at such an early point in the negotiations.  That is important.  The Government's clear stated preference is to have the closest possible trading relationship between the EU and the UK, which, in turn, minimises many of the problems and challenges we are talking about.  We have to be careful not to take a position in some other area that gives the impression that we have already folded our tent on the issue.  That is also important.  It is not to say that we are not looking at all these issues but we have to be careful that we do not prejudge our negotiating position.</p></speech>

I mean that because we need a positive outcome in the negotiations.  The points we are putting forward will be published in a further document on Brexit dealing with some of the issues that I am raising.  We will send it to the officials.</p> <p>  We wish the officials well, but no matter how good the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, I do not believe that there is not going to be a negative impact on this State.  We are all familiar with the impact in terms of World Trade Organization tariffs.  We are talking about unemployment levels going up 2%, &euro;20 billion onto the national debt and GDP reduction of between 3% and 4%, depending on whether we take the figures of the Department of Finance, the ESRI or the Central Bank.  Even if we do not get the type of hard exit or WTO tariffs, we are also looking at significant impacts in the country, and I do not believe any positive outcomes would offset those.  Is the question of exceptional circumstances laid down within the fiscal rules something the officials are willing to look at?</p></speech>

The point I would make is that it becomes part of a wider set of issues in terms of the overall fiscal management and investment strategy of the Government.  Brexit will be an important factor, but by no means the only factor, influencing the decisions that have to be taken.</p></speech>

The maintenance of the trading relationship to the greatest extent and the transitional arrangements that we would hope for would be close to the status quo.  A hard Brexit is very different.  It is difficult to make the case for exemptions from fiscal rules unless we have something to hang it on, at least at this point.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty's comments are fair.  Clearly, Deputy Doherty is familiar with the research we have put out on a hard Brexit.  We have put out the research to inform and stimulate debate and the types of questions Deputy Doherty is asking.  We probably need to know a little more about the negotiating outcome before we make those through the Council formations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-16a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051600002#L00600"><p>That is valid.  I have one last question but I want to make another comment first.  The outcome will determine whether there would be a trigger but I expect the normal process in negotiations would involve this being teased out.  If that is the outcome, what would trigger the exceptional circumstances provision?  Usually, we do not leave it until the end to find out the outcome.  I am offering this as something that should be done during the negotiation process.</p> <p>  My last point relates to state aid.  I welcome the comments of the deputation on state aid.  We have already seen industries being severely impacted as a result of Brexit, for example, in terms of currency fluctuations.  The mushroom sector is one case in point.</p> <p>  State aid rules do not require amendment.  At this point, they require the flexibility to do certain things.  They require the flexibility that is built within them to be utilised.  I do not believe this is something that can be left to the end point.  Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union relates to state aid rules and is clear.  It allows aid to promote the execution of the important project of common European interests or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a member state.  I beg the deputation to make it clear as part of the negotiation strategy that Article 107(3)(b) needs to be initiated because of a serious disturbance in the economy of a member state.  If that takes place, we would not have to spend six, nine or 12 months negotiating while we see employment in companies going to the wall or people joining dole queues or emigrating.  The flexibility is in place.</p> <p>  We have all the research from the Department of Finance.  We do not know the outcome of the negotiations, but it needs to be agreed that the provision can be switched on at any time.  Brexit should be seen as a serious disturbance.  If the Council does not believe that it is a serious disturbance, then what we are reading in the newspapers or what we are hearing in the media suggests something different.  I appeal to the deputations to promote agreement in principle at negotiation level that the article can be triggered and that Brexit can be deemed as such.</p></speech>

It is a good example, if not by any means the only one, of how complex this process will be.  This is reinforced by the Senator's point that the nature of the aviation industry is such that a great deal of planning is done up to 12 months in advance in terms of capacity building, ticket selling and so on.  It is one of the issues we have been impressing on the Commission task force.  While it is not unique to Ireland, we have a particular interest in having the issue addressed early.  We have been impressing on Mr. Barnier's task force that it cannot be left to be picked up in a future trade agreement.  Aviation is not currently on the list of immediate withdrawal issues and we are pushing hard to ensure it will be addressed as early as possible in the negotiations for precisely the reasons the Senator raised.</p></speech>

In terms of the overall approach, there are specific sectors, of which energy is another obvious example.  We want to ensure we continue to have interconnection both on the island and between the United Kingdom and Ireland in terms of electricity and gas supplies.  On aviation, we want to ensure clarity concerning the arrangements, whether with the United Kingdom as a third country, between the European Union and the United Kingdom or in respect of other third countries with flights to Europe, including the United Kingdom and onwards to other EU countries.  There is a large set of issues in the aviation sector which will have to be addressed.  The discussion will have to be broadened to address a number of individual sectors.</p></speech>

In effect, what will be required, assuming that the United Kingdom presses ahead with the overall approach, is a new agreement negotiated between the United Kingdom and the European Union.

This will have a negative effect in attracting financial service companies to relocate to Ireland rather than elsewhere, including Paris and Frankfurt.

The Central Bank does not have a competition mandate as this mandate was removed post-2010.  On some of the comments made, the Minister and the Central Bank have made it clear that we want substance in relation to entities moving to this jurisdiction.  The way the international financial services sector works is that some activities are outsourced, as it were.  However, we want substance on the ground to ensure we will not see the creation of empty shells - the phrase used is "brass plates" - in this jurisdiction.  We want entities to move here which would be creating substantive and continuous employment.  The Central Bank is taking a pragmatic view of applications and we are engaging with entities that are considering moving to Ireland, among other jurisdictions.  We are hearing positive reports.  The role of the regulator is to challenge firms to put forward a case on how they will deal with concerns the Central Bank may have.  In our experience, this has been a constructive process and the Central Bank is engaging proactively with the firms in question.  The Department and IDA Ireland are working with the Central Bank to try to attract as much industry as possible.  As I stated, this must be industry that puts substance on the ground here.</p></speech>

I understand Mr. Barnier has indicated that 65% of Irish exports to mainland Europe transit the United Kingdom.  Does this present opportunities in terms of a mechanism down the road?  Goods are currently trucked through the United Kingdom free of tariffs and VAT.  If businesses in the United Kingdom were to relocate here, would they be able to transport goods tariff free through the United Kingdom to mainland Europe rather than continuing to pay tariffs if they were to remain in the United Kingdom?  Does this present an opportunity for Ireland?  If that is the case, how would this mechanism work in practice?  Having spoken to many individuals working for multinational companies, this is the number one issue for many of them.  It is currently economic for companies to transport goods through the United Kingdom.  If this is no longer an option, they may relocate to the United Kingdom or mainland Europe, which would present major difficulties for us.  I have no doubt that this issue has appeared on the delegates' radar.  I ask them to comment.</p></speech>

The Department's overall approach is that for goods travelling through the United Kingdom - whatever the percentage, it is a substantial proportion - we want to continue with an arrangement that is as close as possible to the current one.  If the United Kingdom will be a third country from a customs point of view, there are transit provisions that could be operated to minimise, albeit not entirely eliminate, disruption.</p> <p>  If I understood the Senator correctly, the second issue he raised is separate.  He referred to a UK company selling into the European Union which would, post-Brexit, potentially face tariffs and might, therefore, choose to relocate some of its activity to Ireland or another EU country.  We have a very successful story today of companies from the United State locating in Ireland.  In that sense, as long as companies do this in full compliance with EU and Internal Market rules, the scenario presented by the Senator would be an option for a UK company that wished to trade into the European Union.  However, it would not be possible to somehow move goods into Ireland and then move them using a transit procedure to avoid tariffs.</p></speech>

About 80% of our goods trade going from Ireland to the UK is land bridge.  The others are primarily Rosslare and the airports.  Land bridge is also used for goods from Donegal transiting Northern Ireland, down to Dublin and other parts of the Republic.  There is land bridge for quite a large volume of Northern Ireland goods coming down to Dublin Port to go the UK.  There are different scenarios, but there are standard procedures, depending on the nature of the future relationship and how onerous or light they will be.

In total I believe there are 28 people in total.  All of them, to some extent, have a Brexit function, whether it is our international or EU business or British-Northern Ireland.  It is hard to say definitively how many are exclusively or full-time working on Brexit.  The Britain and Northern Ireland team has a core of seven or eight people working on Brexit, and also on the EU side there is a small team to work specifically on Brexit issues as well.</p></speech>

Deputy Donnelly alluded earlier to the idea that there are four or five of the 27 member states who will be very affected in terms of trade.  The further away from the UK a member state is the less affected the member state will be.  In Hungary, Romania or Bulgaria Brexit is not as big a deal as it is to Ireland or the Netherlands or France in terms of various products, exporting, trade and even tourism.  Are there some people who are quite interested in punishing a member state which is trying to leave?  Does the idea exist that Britain is on its way out of the EU and that we should not make it particularly easy for them to leave?  We do not want to make it easy for other countries with elements of Euro-scepticism to leave, who might see that they can have their cake and eat it?  Has there been experience of that kind of attitude?  It is important that we understand that not everything is perfect and that not everyone understands everything about Brexit.  I presume that people in countries like Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary are not all that bothered about Ireland and are worrying about themselves.</p></speech>

There is no doubt but that Brexit has an uneven impact or resonance on the different member states.  We have unapologetically said that we believe that we are the most affected, for a variety of reasons, and have engaged on an extensive diplomatic and political campaign to reinforce that.  On the other hand, the key point is that the impact and priorities are different.  They are uneven, but also different.  The further east one travels the more the member states are concerned with the issues of citizen's rights.  In some of the countries mentioned they are very concerned about the treatment of their citizens currently residing the UK and want to protect their position.</p> <p>  Certain countries have surprisingly deep trading relations with the UK for historical reasons that might not be immediately obvious at first glance.  When we delve into it we discover that there are very deep trading relations between a couple of the countries.  The countries that are geographically closest have, for more obvious reasons, strong trade concerns.  As we move into discussions on the trade relationship we want to get away from saying that we have very unique issues and move towards saying that we have commonly shared issues, even if they might be of greater significance to us.  The senator has hit the nail on the head by saying that each country first and foremost will focus on their own issues.  Even when we talk to those countries it is a long, slow process to explain what our particular issues are and why they are important.  We get understanding and sympathy at the first stage, but when we start to table potential solutions each member state has the natural reaction of asking whether there is a read-across for them and if there is a similar situation for them.  It can throw up the most unexpected of complications that we then have to work through and manage and negotiate.</p></speech>

As we have scaled up that has not been an issue and no one has put a barrier in the way for me.  More generally, across the entire civil service and the wider agencies, there has been recognition that there are certain areas that need to be resourced more strongly on Brexit, whether that is through a reallocation of resources within those Departments, or in some cases through additional resources.  Across Government, and at a political level by Government, there is a recognition that this is one of the biggest challenges we have to face, and it will not lack the human resources needed to deliver it.</p></speech>

Some of the areas that need the most help are those which are going to be the worst affected.  Some of those that might see some silver lining to the fairly dark cloud are the areas that are possibly overheating already, for example opportunities for jobs in finance which are likely to be in Dublin and urban areas.  In terms of agriculture we have heard previously that tariffs might potentially be between 30% and 50% on items such as dairy and meat.</p><p>That affects rural areas far more than urban areas and affects agriculture more than finance.  What preparation can we do to mitigate that in so far as we can?  It is a broad question and I realise we have time limitations, but it is the areas that could do without this the most that will be the most affected.  If we did get a huge amount of jobs here, we would have a difficulty housing all the people and finding office accommodation for them in the short term, if not the medium term.</p></speech>

Independent of Brexit, the Government over the last number of years has been conscious that the economic recovery has been stronger in Dublin and other cities.  It has been very conscious of that in its approach to enterprise support, job creation, job support and so forth.  However, you are right - Brexit compounds that.  That is uppermost in the mind of the Government in terms of its approach and the type of measures required, such as those I spoke about earlier in terms of the overall economic response.  The Cabinet is seized with the fact that to the extent there are negative impacts they will hit harder in certain areas, regions and sectors.  That will be reflected in the overall Government response.  I will ask Pauline Mullingan to comment further from the jobs and enterprise perspective in terms of how that is being reflected in the Department's strategy.</p></speech>

We secured a 10% increase in our capital budget for this year, as well as additional current funding for up to 50 staff between Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  It has been a mix of additional funding for the agencies and the development of the schemes I spoke about in reaction to the currency impacts companies are experiencing, such as the development of proposals around a working capital scheme.  It is a short-term guarantee scheme similar to the agriculture scheme.  You spoke earlier about the impacts on the agri sector, in particular.  That scheme was rolled out last year by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  We are now looking at the development of a scheme on a whole-of-economy basis for companies most impacted.  It would be a short-term scheme rolled out through the SBCI.  Work is under way in the Department on developing that.</p> <p>  The other matter we are working on is scoping out the need for a longer-term business development loan scheme, again for the companies most impacted.</p> <p>  They are the two issues.  Finally, we are considering scoping the idea of a financial advisory hub for SMEs.  That is in development.  It is based on the research and analysis carried out on the companies most impacted in the short term and which will have the most impacts from Brexit in the medium term.</p> <p>  John Callinan spoke about the next phase in terms of detailing all of the mitigation actions that are under way and planned.  That will be the next step.</p></speech>

Are further opportunities for diversification being pursued at a greater speed now than they would have been otherwise?</p></speech>

Yesterday, you might have seen that Enterprise Ireland launched its eurozone strategy.  Enterprise Ireland has been working with the 1,500 clients that export to the UK but with a particular focus on the 600 companies that are most exposed to the UK market.  It is driving home the diversification of product as well.  It is about not moving out of the UK completely but diversifying into other markets.  That is the bread and butter of the work Enterprise Ireland is doing with the addition of 39 extra staff, between at home and in offices abroad.  It is to help that effort.</p></speech>

Mr. Callinan, I could speak about the customs union all day but we have covered it relatively well.  I happen to be a chartered accountant and we have received a large amount of material from Chartered Accountants Ireland, which I am sure you have seen, about the impact on small businesses.  Many of them are not conscious of all that is involved.  I do not wish to labour that point although I believe it is valid.  We might invite them to appear before the committee on another occasion.  Consider the issue of food control.  The UK has typically had a cheap food policy.  It is not as interested in the agriculture sector as in the end consumer.  There is the possibility of a great deal of cheap, not as well regulated product coming into the UK once it is not subject to EU rules.  If that food were to get into the UK food chain, how difficult or easy would it be to control it from getting across the landbridge between Scotland and Belfast or Liverpool and Belfast and ending up in the food chain here?  For example, it could be South American beef or chicken from various other places that would not be subject to the same food controls.  Has there been any thought about what we will do in that regard?  We have a very long Border and we do not wish to have a hard Border, but how can we mitigate against that?  We cannot control the UK's borders if it adopts a different policy and we are the most vulnerable to leakage.</p></speech>

One is at the EU level and the anticipation of a potential future trading agreement.  The EU has made it clear that one of its concerns will be to ensure that any arrangement respects the principle of a level playing field.  In the guidelines adopted at the end of April the EU says that it must ensure a level playing field, notably in terms of competition and state aid, a point raised earlier, and in this regard encompass safeguards against unfair competitive advantages through, inter alia, tax, social, environmental and regulatory measures and practices.  The EU is saying that it will not have some type of soft arrangement where the scenario you have mentioned would be a risk.</p> <p>  Equally, on this island we must look at how we enforce the standards and regulatory controls.  That is one of the areas I mentioned where there might be much scope to do things on an all-island basis.  Much will depend on the overall arrangement between the EU and the UK and much will depend on the devolved powers the Northern Ireland Executive will have.  However, it is one of the areas which I would have thought, to refer back to imaginative and flexible solutions, would be an obvious example of where it is in everybody's interest to have an all-island approach to tighten food standards and controls.</p></speech>

A number of French Senators came over to visit members of the finance committee.  They had been to Hong Kong, Singapore and London and they were coming to Dublin and Frankfurt to examine what was happening and what opportunities they could seek.  There appears to be a movement away from passporting arrangements to more equivalent regimes, certainly within the UK.  What have been the indications in regard to regulation equivalence of standards and is it likely that any deal will be struck allowing for equivalence of standards between what we are doing and what the UK will do?  Many people do not appreciate just how large the UK's capital markets are as a percentage of the total EU.  In excess of 70% of the entire EU's capital transactions go through London, not Frankfurt, Paris or here.  How will all of that be handled?  In terms of relocation, we do not appear to be as forward as perhaps some other countries are in angling for the businesses that might wish to remain in an EU territory.</p></speech>

Again, I refer to the guidelines.  They include a statement that any future framework must safeguard financial stability in the Union, which is a reference to the financial sector, and respect its regulatory and supervisory regime and standards and their application.  Again, that is a principle the EU side has applied.  In terms of the extent to which we are pitching for the business, as it were, it would be incorrect and unfair to the IDA, the Department of Finance and others to suggest that they are not aggressively pursuing the opportunities.  They are not necessarily doing it in exactly the same way as other countries, but that is for a careful, considered reason.  It is seeing a great deal of success.  Of course, they are not going to win every project every time, but many projects have already been identified.  It is fair to say as well that a number of companies involved do not necessarily wish to announce in a fanfare what changes they might be making.  Some do and some do not, but I will ask Oliver Gilvarry to elaborate on it.</p></speech>

There is an enormous financial centre in the UK.  Is it reasonable or likely to expect that the vast bulk of that will stay in London dealing with EU matters or is that unlikely to be possible?</p></speech>

I suspect that one way or the other, a very sizable portion of the EU financial market may still transact through the UK.  London is going to continue to be a major financial services centre.  I think that is clear.</p></speech>

A certain amount of business will be lost.  From what we see, entities currently based in London are looking for jurisdictions within the EU 27 to relocate to.  Dublin is one of those.  We are always in the top numbers being considered.  That is to ensure continuation, as Mr. Callinan highlighted.  It is too early to say what the impact on London will be.  It is too early to say what type of deal will be made.  The concept of the equivalence assessment was mentioned.  Will we or the UK have to rely on what regimes we currently have in place in certain European directives or regulations, or will they be rewritten?  Firms are making the decision now to say that they cannot wait for that and will set up operations within the EU 27 to ensure continuation of service to their European clients.  London is still London and always will be.  It will be a centre of liquidity, similar to New York, Hong Kong and Singapore, but it will see a fall-off of some European business.</p> <p>  On the point about us being forward in attracting financial services, there are a number of other jurisdictions.  The competent authorities would have competition mandates.  They are very proactive.  To reiterate what Mr. Callinan said, the IDA has been very proactive, having roadshows, and a number of Government Ministers and our officials have been at those as well.  The sense we get is that Dublin and Ireland generally - it is not focused purely on Dublin, since there is also a focus on locations outside Dublin due to lower costs - are comparing very well.  We find that many firms want the consistent approach of the certainty of the framework and the engagement with the regulator.  They are not looking for light touch regulation.  There is a single rule book, as we call it, for regulation in Europe.  They want something that will give them a clear answer and certainty about how they will be treated.  Dublin is very high up there and we compare very favourably with a number of larger member states on that basis.</p></speech>

More broadly, much of what is said in the IMF report is consistent with the analysis that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has produced for the Department of Finance itself which says, absent other policy changes, there could be a severe impact in a worst-case scenario.  We would in turn anticipate policy responses to mitigate that impact.  I will ask Mr. O'Connor to speak on the IMF and other issues.</p></speech>

I was in many meetings with it, including on this issue.  We have representatives from the Commission with us this week as part of its post-programme surveillance, PPS, mission.  Article 4 is part of post-programme monitoring as well.  We have a meeting about Brexit in the Department of Finance tomorrow.  There is one in the Central Bank tomorrow.  I think most of what the IMF said was probably present in our own research.  We took a view that we wanted to do much research.  This dates back to late 2015, when the first volume came out, and then quite a bit last year.  There were several publications.  One was earlier this year.  We have been very up-front in bringing our research to as many people as possible, including domestically, to the Low Pay Commission, for example, and others that have wanted to hear what we have to say.  The institutions have had many questions.</p> <p>  We would agree with some of the IMF's comments, which would reflect things we have said publicly, not just privately.  It is probably focusing on some of the harder Brexit scenario that we have put out.  Our own macroeconomic forecasts from 2019 onwards embed those hard Brexit scenarios anyway.  Therefore our labour market forecasts would already incorporate those scenarios.  If one looks at our labour market forecasts, we will have a situation by the end of this decade where we expect more people in work in Ireland than ever before.  Going back to what Mr. Callinan said, from a counterfactual perspective - that is to say relative to a situation where there is no Brexit whatsoever - this path is a little more muted in some scenarios.</p> <p>  The final point is to summarise, as Mr. Callinan said, that all of our modelling and analysis is very much on a no policy change scenario.  We already saw policies introduced and announced in the budget last year.  It was very clear at that time that that was the first in a number of budgets that would take Brexit into account.  There was a single publication called "Getting Ireland Brexit Ready".  It was very specific.  Some policies were announced there.  Some policies are sectoral.  Some that were announced are fiscal as well.  One would anticipate more as time projects.</p></speech>

On the negotiation process, the detailed negotiating directives that are currently being discussed are due to be finalised at the General Affairs Council next week.  That would then be the ending of the first phase of documentation, capturing how the EU is going at the negotiation process.  The working assumption had been that formal negotiations would then begin almost immediately, but the calling of the British election has effectively put that on hold from all sides for a few weeks.  The hypothesis now is that, as soon as the British election is over and the line-up is clear on the other side, negotiations between the Barnier team and the British representatives will begin, and that what we would hope, as mentioned earlier, is that this moment of sufficient progress on the early issues would be reached reasonably earlier and that the discussions would then widen to include the framework for that future trading relationship, potentially before the end of the year.</p></speech>

More than 50 countries have negotiated trade deals with regard to quotas.  How will those quotas be designated?  Will they be EU quotas, or will they be left with the UK after it is done?  How do the witnesses see it working out?</p></speech>

How that will be dealt with when the UK leaves has to be taken into account in negotiations.  Does the whole quota stay with the remaining EU countries?  Does some portion of it go?  If so, how is that calculated?  The complex mechanics of that have yet to be worked out.  I do not know if any of my colleagues know more about it than I do.  I apologise that I do not have the intimate detail of that.  My understanding from recent discussions is that that is a big piece of work that has yet to be worked out in the overall arrangements.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Pauline Mulligan has insight on it.  It is one of a number of issues where is much exploration into what the best interests of Ireland would be, but the point of those discussions and really getting into them has not been reached yet.</p></speech>
