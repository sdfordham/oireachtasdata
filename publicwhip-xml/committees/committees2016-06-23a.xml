Apologies have been received from Deputies Crowe and Barrett and their substitutes are Deputies Funchion and Durkan.</p> <p>  I welcome all of the members of the select committee to its first meeting of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  I look forward to working with all of them in a genuine spirit of partnership and co-operation.  I am confident that we will bring our combined skills, experience and commitment to bear on the work ahead.  We will make this a highly productive committee that discharges its functions in a efficient, progressive and enlightened way.</p> <p>  I propose that we go into private session to consider the arrangement and format for today's meeting, namely the discussion of the Estimates.</p></speech>

We should, at the earliest opportunity, see what we can do to address the refugee and migrant crisis.  I know that is for another day because today we are dealing with the Revised Estimates.  The crisis in Europe and on its borders needs to be the absolute focus of this committee.  We must also look at the EU-Turkey deal and how it impacts on the rights of refugees.  The refugee and migrant crisis should be our main focus between now and the summer recess.</p></speech>

I worked with him in the previous D&aacute;il.  We were both members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade so I know how fair, impartial and willing to listen he is.  I also wish the committee staff well.  They performed a fantastic job on the previous foreign affairs committee and I have no doubt that we will work well together on this one.</p></speech>

It was a pleasure to work with Deputy Durkan during the five-year term of the previous D&aacute;il.  He has been a very committed and hardworking member of this committee at all stages.</p> <p>  Deputy Darragh O'Brien mentioned the migration crisis.  Earlier this morning, I discussed that matter with our officials.  A UN migration summit will take place in September and will be chaired by Ireland and Jordan.  When we know the identities of the Senators who will serve on the joint committee and as soon as the latter is formed, the migration issue will be one of the first subjects that will be discussed.  There are many pressing issues in terms of the migration issue as a whole.  I can confirm that we discussed the matter this morning.</p> <p>  I propose that we go into private session to make arrangements to discuss the Estimates.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

At today's meeting, the committee will consider these Estimates and report back to the D&aacute;il.</p><p>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, Deputy Joe McHugh.  I congratulate both of them on their appointments.  I look forward to working closely with them over the term of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.</p><p> I also welcome the officials from the Department to today's meeting and thank them for the detailed briefing material provided to the committee.  The proposed format of today's meeting is that we will hear brief opening remarks from the Minister before proceeding to deal with Vote 28 on a programme by programme basis.  At the outset of the consideration of each of the programmes, the Minister can give an overview of the programme, including detailing any pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance or expenditure in relation to the programme this year.  We will then open the discussion up to the floor for questions from members of the committee.  On completion of Vote 28, we will proceed to Vote 27 and consider it in a similar manner.</p><p> Before proceeding to the business of the meeting, I remind members and those in the public Gallery that their mobile phones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the recording equipment in committee rooms even if on silent mode.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the House, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to make brief opening remarks on the overall expenditure of the Department before proceeding to examine Vote 28.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#D00200"><p>I will start by congratulating you on your recent appointment as Chairman of this committee and I also congratulate the members of the reconfigured committee for the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I look forward to engaging with the committee not only today but in future months and, dare I say, years.</p> <p>  Under the programme for a partnership Government, this Government is committed to reform of the budgetary process, including pre-budget consideration, better scrutiny of Revised Estimates and better evaluation of programmes.  We, in government, look forward to having the valuable input of the committee in this process as it develops.</p> <p>  I will briefly refer to Vote 28, which I will deal with as it relates to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, will then address the committee on Vote 27, international co-operation.</p> <p>  As you are aware, Chairman, Vote 28 funds the operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its network of 81 missions, excluding African missions and Vietnam, which come under Vote 27, Ireland's contributions to international organisations such as the UN budget, UN peacekeeping operations, the OECD, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe, among others, and a number of smaller programmes such as the emigrant support programme, the peace and reconciliation fund and other funding programmes in areas such as culture, education and trade promotion.</p> <p>  Members will have seen the advance briefing provided by my Department which summarises the main activities and priorities under each strategic programme and which includes actual expenditure under each programme to the end of May 2016.  For 2016, the committee will be aware that the overall gross estimate for the foreign affairs and trade group of Votes, Votes 27 and 28, is &euro;698 million compared with &euro;686 million in 2015, an overall increase of &euro;12 million or 1.6%.  A total of &euro;10 million of the total increase represents an increase in the international co-operation Vote, Vote 27, with the balance of &euro;2 million on Vote 28, which is earmarked in particular for the passport reform programme.  The gross budget for Vote 28 has increased to &euro;212 million from &euro;210 million in 2015.  A total of 71% or &euro;150 million of the Vote 28 allocation is for administrative costs with the balance of 29%, or &euro;62 million, allocated to programme subheads.</p> <p>  I believe that represents good value for money.  The overall trend in recent years has been one of significant reduction in the Department's administration budget which is down by 22% or &euro;43 million in 2016 compared with 2008.  Most of that is accounted for by administrative savings on salaries and on the cost of maintaining our diplomatic network.  Our mission network serves our citizens, our businesses and our Government well.  It is a small one by international standards and by comparison with like-sized countries and our missions are small.  A total of 15% of our 80 missions are staffed by one diplomat while 40% are staffed by two diplomats with support from local staff.  Denmark, with a similar population, has 108 missions in its diplomatic network.  Finland's foreign Ministry employs more than 2,600 staff at home and abroad compared to a total of just under 1,500 in Ireland's case.</p> <p>  The programme structure for Vote 28 is somewhat different from the situation in 2015.</p><p>The current structure is based on the Department's statement of strategy for the period 2015 to 2017 which is rooted in the recent foreign policy review document, The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World.  The latter sets out the Department's work in five priority areas: supporting our people; promoting our values; advancing our prosperity; engaging actively in the European Union; and strengthening our influence.  These correspond directly with the longer-worded descriptions for programmes A to E in the published Revised Estimates Volume.</p><p> We are nearly halfway through the year already.  In the course of my remarks this morning on the individual programmes, I will seek to address some of the work under way in each of the areas, how expenditure is going so far this year and the factors and pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance across the programmes in 2016.</p><p> The Department is experiencing a number of cost and exchange rate pressures mainly driven by our global presence.  In particular the weak euro, while a major advantage to exporters, is adding significant costs to operating in key markets and engaging with strategic partners.  It is estimated that in 2015 currency exchange rates cost the Department almost &euro;10 million extra in euro terms.  In addition, the recovering economies around the world have increased local costs driven by rising inflation and local market conditions.  My Department is also incurring increased security costs at overseas missions as we seek to ensure the safety of staff and visitors to our premises - both Irish citizens and others - following the various terror attacks across the globe.</p><p> With the Chairman's agreement, I now propose to make some short introductory comments on programme A, and to open out the discussion and invite comments or questions from members.  Once we complete our discussion on the programme, I will then take each of the subsequent programmes in sequence.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#E00300"><p>Work under the programme includes: the effective delivery of passport and consular services for citizens; supporting emigrants; deepening engagement with the diaspora; sustaining peace and enhancing reconciliation and political progress in Northern Ireland; increasing North-South and British-Irish co-operation; and promoting our culture, arts and creative industries throughout our embassy network.  The amount allocated for the programme in 2016 is &euro;67.3 million, compared to &euro;63.9 million in 2015.  The programme is about our people and it covers a number of key priority areas for the Department.</p> <p>  Given the breadth of issues covered by the programme I will just briefly touch on some of them in my introduction.  The first relates to consular services and consular assistance.  Providing high quality consular assistance and other consular services to Irish citizens at home and abroad is a key objective of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The number of Irish citizens travelling abroad has increased sharply in recent years.  We are seeing a most significant increase in the level of requests for consular assistance from the consular division in Dublin and across the mission network overseas.  In 2015 we provided assistance in 2,500 separate cases, including more than 250 cases of deaths abroad, and a similar number of hospitalisation cases.  That represents a 20% increase in the workload compared to 2014.  Statistics for 2016, to date, suggest an even sharper increase, or close to 40% in demand in the past 12 months.  We also note a greater frequency of responses to major emergency incidents and critical crisis events.  I need hardly recall the deaths of six young men and women in Berkeley or the murder of three Irish citizens in Tunisia a year ago this month.  We are conscious also of the increased threat of terrorism in Europe, as demonstrated by the Paris and Brussels attacks, which resulted, unfortunately, in a number of Irish citizens being injured.  Much of the work the Department does in the area is less visible, including work that is of a preventative or precautionary nature.  We dedicate significant attention to research and communication in the area of travel advice to ensure citizens can make informed decisions about travel and are forewarned of the risks involved.</p> <p>  As members are aware, extensive preparations were put in place for the tens of thousands Irish and Northern Irish fans in France for the European championships.  We are all immensely proud of the hugely positive press and social media coverage our fans have been receiving.  We could not buy that positive coverage.  It is quite remarkable that the events in France are ongoing.  We congratulate the team on last night's performance and look forward to further events over the weekend and into next week.  A similar level of consular assistance operation is being put in place for Brazil for the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games that are coming up shortly.  This area of our work is also driving forward our pursuit of new and innovative means of supporting Irish citizens abroad.</p><p> On the eve of the Euros 2016 on 10 June, I was proud to launch the TravelWise smartphone app, which is an important new state-of-the-art tool for improving our communications with the travelling public, ensuring that we keep our citizens safe and well informed while they are abroad.  It provides full access to all of our travel advice content, even offline, instant access to our network of 80 permanent embassies and consulates, more than 90 honorary consuls worldwide and enables us to contact citizens to alert them about major incidents and/or changes in security levels in countries where they are travelling or in which they have already registered an interest in visiting.  I recommend this travel app to all members and encourage them to promote it among family, friends and constituents.  The feedback relating to it has been remarkably positive.  I trust that the app is already in full use on the smartphones - of course, those in the room have all been turned off - of all elected Members of the Oireachtas.  I ask members to check their phones as we conclude the meeting.  Officials from my Department are here to offer assistance in ensuring that the downloads have been adequately and properly effected.</p><p> I will now deal with passport reform.  In 2015 the Department issued 670,000 passports and 13,500 passport cards, representing a 6.4% increase over 2014.  To date this year, 434,000 passport book application have already been received and we are 12% ahead of the number of applications made at the same point last year.  The passport card - the first of its type in the European Union - was introduced last year for adult holders of Irish passports and has received the most positive endorsement.  As members may know, I launched a significant investment in the passport service to modernise the issuing of passports and improve security, enhance the service provided to citizens.  The passport reform programme, involving a combined capital and current budget of &euro;18.6 million, will run from 2016 to 2018.  An additional &euro;3.75 million has been allocated for the programme in 2016.  I trust the Chairman and all members are adequately equipped with passport cards for ease of travel.  I know this committee will be engaging in a considerable amount of travel during the term of the Chairman's tenure and I trust all of the members have been issued with their passport cards.  They are very useful.  Again, the feedback from the general public has been particularly positive.</p><p> The emigrants support programme provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects in order to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  I am pleased to say that funding for 2016, at &euro;11.6 million, remains the same as previous years.  The organisations funded provide a range of services from informal community networks and groups for seniors to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements.  The programme also supports projects aimed at creating practical, results-oriented links between Ireland and the global Irish and projects that emerge as a consequence of the work of the Global Irish Economic Forum such as, for example, the development of Irish business alumni and affinity networks.  Applications for 400 projects, received from over 230 organisations under the emigrant support programme, are currently being assessed.  It is anticipated that the 2016 project allocations will be approved in the coming weeks and that the target of funding more than 200 organisations in 2016 will be met.</p><p> In regard to the relationship between Ireland and the UK, today's referendum is uppermost in all of our minds.  The position of the Government is quite clear.  We want the UK, as our friend, closest neighbour and partner, to remain a member of a reformed European Union but we fully respect that, first and foremost, this is a decision for the UK voters which they are making today as we speak.</p><p> As already stated, the programme deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland and delivers funding for projects to bolster peace and reconciliation across the island.  The maintenance of peace, stability and economic growth in Northern Ireland remains an absolute priority for the Government.  The Government is committed to the full implementation of Stormont House Agreement and A Fresh Start, which provide a framework for continued progress.  The reconciliation fund is on track to finance over 100 civil society and community organisations in 2016, drawing on the &euro;2.7 million budget allocation.  More than 450 events have taken place around the world, supported by the Department and its embassy network as part of Ireland's 2016 global and diaspora programme, marking the centenary of the Easter Rising.</p><p>These events have been very well received both at home and abroad.  We are now in the fifth year of the decade of centenaries 1912-1922, marking the events of a century, which shaped the past 100 years of Irish life.</p><p> In the matter of culture, the Department's overseas mission network continues to organise and support events of a cultural nature which promote Ireland.  Funding has been provided for 266 such events in the first half of 2016 and we will meet our target of 300 value adding events in this regard over the period of a year.  With regard to the trends in expenditure to the end of May, the expenditure on this programme remains on target, however due to the significant rise in passport applications the passport service is experiencing significant cost pressures.  My Department has deployed additional temporary clerical officers and increased overtime to facilitate increased production on an issue that I know all members of the committee are concerned about and we are anxious to ensure an efficient service delivery to all the applications.  I might add that the increased passport issuance has result in increased non-pay costs in passport book application forms and ICT costs.  Currently the passport service is approximately &euro;3 million ahead of its budget profile.  My officials will continue to closely monitor this demand-led programme.</p><p> I thank the Chairman</p></speech>

They have all been and continue to be great ambassadors for our country.</p> <p>  With regard to passports, members receive representations daily in regard to new passports or the renewal of passports.  The Minister referred to the ongoing programme of reform and my understanding is that a new online passport system will be introduced.  Will he outline in his response how this reform is progressing and what it will mean for Irish citizens to have the new online passport system?  With regard to his concluding remarks on Northern Ireland the British referendum, a number of us in this room represent Border constituencies and I think his earlier remarks on the pressures on the Department with regard to currency Exchange rates, we sincerely hope that after the decision of the electorate in Britain today that we are not back to that being a common issue, on a daily basis for those of us on this island, particularly those of us who live in Border counties and who grew up with the disruption caused by Border controls from the point of view of the control of persons and good crossing either North-South or South-North.  </p> <p>  I propose to group the questions together and the Minister may respond to all at the end.

I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh also on his appointment.</p> <p>  I know that we are moving towards an online passport service; will that include a reminder system as well, similar to what applies to road tax and various other services?</p> <p>  It would be of interest to note what percentage approximately of applications received by the passport office are incomplete.  I hope the online application will actually ensure full completion of applications.  I take this opportunity to commend the staff in the passport office because I know they are under ferocious pressure and I have also contributed to some of that.  It is a very stressful time but if we can provide an online service that would be something.</p> <p>  My final point relates to the public service card and the requirement for new or renewal applications to have the public service card.  Is the Department liaising with other Departments in that regard because we are finding that people who are not aware of that requirement have to seek appointments for the public service card as well?  I understand that 1.8 million people have received the card so far, as I learned from a response to a parliamentary question I tabled.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions on programme A.  The expenditure so far on emergency consular assistance to May 2016 is &euro;1 million whereas the target is &euro;79 million.</p><p>Is there a reason for that?  Are there expenditures pushed out into the second half of the year that are not shown in the Estimates?</p><p> My final question on programme A relates to North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation.  The Minister might inform me as to when the next North-South Ministerial Council meeting is being held.  In particular, I am interested in the all-island bodies that fall under his remit and how the Minister oversees their work programme and targets.  There is a feeling out there - it may not be a fair one - that we may not be getting from the all-island structures all that we could and that the potential of those bodies to work for all the people on the island of Ireland is not yet being met.  It appears that over the course of the past year, obviously because of the electoral cycles, that it slipped off the agenda.  I am particularly interested to hear the Minister's views on a work programme in that regard, what targets are being set, how we are interacting and how the Department interacts with the all-island bodies, which were brought forward in the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure that we are using them for the good of all the people of Ireland and to reach their potential.</p></speech>

Is there a space if somebody else is looking for funding?  For example, on North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation, we have met quite a number of the groups.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and some of these groups are in existence for quite a while.  I wonder whether there is an audit of them and if the Minister looks at them with a fresh eye each time they apply.  I am conscious this morning of the story that has broken about governance issues in another organisation.</p> <p>  My other question also relates to the North.  There are difficulties and there are people who feel left behind by the Good Friday Agreement.  I wonder whether there is a space within this programme.  As the Minister will be aware, some of us have been visiting Maghaberry prison and other prisons and engaging with both loyalist and republican dissidents.  I ask whether there is a space within this programme for working with that particular group because it is in everybody's interest that there is a conflict-free environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1313" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#H00300"><p>First, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, on his reappointment, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, on his appointment to the Department.  I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on a few occasions.  It is always a pleasure to work with him and also with the Minister of State.</p> <p>  I concur with what my colleague said in complimenting the staff in the passport office.  They do an excellent job.  In any contact I have with them, they always try to facilitate people who, I still cannot understand, when they have booked their tickets, including flights and hotels, at the last moment check their passports.  It is a big issue in many Members' offices as the first port of call is to ring the local Deputy to see what can be done.  As the Minister will be aware, on every occasion in the run-up to an election, it is the practice to ask the public to check the register.  Can such a campaign be run in this case?  I issue a press release at the start of every year asking constituents to check their passports and many of them still do not do so.  Can there be such a campaign asking those travelling abroad to check their passports before they book?  It is the first thing someone travelling abroad should do.</p> <p>  I note the Minister stated that there is an increase in passport applications.  Is much of that from second or third generation Irish outside the jurisdiction?  Has there been an increase in applications from the United Kingdom?  The Minister might have that information for us as well.  He might also state what country, other than the Republic of Ireland, has the most Irish passport holders.</p> <p>  I also note the Minister stated the Department is spending a lot more on security at some embassies.  Is that due to intelligence reports that our embassies or staff may be under threat abroad from ISIS or whoever?  The Minister might elaborate, if he can, on the embassies where security has been beefed up and for what reason, and the additional cost to the State.</p><p>I agree with it.  We must protect our civil servants at work abroad representing the country and if there is such a threat, it is important that they are protected.</p><p> Finally, the Minister stated there were 250 fatalities abroad among those who went on holidays.  The Department is brilliant any time we contact it to give consular service.  The staff are on the ball.  It means a great deal to a family to get a telephone call from somebody in an embassy in a country where there has been a fatality.  As a matter of interest, would the Minister know how many of those 250 did not have travel insurance and what assistance the Department provides to families in such circumstances?  Annual travel insurance costs &euro;60 or &euro;70.  Most members hold such insurance.  It is crucially important.  The word should go out from this committee to anybody who is going abroad to ensure he or she takes out travel insurance.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointment and wish them well in the coming years.  I also congratulate the Chairman.</p><p>The issue in the back of everybody's minds is the UK referendum.  I congratulate the various Ministers, Departments and opposition spokespersons who have given so much of their time to promoting what is a common cause in so far as the United Kingdom's potential exit is concerned in the sense that, as referred to by the Chairman, while it may be in a different jurisdiction, there is a serious common interest.  We hope that it goes right from the point of view of both the United Kingdom and this country.  To those who say that it is a separate issue, we all are Europeans whether we like it or not.  By virtue of the fact that we live on the continent of Europe, we have a common interest.  John Donne always comes to mind, when he famously wrote:</p><blockquote>if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe<br /><br />is the less,</blockquote> <p>and he finished off by saying,</p><blockquote>And therefore never send to know for whom<br /><br />the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</blockquote> <p>We hope that the response is in the interests of Europe when the results are made known.</p><p>I congratulate the embassy staff and mission staff overseas for their work and involvement in the promotion of Ireland Inc., the national cause, the commerce and the industry, and the link-up that is required being part and parcel of the selling of the Irish image at all times.  I suggest that continue and be emphasised because the corporate brand is much broader than we used to recognise it as being.  It goes a long, long way.  It has many aspects, including the football, which we have watched over the past few days and, hopefully, will watch to an even greater extent in the next few days.</p><p>I congratulate the Department for its work and foresight, and its many missions overseas, which we have visited in the past and seen at first hand.  They do tremendous work and take on considerable tasks with very little resources, and manage to survive and make an impact that is above and beyond that of a player of our size in the international arena.</p></speech>

I have had occasion to talk to some of the fans who are in France.  Being a supporter of Sligo Rovers, I know there is quite a number of Sligo Rovers supporters still in France.  I do not know when they are coming home but I hope they will be out there for another week or two anyhow.</p><p>The incentive provided by the Minister is welcome.  For people going abroad for this event in France, the travel app is welcome.</p><p> In respect of passports, we have had numerous such cases.  Travel agents must also have a role to play in this area.  I congratulate the Passport Office, which has been very understanding and helpful on numerous occasions under extreme time pressures to accommodate people if at all possible.  It is right and proper that we acknowledge the work being done in the Passport Office.  The only issue about which I have a reservation is the timeframe.  People are led to believe that the passport application, if posted through An Post, will be back within ten or 15 days.  I have had numerous complaints concerning this where it takes 20 days or more.  It is important that people be aware of that when, as previous speakers have said, they are about to travel and realise, at the last moment, that their passports are out of date.  People think that because of the three-day quick turnaround, which is a wonderful facility, that they will be able to get passports.  It is important that travel agents and the general public be aware the Passport Office is working flat out and certainly the 15-day turnaround is very difficult to achieve.</p><p> Recently I have been dealing with a very tragic case in Sligo involving a young lady who died in Japan.  The service provided both by the Minister and his staff in Dublin and the people in Japan has been recognised by the family.  The family were impressed by the assistance they received.  From the time the family arrived in Japan, they were looked after by the staff there.  I put this on record because if it happens there it happens in many other parts of the world.  The Minister mentioned that some embassies and consular areas have only one member of staff.  I wish to express my appreciation and that of the family for the service provided.  There have been many other cases in which I and others have been involved.</p></speech>

The Minister outlined a comparison between Ireland and Denmark, which have similar populations.  We have 80 missions and Denmark has 108.  Are any plans in place to open up additional missions in the next couple of years and, if so, perhaps the Minister would outline them?</p></speech>

Perhaps I can address the replies by way of groups because there has been an interest in the same topics, including the issue raised by the Chairman and Deputy Darragh O'Brien in regard to Northern Ireland.  I wish to assure members that we are anxious to advance matters under the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and A Fresh Start.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien is correct in saying there has not been the same number of meetings this years compared to last year.  That was because of our general election and coincidentally a round of Assembly elections in Northern Ireland, a rather protracted Government formation period here, similarly a negotiation of the programme for Government in Northern Ireland.  As a result, there have been fewer meetings.  However, during the period in question I did have a number of high-level engagements in Northern Ireland with the Secretary of State and with the party leaders.  I expect to have a date very soon for the North-South Ministerial Council meeting.  A date had been fixed for around now but all the parties were not in a position to proceed as we would have liked.</p><p>However, that is a priority issue and I expect to be in a position to report progress through the Office of the Taoiseach.  Of course, the Chairman and the committee will be informed.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien is correct.  It is important to ensure that the various ministerial engagements on the work programmes that have already been agreed report progress in a way that, in the circumstances, is appropriate.  In the programme for Government we have identified a number of specific areas which will be implemented in early course.  We are also looking at areas such as third level education, sustainable transport, cross-Border greenways, e-health as well as the more traditional areas such as economic development and programmes across the north west in particular.  </p><p> I acknowledge the kind words of Deputies in respect of the staff at the Passport Office who, we all accept, do a very good job in somewhat challenging circumstances.  In the course of our duties, as public representatives, we all deal with emergency situations, all of which seek a form of priority.  We are now at peak season with more than 60,000 applications currently in process.  So far the number of incomplete applications is of the order of 32,000, which gives rise to queries.  Deputy Noel Grealish is correct when he speaks of the need to ensure we have a programme of information.  Deputies, public representatives and county councils can all have a role by having these issues addressed by way of information at our meetings.  We have notices at Garda stations, some post offices and the like.  It is important that we continue to remind people to make an application in advance.  If people are travelling in three weeks or more the passport express service is the cheapest and most convenient application channel, the turnaround for which is 12 to 13 days.  Obviously for people travelling more immediately they should go online.  The importance of our expenditure programme is to enable converting to online.  This should not be underestimated.  We expect that will be completed by 2018.  Already people can apply for an alert reminder.  We would hope by the end of 2018, once the applications are online, that the facility will have been taken up by large numbers of people.  It is important that people register for reminders.  </p><p> In regard to the spike in applications at this time of year, a number of steps have been taken by the Passport Office, including the recruitment of more than 200 temporary staff and current staff working overtime.  My advice, which I ask the Chairman and members to convey to their constituents, is to allow six weeks, 15 days is the target, for receipt of passports.  Unfortunately there are times when this timeframe cannot be guaranteed.  It is important to engage with An Post to ensure applicants get a realistic estimate of the timeframe.  </p><p> There has been an increase in the number of applications from overseas, particularly first time applications from Britain and Northern Ireland.  However, in terms of applications from overseas the impact on the passport service overall has been minimal as numbers are low.  The total increase in first time applications from Great Britain for the months January to May, compared with last year, is 3%.  The total number of first time applications this year is likely to be of the order of 4,000.</p><p>That represents a very small percentage of the total number of applications for Irish passports each year, which is currently approximately 670,000.  I will furnish precise details of the countries outside the State with the greatest number of passport holders and the greatest number of applications but I would be disappointed if they were not the UK and the US, in that order.  I am happy to continue engagement with the committee on the matter of passport services.  We are working towards a reformed passport system, which will result in a state-of-the-art service to our citizens and applicants.</p><p> In respect of consular services, I acknowledge the kind words of Deputies about the very sensitive, dedicated and important work our consular teams undertake abroad,  often in very difficult circumstances.  We already said that there were 250 deaths last year.  This is a very sensitive time for families and we are anxious at all times to ensure that these sensitivities are observed and that we offer an appropriate level of assistance.  In respect of consular expenditure, it is appropriate and necessary for us to look at it in terms of the entire year rather than on a month by month basis but the committee can take it that the amount of money we have allocated towards that will undoubtedly be expended because we are now running at in excess of 2,500 cases per annum, which is unprecedented.  We always ensure that expenditure is appropriate to the needs of those involved.  </p><p> Deputy Grealish is right about the issue of insurance.  Unfortunately, too many of our people are going abroad without an appropriate level of travel insurance.  We can only advise people, which we do.  A significant feature of our new travel app is a series of local advices tailored to meet the circumstances of the country.  Those who have seen it will undoubtedly have been enthused by the level of information.  I would advise those who have not seen it to take some time out and look at it.  I again advise constituents to do so because there is a huge amount of information on that app with advice on insurance.  It underlines what the Department is doing to ensure that we have a state-of-the-art, world-class service for our citizens travelling abroad.  In respect of the Chairman's remarks about France and Irish fans currently travelling, we had a most innovative feature of our engagement in this regard with immediate and short-term pop-up facilities in Lille and Bordeaux.  Similarly, our team will be on the ground in Lyon on Sunday.</p><p> Deputy Grealish mentioned embassies and threats and Deputy Darragh O'Brien referred to expenditure on our embassies.  We do not have, nor have we had, any specific threats but we share information and intelligence with other embassy networks and liaise closely by means of taking advice from local intelligence services and police forces.  There have been incidences where we felt it was appropriate to increase our security because we have a strict obligation to our staff, our citizens and people using our embassy and consular services but we have not received any specific threat to any specific embassy in any specific country.  Notwithstanding that, we keep our building network under review for security and other issues.</p><p> In respect of the mission review, we have 81 full-time embassies and missions abroad.  We would like to increase that number in accordance with our priority programmes over a range of issues with particular reference to trade.</p><p>Over the past number of years, like all Departments, we had some pressures on our expenditure but during that time, we were in a position to open new embassies in Jakarta in Indonesia, Hong Kong and Austin in Texas.  We are reviewing what we would regard as best practice in order to ensure we can maximise our footprint across the regions.  I would be happy at another stage with more time to go into a greater level of detail on that.  I would welcome any commentary, advice or observations that members might have in that regard.  </p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made a point regarding the reconciliation fund in respect of Northern Ireland and across the island.  I can assure her and other members that the fund is open to new organisations.  We encourage new applications and are anxious to ensure that we have a significant level of direct engagement with groups.  If the Deputy has contact with any particular groups, we would be happy to hear from her in that regard.  Again, I ask people to visit the Department's website from time to time where we have full and detailed particulars of the criteria for qualification, the application forms, the deadlines and dates.  Of course, we would welcome new groups and we have an appropriate level of criteria-based scrutiny and evaluation with a view to ensuring an appropriate level of checks and balances.  </p><p> I am not sure if the Chairman will allow much debate on Maghaberry Prison in the context of the Estimates because I know we are pressed for time but I would be happy to engage bilaterally with Deputy O'Sullivan if she requires some information prior to the next parliamentary question series.  </p></speech>

Will the Minister give a brief outline regarding programme B?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#N00300"><p>Programme B covers the Department's contribution towards a more just world, the promotion and protection of human rights internationally and a more secure world based on a stable and secure rules-based international environment.  Over 70% of current expenditure in this programme is made up of contributions to international organisations.  My Department's commitments to international peace, security and human rights under Vote 28 is channelled through programme B which has a total allocation of &euro;56.8 million.  This compares to &euro;57 million in 2014.  In addition, we have a contribution under international co-operation of &euro;480 million under Vote 27, which the Minister of State will address.</p> <p>  Ireland's role and influence in the developing world is far greater than our size warrants.  This is the result of many factors.  My Department maintains strong partnerships with our bilateral partners in Africa.  Other factors include regular policy dialogue and voluntary contributions to our UN partner organisations.  We continue to work closely with the Irish NGO community in the implementation of our aid programme.  We increasingly seek out strong engagement across Departments such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on agricultural development in Africa and the Department of Health on global health issues.  The reputation of Ireland's development programme has consistently been one of high quality, as has been endorsed in the most recent peer review of the OECD development assistance committee.  I am proud to emphasise the dedication of our embassy staff in very difficult environments, not least the commitment and skill shown by our team in Freetown last year in tackling the Ebola crisis.  During that crisis, we worked closely with all partners on the ground and were seen to have led the field in terms of responding quickly and appropriately to what was an horrific international crisis.   </p> <p>  Finally, I would like to reflect on the role played by Ireland in responding to the migration crisis.  We are seeing more people than ever before fleeing from conflict and poverty across the Syria region and many parts of Africa.  Through the Irish Aid programme, my Department continues to provide humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of people caught up in such a crisis as well as the communities in neighbouring countries that are hosting large numbers of refugees and displaced people.</p><p> On the matter of UN contributions, most of the expenditure under this programme relates to Ireland's mandatory contributions to national organisations of which we are a member, including the UN, in the case of which the significant out-turn relates to contributions in support of our peacekeeping operations.  I had the opportunity last week to visit our troops in the Golan Heights.  The committee might give appropriate attention to this mission in terms of its travel arrangements because, from my experience and I know from the members', the troops abroad always like to engage with Irish parliamentarians.  Predicting payments for the programme, particularly regarding UN peacekeeping operations, can be difficult.  Estimated costs are submitted in some cases 12 months in advance of when a payment might be finalised.  New missions can arise in response to emerging crises.  The uncertainty of the dollar-euro exchange rate has all the potential to impact on the final out-turn that will be due in any given year.  I might mention in passing that Ireland is seeking election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-22 term.  We declared this candidacy in 2005 and will be basing our campaign on Ireland's foreign policy credentials and strong international standing within the United Nations on the matter of disarmament and non-proliferation.  These issues will remain a priority for 2016, building on our active engagement and participation in the international disarmament and non-proliferation process.</p><p> We continue to advance human rights priorities, building on our successful membership and solid record of achievements on the UN Human Rights Council, following our two-year term on the council, which ended last year.  A key pillar of our international engagement under programme B is our input into shaping and formulating the European Union's common foreign policy on defence and security, most notably meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, in which I participated last week.  During my visit to the Middle East I met the Israeli Prime Minister, the Palestinian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and the opposition leader in Israel.  I also visited troops serving in the Golan Heights and met with senior UN officials.  I would be happy to speak further on this issue, perhaps at a future meeting, because I believe that our UN peacekeeping missions and the high esteem in which the Irish contingent is held by our international colleagues are hugely important.  We have taken on for many years positions not only regarding our experience, but also our leadership expertise.  I would also like an opportunity at some future time with the committee to discuss the Middle East peace process.</p><p> Expenditure under this programme remains largely on target.  The level of our final UN contribution, however, will not be known until later in the year.</p></speech>

I will revert to the Minister another day on his visit to the Middle East and particularly the situation of Israel and Palestine.  Specifically, though, we would all like to commend our troops who are on UN peacekeeping duties across the globe and we welcome the Minister's remarks in that regard.</p> <p>  He mentioned the migrant and refugee crisis in his statement, about which I would like to ask him two questions.  Some of this may be more relevant to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, in which case we can leave it until his contribution.  I wish to ask specifically about our response as a Government and within the EU to the refugee crisis.  We had made a commitment of resettling 4,000 people, refugees from Syria, Iraq and the Middle East.  It is hard to get a figure, but my understanding is that we have settled 12 people.  I know this covers the Department of Justice too, so I am not laying this all at the Minister's door.  The EU response has been well below par.</p><p>I would like the Minister to comment on that with regard to his contact with the Department of Justice and Equality.  Will we reach the target of 4,000 people, who need our help and assistance, and will we abide by our commitment?  If so, how long will that take?</p><p> Finally, I would like the Minister to comment on the decision of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res not to accept any funding from European Governments or EU institutions due to the EU-Turkey deal.  We have made a financial commitment of about &euro;22.9 million that is linked directly to the EU-Turkey deal.  Many people, including myself, feel that the arrangement with Turkey is not in the best interests of many of those refugees.  Turkey already has 3 million refugees from the region within their borders, but we believe that the rights of refugees and those in need are being infringed by this deal and that some of the money that we are allocating to the EU fund is actually being used to strengthen borders.  I would like a comment today that none of the &euro;22.9 million that we have allocated to the EU fund is being used for enhanced border protection and security so that we are stopping people coming into Europe.  The situation is that those within Europe and in Greece already are stuck in camps, with their families left in Turkey.  This is not a situation by which we as a country should abide, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, DFA, Department of Justice and the Government should reconsider our role in the EU-Turkey deal.  It is a bad deal for those who need our help.</p></speech>

The Minister is aware that I visited the Middle East in a private capacity last year.  I visited the refugee camps in north Lebanon, in which there were mostly Christian Syrians who were forcefully driven out of their homes by ISIS.  ISIS came into their town overnight and a cross was painted on the door just because they were Catholic.  They were given three options: convert to Islam, learn the Koran or be shot.  I met one family in which the son-in-law refused to comply, and ISIS assassinated him there and then in front of the family.  These people were thrown out of their houses there and then with just the clothes on their backs and told to leave.  They are now in refugee camps in north Lebanon.  They do not want to come to Ireland.  They do not want to leave their home town.  They want to go back home to their countries and live where they were born and reared.  These are middle-class families who worked exceptionally hard and, just because of what has happened overnight, they are now in a refugee camp in Lebanon.</p> <p>  In the course of that same trip, I attended a conference in Beirut at which we were told that, despite the birth of Christianity in the Middle East, if this trend continues, there will be no Christian left in the Middle East.  Where in Iraq there were 2.2 million Christians, now there are fewer than 200,000.  It is the same in Syria.  Is enough being done at EU level to protect these people in the Middle East?  What is being done by the EU about ISIS?  ISIS must be stopped.  What I saw in Lebanon is horrendous: hundreds of people crammed into little rooms just because they were Christian, just because they practise a particular religion.  I know this happens to people of other religions, but the EU must get together with the Americans and Russians or whoever in the Middle East.  Everybody must work together to stop the spread of ISIS.  We see what ISIS is doing and the threat they represent around the world.  Global co-operation is needed and the EU should lead it.  I would like to hear what is being done at EU level in this regard.</p></speech>

I generally share the remarks made already, but there is also a very urgent need for the United Nations to review its role and its influence globally.  There is a gradual sidelining, for whatever reason, of the UN in the area of international conflicts, with obvious consequences.</p><p>It is not to the benefit of peace globally or to the future of the UN itself.</p></speech>

A number of meetings have taken place.  I do not have up-to-date information since the recent Government formation but I would be happy to forward this to the Chairman and to record his anxiety that this committee complete its work programme.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the matter of stability fund support, which has a budget of &euro;4.4 million for 2016.  It funds a range of organisations, including United Nations bodies, NGOs and those which engage primarily in the promotion of human rights and the rule of law in international peace building through a range of activities.  I would happy to keep this committee informed of that work.</p> <p>  Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Noel Grealish raised the issue of migration and I am conscious of the Chairman's comments that we will not have a detailed discussion on the matter today.  While acknowledging that it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and for the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, with regard to Ireland's domestic mandate, I would be happy to engage at some future date.  This matter has been on the top of the EU agenda for more than a year.  A number of initiatives have been developed to address it, including a comprehensive package of relocation and resettlement, in the course of which the Government has approved taking up to 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers.  Progress on the resettlement has been good.  We have already taken in more than half - 273 of what had been pledged - and we are on course to meet the target of 520 refugees by the end of 2016.</p> <p>  With regard to relocation, the progress has not been as we would have liked.  It has been slow but it has been slow for everybody across the EU for a variety of reasons, many of which are not under our direct control, including operational difficulties and administrative issues.  We have already received our first family of ten and we have pledged for a further 30 which we hoped will be filled very shortly.  However, this is an issue which it primarily falls to the Minister of Justice for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I am in direct contact with her.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the situation in Turkey.  I have noted the concerns raised by Deputy O'Brien.  It is important that the agreement between the EU and Turkey adheres fully to international human rights laws and practices.  This has been acknowledged by the European Union and was a part of the discussions.  It is, and continues to be, a matter of concern to us but we continue to keep it firmly on the agenda.  The measures agreed to in the EU deal with Turkey comply with international law with particular reference to the protection of human rights.  Migrants will be protected in accordance with the relevant and appropriate international standards.  I note the comments made by Deputy O'Brien in respect of the use of the expenditure by the Turkish authorities.  We are at all times anxious that these moneys are expended towards the provision of shelter and safety to the many migrants putting extreme pressure on the authorities in Turkey.  That is an ongoing process and I would be happy to keep the committee and the House fully informed.</p></speech>

My Department's commitment to advancing Ireland's trade and economic interests in Europe and internationally is set out under the programme.  The amount allocated for this programme in 2016 is &euro;27.6 million, which represents a very slight decrease on the 2015 provision of &euro;27.9 million.</p><p>With a global footprint of 80 missions, the embassy network has been fundamental to our efforts to restore Ireland's unique international reputation and to drive economic recovery through the promotion of trade, tourism and investment.  Working in partnership with state agencies, embassies have made a significant contribution to Ireland's strong economic performance and our ongoing ability to continue to attract foreign direct investment and inward tourism.  The new economic diplomacy strategy which launched in January aims to build the capacity of the network to enable our embassies to become more active and to open business hubs for our exporters, which complements the work of the State agencies.  The first step is a pilot programme for the local hire of commercial <i>attach&eacute;s</i>which is currently being rolled out at five embassies in the emerging markets where Ireland has recently opened missions.  Trade promotion funds will be expanded and developed under this initiative.</p><p>With regard to the St. Patrick's Day period and the export trade council, this year the council has already formally met on two occasions in January and June.  The latter meeting had a particular focus on the UK referendum.  Between the January and June meetings, there were also separate informal meetings with the private sector and with Government and State agencies.  All 27 priority markets have prepared local market plans for this year and the seven designated exploratory and high-potential markets have also submitted plans for their activities this year.</p><p>The OECD programme involves a contribution to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which was &euro;2.2 million in 2015.  This is a mandatory contribution and is expected to rise to about &euro;2.5 million for 2016.  With regard to the financial position at the end of May, our expenditure remains broadly on target.</p></speech>

It is more than five years since certain trade functions were transferred to his Department with the establishment of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Will the Minister indicate whether his Department ensures that its work and goals are aligned with those of other Departments and statutory agencies which are also working to enhance Ireland's trade and business abroad?  I am thinking of the work of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Bord Bia in this regard.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is no duplication or overlapping of effort?</p> <p>  At times we do not give due credit to many of the companies which are operating in the international markets, building up markets for themselves and growing markets.  Before the trade functions were formally assigned to the Department, I know that it, through its embassy network, and the different statutory agencies always did great work in assisting Irish companies to build up relationships and expand into or develop new markets.  We should be cognisant of the great work of so many small companies and large Irish companies out there gaining extra market share for Ireland.</p></speech>

From being involved with this committee and with the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, I understand that countries are very keen to do business with Ireland.  It comes from our attitude to aid and to human rights.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate if Cuba is on his agenda because I understand that country would be anxious to have a trade mission.  It is something that has been spoken of for quite some time and we do not see anything forthcoming on that particular matter.  I want to stress, and I have attended quite a number of meetings about the matter, that if we are talking business we have to talk about decent work and our businesses, when they go to the countries, are encouraged to keep that on their agenda also.</p></speech>

The export trade council acts as a link between the agencies and various Departments. </p><p> The trade, tourism and investment strategy expired at the end of last year.  We are currently in the course of renewing that strategy, which will ensure all of our trade-related policies are current and fit into a whole-of-government approach.  There is no doubt but that since the reconfiguration of Departments in 2011 the trade promotion section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been working particularly well.  The new mandate given to our 80 missions to place particular emphasis on trade, business and commerce has had dividends and, I might add, has played an important role in our economic recovery.  There has been no formal agreement yet on the programme for trade missions for this year but I understand from Enterprise Ireland that it is in the course of finalisation.  Enterprise Ireland will communicate the proposed programme to my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Once agreed, we would be anxious, particularly now that we have almost reached the halfway point of the year, to ensure that not only do the missions take place but that they are successful.</p><p> I referred earlier to St. Patrick's Day.  The NBC network and my Department play a huge role in ensuring the success of the St. Patrick's Day events.  This process was somewhat restricted this year because of the electoral cycle here.  Notwithstanding this, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and several Ministers and Ministers of State visited six countries promoting Ireland and Irish business.  We will be in a position, as always, to provide a full and detailed report in respect of the success in that regard.  I take this opportunity to advise the committee that at the end of August, at my invitation, all of the heads of missions will be returning to Dublin to discuss their trade work.  It is important, as we continue through the recovery of our economy not only in Dublin but also across the regions, that we ensure that all our missions are fully engaged in developing Irish trade, business and commerce.  I would welcome any views the committee might have in that regard.</p><p> With regard to question from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, last year I had the opportunity to meet the Minister of Trade for Cuba at the UN.  There are countries with which Ireland has not had the type of relationship that perhaps some of our citizens would have enjoyed.  I will continue to expand and develop our network and contacts during the course of my tenure.</p></speech>

The programme equally supports Ireland's contribution to the EU's global engagement on peace and security, trade and development, as well as security in the wider European region.</p> <p>  The allocation for this programme in 2016 is &euro;19.3 million, compared to &euro;19.5 million in 2015.  The allocation supports the operation of our network of missions to Europe, including our 28 embassies in EU member states and the permanent representation in Brussels, allowing us to grow our influence.  Our mission network operates on behalf of the whole of Government, promoting and securing our interests with our most important partners in Europe.  This allocation is also used to fund projects which seek to further Ireland's foreign policy priorities under the EU common foreign and security policy.</p><p>The 2016 allocation is &euro;418,000.  Expenditure is divided into two categories, monetary payments under the Common, Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, and support for voluntary contributions to projects promoting Ireland's foreign policy priorities under the Common, Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, framework, as outlined in our foreign policy document, The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy in a Changing World.</p><p> In terms of outputs, by end June this year there will have been 32 incoming-outgoing visits by Ministers and senior officials to our European partners, keeping us on track to reach 50 visits by the end of this year.  This includes 15 visits to western Europe, seven to eastern Europe and four to the Caucasus, Moldova and Central Asia.  The outputs identified under this programme reflect the work of the Department in building our presence within the European Union and ensuring a strong flow of analysis and strategic information from our mission network to the appropriate and relevant areas of government.  </p><p> The programme remains broadly on target but we are incurring additional security costs at some of our missions following the terrorists attacks in major European cities, as referred to earlier by Deputy Grealish.</p></speech>

Has the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made preparations in case of a British decision to leave the European Union, which I sincerely hope will not arise?</p> <p>  Do we have an embassy in each EU member state?  If so, I presume we will continue to retain them.  Also, over the years we have been very fortunate as a country in that we have had Irish people in senior positions in the European Union institutions.  A few years ago concern was expressed that the number of Irish people in the institutions was declining.  At one stage, it was thought a programme might be put in place to encourage people to apply for employment within the European Union institutions or to apply for transfer there from within the public service.  Has there been any increase in the number of Irish people taking up employment in the institutions? </p></speech>

We will be eagerly awaiting the result tomorrow.  I expect the Taoiseach will make a statement some time tomorrow morning outlining Ireland's reaction to the result and the appropriate next steps.</p> <p>  On our missions in EU member states, we do have a full time presence in each of the 27 EU member states.  As I said earlier, these are under review.  I would be anxious that we would be in a position to open new missions abroad having regard to the changing circumstances.  However, such endeavours must be maintained within budget.  The allocation of resources is kept under review at all times.  </p> <p>  On employment within the EU institutions, Ireland has always been particularly proud of its contribution at all levels across the EU institutions.  It is testament to our endeavour and our expertise that over the years many senior positions within the EU institutions have been occupied by Irish personnel.  I do not have information for Deputy O'Brien in regard to vacancies.  I do not envisage that there are any vacancies but I am happy to communicate with the Deputy on the matter at a later date.</p><p>Members will have noted a recent initiative by the EU institutions to advertise for Irish language translators, and that will be of interest to Irish scholars and those wishing to work in the EU institutions.  Those applications are under way.</p><p> Programme E is a new programme for 2016.  It highlights the emphasis we are placing on driving and supporting public service reform and Civil Service renewal by strengthening our corporate governance and reviewing and upgrading key corporate processes and procedures.  It includes the resources we dedicate to communicating globally through traditional and social media, providing high-quality advice, briefing and analysis to the Government, the Houses of the Oireachtas and other State actors, and our efforts to proactively publish information and to respond to freedom of information requests.  The allocation under the programme for this year is &euro;41 million, compared with &euro;41.6 million in 2015.  A total of 98% of the costs associated with this programme include the pay and non-pay administrative expenditure for the main support divisions of the Department, including those supporting our operations in ten locations on the island of Ireland and our 80 missions abroad.  These include our information and communications technology unit, finance division, human resources unit, communications unit, policy planning unit and strategy and performance unit.  The figure also includes the resources across the mission network dedicated to strengthening our international influence.  Work has continued on the roll-out of new websites across our mission network in the period to 16 June 2016.  There have been 4.3 million visits to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website network by almost 2 million unique users, compared to 2.7 million visits by 1.35 million unique users over the same period in 2015.  Visits to the website have almost doubled year on year.  We are on track to exceed our targets for visitors and unique users this year.  The largest items of web and digital expenditure have included technical development costs for the TravelWise app, to which we referred earlier, and other non-recurring mission website-related costs.  Press and public outreach expenditure has so far focused on the 1916 centenary events, including inward media visits and the May visit to Ireland by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.</p><p> Some of the 2016 output targets provide a snapshot of headline governance activities in the Department as well as reflecting some of the key operational supports which enable the Department to perform across the programme.  Earlier this year we published our first corporate governance framework for the Department, which sets out the structures and processes in place to help us deliver on our priorities, achieve our objectives and act in the public interest in ways that are consistent with legal regulatory and government policy obligations.  The Department received the results of the first Civil Service employee engagement survey in April of this year.  Our results were broadly positive in comparison with other Departments, exceeding the Civil Service average scores for 20 of the 24 measures examined.  Since the survey results were issued, several workshops have been held with staff to identify practical initiatives to address some of the issues raised in the surveys.</p><p> Eight knowledge management projects are advancing through our knowledge management and innovation task force, including new projects in areas such as contacts management and facilitating online payments.  To date, 69 of the 80 missions have a social media presence - that is, 85% - and our aim is to achieve our target of 100% by the end of 2016.  The Department&rsquo;s policy planning unit is on target for its output and has completed four significant policy projects to date this year - on Russia, migration, the United Nations and US foreign policy.  </p><p> In conclusion, the financial position at the end of May remains broadly on target.  Customer service is at the heart of our work.  The Department is updating the customer services charter and our customer service action plan.</p></speech>

We ensure we have people in place with the appropriate level of expertise to meet the needs required in important roles.  Through our recruitment and promotion competitions, organised by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, we have recruited 13 permanent third secretaries since January.  The next generation of appointments will ensure we fill the critical gaps here in Dublin and abroad.</p></speech>

Over the past couple of years we managed in very challenging financial circumstances to open 14 new missions abroad.  I expect that over the next couple of years we may be in a position to increase our complement.  The review is considering Europe and further.</p> <p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan will be pleased to hear that we are considering particularly Latin America where there is opportunity for us, and South-East Asia, which has been particularly important for our trade policy.</p></speech>

That includes 314 locally recruited staff in missions abroad as well as over 150 temporary clerical officers to meet the seasonal demand in the Passport Office.  Deputy McLoughlin has raised an important point and it is one we keep under review.  We recently reviewed the operation of our single diplomat missions which have worked well but there are recommendations and we hope to ensure that they have sufficient support from our headquarters here to help them prioritise their business engagements.  We do not have any plans to expand that model but we will keep the situation under review.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan will not be surprised to know that most of the freedom of information requests are from the media and members of the public.</p></speech>

The primary source of income which accrues directly to the Exchequer from my Department comes from passport application fees, which are estimated to amount to more than &euro;40 million in 2016 and which account for more than 90% of all our appropriations-in-aid receipts.  The total income under appropriations-in-aid is estimated at more than &euro;45.2 million.  Appropriations-in-aid to the end of May are ahead of budget by &euro;5 million due to the increase in passport applications that we referred to earlier.</p></speech>

Gu&iacute;m gach rath orthu go l&eacute;ir leis an obair th&aacute;bhachtach at&aacute; romhainn.  Chomh maith le sin, ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt d'iar-oifigigh mo chuid-se i Roinn na Gaeltachta.  In 2014 nuair a th&aacute;inig an cr&uacute; ar an tairne bh&iacute; siadsan ann agus is m&oacute;r an taca&iacute;ocht agus an cuidi&uacute; a bhfuair m&eacute; uathu ag an am.</p><p>The Chairman is conscious of the fact, as am I, that Ministers come and go, so I wanted to publicly acknowledge my appreciation to my former team in the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and to let this committee know that use of the Irish language will continue in this Department.  I have a meeting today with the coiste Gaeilge in the Department.  If the Chairman has any<i></i>ideas around how we can network and link in with our global diaspora or global networks in respect of the promotion of the Irish language, we will be all ears.  I further add that since coming into this Department, I have been welcomed in a very positive way and am really looking forward to working with a positive and strong team.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to present the 2016 Revised Estimate for Vote 27 - International Co-operation and to briefly outline our plans for the coming year.  As the new Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, I look forward to a constructive engagement today and throughout my term as Minister with responsibility for Ireland's development programme.  I repeat that my officials and I are available to the committee at all times and I hope it will have an early opportunity to visit the aid programme to see and assess its impact for itself.</p><p>As the committee is aware, Vote 27 - International Co-operation funds approximately 80% of Ireland's official development assistance programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid.  The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department's high-level goal to work towards a fairer, more just, securer and sustainable world.  For 2016, the Government has provided a total budget of &euro;641 million, which is an increase of &euro;40 million or almost 7% on the 2015 allocation.</p><p>This is the first substantive increase in the aid budget in seven years and is a clear indication of the Government's firm commitment to the aid programme.  Of this total, &euro;483 million is managed by my Department under Vote 27 - International Co-operation, while the remaining &euro;155 million is made up of contributions by other Departments and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Co-operation budget.</p><p> The Government is committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, as official development assistance, ODA.  Our programme for Government reiterates this position and states that we will make progress towards the target as resources permit.  As the economic recovery consolidates, we have begun to start delivering on this commitment.  Our ambition is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the UN 0.7% target by 2030, the timeframe for the sustainable development goals.  At this stage, we estimate the 2016 allocation will deliver an ODA-GNP percentage of 0.36%.  However, the final statistic, which is heavily dependent on GNP, will not be available until next spring.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is strongly focused on the fight against poverty and hunger in the world.  More than 80% of our funding is provided in sub-Saharan Africa, where the needs are greatest.  Seven of our eight key partner countries are in Africa, the eighth being Vietnam.  We are working this year to address the immediate needs arising from the unprecedented level of humanitarian crisis in the Middle East and Africa, while strengthening the resilience of our partners through our long-term development programme.  This is a difficult balance, given the scale of immediate need, but it is a vital one if we are to assist in averting future crises as a result of conflict, underdevelopment, inequality and climate change.  It is essential that we frame our work in the context of the new sustainable development goals, adopted by world leaders at the UN last September, which provide a new agenda for global development up to 2030.</p><p> The scale of the humanitarian crisis facing the world was captured by the UNHCR this week.  There are now 65.3 million people worldwide displaced from their homes as refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers.  The number, scale and intensity of emergencies continue to increase and the humanitarian system is struggling to cope.  In the past decade, the number of people who need humanitarian assistance has increased by 237%.  Since 2004, humanitarian funding requirements have increased by 490%.</p><p> Ireland's humanitarian assistance in 2016 will total approximately &euro;150 million, representing a sizable scaling up on previous years.  Our support is focused on responding to meeting the acute needs of people affected by ongoing complex conflict crises in Syria and its neighbouring countries, South Sudan and the Horn of Africa and the Sahel region.  Ireland is also responding to food insecurity and acute malnutrition arising from the impact of the El Ni&ntilde;o weather effect throughout Africa and to crises which receive less media attention such as those in Somalia, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><p> Last month, I represented the Government at the first ever world humanitarian summit in Istanbul.  At that summit, Ireland made a number of specific commitments which we are now taking forward.  These include an increased focus on the needs of displaced communities, more efficient and predictable provision of humanitarian funding and greater coherence between our development and humanitarian funding.</p><p> Over the coming weeks, I plan to visit Uganda to launch our new five year development programme, which is strongly focused on education and some of the poorest communities in the country.  I look forward to meeting with our NGO partners, which are so critical to the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s development and humanitarian programmes and to our policy engagement internationally.  I will also be engaging with our key UN partners as we follow up on my initial meetings at the summit in Istanbul and prepare for the migration summit in New York on 19 September.  We provide targeted core support to a number of key UN partners and other international organisations, whose priorities and policies fit well with ours and who have a proven track record of delivery.  These voluntary contributions allow Ireland to participate in development co-operation at a global level in key areas of need and in countries outside our bilateral programme.</p><p> Our development co-operation is at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Our key objective for 2016 is to continue delivering a world class programme which is aimed at some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable and marginalised people, helping to save lives and building livelihoods.</p><p>We appreciate the continued strong support and engagement of the committee in this regard.  I would welcome comments and questions from members.</p></speech>

We can take the individual Votes together because it is one programme.  Pope Francis recently said that arms can get to places in very deprived countries where food cannot.  That comment shows the failure of the international community to get aid, food and nutrition to many displaced people living in the most horrific circumstances.  The barbarity, murder and genocide committed against people in Syria and that region has to be a source of great concern to all of us.</p> <p>  An issue I would like to see pursued is the horror being inflicted on many people in the Middle East being termed as genocide.  A recent UN report made some commitment to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court.  It is an issue Ireland should support and we should enlist the support of other EU member states.  I do not think there is much benefit in having the slaughter and mass murder of innocent people and the horrors inflicted on many people in the region termed as genocide in 20 or 30 years' time.  It should be done now.  It is an issue we should pursue at EU and UN level.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State tell us what percentage of GNP was our ODA programme in 2015?  Is Ireland considering working with any new key partner countries in addition to the nine established ones?  A widely quoted figure this week was that 65 million people are displaced worldwide.  It is a terrible reflection on the international community.  Deputy Durkan referred to the non-working of the UN.  We need its architecture to be reconfigured and for there to be a change in its work methods, in particular in regard to the veto of the Security Council.  It crosses over with the work of the Minister of State, along with that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  In every forum that is available to us, we should continue to raise these issues.</p> <p>  I take the opportunity to compliment the many people who deliver aid and assistance at the coalface and provide help to the most beleaguered people throughout the world.  People are working with many NGOs, including lay people and religious missionaries.  Many people volunteer to work in particular countries.  They all deserve our commendation and appreciation because they are working in horrific circumstances.  Over the years, the committee has had the opportunity to hear at first-hand the experience of different Irish NGOs, in collaboration with their international sister organisations.  We want to send the message out that this State will continue to support as strongly as possible the work of those people in the provision of the humanitarian assistance that is so badly needed in many different parts of the world.  Unfortunately, the demand seems to be growing all the time and aid is not getting to the most vulnerable people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#Y00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining his programme of work and priorities.  He referred to a figure of 0.36% of GNP as being our target.  For a number of years, we have had a commitment to reach 0.7% of GDP.  We discussed this issue in the D&aacute;il.  While the commitment is to be on target by 2030, it is incumbent on all parties and Independents that, in advance of the budget, we examine how, subject to certain growth assumptions, what the appropriate position should be in three or five years' time, should the term of the Government last between three and five years.  We need to set that out on a multi-annual basis.</p><p>The figure is linked to GNP and things work both ways.  There can be substantial decreases in ODA in monetary terms, but matters can appear to be quite good in GNP terms.  No one expected the crash.  We will not go over all of that again, but it had an impact.</p><p> I am aware of the work Irish Aid is doing with regard to auditing and review, which is taken extremely seriously and done very well.  I do not have any specific concerns in that area.</p><p> I want to return to an issue I raised with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  I have specific concerns about the EU-Turkey arrangement.  I understand that, through Irish Aid, our contribution towards the arrangement is &euro;22.9 million.  I agree with MSF that these moneys are supporting an ever more restrictive migration and asylum system in the EU.  I would like to get confirmation that none of the moneys allocated are being used to strengthen border defences or for security within Turkey.</p><p> The Minister of State has an excellent opportunity - on his visit to New York - to address the migrant crisis and to reassert Ireland's foreign policy independence.  I am not happy - others will make up their own minds - about how the EU is addressing the crisis in the Middle East, Syria and Iraq.  Most reasonable people will not be comfortable with the deal the EU has struck with Turkey.  We should say that and there should be no fear about an independent Irish State asserting independent Irish foreign policy.  I would welcome a more detailed discussion with the Minister of State and a meeting of the committee before the migrant summit in New York because it is a fantastic opportunity to strike out and say what is really happening.  Europe has not reacted well to the crisis.  Citizens need help and assistance.</p><p> Deputy Grealish said many migrants do not want to come here.  I understand that, but many do wish to do so and there can be a short-term solution.  The response of the EU has, in many instances, been nothing short of disgraceful.  To strike a deal with Turkey, given its human rights record, in particular its treatment of the Kurds on its southern borders, leaves a lot to be desired.  We have to reassess the agreement.  That is all I will say on the matter.</p><p> On ODA, all of us have to plan as to how we will increase funding over the next three years for the excellent work that is being done through the Department of the Minister of State and Irish Aid.  Once the committee is up and running, we would welcome the opportunity - outside the Estimates process - to have a specific discussion on that matter.  We would like to see some of the programmes and the work that is being done.</p><p> I refer to our commitment in respect of the rebuilding and reconstruction of Gaza after the Israeli bombardment there and the war that took place.  I understand we committed &euro;4.5 million towards the reconstruction.  What is the current position?  Have we met that commitment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#Z00200"><p>I want to acknowledge what has been maintained in spite of recessionary budgets and repeated calls to drastically cut ODA or eliminate it altogether.  I would like to see how we will achieve the 0.7% target because it is being pushed further and further out.</p> <p>  We know the damage done by climate change, yet we are only donating &euro;2 million to the green fund.  Are there plans to increase that figure?</p> <p>I was a member of the previous committee and chaired the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA.  I have particular concerns about Africa.  There was great disappointment when our embassy in Lesotho closed.  I met the former ambassador recently, who is now working in a voluntary capacity.  What engagement has taken place with Lesotho and the programmes we had in place?</p><p> I refer to a bigger issue, namely, policy coherence and aid effectiveness, about which I spoke recently at the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, Assembly.  There are times when we seem to give aid with one hand but surely the objective must be to increase sustainable livelihoods and food security in African or partner countries.  There are serious concerns that the Economic Partnership Agreements, EPAs, trade agreements, etc., are not contributing to this objective.  At the ACP Assembly recently - I mentioned this in the D&aacute;il the other day - I was horrified to meet parliamentarians from African countries who knew nothing about EPAs even though their parliaments were going to ratify them.  It is incumbent on Europe to make sure that parliaments know exactly what is involved in these EPAs.  Other parliamentarians knew exactly what was involved in EPAs and had serious concerns.</p><p> An EPA agreement was signed in Botswana two weeks ago but its ratification is only coming up.  There are countries which are prepared to ratify the EPA but because their neighbouring countries are not going to do so, they could be fined.  I think there is an issue there for them and Ghana, in particular, could have an issue.  Those countries are concerned that their own agrifood industries are being undermined.  I do not think enough is going into that.  Again, it comes back to policy coherence of giving with one hand and yet the economic growth of the donor country seems to drive so much aid.  I know our aid is untied, which I hope continues, but other countries have serious concerns because that is what drives their overseas development aid.</p><p> Another issue is engagement with parliamentarians.  I hope that whenever people go to Africa to visit areas in receipt of Irish Aid, they meet the local parliamentarians.  Again, it is concerning that there are African parliamentarians who do not know about aid being given to their countries.  We are talking about democracy and peer to peer engagement of parliamentarians.  It is very disturbing that we do not see either.</p><p> Another big issue, on which I would like us to do more, is tax.  I read that Africa received $134 billion one year in the form of ODA and so on but in the same year, $190 billion left Africa in the form of tax evasion, tax avoidance and the various contracts multinational companies engineer and produce.  There is a need to join up the dots.  I totally support ODA and would never undermine or criticise such aid.  We need to look at the bigger picture of tax, parliamentary engagement and policy coherence.  We are lauded for sending all this milk formula, which is full of fat, to African countries but we have other programmes which encourage African women to breast-feed.  There is a big industry around frozen chicken parts and exporting them to certain African countries.  They are banned in some countries but there is an illicit trade going on.  This is an agrifood business which we could help to support local African farmers to develop.</p></speech>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is an important Department.  It is also important we ring-fence and increase this money for overseas development aid.  Sometimes members are asked why Ireland sends so much money abroad when we need some at home.  A number of years ago, I visited some of our projects in Africa.  I met 12 members of parliament in Zambia, eight of whom had been taught by Irish missionaries.  It is important we acknowledge that.  We stayed in a town in the middle of Zambia, whose name I cannot think of.  The town was pitch dark as there were no street lights.  We were told not to leave our hotel but I wanted to sample the local beer.</p><p>Around the corner from my hotel, I found Delaney's Irish bar.  When I walked into the bar, the whole place went silent.  A guy asked me where was I from and I said I was a Member of Parliament from Ireland.  The man said, "You Irish are very welcome because your missionaries have been very good to us."  I ask the Minister of State to outline the co-operation, if any, that takes place between his Department and our missionaries abroad.  The tremendous contribution made by Irish missionaries is a huge reason that St. Patrick's Day is celebrated abroad and it is something that should be acknowledged.</p><p> We have heard much lately about some agencies and organisations in receipt of State funding being investigated because it is suspected that the money has not been spent correctly.

One must acknowledge the tremendous work that agencies do abroad but it is crucially important that the money goes where it is needed.  I want to know whether there are proper checks and balances in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#BB00400"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well in his future role in the Department.  It is an interesting Department and many challenges will emerge on a daily and weekly basis, including emergencies.</p><p>I agree with the remarks made by previous speakers on the need to ensure aid reaches the people for whom it is intended.  We must ensure that nobody along the way decides to cream off a piece, an edge or a corner of the funding for his or her own benefit.  In fact it is required that this committee, and I am only a passing member today, takes control of this issue.  In so far as is possible, the committee must visit the various locations, meet local politicians and be clear in its understanding of what must be done.  The committee may well be criticised by the media for travelling abroad.  The fact is that ODA is an important area of investment and, therefore, it is important that we ensure that the money is put to the right use.</p><p>Aid for trade has been referred to already by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.  We need to be very careful that we do not find ourselves indirectly aiding commercial enterprises in other countries.  We give aid without strings attached but not every country does so.  I strongly urge that a careful assessment be carried out on countries involved in aid for trade.  We must find out whether we will become disadvantaged by their activities.</p><p>Like Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I wish to mention the important issues of refugees and Turkey.  It is true that Turkey has had an ongoing problem with human rights but that country's standards relating to and recognition of human rights are not the same as ours.  There is a vast difference and that has always been the case.  Unfortunately, throughout the European Union there has been an inexorable move away from Turkey and a tendency to wrongly blame it for things.  Ireland used to be quite supportive of Turkey and encouraged it to comply with the <i>acquis communautaire</i>and to join the European Union.  In recent years, Turkey has moved away from Europe and now has fewer friends in the so-called free world, which is not good.  Recently, I watched a television programme in which a woman went into great detail to explain that the people like her, who are liberal minded and progressive, are becoming more isolated by virtue of the fact that Turkey appears to have been isolated by the free thinking global community.  I have concerns about such a situation.  Previously, Turkey had a natural tendency to move towards Europe and aspired to the same standards that we regard as being a normal part of a modern society.  I think Europe is going in the opposite direction now.</p><p>My point is about the extent to which we tend to see the European Union, and the United Nations as well, as having failed in terms of the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East.  The EU, as an entity, seems to be getting the blame but it was not the EU that caused the problems; it was the individual member states across the European Union and others across the globe.  There was no compulsion on anybody to do anything other than respond in a favourable fashion to the crisis as it arose.  It was not a great advertisement for freedom-loving global communities to see children falling off boats and their bodies being picked up on beaches or to see the old emblem of razor wire as the greeting for children, their mothers and other adults who were refugees and who walked more than 100 miles to get to a place of safety.  As a global community we did not cover ourselves in glory and we stand convicted of negligence and failure to respond or do anything in a situation as catastrophic as the one that has prevailed in the past two and a half to three years.</p><p> When I was a young person, I read about Nazism, the failure of various countries to recognise what was happening long before it came to pass and the appalling cruelty that was visited on the European community and, eventually, the global community.  I am greatly worried about the consequences of the type of scenes we have seen on our television screens in the past two and a half to three years.  If we, as a global community, try to divest ourselves of any responsibility for those events, we are wrong.  We are deluding ourselves.  Oscar Wilde said duty is what we expect of others but not necessarily of ourselves.  That duty must fall to each and every person.  In the near future, a recognition has to dawn that every freedom-loving person in Europe and across the globe has a responsibility to respond in some fashion.  We are having a debate across Europe on what is called immigration, which is a nice word but that is all it is, but unless the European community and the global community come to grips with recognising that we have responsibilities and freedom, and that we can respond in a much more favourable fashion than we have done in the past, we will be condemned in the future and we may suffer the consequences of what happens when we neglect that area.  I am sorry for going on about that.</p></speech>

I stated earlier that the displacement of 65 million people is a huge indictment of the global community.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien referred to the deficiencies in the EU-Turkey agreement.  We all share that particular view.  We do not give enough recognition to those small states, including Jordan and others, in the immediate vicinity of Syria which have taken in a huge number of refugees and which also face challenges.  In fairness to Turkey, it has taken in approximately 3 million refugees from Syria, which is much more than the number taken in by wealthier European states.  We would appreciate it if the Minister of State responded to some of the points raised that are relevant to his Vote.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016062300002#CC00300"><p>It is encouraging that there is a good deal of experience here in that some members were on the previous foreign affairs committee and I can sense that there will be an ongoing engagement on these major challenges.</p> <p>  The Chairman quoted Pope Francis, who referred to food and emergency services not being met because the people needing them were living in war zones or for various other reasons.  That is an issue, but I put a challenge to the Chairman and the members.  We have to look at our own set-up in terms of the peace process.  The Chairman was very involved in the Good Friday Agreement committee and perhaps we have story to share in terms of bringing communities together.</p><p>I met a priest recently, Fr. Padraig Devine, a Roscommon man based in Nairobi, who is very much focused on conflict resolution in war zones.  He sees no point in building schools and hospitals if the conflict cannot be sorted out.  He could be an interesting participant in this committee and the Chairman might get a chance to contact him at some stage.  The organisation is Shalom.  I had not heard of it until I met Fr. Devine a few weeks ago.  He has something significant to contribute that might help the members in their engagement.</p><p> We have a role to play.  We can enlist the support of the International Criminal Court where there are examples of genocide, rape and so on to ensure that aid gets to the most vulnerable.</p><p> The members will be aware that there is a conflict resolution unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and I met with the staff in the past two weeks.  There is an opportunity for this committee also to engage with that unit.</p><p> I was asked if we envisaged the designation of a new key partner country in the near future.  We do not.  We have eight key partners, seven of which are in sub-Saharan Africa where there is a strong strategic commitment to long-term assistance.  I refer to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi and Sierra Leone.  Outside that continent, there is also Vietnam.  That is not to say there is no engagement on funding with other countries.  Obviously, events bring change.  El Ni&ntilde;o brought devastating consequences to southern African and it is affecting food supplies.  The cost of food in places like Lesotho is having a major impact.</p><p> Deputy O'Brien raised again the EU-Turkey refugee facility, which he raised with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who said he would note that.  It was agreed by the European Council to fund services for Syrian refugees in Turkey.  The specific commitment given was that it was for services for Syrian refugees.  I am aware of a committee that will work in tandem with the decision that has been made and if this committee has reservations, there might be an opportunity for it and our Government to let those be known because it was not specifically about border enhancement; it was about services for refugees.</p><p> In terms of the funding, the Deputy is correct that it is &euro;22 million over four years, including &euro;5 million from Vote 27 in 2016.  We engage, through our officials in Brussels, on the management of funding under the new Turkey refugee facility and no doubt the Deputy will continue to engage with this committee on that.  We note his concerns, which he outlined clearly.</p></speech>

When I first heard the figure I had to ask if it was right.  We invested &euro;3.8 billion since 2011.  That is a massive injection when we consider the need this year for the humanitarian interventions is for $20 billion just to deal with the crisis this year.  That is a significant contribution.  While taxpayers here were going through a very difficult time, they were still contributing to the global needs in terms of the humanitarian crisis.  That has to be noted.</p> <p>  I have a note on the reconstruction of Gaza.</p><p>In response to the humanitarian situation, Ireland has provided &euro;2.5 million to the emergency appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.  This support has helped to provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families.  A further &euro;500,000 was recently approved by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for the Gaza emergency appeal and will fulfil the pledge of &euro;2.5 million made by Ireland at the international Gaza restructuring conference in October 2014.  This will bring the total contribution to the 2014 Gaza crisis to &euro;3 million.</p><p> As a new Minister, I will be relying a lot on Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's experience of Africa.  I have never been there but I am really looking forward to going in two weeks' time.  I had a great opportunity at the Ireland-Africa forum to meet many people from the continent.  As the Lesotho ambassador pointed out, the forum had the biggest representation from Africa in five years, so something good is happening in that partnership and it needs to continue.  The Deputy also mentioned the green climate fund, for which &euro;2 million has been provided through the Department of Finance.  In the context of our commitment to overseas aid, we will work together on the question of the amount as a percentage of gross national income.  The embassy in Lesotho was closed on 31 October 2014 following the reappraisal of Ireland's wider diplomatic network and the need to make the most effective use of limited resources, as the Deputy will know.  I was in the constituency of Deputy Darragh O'Brien on Tuesday and saw a very interesting project at Portmarnock community school.  The ambassador of Lesotho was there.  People looking for a confidence-building exercise in addressing global problems will see it there as it is a very practical initiative.  The council has been engaged and young people in the school are developing apps.  They are looking at mapping a country that is a long way away from us.  A lot of it is done remotely - they do not have to get on a plane but can do it using the ICT mechanisms we have.  It is a very interesting project and is an example of the voluntary work and practical measures that are being taken outside our financial commitments.  Teagasc is involved in partnership exercises relating to food.  Africa can supply enough food to feed the world, not just Africa, and all of these measures can help.  The Deputy also asked about untied aid, and we will remain committed to that.</p><p> Deputy Durkan stressed the importance of meeting local parliamentarians.  Tax issues were raised, and there are many areas on which we need to work at a global level, such as in the UN and the EU institutions.  There are, however, practical measures we can take.  I saw some statistics recently about the provision of radiotherapy services, chemotherapy and smear testing, and these are areas on which we can work closely.  I would be very happy to support any practical measures suggested by committee members.</p><p> The ratification of EU economic partnership agreements, EPAs, was also mentioned.  Sine the conclusion in 2014 of three EPAs with west Africa, the east African community and the southern African development community, the EU and its member states have been working with 27 African countries to achieve ratification by 1 October.  Ireland has played its part in this process, signing the west African EPA in December 2014, which was approved by the D&aacute;il last November.  The southern African development community EPA was signed on 10 June in Botswana, and EU member states signed the east African community EPA on 20 June.  Discussions are ongoing on a date for the formal signature ceremony in east Africa.</p><p>The Department has to look at a regional approach to this and measures are in place in this respect.  If Deputies need any further information on this we can certainly supply it.</p><p> Deputy McLoughlin asked about decreases in Vote 27 relating to consultancy services and certain administrative services.  The major need is for a follow-up to humanitarian crises and the peace and stability fund is up by 27%, while the rapid response fund is up 100% and recovery assistance is up by &euro;5.3 million.  The big measures involve dealing with a situation at a given time, such as have arisen owing to 65 million people being displaced because of conflict in vulnerable countries, such as South Sudan and Yemen, and devastating climatic issues arising from El Ni&ntilde;o in southern Africa which are outside our control.  The Department has great capacity in the shape of its relationship with its partner aid organisations which, as members have said, have done tremendous work and we will continue that work.</p><p> Deputy Grealish asked about missionaries.  I did some research into a certain missionary who left Bangor and ended up in Bobbio in Italy in 516 AD, his name Columbanus, and his work can be seen in France and Austria.  This is in our nature and is part of who we are.  We like to give, to travel and to help people in need and the Deputy is absolutely correct about the doors this activity opens, something which is also evidenced by our nuns and priests who went abroad.  It is important to point out that &euro;15.5 million has gone to Misean Cara, an organisation which does great work in health intervention and education.</p><p> I was also asked about auditing.  We have an evaluation audit unit in the Department which is independent and reports to the Secretary General.  It is important that it is independent and robust so that we ensure taxpayers' money is spent wisely.  Deputy Durkan said it was important to see for oneself what the situation was in certain areas.  He referenced Turkey and has concerns in this area.  He made the point that time was not on our side and suggested that, while 2030 might seem a long way away, it is only 14 years.  It was 14 years ago that I was elected to the Seanad but it feels like yesterday and 14 years fly by.  Time is not on our side and we have serious problems.  The agreed sustainable development goals, SDGs, were led by Ireland and co-facilitated by the Kenyan Government to implement the practical measures required.  I asked Charles Boamah of the African Development Bank for his perspective on the 700 people from Syria who died in the Mediterranean.  He told a story about a man he met who survived the crossing.  He asked him why he had risked his life and the gentleman replied that he did not risk his life - he was already dead.  I think everybody in this committee gets that.  I think everybody in this country, from primary schools to secondary schools, gets it too.</p><p>A school in Skibbereen, Kilcoe national school, came up with a great project which won the national competition.  The project was called "There is No Planet B".  Irish people get it both at home and abroad.  There is a duty on all of us to address the issues.</p><p> I look forward to working with the committee.  I will report back from my trip to Uganda.  I hope the committee will stay in touch.  The officials want to work with members also because they know the 14 years until 2030 is a small chunk of time in which to anticipate a population growth of up to 9 billion.  I wish you well in your deliberations, Chairman.  I know your heart is in the right place and that we can continue this engagement.</p></speech>

The committee is taking on a big task and it will work to a very tight timescale.  However, it is a challenging and an exciting prospect for us to take a step back from the daily and myriad issues that affect the health service and to consider the bigger picture in terms of the type of health service and system we believe is most suited to Ireland, how we can transition from the current situation of a two tier, quite dysfunctional service to a single tier, universal health service, consider the most appropriate funding model to achieve that and how we can model and phase the transition from what we have at present to what we believe will be a service that serves the people of this country much better than is currently the case.</p> <p>  We must be careful not to overlap with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health of which Deputy Harty is chairperson.  As many of us know from past experience, that committee, which deals with legislation and day-to-day activities in the health service, has a clear oversight role in respect of the different agencies in the health service and receives many representations.  The work of our committee is to take a step back, examine the system and take a more strategic approach to the current model and the type of model we wish to achieve for the delivery of a modern, reformed and inclusive universal health service.  We must be mindful of that to ensure there is no overlap with the joint committee.</p> <p>  We must also keep a clear focus on the terms of the all-party motion under which this committee was established.  I have asked the Clerk to circulate the motion so we can remind ourselves what it provides for.  There are two key provisions in the motion.  The first is to examine how we can achieve a universal, single tier health service based on health need rather than ability to pay, how to transition from the current situation to that new model and what is the most appropriate funding model for a universal health service.</p> <p>  The second and most pressing element of the motion is to examine how we can re-orientate the health service away from the hospital-centric type of system we have at present and push the focus clearly on primary and community care.  We all talk about the urgent need to do that.  A more community and primary care focused health service undoubtedly delivers better quality of care, better health outcomes and is better value for money but while we talk about it, we have not looked at how we can transition to that model.  It is important that we get some advice on how to phase that transition.  It is all very well to say it makes sense on many different levels to re-orientate the health service to the community and primary sector but doing that in practice and the movement of resources away from acute hospitals to the community require very careful consideration and clear modelling.  It will more than likely require some seed capital to get that transition to happen.  That is the other key element of the motion which we must bear in mind.  There are two separate strands of work, in my view.</p><p> I am keen to hear members' views on how we might proceed.  I also wish to consider the types of groups or individuals we might invite to appear as witnesses before the committee.  I have received many representations already from different groups.  There are umpteen groups in the health sector with genuine concerns but it is important we try to take a strategic approach to this and invite, as far as possible, representative bodies or groups such as representative patient groups and representative professional groups.  We should also be mindful of the commitment in the programme for Government to use an evidence based approach to policy making and that will entail having close working relations with people who are experts in the field from an academic point of view, certainly bodies such as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the universities and other recognised experts in the field.  It need not be limited to people in Ireland.  There is no difficulty with bringing people from abroad if we believe they might be helpful to the committee's work.</p><p> That is my view on how we might proceed.  I am happy to hear the views of members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016062300002#D00200"><p>First, I congratulate you, Deputy Shortall.  It is a challenging undertaking.  There is no point in us sitting here and thinking that we will be able to facilitate everybody among the public who has views and opinions on health care and the health systems in this country.  It is important that when we extend invitations we should do so to people to give their expert views rather than let the committee be used as a lobbying forum for vested interests, of which there are many and many of which have good intentions.  If we are to be true to the spirit of the motion, we are talking about developing a strategy for health care over the next ten years.  That will require a great deal of work, much detailed research, and resources and supports for the committee.  During my time as my party's spokesperson on health, I have learned that there is a huge body of work available in reports that have been produced both nationally and internationally.  A great deal of research has been conducted by independent groups and experts, so we should be able to draw on what has been done already in those reports.  The committee would have to be resourced for that purpose.</p> <p>  On the broader issue, the motion recognises the severe pressures on the health system and refers to the need for consensus at political level.  That will always be a challenge and there is no point in saying otherwise.  There are already varying views in this committee on how we fund health care in general, who pays for it, who has accessibility, who has priority in terms of clinical need and working from that.  That will require shifts in people's minds, on all sides and none.  We should approach it with an open view, listen to the evidence that will be put before the committee and be honest with ourselves about what type of health service we want and what type of health service the State can support and sustain.  The difficulty we have had in the debates on health care in this country for many years, in the case of all political parties and all previous Governments, is over-promising, the simplification of the problems and under-delivery.</p> <p>  We have a health system that is under-resourced, overstretched and lacks capacity.  It will require direction in terms of how we fund health care in the years ahead and it will require resourcing.  It would be disingenuous of this committee to leave this room six months hence, or whenever the report is published, promising a utopian health system but not being honest about how we would fund it and the requirements and resources that would be necessary.  Broadening universality will require extra resources and funding that only comes from a number of sources but primarily from the taxpayer.  We cannot look at health care in isolation, without recognising the other consequences it might have on broader society.</p> <p>  However, this is an opportunity for all of us to move our mindset, perhaps, in how we view the provision of health care in this country.  I hope the committee uses its time wisely in developing the strategy.</p><p>That is as opposed to overlapping with Deputy Harty's committee or ending up as a platform for lobbying.  What we need is blue-sky thinking and beyond.</p><p> We mention a ten-year strategy in the motion, but we should be able to point out that there may be milestones or stepping stones that we should try to achieve as we get to a long-term goal.  We can have a ten-year strategy, but how we get there should be marked in some reasonable timeframe.  For example, we have the primary care strategy, but the problem is that it has not been enacted in full for the past ten or 11 years.  There are many reports and strategies, but if there is a commitment on all sides to ensure they are a priority in developing an overarching strategy, they could make a meaningful impact on people using our health services in the medium term.</p><p> I wish the Chairman and committee members well.  It will be an onerous task and one we should not take lightly.  The public will be looking on and we do not want them just to see another committee promising the sun, moon and, invariably, the stars without highlighting the cost implications, how it is to be funded, and accessibility.  We must be realistic in our efforts.  Nevertheless, we should have a positive and aspirational view of what we would like our health care system to be in the years ahead.  I assume the resourcing of the committee will have to be discussed as well.</p></speech>

We have a huge job of work and nobody underestimates that.  We must be very mindful of the potential for overlap.  We will not get any work done if we spend all our time in here allowing ourselves to be lobbied.  Notwithstanding that, we must balance our time, as I do not want anybody to get the impression that somehow we will not listen or we are not available.  The work of the other health committee will, I hope, take up some of that lobbying work.</p> <p>  Whatever findings we make must be evidence-based, but there is a substantial body of evidence out there already.  I have publicly stated that on a number of occasions.  The health service has, to a large extent, been researched to death and there are major volumes of research already available to us.  We need to be cognisant that there is much information out there that we can and should be using.  Equally, people will want to come and see us and we must be mindful that there are players with a vested interest.  They may be strong or powerful people seeking to influence us away from what is certainly Sinn F&eacute;in policy with regard to universal health care, rather than universal health insurance, for example.  We must be mindful of that and be careful that whomever we see, there is a balanced view.</p> <p>  We are here to do the work and we are very much looking forward to it.  We wish the committee well.  However, a substantial amount of work can be done with written submissions and we do not need to have a huge number of hearings.  We can learn much from what is out there already.</p></speech>

My background is not in medical health but in law; however, that is not necessarily bad, because one may see the issues on an objective level.  We all know how the health system works.  I hope to feed this back to the committee.</p> <p>  From an aspirational perspective, members know that universal health care was eventually abandoned.  I know approximately 47% of the population has private health insurance and 46% of people have medical cards.  We must be careful about what we are promising, as Deputy Kelleher alluded to earlier, from a practical perspective, and take care not to over-reach.  I will endeavour to do all I can, but we must watch the budget from that perspective.</p> <p>  From a practical perspective, there are micro- and macro-issues.</p><p>On a constituency level, I have already been lobbied by particular stakeholders wishing to contribute and have their say.  I wonder if the Chairman wishes us to meet such groups by ourselves and feed it back to the committee or should every group be represented in front of all members.  One of the issues I have with committees in general is they end up being a talking shop.  Will the Chairman assign specific tasks to particular members of the committee in order to bring about movement?  That is instead of just talking every week - or whenever we sit - about what we are doing.  On a practical level, as this is set up for a finite period, I suggest that we be strategic in how we approach the process.  There can be many lofty notions in speaking about health but we must bring that back to the micro level.  I am prepared to do whatever it takes from my perspective to help the committee in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016062300002#F00200"><p>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I congratulate Deputy Shortall on her election and I wish her every success in the role.  It is a daunting task that the Chairman has chosen us to lead and I cannot think of a greater task to be landed on the doorstep of any politician, to be honest, in this day and age, than what all of us have signed up for here, namely, to devise a ten-year strategy for health.</p> <p>  I have never felt so ill-equipped or ill-prepared for anything as landing in a seat here with responsibility to devise a health care policy for the next ten years.  With that in mind, there are a couple of points I should make.  The first is in regard to lobbying, which will be an issue for all of us.  The groups that will not get to appear before the committee will seek us out individually, as we know, and that has started already.  They will try to get to us all in that way.  Those are the joys of living in a democracy and we must all deal with it.  I support Deputy Louise O'Reilly's comments and we should go down the road of written submissions.  There is an onus on all of us to take the role seriously and do much of the reading and research ourselves.  We do not have to hear from everybody as much can be done through written submissions and us being responsible.</p> <p>  One of the biggest difficulties with the health system in the past has been politics and the flip-flop policy making of politicians, individual Ministers and party policy.  There have been changes and movements with whatever way the wind is blowing.  I am not sure that has been very helpful in many cases and one would wonder about the influence of politics on the health area.  Medical politics is involved as well, which is another story.</p> <p>  The first shot in developing a ten-year strategy should be a presentation from somebody on how to devise a strategy.  It might have nothing to do with the medical world but how to plan for ten years.  Perhaps we could have a presentation on strategic planning from an academic who might give us some guidance.  It is just a suggestion as a starting point for the committee to consider and see how we go.  Deputy Kelleher referred to resources, which is an important issue.  We saw the resources put into the banking inquiry and I would like to think this committee could serve a function that is equal to that if it does as it is supposed to do.  Resources should be made available to the committee, noting the short timeframe, so as to equip us to deal with the challenge we have taken and to do it justice.  The savings would be immeasurable down the road if we do the job right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016062300002#F00300"><p>I congratulate Deputy Shortall on her appointment and I look forward to working with her.  I am qualified in the pharmacy area and I have worked in it for the past number of years, so I have a specific interest in primary care.  I would probably like to see the committee break up what we should deal with and try to categorise primary care, accident and emergency departments, elective surgery, step-down facilities, community care, etc.  Perhaps we should try to categorise each section that we would like to examine in detail so as to see how we can build our strategy around them.</p> <p>  As other speakers have noted, there are numerous reports out there.  I have printed what we have been sent by e-mail and I have run out of paper several times.  There is a primary care report by Indecon that is quite thick.</p><p>I think all the reports would have common suggestions on how to tackle the issues in primary care.  It would be well worthwhile for the committee to resource people to analyse and come up with the common themes of all these reports.  If a team of experts has gone to the trouble of producing a very detailed report with the same suggestions, having taken cognisance of it as a group, we should bring forward the proposals for action, instead of a further report.  That is what we should consider.</p><p> One hears very good reports of what works in certain hospitals.  For example, for many years, one has been hearing very good reports of the accident and emergency unit in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.  If that is the case, why can we not replicate that model in other hospitals?  We should look at the elements of the health system that are working and at ways of replicating what works in other areas.  That is the model we should look at.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il I spoke about the lack of an acute stroke unit in University Hospital Kerry during the Topical Issues debate.  I had read a comparative report on the service in Kilkenny, Waterford and Kerry.  The results were startling.  It was frighting to compare the results from an acute stroke unit that is working properly with one that does not.  The very simple solution is to get an acute stroke unit working in all hospitals which deal with strokes.  That does not happen at present.  Sometimes we over-complicate the issues instead of following a strategy of simplifying things and replicating models that work.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Clare Daly that for me and many others developing a strategy is new idea, whether it is in the area of health, education or whatever.  It would be helpful if we could get advice on formulating strategy, so that we go down the right road from the start instead of finding out that we have spent months on work that did not bring us forward.</p></speech>

I know she will be excellent in the Chair because when I served in government with her, she was very passionate about this topic.  It will be a difficult task but I am looking forward to working on this committee.  There is a number of points that we need to get out in the open.  In our discussions, when the word "we" is used, it should not be a reference to our political parties but to a collective unit greater than politics.  We will achieve more.  Ultimately, this could be the most important committee of the Oireachtas for many years.  There has been no consistency in the thinking on health care for generations.  If we are to formulate a plan, and I like the terms of reference, on what we are trying to achieve, we must adopt a completely different approach, one which is open.  I am very much taken by what Deputy Daly said.  We should start with the basics, what we are trying to achieve, how we should go about achieving it in practice and what is strategy.  That is a very important point.</p> <p>  People know that I am a practical person.  I think our meetings should take place as much as possible on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  Life in the Oireachtas is busy for everyone but I hope we can meet even if it means early morning meetings.</p> <p>  The next issue is the politics of health.  As politicians, we are politically tuned in but the most political issue in Ireland is health care.</p><p>We need to be alert to the politics of health care and be able to recognise lobbying from witnesses and others.  I think the Chair will have to be clinical in her dealings.  Obviously, we will be lobbied to death.  Perhaps Deputy Harty will have a function to distinguish between what is important on a day-to-day basis.  I and others on this committee are on his committee also.</p><p> Our role is to put forward a pathway for the future of health care.  We also must look at the domain in which we are working.  There is no point in meeting for six months with the idea of developing a utopian vision, which is not realistic.  We have to create a vision of what can be realised within the realistic constraints in Ireland.  We can be expansive and ambitious, cutting through all that has happened in the past in setting out a plan that is robust, but there is no point producing a report that is not practical and implementable.  That is critical.  If we go the distance in doing that, we will have achieved a great deal.</p><p> While six months might seem a long period of time, it is actually short.  I understand we will have a separate discussion on resources but the level of resources required will be incredible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1281" speakername="Mick Barry" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016062300002#H00300"><p>It is useful at the start of the work programme of any committee to start with the terms of reference.  When we are talking strategy, the terms of reference are particularly important.  Our terms of reference include a reorientation from a hospital-based health service to a primary and community care service.  Our terms of reference include moving towards a one-tier universal health care system based on need and not on ability to pay.  I think we must follow through on the terms of reference in a forensic and laser-like way.  Whatever system is the one most likely to deliver on those goals, which have never been delivered in the history of the State, universal health care, a one-tier system based on need and not on ability to pay is what we must do.</p> <p>  Let us remind ourselves of the terms of reference at the very outset.  If we do that, there will be no fear of members being at cross-purposes with the health committee.  We have very different terms of reference.  We are looking at models for the best model of health care in order to deliver on our terms of reference.  We need to have a broad vision and, as other speakers have said, an evidence-based approach to our task.  The US model is primarily health care for profit.  The mainstream European model is primarily based on versions of social insurance.  The UK model is a national health service style health provision.  The question for this committee is what is the best model for this country.  The curse of the Irish health service through the 20th century into the 21st century has been a short-sighted pragmatism, which at the end of the day is not pragmatic.</p><p>Working from week to week or month to month without an overall view and strategy is a type of short-sighted pragmatism, which at the end of the day is not pragmatic.  The result of this is a health service which is a hybrid.  It is actually neither fish nor fowl.  We started in the early 20th century with elements of a welfare state, with the reforms implemented by the liberal Government.  With the foundation of the State came the role of the voluntary sector and the church in terms of health services, followed in the last decades by a move in the direction of US models.  Thus, we have ended up with a bit of everything, which does not deliver particularly well.  We need to stand back from the immediate and develop a strategy around the best model for Ireland.  </p><p> I am not sure about the idea of breaking up into working groups, at least not initially.  I think what we need first is an overview of the situation, following which we can get into the detail, rather than the other way around.  There are a few other points I could make but I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>

We probably all need a bit of luck in terms of our endeavours in this area.</p> <p>  By way of background, I am a community pharmacist.  I studied in the UK and my background is in the NHS where I specialised in primary care at undergraduate level.  When I qualified, which is approximately 12 years ago, the NHS was in the process of restructuring.  When looking to evidence-based solutions we could probably look to the NHS.  While it is not a perfect model there are elements of it which we could, possibly, aspire to.  </p> <p>  I come from an extended family of public and private medical practitioners.  It is difficult when looking at the structural model of the HSE to get what is going on.  I have tried in the past to overlap it with the hospital trust structure but I cannot do it.  It would be useful to all of us if we could look first at what we have, where it is at and where possibly we might go with it.  We cannot have all of these structures working in tandem or going off in different directions.  It is important for us as a committee to see in diagram form what we have.  I welcome Deputy Jim Daly's comments in regard to strategy in general.  While I am not sure if any of us come from that type of background we could all benefit from that.  There has been a lack of long-term vision in the health service.  I agree that ten years is not that long, but it is a starting point.  What has been done by successive Governments is something we need to move on from.      </p> <p>  Data from the current structures of the HSE and the hospital trusts, should be mapped with the latest population data, showing disease burden, socioeconomic conditions and so on to enable us to determine why the sickest people in this country for some reason have the least access to health care.  In focusing on that information we would not be focusing on any particular profession.  I am always surprised when I hear the much used new phrase "the focus should be on the patient".  Surely, the patient should always be the focus of any health system.</p> <p>  We are unique in this country in that because of our geographical land mass and population we could probably implement a system that no other country in the world could implement.  I believe this committee has the opportunity to come up with a system that will work for the people of Ireland not only for the next ten years but into the future.  My focus was preventive medicine in the primary care setting and that feeding into reducing the burden on the acute hospital structure.  From the outset, we need to hear about strategy and what we have so that we are educated to some extent in regard to what we have as a country and what we can do with it.  We are spending more per head of population on health services in this country than any other country and we need to question why that is the case.  We also need to question why our outcomes are not necessarily ideal.</p> <p>  I look forward to working with all members.  I hope we all have the common goal of progressing this issue.  Let us get at it.</p></speech>

Apart from the housing and homelessness issue, the health problem is the most critical in political terms.</p> <p>  As stated by Deputy Kate O'Connell, the patient must always come first.  In planning a health service, our focus should be on the development of systems that suit the patient rather than, as has been the case down through the years, the patient being accommodated by the system, which results in patients falling through the cracks.  It is important the patient remains in our focus as we plan our strategy.</p> <p>  Many people are of the view that primary care is the answer to many of the problems in our health services.  Our hospital system is so expensive, it is critical that primary and community care is developed.  We have an ageing population and a huge burden of chronic illness.  The most appropriate place for the treatment of chronic illness is the primary and community care setting.  We need to integrate primary and secondary care.  In this regard, the Kilkenny model, which is a pilot system involving the seamless integration of primary and secondary care, which delivers cost effective medicine as close as possible to the patient's home thereby preventing unnecessary admission to hospital, has been very successful.  We also need to integrate our public and private systems.  There is huge capacity in our private system that the public system, which is bursting at the seams, could tap into.  The integration of public and private medicine could start the process of a one-tier system.</p> <p>  We should have common purpose.  This is not about politics.  It would make no sense to seek political advantage on health issues.  We are all here for the same purpose.  This issue should be above politics and the committee should aim to keep it so.  The task with which we are faced is not an impossible one.  Many of our other systems work well.  To achieve change, we will need to challenge particular work practices and management structures.  Front-line staff are often excluded from decision making.  We should seek to ensure front-line staff are involved in all policy decisions because they are the people who are delivering the service.</p> <p>  We need to start moving in the right direction.  In this regard, a strategic framework will be important.  I agree that the focus of the committee from the outset should be on how to go about strategically changing the system and how to manage that change properly.</p></speech>

I know she will do an excellent job.  I look forward to working with her and the committee.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Harty and other members that keeping politics out of this issue will be key to the success of this committee.  We all want to see the ten-year plan implemented.  We are also aware of how politics has curbed progress within the health service.  It is important that our ten-year vision is workable and affordable, bearing in mind that resources are limited.  We must also be cognisant of this Government's term in office and set out clear targets in terms of what is achievable within the next year or two.  This is an all-party committee and its vision for our health service over the next ten years and beyond should be implemented regardless of who is in government in the future.</p> <p>  I look forward to participating in the work of this committee.  We are faced with a huge challenge.</p><p>I concur with Deputy Daly in regard to the strategic plan, which will be a key part of the success of the committee.

I do not think we have personally met yet but her passion in this area over the years has always come across clearly.  I know that she will keep this committee focused.  We could end up going down all sorts of rabbit holes, so staying focused will be key.  It is a serious and significant undertaking but I have a lot of hope for the committee.  However, with hope comes expectation.  We need to end up with an evidence-based strategy which clearly sets out where we want to end up and how we will get there, including pathways and goal setting.  Ultimately, the report will need to be tight.  We do not want to end up with a report that states what we feel it should state but which would allow those who are to implement it all sorts of get-out clauses due to broad and perhaps passionate wording but wording which is lacking in specifics.</p><p>That, of course, will require us to make decisions and those decisions will upset people.  I have no doubt a lot of lobbying will be attempted.  We will need to close our ears to it and try to look at what we are doing here with an open mind.  Everyone here is here for the right reasons.  Everyone wants to see an effective health care system.  Access to health care and equality in access to health care is a human right.  We need to get that point.  We have a very <i>ad hoc</i>health care system in this country and there seems to be little rhyme or reason to it.  There is a lot of geography lottery and what one can get in one county cannot be got in another.  There are also situations in which those in villages on the edge of a county border must travel perhaps 20 miles to their county town when the facility closest to them is only a mile away in the next county.  We have that type of carry-on.</p><p>If we are modulating this in terms of the different areas and when we are bringing people in, we should consider that the area of mental health is extremely important and can sometimes be forgotten.  As spokesperson for mental health, I will try to keep the focus on that area but all the different aspects of our health care will need to be linked in together.  I have confidence in the committee and the Chairman's stewardship of it and am looking forward to the next six months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-23a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016062300002#L00300"><p>I thank everyone for their contributions.  There is a general theme running through all of them and there is a lot of enthusiasm and ambition for the health service in the room.  Perhaps our fault as politicians over the years has been that we have been fatalistic about the health service and that there was a sense that it was a hopeless case.  However, I very much get a sense that people here want to work very hard to achieve a better health system.  We know that most other countries, certainly most other European countries, have good, functioning health services where it is unheard of that a person would have to wait 15 months or two years for an appointment with a specialist.  Services are accessible when they are needed, irrespective of means.  I think that is the aim for all of us.</p> <p>  There is a strong level of ambition and an open-mindedness in the committee to look at the evidence, leave the politics aside and do what a number of members spoke about, which is putting the focus on the patient.  Often within the health service, the patient is forgotten because there are so many other interests.  At a ministerial level, in particular, this is something one would be conscious of.  There are some powerful lobbying groups within the health service and sometimes it is hard to get through the fog of all of that and keep the focus on the patient.  That is probably the single most important message coming from the contributions this morning, which is the need to keep the focus on the patient and to do what is in best interests of the patient.  </p> <p>  The ten-year plan has been mentioned and a few people outside the committee have been commenting on it.</p><p>We have to make it clear that we are not talking about doing work for something that can be achieved in ten years' time.  It is about agreeing the kind of health system that we need in this country, the funding model for it and how we start to transition later this year and early next year over a ten-year period, which is a reasonable perspective in terms of system change, but we have to be clear about the phasing of it.  </p><p> The problem we have had to date is that every time there is a new Government or a new Minister there is a new plan.  With each change of plan, there is huge disruption caused to the health service and a huge lack of certainty about what the future holds.  We have to bring that to an end.  We can learn a lot from what happened in the UK after the war where the two big parties in the UK, coming from very different places, agreed on the NHS model.  Irrespective of which party was in government, everyone supported that model.  Notwithstanding some of the problems that have arisen over the years, by and large there is huge buy-in to that approach and the British people are very proud of their health service.  We need to get to that point, which is an agreement on the system and the model and, irrespective of what parties are in government, we can support, fund and stick to the model for the future.  </p><p> The order to take is probably to agree the type of system, then the funding model and then the model of care.  There are lots of examples of models of care including the switch to primary care in terms of pharmacists, GPs, allied health professionals and so on providing services locally in the community thereby saving the patients the need to go to acute hospitals and taking the burden off acute services.  There are lots of models and all of them have to be considered in the context of the overall system and the funding system, which determines in practical terms the types of models we have.  </p><p> There have been many good suggestions.  On Deputy Daly's point about getting advice on strategy, we probably need to get advice on the project management aspect.  We will examine the matter and perhaps we will have a chance to speak about it later.  The other suggestion was that we would get an initial presentation on the current system, the different types of health systems, particularly those which are common in Europe, and the different issues in respect of funding models.  In that regard, I suggest we bring in representatives from the ESRI to give us that overview at our next meeting.  A lot of academic work has been carried out by the ESRI over recent years.  Specifically, last year it did the costings for Government on the proposals for universal health insurance, which was subsequently dropped.  It has looked at different types of health systems and the funding models involved.  I suggest that we get those representatives in at an early stage to give us that kind of overview and context. </p><p> We also need to consider the best time and how frequently we should meet.  How do members feel about us having weekly meetings until the end of July?  Is that possible?  Can we do that?  Yes.  </p></speech>

I want to be clear on the committee and its approach.  I mentioned meeting with other groups, for example in my constituency, which have already approached me about meeting up.  First, is there anything to prohibit me doing that?  Second, if I do, is it worthwhile bringing that feedback to the committee?  What is your guidance on that?</p></speech>

We should hold off on that.  It is a good suggestion, but we will start with the overarching presentation and briefing, then look at how we might proceed.  A huge number of groups are certainly very keen to come before the committee.  We have to be very careful about that.  For individual members to meet with groups and bring feedback to the committee entails those groups having access through members.  Maybe after the initial presentation we will have some discussion on that and see whether we can put some shape on how we will proceed.  In the meantime, I will ask the secretariat to identify some of the representative groups.  There are umpteen patient groups, for example; we cannot have them all in, but there are a small number of umbrella groups that represent several different patient groups.  We might just look at suggested groupings that we would invite before the committee.  I will come back to members at the next meeting on that, if that is all right.</p></speech>

It is access by another name.  The Chairman pointed out a very practical way to approach it by talking to the overarching representative groups.  This is a personal opinion, but I do not think it is productive for us to have mini-representatives, in ourselves, coming in to represent other groups.  I am acutely aware, from my constituency as well as outside it, that we will all be lobbied, but it does not make practical sense for us to come in and speak on behalf of a group.  We will all be in that situation, but what makes practical sense to get over that is to facilitate short - God help us, we hope - written submissions to the group.</p></speech>

Obviously people will meet whoever they wish, but we have a very clear remit with regard to the bigger picture, being objective and sticking to our terms of reference on using the evidence base.</p></speech>

I have been lobbied substantially over the past few days.  I suggest that if groups approach us individually we should acknowledge receipt of their lobby but give it to the secretariat to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to meet them.</p><p>It is probably not appropriate for us as individuals to decide on who comes before the committee.  We could meet them as public representatives but not wearing the hat of a committee member.  We should make it clear that the way the system operates is that everything goes through the secretariat.  We can meet them but we cannot influence the committee in respect of their lobbying.</p></speech>

We need to separate our hats and draw a distinction between being public representatives and being on this committee.  We are not on the committee to represent them but to express views based on the data that will be before the committee.  We should not negate our role as politicians in our daily life, but we are not coming to committee meetings representing those whom we meet in any shape or form.</p> <p>  Since I was appointed spokesperson on health more than two weeks ago, I have been inundated with people who want to meet to talk about this committee.  Everybody will be faced with this issue.  May I make a practical suggestion?  I  would like collective agreement on a template for written submissions so that those who wish to communicate with the committee can use the template and send in written submissions directly.  We should encourage everybody to use the template in their communications with the committee so that their submissions can be put up online and everybody can read them.  We have to have practical strategies on how to get through the volume of work.  With a template we would know the structure and size of each document, and it would lead to consistency.  I strongly encourage the use of a template. </p></speech>

I know the clerk has expertise in that area.  I am asking him to bring proposals to the committee on how we might go about doing that.</p> <p>  Initially, if members receive a request for a meeting from a particular group, this should be referred to the secretariat.  We need to consider how we can do that in a structured way.</p></speech>

If we do not have an actual physical structure so that organisations document what they want in a structured manner, rather than firing in everything in their submission, we will be at naught.</p></speech>

I think the terms of reference are fairly explicit.  We will not be stepping outside the terms of reference, so the template can be moulded and guided by them.  I think that makes good practical sense.</p></speech>

In regard to the structure we have, perhaps we could have someone explain it within the first few sessions so that whoever claims to know what is going on is invited to show us what we have, why there are so many people employed, what they are doing and where they are based.  I think we need to know where we are at the minute.  Perhaps we could set up a session with the ESRI as soon as possible before we start off.</p></speech>

Everybody is free to use his or her judgment on whom to meet, and that is what we do as practising policy makers.  This is not an issue exclusive to this committee.  We are members of other committees and vested interests seek time with us.  It is a capacity issue that we will not be led and used by any particular vested interest.  I think we all have the capacity to rise above vested interests and not represent narrow views.</p><p>In the same vein, I do not know how relevant this is but some of the other members and I visited the College of Physicians yesterday.  I know they are doing a ten year health plan strategy which they hope to have completed by the end of this year.  I suggest the committee should tie in with them so as to avoid duplication.</p><p> I support Deputy Kelly's suggestion.
