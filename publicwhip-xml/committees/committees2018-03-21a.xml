On behalf of F&oacute;rsa trade union, I will read our statement on this issue and then I will hand over to Ms Clarke and Mr. King, who are two members of our union from Mayo and Kildare, to summarise this issue.</p> <p>  The amalgamation to create F&oacute;rsa trade union came into effect on 2 January 2018, bringing together the 80,000 members of the former Irish Municipal, Public and Civil Trade Union, IMPACT, Public Service Executive Union, PSEU and Civil and Public Services Union, CPSU, unions to form the largest public service union in the State.  We represent working people in the health service, the Civil Service, local authorities, the education sector, the community and voluntary sector, State and semi-State agencies, commercial services as well as private companies such as in aviation and telecommunications.</p> <p>  Although our union has been invited to present to the committee today on this issue, it is important to note that this campaign has been formally supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, as well as many individual unions, including the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT and the Financial Services Union.</p> <p>  In 2001, in recognition of the key role trade unions play in Ireland in delivering economic and social cohesion for wider society and fair play for workers, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, introduced a flat rate tax relief on trade union subscriptions of &pound;100 per year at the standard rate of tax.  The introduction of this tax relief was only starting to bring union members into line with the position of those paying fees to professional bodies, who had long enjoyed full tax relief on their subscriptions at the marginal rate of tax.  To more accurately reflect the cost in real terms of trade union membership, this relief was increased incrementally between 2001 and 2008, when it was &euro;350 at the standard rate of tax.  In effect, this was a tax credit of &euro;70 for all trade union members in the country.</p> <p>  In budget 2011, the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, announced that he intended to abolish the tax reliefs on trade union subscriptions, as well as those to professional bodies.  This was part of a review of all tax reliefs as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the economic crisis.  Indeed, because of the very fact of that crisis, the trade union movement did not campaign on this matter.  However, when the Finance Bill 2011 was published, it became very clear that while the tax relief on union subscriptions was to be abolished, the tax relief on subscriptions to professional bodies was not.  This followed a sustained lobbying campaign after the budget by professional bodies and business organisations such as Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, IBEC, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, ACCA, the Institute of Banking, the Institute of Directors in Ireland, the Marketing Institute of Ireland and the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, among many others.</p><p>Instead, the then Minister decided to abolish the benefit-in-kind, BIK, exemption that allowed employers to pay the annual membership fee of a professional body where membership of that body by a director or employee was relevant to the business of the employer.  This was a different decision than the original and was not the same as abolishing the tax relief on subscriptions to professional bodies generally.  This proposal only applied to directors and employees but not to the self-employed.<br/><br/>Following the lobbying campaign, the decision to abolish the BIK exemption on subscriptions to professional bodies led to Revenue issuing a clarification as to how it would interpret the Finance Act 2011, the net result of which I will now outline.<br/><br/>Tax relief on expenses paid by the self-employed, including membership of professional bodies, continues as before and is granted at the individual's marginal tax rate.  This also exempts income from the USC and PRSI.  Professional fees paid by employers on behalf of their employees to many professional bodies may continue to be paid tax free.  Businesses can receive full relief on subscriptions to bodies such as IBEC and ISME.  However, subscriptions paid by trade union members do not qualify for tax relief anymore.  Even when they did, the relief was only at the standard rate while PRSI and other levies applied to those payments.  This situation, which still applies today, is clearly discriminatory, given that the existence of a tax relief on trade union membership is as relevant to us as tax relief on membership is to professional bodies.  In addition, there is no justification for denying tax relief on trade union subscriptions when the self-employed and members of some professional bodies have this facility.<br/><br/>What is particularly galling is that this discrimination goes further than just membership of professional bodies.  The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, which is the largest representative body for Irish farmers, advises its members on the basis of professional advice it has received that farmers, as self-employed traders, can claim tax relief on their IFA subs as well as their subs to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>because those are beneficial to their trade.  This clearly does not meet the test provided by Revenue's clarifications, which justified the retention of tax relief for professional body members but not for members of trade unions by outlining that there should be a requirement for a practising certificate or licence, a statutory requirement or an indispensable condition of employment.  If tax relief for the self-employed, such as farmers, is granted to their respective membership organisations on the basis that it is beneficial to the trade, tax relief for the thousands of working people whose trade union membership brings about a clear and tangible benefit to their professions should surely receive equal and fair consideration for tax purposes.  For example, the training provided by our union to our more than 8,000 members working as special needs assistants, SNAs, is invaluable to their work.  Health and social care professionals represented by F&oacute;rsa have access to legal advice and representation through their union in the event of a fitness-to-practise case that would be financially inaccessible otherwise.  This is in addition to the practical training supports in areas as varied as job evaluation, interview skills and public speaking provided to our members as well as our core services of professional representation and collective bargaining and negotiation.<br/><br/>It is clear that farmers, the self-employed and employees of certain professions can get tax relief for their subs while trade union members cannot.  It is also worth pointing out that Ireland's position of not providing this relief to trade union members is out of step with the practice in many other countries.  In Germany, a trade union membership fee is classified as a professional body fee and can be declared as a professional expense in a person's tax return.  In Belgium and Holland, trade union members can get 50% of their union subs back in tax relief.  In Norway, tax relief of &euro;400 per annum is allowed for union subs and tax relief on union subscriptions applies in Australia and Canada.  Many countries that we generally look to compare ourselves to recognise the importance of union membership to their societies and seek to create a level playing pitch in terms of tax relief for membership subs.  Why does Ireland not do so, too?<br/><br/>The trade union movement had decided to hold off on pursuing this issue in recognition of the economic crisis that had hit the country.  In the run up to budget 2016, however, and given the much more favourable economic circumstances, congress worked to have this discrimination and anomaly addressed.  That budget contained a commitment to conduct a review of, and a public consultation on, the appropriate treatment of tax reliefs for membership fees of trade unions and professional bodies.  This process was supposed to take place in 2016.  Unfortunately, no public consultation ever took place.  What actually happened was that the Department of Finance, without any public input, undertook a review of tax reliefs.  Due to the Department's innate hostility to tax reliefs, that review unsurprisingly did not support the reinstatement of the tax relief on union subs.  The Department concurred with the 2009 report of the Commission on Taxation, which recommended that the relief be discontinued on the basis that, since membership of a trade union was likely to be influenced by the benefits of membership, the value of a tax credit was unlikely to be a factor.  We agree on that point.  The trade union movement never pursued this matter on the basis that it would have any material effect on the levels of trade union membership, but because the existence of a tax relief on membership subscriptions was as relevant to trade union members as it was to professional bodies.  We are seeking equity for our members.<br/><br/>Now that the economic crisis is over, the trade union movement is actively pursuing the restoration of the tax relief on union subscriptions and the ending of the obvious discrimination against union members compared with the position of self-employed people, members of certain professional organisations, farmers and businesses.  Ireland is out of step on this issue with many of our friends and neighbours, who recognise in practical terms the important role that unions play in our societies.  It is time for this discrimination to end and for tax relief on trade union membership to be restored.<br/><br/>We are seeking the committee's support on this issue in order to address the clear inequity and discrepancy created in 2011 in the taxation treatment of different groups in society.  Nurses, SNAs and care workers should not be treated unfavourably in this manner compared with solicitors and accountants.  The training, services and representation that are beneficial to the professional lives of many thousands of working people should not be held in less regard than similar benefits availed of by the self-employed through their membership organisations.<br/><br/>We are seeking the committee's support to put PAYE workers who are members of unions on an even keel with the self-employed and members of professional bodies as well as with their trade union compatriots in Australia, Canada and several European countries.  Unlike those representing professional bodies, great restraint was shown by the trade union movement in Ireland on this issue in the teeth of the worst economic crisis to hit the country in generations.  Reinstating this relief would be an important statement in recognition of the important role played by trade unions in Irish society and a small gesture to the members of trade unions who made significant sacrifices during the recent economic crash.<br/><br/>I will hand over to Mr. King and Ms Clarke, who would like to say a few words to conclude our opening statement.</p></speech>

I am a member of the in-house committee in Institute of Technology, Carlow, as a F&oacute;rsa rep, so I am speaking on behalf of our members there, who are predominantly women.</p> <p>  Since 2011, we have taken significant pay cuts and have seen our sick leave halved, holidays reduced and working week extended, all of which has a financial cost for members, many of whom are the sole wage earners in their households and also have caring responsibilities in respect of small children or elderly parents.  We are seeking parity of esteem.  It is inconceivable that one can claim tax relief if one is a farmer and subscribed to the IFA, a member of a professional body or even a business with an IBEC or ISME subscription when a member of a trade union, which is the negotiating body for our sector and is valuable to us as the means through which we do our business, receives no recognition in that regard.  I would put the case from that point of view and from the perspective of people on the ground who are not earning large salaries, are committed trade unionists and believe that their trade union is of significant benefit to them in their working lives, not just in terms of training, but also in terms of upskilling, which we are all being asked to do in these times.</p></speech>

I work in the Castlebar library in County Mayo and in any other library within the county to which I am sent on a daily basis.  I am also an activist with F&oacute;rsa.  On behalf of the members who are covering for me today, I thank our Deputies who are on this committee - Deputies Calleary and Lisa Chambers - for their professional and courteous reception and hearings on this matter to date.  The rest of the committee's members have been equally courteous and professional with those of our members who have approached them.  I thank them for that.</p> <p>  From my point of view and that of those whom I represent in this and other unions, our business today is precisely what all of us and every committee member seeks, namely, equity and fairness.  It is as simple as that.  I ask that the committee consider the initial reason for the 2001 introduction of tax relief on trade union subscriptions.  As the then Minister stated, it was done to recognise the key role that the trade unions played in delivering economic and social cohesion for the wider society and fair play for members.</p><p>We all know what happened after that eight years later and how ordinary people and workers, especially lower paid workers, suffered.  It is easy, looking back, to forget the critical role that Irish trade unions played during the economic disaster and the subsequent recovery.  There were many arguments within the trade union movement, but it decided ultimately to work with Government and not against it.  Public servants continued to deliver excellence, and new innovations were brought in that in many ways are far ahead of the public services in other countries.  That is certainly the case in the library service I work in.  </p><p> The then Minister for Finance was entirely correct.  The trade unions have a key role.  Another Minister for Finance abolished the relief in 2011.  We all know why that happened, and we had to accept that in the interests of the greater good at the time.  This hurt workers, on top of all the other cuts, but we understood and were patient, and we waited our turn.  We waited eight years, and we made submissions through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Our members are now energised about this, and it is gaining traction.  They are saying that it is a matter of fairness in society and for workers, and it is about recognising their contribution.  We now want the relief to be restored.  It is a matter of fairness.  We believe in fairness, and I am convinced that public representatives of every party actually believe in fairness too.</p></speech>

I want to clarify how the current system works.  We are clear on the position of union subscriptions, the tax relief for which ended in 2011.  The example of a self-employed persons, a farmer, was given.  A trade union subscription is a deductible expense for a farmer in his or her tax return.  It is not an income issue because they pay themselves a salary, but rather is a deductible expense and so it is at the marginal rate in terms of the tax deductibility.  For an employee working for a company, where the company pays for his or her subscription to an engineers' institute, a tax institute or an accountancy institute the employee is not subject to BIK on that.  Is that the case currently?</p></speech>

The traditional distinction between the tax treatment of self-employed versus PAYE workers was that it had to be wholly, exclusively and necessarily a requirement for a PAYE worker.  "Necessarily" was never a requirement for the self-employed.  In a business situation, however, it can be easily agreed that it is necessary.  If a company was pitching for business it would use the fact that somebody was a member of the professional body as part of its pitch for business, which then meets the "necessarily" camp, and it can be written off as an expense.</p></speech>

The following year, which is the final year for which records exist, it cost &euro;26 million.  That was on the basis that, even at its height, this relief was only claimed by approximately two thirds of trade union members across the country.  One third of trade union members did not actually claim the relief.  The estimate the Deputy is referring to comes from a Revenue estimate based on a 100% uptake of this relief by trade union members.  We do not dispute those figures.  The likelihood is that, given the fact that since the relief was ended in 2011 a number of trade union members on lower incomes have come in and people on higher incomes have retired, we believe it would cost slightly less.  However, it will cost approximately that figure to reintroduce it.</p></speech>

There are many competing demands, not least from trade union members.  They are quite legitimate.  We have a current pay agreement, for example, but there will be future pay agreements as well.  Many public services remain under huge pressure and certainly have not been restored following the economic crisis.  Where does this issue rank in terms of the level of priorities that the witnesses believe are appropriate and that their members would be advocating for?  The figure of &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million is still a lot of money, and it is being competed for by many other parts of the public service and across the area of public expenditure.  It is a valuable resource.</p></speech>

We would not be here if we did not have the financial crisis because it would have continued.</p><p>That is the practical reality of the matter.  We did not press the issue at all in the dark days on the grounds of the trade union's social responsibility, unlike others who went in the back door and in effect saved the relief for themselves.  We just chose to resurrect the issue when there were options as far as State expenditure was concerned.  Is this more important than houses or health?  No, it is not, but it is an irritation because people feel a sense of grievance about the fact that we took it on the chin and no one else in society did so in a similar set of circumstances.  Now that we are back to there being budget equilibrium, perhaps budget surpluses, we believe the &euro;26 million practical cost of this, in the overall scheme of things, is probably worth more psychologically to trade union members than the overall &euro;50 billion, &euro;60 billion or &euro;70 billion State budgets.  We see it as an issue of fairness.  It will not break the bank, and we have been patient about it because we did not believe it was an appropriate matter to be here talking to the committee about in the hard times.  However, we are in a different situation now, and this is due in part to the sacrifices made and the retrenchments and difficult decisions taken by tens of thousands of members of our union and many others in those difficult times.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath asked a number of them for me so I will not repeat those.  I wish to begin by welcoming the witnesses, as my colleagues have done, and thanking them for their pretty passionate and very well-articulated presentations.  I acknowledge the more than significant role of trades unions in the history of the State in securing groundbreaking rights for men and women, workers generally, over the past 70 or 80 years, some of which have been eroded slightly in the past two decades.  I am hugely sympathetic towards the witnesses from that perspective and hugely sympathetic to the rights of unions to exist, thrive, encourage membership and provide the best services backup to those members.  I myself was a member of a public service teaching union for a number of years.  However, I am here as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and our job is to scrutinise the proposals the witnesses are making and to interrogate them with a small "i".</p> <p>  My first question concerns the Department's report and its review into the abolition and the analysis of the application of the relief.  A professional membership fee has a very clear benefit.  I was a self-employed professional and - this point is made in the Department's review - I could not practice without paying such a membership fee.  I could not practice without accruing the continuous professional development requirements that allowed me to gain accreditation, for which the fee had to be paid.  No one in any of the trades unions the witnesses represent cannot practice their profession without being a member of the trades union.  That is the difference, and I would like the witnesses' response to that.</p> <p>  The second point in the Department's review concerns the regulatory function of accreditation bodies.  I take Mr. O'Connor's point that IBEC is not a regulatory body but a professional body.  However, in respect of accountants, professional solicitors and the range of self-employed people who pay fees, there is a regulatory function in professional bodies, but there is no regulatory function in a trades union.  I ask the witnesses to respond to this point.</p> <p>  The review also points out the principal advantage that accrues to a member of a trades union, namely, representation.  Regarding the additional ongoing training services that are provided, one could argue that is not the function of a trade union.  The function of a trade union is basically to represent its members.  Again, I ask the witnesses to respond to this point.</p> <p>  I have two final questions.  I will use primary school teachers and members of the INTO as an example.  The witnesses are seeking that a member of the INTO gets tax relief on his or her annual membership fee.  A primary school teacher or post-primary school teacher must become a member of the Teaching Council once he or she becomes qualified.  That is a professional body, and teachers are actually obliged to become members of the Teaching Council.  Is tax relief available on those fees?  If not, can the witnesses see the other doors they are potentially opening up?</p> <p>  Finally, Mr. Cody mentioned retired members.  Again, I ask this as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  I am just seeking information.  What justification would there be for tax relief for retired members of trades unions on their membership fees?  Are the membership fees of retired members reduced?</p> <p>  There are four or five questions on which the witnesses could perhaps provide clarity.</p></speech>

First, bodies such as the Teaching Council, CORU and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland are not professional bodies; they are regulatory bodies.  In other words, they are not the people who will represent a worker if, say, he or she gets into professional difficulties.  They are the people who will-----</p></speech>

Revenue recognises that if one is a member of a profession governed by any of those regulatory bodies and one must pay a professional fee, that fee is claimable against tax.  However, for teachers the payment is &euro;80-odd per year; CORU's fees are &euro;100 per year; in the case of the Nursing Council, the fee is &euro;100 per year.  Even if one is given tax relief at the standard rate, it will amount to &euro;20 so it will not be a king's ransom, but that is claimable.</p> <p>  The main purpose of a trade union is representation, but that is not all we do.  Mr. O'Connor mentioned the fact that we represent thousands of special needs assistants.  The State provides very little in-house training for special needs assistants.  The body that does the CPD in that area is actually the trade union.  We hold out-of-hours weekend workshops for our members in all the dimensions of delivering a professional service.  This is very much akin to what a self-employed person would be able to benefit from-----</p></speech>

We receive no State funding or anything like that.  We see it as part of what we do.</p> <p>  Deputy Lahart mentioned the INTO.  The INTO also doubles up as a professional body, if I can call it that.  One of its biggest conferences is its education conference, at which it discusses education issues, syllabuses and so on, as opposed to what might be called its trade union conference.  This is very common within the teaching profession.  Similarly, the Deputy may know that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has purchased the old Richmond Hospital as a training centre for the continuous professional development of its members.  Many trade unions provide such a dimension to their work, but we see that the State does not fund this.  We are not seeking funding from the State.  This would simply be a recognition of what we do.  If we go back to the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy's comments when he introduced the tax relief following discussions behind the scenes with the trade unions, it was in recognition of their role in delivering economic and social cohesion for the wider society.  I would add to that the add-on benefits we provide for our members and the services they deliver.</p> <p>  Deputy Lahart mentioned, I suppose, a closed shop, whereby technically speaking one could claim tax relief on union subscriptions.  They are very few and far between in the Irish trade union movement.  They may be more a symptom in other countries.</p></speech>

I absolutely accept the situations he has described.  The trade union movement, in terms of the services and the training we provide, has not achieved the same social standing as some of the professional bodies in terms of the services and training they provide, whereby it is actually a requirement to do the job.  However, this does not mean it is not of equal value, and anyone who asks a special needs assistant or a health and social care professional who relies entirely on his or her trade union for those services will have this confirmed to them.</p><p>That is the professional bodies' scenario.  We have also outlined the situation where there is no case to be made for the self-employed, for example farmers, claiming tax relief on membership fees for their organisation, having any greater entitlement to that in the training, services and representation provided by those bodies versus trade unions.  I agree that our core role is a representative function with professional representation at workplace level and collective bargaining negotiations, but that is of very great significance and value within our society and it should be recognised as such.  It was said earlier that the reason we are having this conversation is because the intention was to take this away in an equitable way from all of these bodies as a response to the economic crisis.  A lobbying campaign, however, was conducted that meant certain bodies were exempted.  F&oacute;rsa had restrained in that regard and all we ask for now is to resort back to what would have remained the case if it was not for the economic crash that befell the State in 2011.</p><p> In my opening statement I spoke of the Revenue report.  This report, essentially, couches its opposition to this on the basis that it would not incentivise trade union membership on the basis that people do not join trade unions for the tax relief, they join for the benefits of trade unions and even if it did incentivise, why would the State do that?  We fully accept that point.  This is not about incentivising trade union membership.  It is about trade union members receiving the same tax treatment in their membership of F&oacute;rsa, which is of great value and as other professional bodies and self-employed people get.</p></speech>

We are wearing our budgetary oversight hats and I am broadly sympathetic to the compelling argument put forward by the witnesses, but is there any evidence that trade union membership has fallen off because of fees and that tax relief would assist and encourage members?</p></speech>

We are all aware of circumstances where people were literally put to the pin of their collars.  At a meeting during this period a person told me that it came down to filling the tank with oil or paying the union subscription.  That was the personal life choice this person had to deal with.  There was an element of that in the difficult days.  Union membership is growing again in the context of income recovery and so on.  As Mr. O'Connor has said, this is not really a matter of the State subsiding trade union membership.  It is simply a matter of holding us in parity of esteem with other representative bodies that are not shy about coming in here looking for various things on behalf of their members.</p></speech>

Deputy Lahart's question on training deserves more of an answer.  Ms Clarke and I are acutely aware, as lay activists in the places we work, that in both our employments and across almost all the public service employments, budgets for training disappeared almost overnight.  Since the crash, and until relatively recently when there has been a small bit of clawback, almost all of the training we have had to do with our jobs, personal development and everything else, has been through the various trade unions.  As Mr. Cody has said, much of this training happened on evenings and Saturdays.  It was critical for continuous personal development.  The actual value of tax relief on union subscriptions should not be discounted.  It could be hugely important to people, even towards putting diesel, petrol or a battery in to their car to bring them to this training.</p></speech>

I also thank the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council F&oacute;rsa branch which also contacted me about the issue as part of the campaign.  The witnesses do not have to convince me any further; I have already been convinced, as has Solidarity - People Before Profit.  It is a cut and dried case of fairness and equity that the tax relief for union subscriptions should be restored.</p><p>The witnesses may not have the answers to some of my questions.  Why do they think this iniquitous situation has persisted? I find it bizarre that a subscription to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>or a membership of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, qualifies for the tax relief but this does not.  I do not see the difference between the representative function of the IFA <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>its members, and the representative function of trade unions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>their members.  I do not get how it can be justified to give the tax relief to one and not the other.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>situation is stranger.  Is the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, included along with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC?  By any stretch I do not believe one could say IBEC or ISME are anything other than representative organisations for certain businesses that campaign and advocate on behalf of their members' interests.  They are not, however, a trade expense.  It they are then so too is being a member of a union.</p><p>I do not understand how the Government could have refused the unions' request before the budget.  Perhaps the witnesses will elaborate on how the Government can justify this iniquitous situation.  It seems to be completely baffling.  The representatives said that those organisations lobbied whereas in the teeth of the recession the unions did not.  Is there anything more the union representatives can say about the nature of the lobbying by those organisations and why they were listened to?</p><p>Maybe it is due to my own political biases, but on the face of it it appears there is one law for workers and a different law for businesses and people who are trading.  This is what seems to be running behind it and it is deeply unfair given the sacrifices workers were forced to endure in the period of austerity.  Do the witnesses see it being as simple as being just a political or ideological bias?  Was any credible argument put forward to them to explain how this iniquity has been maintained?</p><p>Have the unions had any recent engagement with the Government since it refused to reapply the relief in the last budget?  Have there been subsequent discussions with the Government around what its stance might be coming in to the next budget?</p><p>Primarily this issue is an irritant.  It is not a huge financial issue.  It is an irritant because it is so unfair and inequitable.  Ms Clarke spoke of how hammered the union members got on other fronts.  It may stray from the subject but as rank and file F&oacute;rsa members what other measures would the witnesses like to see, beyond this, to try to restore the fortunes of workers who got hammered?</p><p>My last point may add to the armoury of the union's argument.</p><p>Profits have gone through the roof in the last six or seven years such that pre-tax profits were approximately &euro;149 billion based on the last figures available.  I think there is approximately &euro;80 billion in tax reliefs and deductible expenses, overwhelmingly going to business.  Even at that level it seems like a tiny request that workers might get something that might cost about &euro;20 million, given the huge number of very questionable tax reliefs and deductions that are allowed for big business.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on other tax reliefs and who benefits from them as against the very small one that the Government is refusing to give back to trade union members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shay Cody" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018032100002#J00300"><p>Bearing in mind what the Chair has said, I will try to restrict myself to the issue at hand.  When the abolition was announced in 2011 all the professional bodies got together.  They did not lobby separately; they created a coalition.  That very powerful and influential coalition absolutely upended what was at least an equitable announcement in the budget by the then Minister, Mr. Lenihan, that he would abolish the tax relief for everybody.  We were in very dark days and the trade union movement decided to live with it.  We did not press it until now.  We have been speaking to various Deputies throughout the country.  We wrote formally to the Minister for Finance, putting it on the agenda so that it is with him.  We have only an acknowledgement at this stage, but the Minister is aware of its importance for the trade union movement.</p> <p>  We believe this is a part of the process of trying to influence the system and hopefully in the lead-up to the next budget in October there will be support for it from across the political spectrum and that will feed into the system.  If it does not work in that timescale, we will keep knocking on the door.  As my colleagues have said, it is an irritant.  It is like the State recognising the difference between a trade union member in a workplace and somebody who opts not to be in the trade union in the same workplace but actually gets all the benefits of the work of the trade union movement.  While it is a modest sum for an individual, it is simply a recognition that good is done by the collective bargaining process both in good times and, maybe more significantly, in very bad times.</p></speech>

I have read the joint letter by the various professional bodies that Mr. Cody mentioned.  That obviously happened in the autumn to winter time between the budget and the Finance Bill.  It is clear that it was a very powerful argument from a very powerful lobby group to say that for a marginal saving to the State this is something that would greatly affect the businesses practices of all these professions and would impact on business.  That was probably a scary thing for the State at the time.  In the meantime our focus has very clearly been on protecting the jobs and incomes of the workers we represent.  This was well down our priority list but was obviously high enough on the priority list of professional bodies to make those representations.</p></speech>

Business obviously drives the economy in any country.  How do we feel about it being left for them and other agencies and organisations but not for us?  It comes back to our earlier statement.  We feel it is grossly unfair and we feel let down.  It is iniquitous and we crave to have something done about it.</p></speech>

Richy Carrothers is a fine trade union representative from west Donegal.  He has also briefed me on this.  It did not take long because I support the aims of the campaign.  I resisted, and campaigned and voted against it when it was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government at the time.  I made the point in 2011 that at a time when jobs were being lost and wages were being cut, trade union membership needed to be retained.</p> <p>  I have a slight disagreement with Mr. O'Connor.  I believe the State has a responsibility to support trade union membership.  I know he agrees with that.  The argument is about the basis of equity.  Trade unions are a movement for social good.  I refer to the 2009 the Commission on Taxation report.  This was the same commission that recommended the introduction of water charges.  We defeated that one and hopefully we can get rid of this one as well.  It did not actually suggest that there should not be an incentive for trade union membership.  The argument it made was that the incentive was not working and that it was kind of mandatory to be part of a trade union.  From a public policy point of view, support for trade union subscriptions should be justified and legislated for.  I wholeheartedly support the campaign.</p> <p>  There was mention of the support across the trade union sector and from ICTU.  Have the unions had indications of political support or has that not yet been formally offered?  I do not believe that my party has written formally to the trade unions.  Is this something that is building momentum?</p></speech>

While the Deputy and I might agree on that, I would hope in the same way that Mr. King stated, that all Deputies would agree that fair tax treatment for trade unions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other bodies is absolutely essential.<br/><br/>On his second point on political support, we have not formally requested political parties to include this in their pre-budget submissions and their draft manifestos for a general election whenever that might come about, but we will certainly do that.  In our individual representations to political parties, we have received support from Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il, Solidarity - People Before Profit, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party and many other individual Independent Deputies whom our campaign's representatives have met throughout the country.  We will continue that engagement in coming months.  As Mr. Cody has said, we feel this should be addressed in the upcoming budget and we call on members of the committee to bring it back to their own parties and to advocate that it be supported.</p></speech>

Outside the political party process, this committee has a role, irrespective of parties, whereby we can submit a report and hopefully come up with some recommendation in that regard.</p> <p>  I return to the cost issue.  The highest cost of this tax expenditure was &euro;26.7 million in 2009.  It dropped to &euro;26 million in the year before it was abolished.  At that time a third of trade union members were not availing of this tax relief.  This tax relief was valued at &euro;70 per person; there was a cap at &euro;350 at the standard rate of tax.  Why did people not avail of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shay Cody" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018032100002#J01300"><p>There are a couple of reasons.  First, certain casual low-paid workers are not in the tax net at all.</p><p>There is no point claiming something from which one will not benefit.</p><p> Second, it is somewhat similar to tax relief on medical expenses.  There can be a lot of work involved in making a tax relief claim and if the amount of money involved is relatively modest, people sometimes do not get around to it.  The Revenue estimates that only 50% to 60% of people claim their medical expenses.  People are less likely to do so if the sums involved are not very high.  There will always be some dead weight regarding tax expenditure and in this case that is the difference between the actual cost of &euro;26 million and the estimated cost of &euro;39 million.  I am unsure it would ever cost &euro;39 million because some union members do not pay tax, either because they were not in employment for the full year or have very low earnings which are, therefore, non-taxable.</p></speech>

The cost of &euro;26 million was based on a trade union membership of 511,000 rather than the current membership of 437,000.  In that context, a cost of &euro;26 million is probably on the high end given that it was based on a larger membership.</p></speech>

We are not in a position to argue whether the cost would be &euro;26 million or &euro;23 million.</p></speech>

The amount of relief that could be claimed was increased in 2008.  We acknowledge that the quantum of trade union members in the country is more significant than the number of people who claim relief for membership of professional bodies.  We are calling for the reintroduction of the relief that was removed seven years ago.  Obviously, that can fluctuate in value, as it did in the period between 2001 and 20008, but we wish for it to be restored at that level.</p></speech>

We should not have tax relief for subscriptions for other professional bodies but none for trade union membership.  I made the point at the time that the relief is an encouraging and deciding factor.  People understand the benefit of being a member of a trade union but also its cost.  The relief is a deciding factor for a person who is weighing up if he or she will have enough money after taking out membership.</p></speech>

The Ministers agreed to include in the budget a statement that they were going to review the abolition of the relief and have a public consultation in that regard.  They indicated they had open minds on the matter.  There was then an election and so on.  There has since been a retreat from having an open mind to the fairly doctrinaire and dogmatic approach of the relief being dead weight.  We could go point out many other tax breaks about which that argument could also be made but they do not seem to be in danger of being abolished.</p></speech>

I looked at the proposal in detail and discussed it with Mr. O'Connor at some length.  I will be advocating within Fianna F&aacute;il that we support it in the upcoming budget negotiations.  I am conscious that the relief was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and abolished by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance during a crisis.  It is time for it to be reintroduced.  The equity argument stands for itself but, in addition, the State must do what it can do support trade unionism and ensure we have strong trade unions in the country.  There has been a very serious widening of the wealth gap in Ireland.  The two biggest asset groups which we can track are home ownership - we are at the lowest level since 1970 in that regard - and pensions, which are in an absolute mess at the moment.</p><p>My portfolio is Brexit.  I firmly believe that Brexit is part of a consistent pattern across much of the western world, as evidenced in public support for Marine Le Pen and Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland, AfD, and all sorts of unpleasantness.  That has largely arisen because the <i>status quo</i>is not working for many of the people who are or should be in trade unions.  We need to do reintroduce the relief and work with the unions to ensure the trade union movement in Ireland grows stronger and that employers are not allowed to tell their staff they may not join a trade union.  I have spoken to my colleagues on this issue.  We must be cognisant that we are in the middle of crises in homelessness, housing and hospital trolleys, as well as dealing with threats from Brexit.  Significant investment in social and transport infrastructure is needed across the country and &euro;26 million is not a small amount of money, so it will be assessed in the context of many urgent and competing demands.  I will advocate that the relief be reintroduced and that we can potentially go further in supporting the growth and strength of the trade union movement in this country.  It is very important.</p><p>In terms of the procedure of getting back the &euro;70, must a member fill in a form 11 or go through a full self-assessment to do so or is there an easy way to get it?  The only reason I ask is that one must assume that, at the margin, price matters and there will, therefore, be those for whom the &euro;70 will make the difference between joining or not joining a union or, indeed, it may take pressure off another part of their lives.  That becomes far more difficult if one must fill in an entire Revenue form 11 online.  How does one get the &euro;70 back?</p></speech>

Beyond that, trade unions and individuals sometimes submitted data banks.  However, the Revenue was able to get it up and running very quickly by using the employers' payroll information.  It would probably be easy to do the same if this was in place next year.</p></speech>

The gross allocation for 2018 which includes a capital carryover of &euro;6 million is &euro;587 million.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten; the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who will be joining us shortly, and their officials whom I thank for the briefing material provided which has been circulated to members of the committee.  I thank the Minister and his officials for the open and constructive dialogue with the committee secretariat in developing the briefing document for the meeting.</p> <p>  The committee has agreed to proceed programme by programme.  At the outset of the consideration of each programme I will ask the Minister or the Minister of State to give a high-level overview of it, including the pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance, and related expenditure in 2018.  Members will then be invited to put their questions about particular subheads.  I will refer to the briefing document prepared by the committee secretariat to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimate.  We will start with programme A, communications, which is dealt with on page 7 of the committee secretariat's briefing document.  The programme comprises 75% of the Vote's adjusted gross allocation.  I invite the Minister to make a short statement on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12018032100002#B00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to meet the committee to discuss the 2018 Revised Estimate for my Department.  I am joined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who has responsibility for natural resources and digital services development.  I am also joined by my officials, Mr. Brian Carroll, assistant secretary with responsibility for climate action and environment; Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, assistant secretary with responsibility for the communications division; Ms Rebecca Minch, principal officer, energy efficiency and affordability division; Mr. Denis Maher, principal officer, inland fisheries division; and Jim Whelan, assistant principal officer, finance unit.</p> <p>  The total provision for my Department in 2018 is &euro;587 million which comprises &euro;215 million for capital investment, inclusive of a capital carryover from last year of &euro;6 million, and &euro;372 million for current spending, of which &euro;222 million represents a pass-through of television licence receipts.  During 2018 my Department will progress projects in a number of areas of strategic national importance, encompassing climate action, energy efficiency, communications, broadcasting, the environment, waste management, natural resources and inland fisheries.  A number of the strategic investment priorities identified in the national development plan are directly relevant to my Department and its agencies.</p> <p>  I will highlight some key projects and policy objectives to be progressed this year.  Delivering a connected economy and society is a key priority for my Department.  Commercial investment continues to improve and expand the breadth of broadband and mobile telecoms services available in the State.  Complementing this commercial investment, the State is committed to investing through national broadband plan intervention in the delivery of a future-proofed network to support high quality affordable broadband services in those areas where a commercial investment has not been demonstrated.  Fast, secure, high capacity digital connectivity will underpin balanced regional development, allow new businesses and services to emerge and increase Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and attractiveness as a place in which to live and do business.  Under the national digital strategy, there will be continued support for digital adoption measures to enable small businesses and citizens to realise the full social and economic potential of the digital world.  Facilitating a secure and safer Internet environment for citizens, businesses and critical infrastructure providers is essential.  The National Cyber Security Centre which plays a key role in securing Government and critical national infrastructure and data will be strengthened.</p> <p>  Climate mitigation and adaptation are cross-cutting priorities for the Government.  My Department will continue to progress the climate action agenda, in line with the whole-of-government national mitigation plan.  This year the focus will be maintained on achieving targets in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency to combat climate change and contribute towards the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 targets.  The development of renewable energy sources across the electricity, heat and transport sectors will be critical in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy.  Increased investment in energy efficiency upgrades in the residential, commercial and public sectors is a central plank of Ireland's action on climate change and will deliver significant energy savings.  Decarbonising the built environment is the most effective way to tackle climate change.  Energy efficiency measures will also realise benefits for air quality, health, social inclusion and business competitiveness, all of which will make a real and positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  The roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat aims to support the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems with renewable energy technologies.  The continued incentivisation of the uptake of electric vehicles will further support the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>  The sustainable management of waste and improved resource efficiency are critical.</p><p>In the environmental area, the Environmental Protection Agency will continue to deliver on its research commitments and meet its expanded role regarding ambient air quality, noise and non-ionising radiation monitoring, as well as a significant climate action agenda.  Continued investment in INFOMAR and TELLUS geo-environmental mapping projects will provide reliable geoscience support, underpinning the sustainable development of Ireland's natural resources.  I am happy to discuss the Estimate with the members.</p><p> The focus of programme A is to support economic growth, jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion through a range of policies and regulation designed to facilitate a more digitally connected economy and society.  It provides for investment in next-generation broadband networks, promotion of the use of digital technologies by citizens and businesses and support for digital entrepreneurship.  The Estimate for programme A includes funding of &euro;15 million to finalise the tender process for the State-led intervention to bring high-speed connectivity to all parts of Ireland where there is no existing or planned commercial network.</p><p> The programme also supports digital adoption measures such as the trading online voucher scheme, the school digital champion programme and the digital skills for citizens training scheme.  A sum of &euro;3 million will be made available this year for the trading online voucher scheme to support a further 1,500 small businesses to trade online.  By the end of 2017, over 4,100 small businesses had successfully applied for trading online vouchers and over 10,600 businesses in total had benefited through participation in training sessions delivered by the local enterprise offices under the scheme since it began in 2014.  Under the digital skills for citizens scheme, community and voluntary organisations will receive funding of &euro;2.2 million to deliver ten hours of free digital skills training to 25,000 people who have never used the Internet.</p><p> Programme A also supports growth and innovation in digital entrepreneurship through the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre.  The 2018 Estimate includes &euro;1.8 million for Eircode postcodes and &euro;2 million in operational funding for the National Cyber Security Centre for the protection of critical infrastructure and Government networks.</p></speech>

There is provision for expenditure of &euro;19 million this year.  Could the Minister elaborate on the main outputs?  What is the State getting in return for this expenditure?  Before the Minister responds, I will bring in a couple of my colleagues.</p> <p>  For the information of members who have recently joined us, we are just dealing with programme A, which relates to communications.  When members are asking questions, they should name the relevant subhead.  I refer them to page 7 of the briefing document provided by the secretariat.</p></speech>

That is not new money.  That was in the original Estimate.  Is that not correct?  As a result, there is no change.  The only change is that there is almost &euro;1.5 million less to be spent than was originally estimated, if I am reading the Minister's communication correctly.  The 2017 Estimate was &euro;20.49 million and the figure for 2018 is &euro;19.04 million.  Therefore, less money is being spent than was projected.  Reading the communication, one would believe there is an extra &euro;15 million.  This speaks to the point about how serious the Department is in terms of rolling out high-speed broadband.  I agree with everything the Minister said in his introduction but we are still no further on.  I recall the same process last year.  Perhaps the figure was &euro;5 million at the time.  We are still progressing through.  I do not want to rehash the debates that the Minister, others and I have had the time out of number but there is nothing in this Estimate that would lead me to believe there is a greater level of activity.  Perhaps the Minister could bring us up to speed on the current position and reaching a conclusion with the one remaining bidder.</p> <p>  Since the decision was taken by Eir, I am sure the Minister, like me, has met plenty of people who cannot understand why it is taking so long to get high-speed broadband.  They are deeply concerned about the potential delays and want to see the matter brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  In that context, could the Minister outline the current position?</p> <p>  There are some savings on staffing.  There is also a projected reduction of &euro;654,000 regarding multimedia developments.  How did that come about?  There are some savings on administration.</p></speech>

Overall expenditure on communications has decreased.  The trading online fund has decreased.  Is there a reason for that?  What supports are in place for small businesses?</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the online trading voucher scheme output has increased.  The targeted output for this year is 1,500.  That is welcome but the amount of money is relatively small.  As we know, the volume of trade online is increasing.  Small businesses need more supports.  Many of them are in the regions, where we are trying to develop jobs.  The Minister might indicate why the expenditure is down.</p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;15 million for the national broadband scheme, my first concern is about the timeframe.  The funding is also an issue.  The Minister told us previously there was a staff of 80.  How far will the &euro;15 million carry us this year if the procurement is not secured until November or December, for example?  Is it adequate?  The concern is over whether it is being given enough priority because we are down to one bidder.  The project is obviously long overdue.  We have rehearsed the matter of the delays time and again.  The funding seems to be modest.  Is it sufficient?  How far will it carry us this year?  The longer the process goes on, the longer 80 salaries will have to be paid, along with the legal expenses and associated ancillary payments.</p></speech>

I had not had a chance to review the figures.  In his opening remarks, the Minister said that the National Cyber Security Centre is to be strengthened, which is very welcome.  On the Channel 4 documentary on Monday night, the UK Information Commissioner, whose office has a role slightly similar to that of the centre, said she was unresourced to tackle cybercrime, social media issues, etc.  She had to talk about getting a warrant a day or two after the event although Facebook was able to go in that same night, apparently.  Nobody can quite understand how that happened.  I would hate to see the same happen here because of a lack of resources and support.</p> <p>  We know local authority and public websites have been hacked.  The Houses of the Oireachtas website was taken down about a month ago because of a cyberattack.  Therefore, a national cybersecurity centre is very much needed.  We also saw what we might have thought was a plot from a James Bond movie but which is becoming real.  FBS agents based in Dublin were targeting multinationals based in Dublin.  Many of those companies have expressed concerns regarding this type of development.  There is a directive to be transposed - the EU information security directive but I am not sure what the position is in respect of it.  Perhaps the Minister could provide an update.</p> <p>  In the same vein and very much related, we heard concerns in the House yesterday and again today on the social media issues pertaining to online campaigning, the Cambridge Analytica data mining, the use of social media platforms using information malevolently or lending it to other actors to use it in that way.  I had legislation before the House, the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill, which would tackle many, if not all, of these issues.  In the context of the Estimates, I understood from the Department that a money message was required for that Bill to be progress.  I hope all parties now agree that the Bill is important and that it tackles many of the issues that have been raised and over which concern has been expressed in recent days.</p><p>Earlier, the Taoiseach said that there were some technical issues.  I am happy to work with the Minister and the Government on refining those issues if that is the case but I ask for the Minister's support to bring the Bill to committee as soon as possible.  If a money message is required, let us address it today in the Estimates.</p></speech>

I will begin with the spending and changes in the figures from 2017 to 2018 under the various subheads.  On information and communications technology, between 2017 and 2018 the Estimate has gone from &euro;20.5 million to &euro;19 million.  That is because of anticipated contractual payments under the concession agreement for phase 2 of the metropolitan area networks which are projected to be less than was budgeted for in the 2017 allocation.  The outturn for 2017 is &euro;1.45 million less and that is reflected in the change in the subhead.</p> <p>  Some &euro;15 million is allocated to complete the procurement process in the national broadband plan.  The process commenced 27 months ago and we have gone through the process and the complexities involved.  As I have said before, is not a simple auction.  At the start of the process we did not have the technical solution, so that as part of the whole procurement process, one is bidding for the technical solution.  The three bidders who had progressed forward had recommended a primarily fibre-based solution for this.  David McCourt put it well in one interview when he explained what a competitive dialogue procurement process is.  At the start one has 200 issues to deal with, and now we are down to the last handful.   Once they are agreed, one signs off on the matter and moves on.  We are now at the very end of the process.  As I told the committee here some weeks ago, we will have a preferred bidder stage by September.  I think we can expedite this and we will get contractors on the ground delivering high-speed broadband quicker than we had envisaged.  The build out is expected to be three years and we are making significant progress.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked for a breakdown of subhead 3A.  The substantial part of that relates to the national broadband plan.  There is &euro;140,000 for the metropolitan area network, MAN, phase 2.  The management services entity, MSE, process management, which relates to the MAN ducting, has a fee of &euro;80,000.  The MSE 2 concession agreement is &euro;1.4 million.  The Galway-Mayo ducting is about to come to committee -----</p></speech>

The Tuam ducting has a sum of &euro;100,000.  The North-South telecoms operation is &euro;20,000 and &euro;1.8 million for Eircode.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked about subhead A4 on multimedia developments.  The projected change from the 2017 Estimate to the 2018 Estimate is &euro;654,000.  The decrease relates to the Digital Hub Development Agency 2018 allocation which reflects the ongoing implementation of the 2015-2019 financial model which is designed to gradually phase out the agency's reliance on Exchequer funding.  Funding for operating expenses and capital has decreased in line with the financial model.  In plain English, part of the long-term strategy for the digital hub is that over time it would become less reliant on public moneys and be able to generate more income itself.  Much of that income is being generated in relation to the development of property on that site which is then let to companies including tech companies.  As the rental income from the site increases, the Exchequer contribution towards its running cost diminishes and the figure of &euro;645,000 reflects that.  </p> <p>  Those are the two big changes in spending on the A Vote.  Deputy Stanley asked about the difference between the spend.  There is another slight change in this, namely, &euro;258,000 on administration non-pay aspects.  That relates to overall savings on that side.  Deputy Stanley also asked about the trading online voucher scheme.  Since I was appointed Minister, we have increased the funding available to the trading online voucher scheme year-on-year.  On several occasions I have publicly made the local enterprise offices aware that if applications for the trading online vouchers scheme is over-subscribed and the funding is not there to meet it, I will find the funding for it.  I do not want funding to be an issue on that.  Many colleagues here have actively encouraged companies in their own constituencies to apply for the trading online voucher scheme which is a 50% grant up to &euro;2,500 for people to start trading online or to be able to take online payments if they already have an Internet presence.  We have found that those people who have started to trade online are increasing their sales by one fifth, employment by one third, and two thirds of those companies are now trading internationally.  </p> <p>  It is not only traditional retail businesses which can benefit from this.  I was in Deputy Dooley's county town of Ennis recently and visited Bridget Haren hairdressers, not that I am an expert in visiting hairdressers, where we had an interesting conversation regarding Bridget having availed of the online voucher scheme.  They have used it in order to make all their bookings online.  Whether it is a wash and blowdry or highlights, the client is allocated whatever period necessary and the staff member to do it.  It provides them with a huge degree of flexibility as well as being able to sell the hair products online that they have the rights to stock in their salon.  Over the Christmas period, they saw their sales increase dramatically.  There are huge opportunities there for businesses which may not traditionally see themselves as having an opportunity to go on the route of trading online.  I actively encourage people to avail of the scheme.  Up to one third of that grant may also be spent on online marketing.  There is no point in having a shop window online unless people can actually see it.  </p> <p>  Another interesting thing that we have found from it is that quite a number of people who have availed of the training have found that their existing system meets their needs but they may not have been maximising it.  Over 10,000 businesses have received training where about 4,500 have availed of the voucher.  There are 1,500 vouchers.  Let that not be a limit.  I encourage colleagues here to actively encourage businesses in their constituencies to avail of that support.</p><p>Deputy James Lawless asked a number of questions.  On the legislation he introduced, I have spoken privately to him about it.  I also discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il the technical difficulties with it, although the Deputy gave a different impression on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; earlier in the week.  We are all agreed on the route we need to take.  An interdepartmental group which is led by the Taoiseach's Department and comprises representatives of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is due to meet on Friday and this issue will form part of its discussion on electoral reform.  We are and were conscious of the issue in advance of the Channel 4 documentary and what was reported in <i>The Guardian</i>this week.  The interdepartmental group was established on foot of the Deputy's legislation and it is our intention to progress swiftly in that regard.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's question of whether there is a lack of resources on the cyber security side, all of the resources that have been sought have been provided.  I had a discussion recently with the head of our cyber security division about whether resources were an issue.  The main issue is the provision of accommodation to meet staffing levels which have increased dramatically from a low base.  The intention is to recruit additional staff this year.  The challenge, therefore, is not resources, but, rather, finding staff with the requisite training.  Traditionally, we have seconded staff from the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this practice is continuing.  We liaise with our colleagues across Europe in that regard.  A recruitment process will commence soon to ramp up capacity in this area.</p></speech>

I welcome the establishment of the interdepartmental group, about which I heard for the first time yesterday on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  It is better late than never and I hope it will do some good.  In the meantime, it is my understanding there is one line in the legislation that causes difficulty for the Government.  If the Minister was willing, he could work with me on redrafting it before Committee Stage.  I would welcome engagement with him in that regard.</p></speech>

If so, will the competitive element follow the selection of the preferred bidder or will it commence now?  How does the Minister see it developing as an option?  Given that the ESB is a State-owned company and that enet is owned publicly by a State investment fund, I imagine it is a complex regulatory issue as to which poles might be used, given that they have existing uses and so on.  I would welcome some detail from the Minister on this aspect of the tendering process.  Is it one of the handful of issues which the Minister mentioned which has yet to be resolved and if it is part of the tendering process, will it happen before or after the selection of the preferred bidder?</p></speech>

I understand there has been engagement to explore all options and that nothing has been ruled out.  The regulated price is &euro;20 per telephone pole, which means that if there are two operators using a pole, the cost if &euro;10 each and that if there are four, the cost is &euro;5 each.  The Deputy will be aware that prior to Christmas I brought a memorandum to the Government on the introduction of legislation to deal with the regulated price of access under the NBP.  The regulated price is reviewed every three to five years, but the contract period in this instance is much longer.  There has been engagement on price with the owners of infrastructure.  This is very much part of the overall procurement process and the final price will be determined as part of the decisions that are made on the contract.</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; and TG4 are funded through a mix of commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising, Exchequer grant payments and licence fee revenue.  It is estimated that broadcasting licence fee receipts will be &euro;222 million in 2018.  The broadcasting programme provides for an allocation of &euro;190.7 million in television licence fee receipts to RT&Eacute; to enable the company to meet its statutory obligations as a national public service broadcaster.  In addition, the programme provides for an allocation of &euro;4.2 million in television licence fee receipts and &euro;31.5 million in grant payments to TG4 to produce a comprehensive range of programming in the Irish language.</p> <p>  Programme B also funds new Irish television and radio programmes through the broadcasting fund which is operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The fund receives 7% of net television licence fee receipts which is expected to amount to &euro;14.7 million in 2018.</p></speech>

That is a significant amount of money at a time when the national broadcaster is under significant strain in terms of its ability to meet its commitments and compete with the digital platforms.  What has come to the fore in the last couple of days about the capacity of outside forces to use social media platforms to act in a nefarious way in democratic elections must surely bring home to the Minister and everyone else at the Cabinet table the necessity to support indigenous media.</p><p> In this instance our discussion concerns broadcasting only, so I will confine my remarks to that.  I also have a view that we must support the wider media to act as a bulwark against the kind of nefarious activities that have been talked about in other jurisdictions.  In that light, what movement, if any, have the Minister and the Department made to address the sum of approximately &euro;40 million that is being lost to evasion?  How quickly does the Minister hope to address the funding shortfall that arises in this way?  Does he have any further thoughts about the use of the Revenue as an agency to collect the licence fee?  Has he thought further about extending a flat broadcasting charge across the State as a method of supporting our indigenous broadcast media?</p></speech>

I note that bulk of the total figure, &euro;190 million, comes from the licence fee.  There is little or no accountability for how that is spent.  I note that the Committee of Public Accounts has written to RT&Eacute;, requesting that its representatives appear.  Is there any accountability to the Department for that considerable sum of money?  That is one question.</p> <p>  My second question under subhead B relates to our progress in capturing the 14% to 17% licence fee evasion.  I am very clear that the TV licence fee should not be increased.  We should aim to spread the burden more widely, because an awful lot of people get up early in the morning and earn very small wages, but who dutifully buy stamps to pay their television licence every week.  Indeed, people who are on other low incomes, such as social welfare, do the same thing.  People who are fairly wealthy may not pay it.  What progress has been made?  The wheels seem to turn very slowly.  I put forward proposals to improve that collection rate by having the registration at the point of purchase of the service or of a television set.  A user would immediately come into the net.  What is the current position and what is the scale of the loss at the moment?  The figure of &euro;40 million has been mentioned in the past.</p> <p>  My questions concern accountability for where the money goes and the progress in moving to a new system to ensure a greater spread of the burden while keeping the licence fee where it is.</p></speech>

I think this committee is at one.  There is a real urgency in addressing the funding of Irish broadcasting and, indeed as Deputy Dooley says, Irish media.  There has been good news in that TV3 is about to sign a deal for rights to the Heineken Cup, which is great.  However, I joked with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, yesterday that RT&Eacute; could not buy the Cork Constitution FC under-15 B team's television rights.  It is being frozen out of a range of areas.  It is not in the long-term interests of this country to have a broadcaster which has been cut to the bone and which has a strategic plan but no direction whatsoever from Government as to whether it will be supported.  This cannot wait.  This is something the Minister will have to address before the summer break, because the world is moving on.  The business world is moving on.  If we are too slow to fund broadcasting properly we will kill it, and that is not in the democratic interests of this State.</p> <p>  We did very good work in the oral hearing we held in Dublin Castle last year.  It is not just the licence fee alone but also the transmission fee and a range of other initiatives that can give us that extra pot of &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million.  That is what we should go for.  We are clear on that.  I ask the Taoiseach every second week and I get a know-nothing response.  It is time to respond.  What is the Minister going to do about it?</p></speech>

I would like to know what progress has been made in gathering them.  That is where a lot of revenue could be collected.  Has the Minister considered the impact on An Post if collection of fees is moved from it to Revenue or RT&Eacute; itself?  Can the Minister comment on the overall vision for having Revenue collect the television licence fees?  It will go down like a lead balloon if another tax is taken out of wages to pay for this.  Can the Minister comment on those three things?</p></speech>

In the next day or two, I am due to receive a report from my officials on that report, and I want to compliment the committee on it.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Eamon Ryan, I note that Deputy Dooley asked me the same question in the House a couple of weeks ago.  We need to deal with this urgently.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan in that regard.  That is why last May I got Government approval to bring forward the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2017.  Hearings on the Bill started here on 11 July 2017, and the committee produced its report on it on 8 March 2018.  I have only just received that report.  My intention is to move as quickly as possible on this.  Specifically, this Bill addresses the issue of evasion.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's query about the impact on An Post, I note that An Post says that it is losing money on the enforcement of television licences.  We have looked for expressions of interest with regard to this service.  An Post is the collection agent at the moment, and the work is carried out through local post offices.  We have no plans whatsoever to move collection away from the local post office.  An Post is one of the organisations that is anxious to bid for this service if it goes through a tendering process.  The intention behind this legislation is to enact it quickly and deal with some of the challenging problems that we have.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked about the issue of retransmission.  The report of this committee of 8 March asked me to prioritise measures to tackle evasion, which is what I intend to do.  It also said that we need a detailed regulatory impact analysis of the issue of retransmission.  We have just received that report, and I have directed officials to work on this immediately.</p> <p>  As I say, I am expecting to receive feedback on the broader report the committee has produced from my officials very shortly.  I presume this will include Deputy Stanley's suggestion concerning registration at the point of purchase of a television set.  Deputy Stanley is right in this regard.  This is something I feel very strongly about.  There have been numerous calls to increase the price of the television licence.  We are effectively asking people to pay more to subsidise those who are refusing to pay.  At the moment the public is actually subsidising the television licence because of the rates of evasion.</p><p>Those who pay a television licence effectively subsidise those who do not to the sum of &euro;39 annually.  About a quarter of the television licence fee is being used for that purpose.  We need to increase funding to RT&Eacute; but the way to do that is by ending evasion and closing off some of the loopholes and anomalies associated with the current licence.  Since 2013, sales of the licence have increased, although not at the rate we would like.  We want to encourage people to buy the licence.</p><p> Deputy Dooley is correct that combatting disinformation is the fundamental reason we need public service broadcasting.  Any robust democracy has a well-functioning, publicly supported media.  That is not only in relation to broadcasting but, as I said shortly after my appointment, it is something that we need to broaden out.  We can see challenges across the board.  We have very good quality journalism in this country, both from broadcasters and print media, and it is something I want to see supported.  That is why the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill includes provision to support community and local radio stations, and also to support young journalists.  I would like to see a situation eventually where we had the flexibility to go further than that.</p><p> Deputy Stanley asked about governance.  The 2016 code of practice for the governance of State bodies issued in August 2016 applies to RT&Eacute;.  However, it did not come into force immediately.  State bodies are expected to be in compliance with the code by the end of the first full financial year subsequent to the publication of the code, which was 31 December 2017, in both cases.  The Department has been working with RT&Eacute; to ensure full compliance with the code within the specified deadline.  In line with the code's requirements, an oversight agreement has been signed by the Department and RT&Eacute;.  The oversight agreement does not include any additional obligations, rather it describes the roles, responsibilities and obligations of the Department and RT&Eacute; as set out in the Broadcasting Act.  RT&Eacute; provides detailed financial analysis to the Department each month, including revenues, costs, deficits and surpluses, by channel, service and broadcasting genre and between public service and non-public service activities.  The information is consolidated at the end of year and published in the RT&Eacute; annual report.</p><p> On the key performance indicators for broadcasting, both public service broadcasters, namely, TG4 and RT&Eacute;, prepare annual statements of performance commitments setting out how they intend to meet the targets in their respective strategy statements and how they will meet their statutory objectives as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland review these statements in the context of the annual reviews carried out under section 102 of the Act and the BAI then reports to me, as Minister, on the performance of each public sector broadcaster with regard to its statutory remit and commitments, and can make recommendations regarding funding required to enable the public service broadcasters to fulfil their obligations.</p></speech>

Anyone listening to the discussion we had around it would know that the Minister has the political cover to act on it because we were pretty much united and perfectly clear having heard the initial evidence that there was a really strong case.  There is some frustration that the process took time, although we were clear in our report after the Dublin Castle event that we thought the retransmission issue was one of the basket of measures that the Minister needed to pick up.  It is true there are all sorts of legal checks, and a final legal scoot around is necessary, but for the Minister to suggest the committee delayed it to 8 March is incorrect.  Anyone following this process over the last year knows that the committee could not have been clearer about the retransmission issue and the need to act fast on it.  The idea that the committee's main recommendation was for there to be more regulatory analysis and that the Department has not done it over the last year beggars belief.  We need to act fast on this.  As Deputy Dooley said, the Minister has political support and cover to do something.  It cannot just be the advertisements I keep hearing on the radio from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment telling me to pay my television licence, which do nothing to address evasion.  If that is our ongoing response, it is not good enough.</p></speech>

Maybe Members of the Oireachtas can be political at times when we do not need to be.  I am sure the Minister and the Department were observing the discussions which were ongoing here.  It was not necessary for us to finalise the report in order to know the direction the committee was taking.  Early on, the majority of the members of the committee had spoken of the Revenue Commissioners as an effective methodology for collecting the moneys owed here.  The Minister's Bill does not do that.  It looks at a hybrid model and gives the Minister options.  I do not know how successful the Bill can be in capturing that &euro;40 million.  I suspect it would be less effective than the direction which this committee suggested.  The Minister does not have to take on board the views of the committee.  Previous Ministers moved this matter on a considerable distance but were unable to get it over the line for political reasons.  The Minister identified the problem in the early stages of his time in office, but he immediately took the notion of a broadcasting charge off the agenda without consultation.  My party, which facilitates the Minister being in government, made it clear in its manifesto that we support the idea of equality and fairness for all, in the sense that everyone would pay their fair share and those who pay do not carry the burden of others.  It is a little disingenuous, if not overly so, for the Minister to suggest that there were delays here in this committee which have delayed the process of getting at that &euro;40 million.  In my view, the Minister could have moved more quickly with the Revenue Commissioners, and could have done it six, eight, ten or 12 months ago, and we would not be where we are.  Now it is coming into really sharp focus because, as others have said, RT&Eacute; has a plan.  The director general has not been before the committee for a while, but I assume she will be in the normal course of events.  Presumably she will say the same thing she said last time, and I paraphrase, that she had heard a lot of claptrap and a lot from politicians about the necessity to provide for RT&Eacute;'s public service obligation but we have not come forward with the money.  The committee has outlined the way to do it.  It is now over to the Minister.</p></speech>

We received the pre-legislative scrutiny report on foot of its publication earlier this month, on 8 March.  There is a process for the passage of legislation.  I cannot proceed to the next stage of that until it completes the next stage.  It has gone through pre-legislative scrutiny and I have asked my officials to act, and act immediately, on foot of that, which is what they will do.  A far more substantial body of work was undertaken by the committee regarding long-term funding for public service broadcasting in this country, which I complimented in my contribution.  It is a very detailed report.  Within days, I will have a report on my desk from my officials on foot of that.  I intend to proceed with that and bring it to Government also.</p></speech>

Using less energy, and using it more efficiently, is the most cost effective way to combat climate change.  The programme provides &euro;10.9 million to cover operational costs of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and includes a significantly increased allocation of &euro;117 million to fund expanded energy efficiency programmes.</p><p>They include: the better energy homes scheme for homeowners to provide grants towards a range of energy efficiency measures; the better energy warmer homes scheme to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low-income households; the better energy communities programme to encourage community-based partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock and energy poor homes; and targeted interventions in the commercial and public sectors to deliver significant energy savings, while reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  These schemes are anticipated to deliver energy measures to over 28,500 buildings, including 9,300 low-income homes and save over 120,000 tonnes in carbon emissions.</p><p> The overall energy programme also provides funding to incentivise the purchase of electric vehicles and support for the installation of home and public charge points, with an increase in the number of rapid chargers.  Investment of some &euro;9 million in energy research aims to accelerate diversification away from fossil fuels to green energy.</p></speech>

The Littleton briquette factory has been a victim of that particular policy, which I understand.  Today is a very sad and difficult day because it is the last day of production at the plant.  It closes this evening.  It has been a very traumatic experience for the 120 people who have lost their jobs in Littleton.</p> <p>  I acknowledge and appreciate the Minister's assistance and support and that of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in facilitating through Bord na M&oacute;na a redundancy package that was accepted by the vast majority of the workforce.  What I and everybody in the local community are concerned about is that we have a plant that has made an enormous contribution to the economic and social life of the area.  It is hugely important and beneficial to the local economy.  We are now bereft of employment in that isolated area.  I am asking the Minister to discuss with Bord na M&oacute;na what the future holds for the plant.  How can we maximise and utilise the existing bog?  How can we provide alternative employment opportunities for those people who have lost their jobs and their dependent families?</p> <p>  I am also concerned about security.  We are talking about roughly 12,000 acres of bogland and we already have a lot of encroachment, trespassing and security issues.  The local people are extremely concerned that the property will be vacated and that it will result in trespass of a serious nature, which has already taken place.  Does the Minister have any suggestions or ideas?  What discussions has he had with the executive of Bord na M&oacute;na about providing alternative jobs and employment at the site?</p></speech>

I presume the reason for that is energy efficiency.  How many renewable energy projects have been supported through the SEAI schemes over the past year?  Have any schools been given support to develop renewables?  One of the good things that has been happening over the past number of years is the number of new schools being built even in 2013, 2014 and 2015 when there was not much money about.  I give the Government credit for that.  It is good that education continues to be a priority.  We have built schools and a lot of money is spent on architects doing designs and all of them look the same.  I am not sure why there is so much hoo-ha about the design.  One of the things that is noticeable is they have flat roofs.  A huge opportunity is being missed to capture solar energy on the rooftops of schools.  I am talking about schools but one could also consider county hall in Laois where a new storey has been added for the payroll section for all the local authorities in the State and a whole lot of public bodies.  There are 70 or 80 new employees in it.  There is a flat roof which is mostly south facing.  Have any schools been given support for that?</p> <p>  My other question is on renewable energy.  It receives money from the ordinary householder through the PSO levy.  There is a slow-down in the development of new renewables.  If one looks at the figures for 2015 and 2016, will one see a downward trend in recent years?  The figures indicate there has been a slowdown.  At what point did it begin?  If one looks at the 2014 to 2016 figures, one can see it.  What is the explanation for it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12018032100002#H00500"><p>The only point that I have not addressed in the past is electric vehicles and the lack of chargers.  The Minister has talked about an increase in rapid chargers.  Collectively, we will have to find a way to get many more charging points out there.  I am hearing it consistently from people who have taken quite some time to get to a point where they are prepared to purchase an electric car.  They have purchased one and are finding that the chargers, on many occasions, are not working.  They are down for considerable periods of time.  It is hugely frustrating.</p> <p>  The most frustrating aspect is that people have come to me to say that if they could they would give up their electric cars and go back to petrol or diesel, not because of anything to do with the car but because of their inability to find effective charging points in the towns which they frequent.  It is very disheartening.  We have to front-load the charging points way above what is needed in the short to medium term.  We should be putting the long-term requirement in right at the very start so that we overcompensate to ultimately encourage their use.  It is a big behavioural change to get people to change from the traditional fuel methods to electric vehicles.  It takes a lot of confidence.  Range anxiety is a very significant inhibitor.  If people have worked out that the range is doable but then discover there is not an available method of charging in the areas they frequent, we have a problem.  I appeal to the Minister to do whatever it takes to get a system in place of rolling out these chargers.  They are just as important now as ensuring that sections of our roadways are not littered with potholes.  It is that serious in my view based on the experiences I have encountered.</p></speech>

Should the baseline figure for 2018 not be at 35,000 and increasing by 5,000 each year if we are to reach the target by 2021?  What kind of budget would be required every year to increase the output to 45,000 buildings by that date?</p></speech>

It is a sad day when one sees any operation in the country closing.  It was inevitable and will be inevitable that as we transition away from fossil fuels, we will have more announcements of this kind in the future.  The objective is to try to ensure, in so far as is possible, that we are transitioning out of one technology and into employment in another area.  It has been very traumatic for the staff involved in Littleton.  There are 124 people impacted by it.  About 80 people will exit the company on 28 March and there will be ten retained in the peat business unit.</p><p>Over a period of six months to three years, 34 redundancies will take place due to the decommissioning of the site.  In terms of the security of the site, 44 staff will still be there and they will transition out over time.  While there were protracted discussions on redundancy, 90% support from the staff was secured for the redundancy package which was ultimately offered.  It is important now to explore the opportunities for the site and source alternative employment for it.  I discussed this with the outgoing chief executive of Bord na M&oacute;na and we have discussed possible alternatives for the site.  We have a new chief executive coming into Bord na M&oacute;na now and I will ask him to look at this.  It is a very valuable site given its strategic location and infrastructure and we must find out what opportunities exist there for alternative uses and employment.</p><p> Deputy Stanley asked me about school buildings.  We have been involved in a pilot project with the Department of Education and Skills.  There was an initiative between the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Department of Education and Skills and &euro;2 million was allocated for a renovation pilot scheme for medium to deep retrofit upgrades of ten primary and secondary schools.  The purpose of the pilot scheme was to help to develop a scalable model for energy efficiency retrofits to schools across Ireland.  On foot of the learnings from that, we are going to try to develop it further.  We had a number of other pilots, one of which involved energy upgrades of central government buildings with the OPW.  This year, we have set aside &euro;9 million to invest in further support for public sector energy efficiency strategies.  We are at about 20% across the public sector in relation to energy efficiency and must reach a target of 33% by 2020.</p></speech>

Solar panels are part of the mix.  In fact, I visited a school in Leixlip where the kids were showing me the solar panel.  They actually had battery storage in the school.  The big problem with schools is that they are closed a lot of the time whether at weekends or out of term.  As such, one is not getting the same bang for one's buck when investing in a solar panel there.  However, this is a whole issue we are looking at in the context of microgeneration.  We had a workshop in October 2017 on this.  It is something not only colleagues here, including me, are anxious to see pursued, but under the new directives on microgeneration and community participation from Europe we will have to do it anyway.  What we are looking at now is a number of options.  Self-consumption seems to be the easiest area in which to get over some of the technical challenges.  That was the example I saw first-hand in Leixlip.  It is our intention to run an initial phase on solar panels for domestic purposes this summer.  We will look at the uptake there.  The SEAI is working on the scheme now.</p> <p>  Right across the public sector, there are huge opportunities.  The Deputy is right about that.  In effect, the grant aid available is roughly at about 30% and we are working with the OPW, local authorities and other bodies.  There is a number of avenues.  We have the public sector energy efficiency targets for which funding is available.  Whatever energy savings are made by the public sector can also be retained by the relevant division or Department and does not have to go back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It can be reinvested in other services within the relevant body or agency.  There are other funding avenues across the public sector for initiatives.  We are quite open to any initiative.  We have done a pilot project with the Department of Education and Skills and hope to see it expanded and developed.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about a drop off in relation to the 2014-2016 figures.  I am not sure what he is asking me about.  Is it in relation to renewable energy or grants for retrofitting homes?</p></speech>

It is a more efficient use of energy.  I do not know why there was a drop and I will have to come back to the Deputy on it.  I do not have an answer.  However, we expect the outturn for 2017 to be up.  I will come back to the Deputy because I honestly do not have an answer to that.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked me about electric vehicles and charging points.  He is right that this issue is coming up all over the place.  There are approximately 900 charging points nationally, most of which are the relatively slow ones.  On top of that, every person who purchased a new electric vehicle had a charging point installed at their home.  The vast majority of people are actually charging at home.  Some people are charging during the day, but the numbers are limited.  If we want to get people to move from using their cars purely for commuting and to travel across the country, it will be necessary to have an effective network of charging points.  That is why we announced this year additional funding of &euro;1.8 million, of which &euro;1.5 million is for capital expenditure and &euro;300,000 is for current expenditure, to expand the network of charging points nationally.  Currently, we have approximately 4,500 electric vehicles in the country.  The grant has been paid out for 2,636 electric vehicles since it was initially introduced and there will have been imports on top of that.</p> <p>  The number of charging points per electric vehicle is probably better than most other places in Europe.  However, that does not take from the point the Deputy makes.  We saw a significant improvement last year.  Approximately one third of all new electric vehicles on our roads were purchased in 2017 and we expect to see that increase again this year.  In tandem with that, we need to repair the points which are not operational.  Some local authorities, including Deputy Dooley's in Clare, have improved the signage and road markings for electric vehicle charging points.  My own local authority, Roscommon County Council, has done the same.</p><p>We must encourage local authorities to do that across the country.  We are now rolling out the fast-charging points.  We are conscious of it.</p><p> Interestingly, we held a new electric vehicle-hybrid trial in Letterkenny last month.  Where taxis were used to transport patients for dialysis to Letterkenny hospital, they were conducting trials on the use of battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hybrid vehicles.  The plug-in hybrids and the hybrid vehicles were supplied by Toyota - they were Toyota Priuses - and Nissan provided the electric vehicles, which were Nissan Leafs.  We also had the cold weather and we will be able to look at the impact of the cold weather on that.  Taxi drivers will give us a good idea, particularly in rural areas, such as Letterkenny, where they are servicing a rural area, of some of the challenges and issues.  As the committee will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport last month launched the new grant scheme for taxi drivers of electric vehicles and hybrids.</p><p> The Chair asked about the national development plan and the ramping up, from 30,000 premises to 45,000 premises per annum.  The main aspect where we will see the ramping up will be on some of the lower volume schemes.  On the better energy homes scheme, last year we did 14,606 homes.  On the better energy warmer homes, we did 6,555 homes.  However, the newer schemes include the warmth and well-being scheme, where we will conduct a pilot on 1,000 homes over a three-year period.  This will involve a deep retrofit and looking at the health outcomes for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and children with asthma.  We have asked the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to examine the health outturns in that regard.  We have spent &euro;15,500 doing a deep retrofit on each of those homes.  In fact, we had envisaged a budget of &euro;20,000 on average per home.  In practical terms, the cost was &euro;4,500 less than that.</p><p> We are also looking at a further deep retro-pilot, some of which will involve turf cutters - those who were availing of turf compensation scheme.  In fact, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne and I are participating in an information evening quite soon on that, talking to some of those families to see whether we can transition away from solid fuel to more sustainable forms of heating.  The other deep retrofit pilot will look at moving away from oil-fired heating.  The cost of doing this is not as prohibitive as we initially thought but we are building capacity within the sector, giving contractors the opportunities to bid for these scheme, building up the skill sets and building up the training ability for contractors to do it.</p><p> We have now also ramped up the sustainable energy community scheme this year.  We have the better energy communities across the country.  Last year, there were 44 projects approved and we have put additional funding into that this year.  The call is just opening on the sustainable energy community scheme for &euro;3 million.  The objective is to look at communities that have not availed of energy efficiency grants up to now and, working closely with them, put a facilitator in place so that they can put a detailed plan in place to improve the energy efficiency of the community as a whole.  Effectively, we will guarantee any group that works with us and the SEAI on this and that meets the terms and conditions, funding this year to get on that process because on so many occasions in the past we have communities go to a huge amount of effort and submit applications to find that they were not successful.  We are saying we will guarantee them funding this year to get their project off the ground and then give them the capacity to bid for the better energy community scheme next year.  We would expect, because of these pilot initiatives that are now ramping up, that we will be able to meet that target of 45,000 premises or homes a year by 2021.</p></speech>

Apologies if I have to leave for that.</p> <p>  What number of those houses in 2021 does the Minister expect to be deep retrofit?  Has Deputy Denis Naughten, as a Minister, supported the European Parliament's call for a 35% renewables target as part of the new renewables directive that is now in the trial process?  Has the Department changed its position, which in its baseline assumption was that we would have a 40% renewables electricity target in 2030 or no increase in current levels?  Given that this morning Baringa, a renowned international research energy organisation, was showing on behalf of the IWEA how we could get a 70% target, what is the Minister's target for renewable electricity in Ireland in 2030?</p> <p>  Lastly, in one of the submissions we had here, Mr. Paul Kenny from the Tipperary Energy Agency made the obvious and stark point that 67% of new houses are putting in fossil fuel heating systems which we will have to take out in the coming decades.  Would the Minister consider introducing regulations to wind down and stop our use of fossil heating systems, given that we have heat-pump technology and solar-water heating alternatives, often Irish made and of high quality, which bring a range of benefits such as air quality and balancing system?  Why are we still putting fossil fuel systems into any homes?</p></speech>

Few are done with anything other than that.  I suspect quite a considerable amount of those are gas.  That is part of a far broader debate.  We have a review ongoing in that area.</p> <p>  In relation to those 45,000 houses, the objective is to bring those up to BER B standard. </p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a 35% proposal that has been put forward by the Europan Parliament in relation to renewables.  The 27% was the figure that we had pushed for at Council.  That will be part of further negotiations that have to take place.</p></speech>

Not even from a climate perspective but an energy security perspective, it makes far more sense to be putting investment in to sustainable long-term solutions that mean that our energy needs are met domestically rather than being imported.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan will be aware, the reason we are looking at a 40% target for 2030 is that the demand for electricity is projected to increase dramatically here over the decade between 2020 and 2030.</p><p>As Deputy Ryan is well aware, to maintain 40% renewables will be a significant ask and challenge for our grid.</p></speech>

Funding under this programme allows my Department to provide reliable geoscience support for environmental protection and the sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources, and to address the environmental, health and safety implications of historical mining activity.  In 2018, funding of &euro;3.75 million is provided for mining services, including &euro;1.4 million for continued remediation works at the former mining sites of Silvermines and Avoca.</p> <p>  The programme also includes an allocation of just under &euro;12.5 million for Geological Survey of Ireland services, including &euro;8 million for the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  The Tellus mapping project consists of airborne geophysical measurements and ground geochemical sampling.  Data from the project will allow for improvement in geological maps, new radon mapping and agricultural mineral maps.  Data from the Tellus project will also facilitate better land use planning and research.  The INFOMAR project is Ireland's national seabed survey and is managed by the Geological Survey of Ireland in co-operation with the Marine Institute.  Under the groundwater programme, the Geological Survey of Ireland's monitoring will provide key data relating to turlough flooding to the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local authorities.</p></speech>

He had sufficient interest to visit the local area in Silvermines and meet with members of the community, who conveyed to him their concerns, anxieties and fears, and the impact that historical mining had on the environment in Silvermines, the risk to public health and the safety concerns emanating from mining at the mines.  We followed that with the interdepartmental meeting held in Agriculture House and we went through a number of proposals and suggestions.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could give me an update on what his intentions are within this budget and what results have been achieved, what additional information has been provided or what formula the Minister of State has for the continued remediation of Silvermines.</p></speech>

He is right.  I attended what was effectively a public meeting in Silvermines recently with the Deputy and his colleagues in Tipperary, which I think was very useful.  There was ill-feeling about the issues and historical legacies of Silvermines.  It shows the importance of other new mines that are being developed and the remediation fund which unfortunately was not there as part of the Silvermines development.  Following discussions with the Department, the Chief State Solicitor's office wrote to the solicitor acting on behalf of the owners of the Gortmore tailings facility stating that, in effect, in the event that the owner does not wish to negotiate along the lines of the previous offer, the Department would consider retention by the owner of the site subject to a comprehensive management plan being submitted by the owner and signed off by a suitable expert.  There has been no response to this letter to date.  I understand that the Department, via the Chief State Solicitor's office, has, in the last week or so, contacted the landowners to again seek a response to the November 2017 letter and to remind them that they have an onus to keep horses off the older, remediated parts of the site.  Following an update in February 2018, approximately 25 horses were found to be on the site.  That is the site that has not been remediated by the Department.  The result has been significant damage to the grass which was seeded directly onto the tailing.</p> <p>  This is an issue for which there is ongoing monitoring by the Department and ongoing liaison with the landowners through their solicitors, with a view to seeking a response to the letter of November 2017 and a follow-up to that.  The funding provided in the Estimates is open to possible compensation.  There is the possibility of the purchase of other sites subject to work being initiated by Tipperary County Council, which we have not heard about, and I know the chief executive was present at that meeting as well as experts in the area from the local authority.  We are open to assisting Tipperary County Council should it come forward with proposals for other parts of the Silvermines site.  We are still in liaison with regard to the Gortmore tailings facility.  As the Deputy said, there have been discussions with the veterinary officers in Tipperary relating to that site.  As the Deputy knows, an inter-agency group is dealing with previous issues relating to incidents of animal disease in certain areas.  That work is going on and there is ongoing mapping of the lands owned by farmers in that vicinity, to ensure that there is best management and best practice and that there is no soil contamination entering into fodder.  Much work is being done by the Department in liaison with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the veterinary office in the area and local landowners.</p></speech>

In 2018, Inland Fisheries Ireland will continue to deliver its licensing, permitting and enforcement responsibilities, along with the rehabilitation of our rivers and streams.  The delivery of a wide-ranging set of investments, innovations and promotions under the national strategy for angling development will ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s fish stocks and angling infrastructure are protected and enhanced for both their economic value and their recreational benefit to the communities and visitors they serve across Ireland.  The inland fisheries programme includes an allocation of just under &euro;18.7 million towards the staff costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  The Loughs Agency is a North-South body and is co-funded on a 50:50 basis by my Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.  Also included in the programme is &euro;14.3 million for non-pay current and capital expenditure by the two agencies.</p></speech>

There has been correspondence from my office to the Minister of State's officials about it.  I know one of the officials here deals with inland fisheries.  I might speak to him about it and see if we can get a resolution to it.  There is illegal dumping and illegal fishing in that dragnets are being pulled out of it.  It is better if a local club is managing and looking after it.  There have been instances of intimidation of people involved in fishing.</p></speech>

The environment and waste management programme includes an allocation of &euro;37.4 million towards staff costs, non-pay current as well as capital costs of the Environmental Protection Agency to allow it meet its legislative mandate and deliver its research commitments, in areas such as ambient air quality as well as the broader climate change agenda.  The programme includes &euro;11 million grant funding for the remediation of landfill sites and repatriation of North-South waste.  A national waste campaign targeted at household waste collection, illegal dumping, end of life vehicles and tyres will increase awareness of the necessity to minimise waste and increase recycling.</p><p>Investment of &euro;2 million in the establishment of a local authority regional climate action office will support implementation of sectoral adaptation measures.  An allocation of &euro;1.5 million will fund a range of Irish academic and research institutions involved in technical research and modelling to inform policy measures in line with the national mitigation plan and the national adaptation framework.  Funding for the national dialogue on climate action aims to build citizen engagement to bring about the requisite societal transformation to address the challenges presented by climate change.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, it is on the agenda again, with a particular company changing its charging structure.  At the time there was much talk about the necessity to change consumer behaviour and I know that some money was set aside for that purpose.  Will the Minister give a view on the effectiveness of the consumer behaviour initiatives taken in that regard?  I still hear about people who have a difficulty in understanding what is and is not recyclable, what should put in the green and blue bins and what should be put in what is generally labelled the "wet" bin.</p> <p>  Will the Minister comment on the watchdog that was established at the time?  He will recall that Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a proposal in Private Members' time to establish a more comprehensive method of ensuring value for money would be achieved across the sector, but it was rejected at the time.  There was also the idea of having a waste regulator in place.  The Minister set up a watchdog, but one of the agencies that was going to be central to it - the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission - chose not to be part of it.  Will the Minister indicate the current status?</p></speech>

Recycling is only the second worst option.  We need to reduce our waste.  We need to lead in these Houses and start to speak to people about reducing their waste.  I get depressed about illegal dumping, the level of which we could see when hedgerows died back this year.  My God almighty, it was absolutely disgraceful.  There are contractors, local authority staff and others out in rural areas gathering up the stuff.  We must try to stop it.  I note, in the context of impact indicators, that rate of household recycling went from 47% in 2013 to 45% in 2015.  What was placed in landfill sites in the same period decreased by over one quarter, which is good news and shows that something is happening to reduce the volume of waste going to landfill sites.  There was a slip of 2% in the household recycling rate when I would have thought it would have been moving upwards and onwards.  I thought we had got the message across and that we had made huge gains.  We are not living in a bubble and China has indicated that it will no longer accept plastic waste.  Does the Minister have a briefing note on this issue to give an outline on what is happening in that respect?  It is a major concern.  What are the figures for the landfill levy, from which there is still a substantial fund?  Will the Minister give a breakdown of where the money goes?</p></speech>

Over the course of the past year we agreed a uniform standard in the use of the green and blue bins.  Across the country there is now a standard list of what can be put in a recycling bin.  It took a considerable amount of work and we ran an initiative in that regard towards the back end of last year.  We also ran through the Environmental Protection Agency a significant number of campaigns to encourage people to use the brown bin.  The single biggest challenge we have is getting people to use that brown.  We are rolling it out in more areas, initially in communities with a population of 500 or more.  It was available in place in areas with a population of 1,500 people or more, but the figure has been reduced to 500.  Ultimately, every home in the country that wants a brown bin will have access to one.</p></speech>

I am hearing from householders who have adopted brown bins that they are too small.  Canister-style bins are given in many areas because the companies do not want too much grass and other materials to be put into them.  In the area with which I am familiar householders have told me that the units being provided are too small.</p></speech>

I know that in my part of the country there are wheelie bins that are the same as the blue and green bins.  I am surprised to hear it and will investigate the matter on foot of the Deputy's comments.  We need to encourage people in that regard as the primary objective is to try to reduce the amount of material being put into the black bin.  We have introduced the revised regime because there are four landfill sites in the country, but by the end of the year we will be down to three.  The very last option should be the placing of material in landfill sites.  Quite a lot of material is being placed in landfill sites that should never be placed in them.  Organic material should be a high priority in that regard.  I will look into the Deputy's point.</p> <p>  We have recycling ambassadors going door to door across the country, speaking to householders and giving them a magnetic list that can be placed on a fridge detailing what can be put into a recycling bin.  We are encouraging people to segregate waste properly.  That initiative also kicked off towards the back end of the year.  The pilot scheme was initially developed by Sligo County Council where it worked very well in bringing about the segregation of waste.  That is why it was rolled out nationwide.</p> <p>  Deputy Brian Stanley mentioned statistics and the household recycling rate going from 47% to 45%, but we hope the figure will rise again.  The Deputy is right in that the primary objective should be to try to reduce the generation of waste in the first place.  That is why last year we brought all of the retailers in the country together to look at ways in which we could reduce the amount of waste or packaging generated in the first place.  One of the first companies out of the block was Lidl which got rid of discounted rates for multiple purchases of fruit and vegetables which in many cases, unfortunately, ended up in either the black or brown bin.  Bread presents another big problem, although I know that it was in scarce supply last month.  We are trying to encourage people not to generate waste in the first place.  I attended the European Council of Ministers' meeting last Monday week and this was a discussion we had, both in public and private.  We considered how packaging and plastic waste, in particular, could be reduced.</p><p>It is an admirable goal that all plastic material will be recyclable by 2030, however, we need to focus on not generating it in the first place.  In advance of the crisis created by China's ban on plastic waste, I had written to the Commission on that point specifically.  </p><p> Deputy Dooley asked about the waste watchdog, the household waste price monitoring group.  This group was put in place to ensure there would not be price gouging when we made the transition from the flat rate system to the system based on use.  As members know, a range of usage systems have been put in place.  We were quite open to the type of systems that would be used.  There are approximately nine different types of usage systems in place across the country.  </p><p> There are 120 different price factors, service charge, lift charge, kilogram weight charge that were recorded in the latest report that was between November and December 2017, some 20 changes were made November and December, 12 had decreased and eight had increased.  One provider recorded a decrease in the service charge per months from &euro;17 to &euro;12 per month and decreased the per kilogram weight charge from 22 cent to 19 cent.  Other providers quoted lower lift charges, a reduction from &euro;12.80 in November to &euro;12.30 in December.  Some companies increased charges, one company had a service charge and charge per lift plus excess charge.  The quoted service charge went from &euro;4.14 to &euro;4.17, so there was a marginal increase.  On average there has been relative price stability since the price monitoring group started looking at charges last September.  All of the price monitoring group reports are available on line.  </p><p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Party had proposed regulation and at that time, I said that I was open minded.  I still remain open minded.  As members know the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is conducting a review of the industry and will complete it later this year.  I will act on its recommendations.  Let us wait and see what the CCPC recommends.  The CCPC did not participate in the watchdog because it was carrying out this review and felt to do so would compromise its position.  We have a good mix of consumer advocates on the monitoring group, and their output is fully transparent.</p><p> Deputy Stanley is correct on illegal dumping.  I believe that illegal dumping is both economic and environment treason.  That is why we have increased the funding to &euro;2 million for community groups that want to clean up blackspots around the country.  We are working with the local authorities in looking at innovative ways to monitor particular locations.  I hope we will secure prosecutions.  We are providing additional resources to the EPA and through the EPA to the local authorities to enforce the legislation in this area.  I have given additional powers to the regional waste management offices so that there are regional inspectors that can go along and deal with cross-county breaches in the legislation.  I will bring forward revisions in the legislation on littering.  I believe strongly that it is totally unacceptable to litter and dump waste.  I am open to new suggestions and ideas.</p><p> The closure of the Chinese market for waste has caused us a problem.  We are liaising quite closely with the waste sector and the waste regulatory authorities regarding the impact of these restrictions.  Basically China has closed its doors to recyclable material.  The vast majority of material that was generated in Europe, both paper and plastic was recycled in China.  It is possible to get other markets for some of this material but in order for us to obtain other markets, it must be clean recyclable material.  The problem arises because of what is presented in the green and blue bins at present.</p></speech>

It is important that householders would rinse out containers before they put them in the recycling bin and present cardboard that is clean.  The pizza boxes must now go into the brown bin and not the recycling bin.  There is a market for paper.  We do not have the paper mills or the plastic recycling facilities.  I had a very interesting discussion with two of my colleagues in Canada last week.  They have come up with some solutions to get around this.  We are exploring those.  There are companies looking at providing processing facilities in Ireland.  There are processing facilities available in eastern Europe and we are accessing some of them at present.  It appears that we must establish a more comprehensive network of processing facilities in Europe.  It is about reducing the waste and providing material for recycling in a clean manner and having outlets for it in Europe without having to export it to China.  China is still taking some material.  Other parts of Asia are taking clean material.</p></speech>

In 2017, income amounted to almost &euro;50 million but revenue is projected to reduce significantly in the coming years as proceeds from the levies are projected to decline.</p> <p>  The landfill levy is projected to decrease due to capacity constraints, the thermal treatment plant at Poolbeg, and the phasing out of flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection, which should lead to a significant reduction in the overall quantity of waste that households produce and improved recycling rates. </p> <p>  Revenue from the plastic bag levy has trended downwards for a number of years and this trend accelerated in 2016 and 2017 when a major national retailer ceased offering leviable bags.  The decline in levy revenues demonstrates the successful impact of the levies in modifying consumer behaviour to the benefit of environment.</p> <p>  The expenditure from the fund in 2018 is anticipated to be in the region of &euro;50 million, and allocations will be approved shortly.</p><p> In 2017, environment fund allocations totalling &euro;38.8 million were approved but the actual spend was &euro;33.97 million.  There was a surplus of &euro;15.96 million.  The money involved was spent on: schemes to prevent or reduce waste: waste recovery activities; research and development into waste management; the production, distribution and sale of products deemed to be less harmful to the environment than other similar products; the development of producer initiatives to reduce and prevent waste arising from their activities; the implementation of waste management plans; the enforcement of the provisions of any enactment relating to waste management prevention; the protection of the environment; partnership projects involving local authorities to improve the quality of the environment for particular local communities; the promotion of awareness of the need to protect the environment, including national and regional campaigns; the promotion and support of education and training to assist achievement of campaign objectives; resources, both human and material, to enable education and training to be carried out; initiatives undertaken by community groups and others for the protection of the environment; initiatives undertaken by international organisations and others for the protection of the environment and sustainable development; and such other purposes for the protection of the environment as would have been prescribed by way of regulation.  I will be making an announcement soon on the allocation for this year.</p></speech>

Weight Management Service at Temple Street Children's University Hospital, and its staff, we thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to present on the challenge of addressing childhood obesity.  Temple Street hospital, as a national acute paediatric hospital, sees up to 145,000 children per year, promotes healthy lifestyles for all children, which includes the prevention of overweight, obesity and dental decay and the promotion of a healthy diet, exercise and optimum dental health, in addition to treating multiple clinical conditions.</p> <p>  I am joined by representatives from the W82GO! multi-disciplinary team, namely, Dr. Sarah McGuire, senior clinical paediatric psychologist, Ms Nicola Sheridan, clinical specialist physiotherapist in paediatrics and Ms Michelle Strahan, senior medical social worker in child protection.</p> <p>  I will begin by contextualising our role in childhood obesity in Ireland and highlighting that we can represent only one small part of a larger discussion related to the complex social challenge of obesity in children.  As such, we will focus solely on the treatment of clinical obesity in children and adolescents and recommend that additional stakeholders are invited to present on other aspects related to this issue.</p> <p>  The W82GO! clinical service was established in Temple Street hospital 14 years ago and, as with many worthy endeavours, the initiative was commenced without dedicated clinical funding but survived on staff commitment and research funding from the Temple Street Foundation and the Health Research Board of Ireland.  Thereafter, temporary seed funding from the Health Service Executive was secured and service development was facilitated.</p> <p>  Since 2017, some funding has been provided by Temple Street hospital, thanks to the vision and growing understanding of the childhood obesity problem by the hospital's executive team.  This understanding is founded on scientific evidence, including some stark facts.  These include the fact that 20% of children and 25% of adolescents in Ireland are overweight or obese; the fact that children with obesity are at increased risk of health complications at an early age; the fact that admissions to UK paediatric hospitals for weight related issues have quadrupled over ten years; and the fact that children with obesity are more likely to develop serious adult diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and many cancers.</p> <p>  The most recent data from the Irish arm of the WHO childhood obesity surveillance initiative, COSI, study run by the national nutrition surveillance centre at UCD, reveal that the estimated number of primary school children with clinical obesity and morbid obesity is around 6.5%.  From Growing Up in Ireland data we know that, in addition, approximately 6% of 13 year olds have clinical obesity.  This means an estimated 80,000 children and adolescents in Ireland have clinical obesity.  The rates of clinical and morbid obesity are nearly double in schools with high levels of disadvantage.  This is particularly worrying because these children are even more at risk of morbid obesity and cardiovascular ill-health in adulthood.</p><p>In Ireland, those with clinical obesity can receive multidisciplinary treatment at Temple Street.  However, they currently have to wait nearly two and a half years to see the treatment team.  For adolescents who will age out of paediatric services, this is particularly unacceptable.</p><p> A multitude of comorbidities are associated with obesity.  An estimated three quarters of children will develop health complications at an early age, including physical and mental health complications.  In Temple Street, we are conscious of the impact of childhood obesity on families.  We approach this issue from the perspective that family re-education and support are essential elements in changing the eating and exercise patterns of our patients.  We are also conscious that this can be particularly difficult for families with financial challenges or who have complex social circumstances.  We work to support families to address issues that can cause barriers to the successful treatment in the child&rsquo;s home.</p><p> The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child demands that those who are already obese and who may have comorbidities must have access to early treatment in childhood in order to avoid progression of associated conditions.  The most recent estimate of the lifetime economic and health care costs incurred due to childhood obesity indicates that the amount involved is over &euro;4.5 billion.  Treatment needs to be available for all children when and where they need it.  Research tells us the intervening early and in a holistic manner is essential if we are to manage this condition.  A staged approach is recommended based around the needs of the child.</p><p> The children of Ireland urgently require timely access to treatment in primary, secondary and tertiary care.  At primary care level, GPs and public health nurses who are interested in this area must be provided with the appropriate resources to treat obesity including access to practice nurses and to the paediatric health and social care professionals, HSCPs, working in the community.  They often deliver the bulk of childhood obesity treatments.  In addition, public health nurses will be unable to identify and act for infants and young children at risk of obesity if they do not have funding and staff dedicated to the delivery of infant and child health.</p><p> At secondary care level, any child in Ireland suffering with the physical or mental health comorbidities of obesity needs timely access to a general paediatric service.  Areas with large populations - for example, surrounding the satellite centre currently being built at the Connolly Hospital site and the planned centre at the Tallaght hospital site - need integrated services which must be clearly planned and implemented in the children&rsquo;s hospital group as a matter of urgency.  Only then can we ensure better access for those most severe coming into tertiary services.</p><p> At tertiary care level, discussions on obesity service provision have commenced between the HSE and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, CHG.  However, transparent planning and implementation engaging all those involved in the care of these children is needed.  Of particular concern is the lack of health and social care professional involvement at executive level in the CHG.  This will no doubt have a direct impact on children with obesity whose care is, in the main, delivered by HSCPs.  New services at the new children&rsquo;s hospital will also need to plan for the inclusion of bariatric procedures in line with best practice guidelines for those adolescents most severely affected.  My colleagues will now update on our service in Temple Street and on progress to date in the area of childhood obesity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Sheridan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018032100002#J00200"><p>As previously highlighted by my colleague, our team in Temple Street treat children who are clinically obese.  To explain this further, the average nine year old in Ireland weighs 34 kg, that is 5 stone 5 lb.  The average nine year old attending our clinic is 55 kg, or 8 stone 9 lb.  In keeping with the ICGP and HSE algorithm for childhood obesity management, all the children referred to our centre are clinically obese.  In the past 14 years since inception, we have treated over 1,500 children with obesity.  Specifically, between 2014 and 2018 we have had over 4000 attendances.  In 2017, 49% of patients were aged under ten years, 29% were 11 to 13 years and 22% were 14 years or older.</p> <p>  Treatment is provided in line with current best practice guidelines and patients are offered group-based family treatment or individualised treatment, based on the health care needs of the child. Over the past four years, we have seen rates of non-attendances reduce and rates of attendance increase.  Providing services to children and adolescents presenting with a range of complications is challenging because 40% already have risk factors for heart disease, 17% meet the criteria for having the metabolic syndrome, 40% have significant and severe mental health problems, and 75% have experienced bullying, with 11% experiencing severe bullying.  Unfortunately, a number of the children seen have a history of self-harm or suicidal intent.  These children have complex needs and as we know from other EU experiences they require access to the paediatric specialties.  Over 40% are from deprived to severely deprived areas and rates of homelessness have become more common.  As such, we are seeing at first hand the effects of inequality on health outcomes for  these children.</p></speech>

In 2016, the Department of Health launched the obesity policy and action plan and the HSE established the healthy active living programme.  To address the needs of those already with obesity, in 2014 and 2015 we collaborated with the HSE to train community health professionals in obesity management and a pilot treatment intervention for children was delivered yielding useful information for future planning of services.  In 2017 the HSE appointed a clinical lead for obesity, Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea.  He has acknowledged the need to provide obesity services in the CHG.  There has been improved collaboration at Government level and in 2018 the Joint Committee on Education and Skills is convening to address the issue of obesity in children.  Further work is required, however.  For example, the CHG recognised obesity as an issue in paediatric health care in its 2016 operational plan.  However, to date, there have been no definite signals on whether or how the new children&rsquo;s hospital will provide the level of service currently available to those attending Temple Street.  The hospital will indeed be built according to bariatric specifications however the blueprints for the required clinical services are yet to be clarified.  In addition, community paediatric dietetic posts promised by the Government in 2013 have not yet fully materialised and GPs and public health nurses are not yet resourced to provide treatment at a primary care level.</p></speech>

We recommended invitations to key individuals including the HSE clinical lead for obesity, Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea, and Ms Sarah O&rsquo;Brien, the national lead for the healthy eating active living programme.  We also recommend invitations to representatives from: the CHG; the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute; the Institute of Community Health Nursing; the Psychological Society of Ireland; the Irish Society of Physiotherapists; the Irish Association of Social Workers; the Irish Institute of Public Health; and the Department of Education and Skills.  I think that reflects the complexity of this issue.  It is a whole societal approach.  It is important to hear from everybody.</p> <p>  The following initial steps are recommended by our team: the development of an implementation plan and evaluation framework for the provision of services to children and adolescents with clinical obesity throughout Ireland; securing sustainable Government funding for the provision of such a service; consistency in delivery of treatment services using service frameworks, referral pathways and professional, appropriately trained, staff with performance management and evaluation; and a review and standardisation of educational content pertaining to adult and child obesity in the undergraduate curricula of all health professional degree courses.  As outlined in the launch of Healthy Ireland, we would like to see a whole-system approach to improving population health.  While public health efforts will focus on population approaches, we need to start with the most vulnerable children who need timely access to clinical services now.</p></speech>

It is important that we started off with persons with a great deal of involvement dealing with the aftermath.

It takes time for professionals to develop an interest in a certain sector.  Demand is also an issue.  There are larger populations in Dublin or Cork.  As 6% of the national population are affected then only a small group of children, who are severely obese, will need this type of treatment.  The bulk of treatment and prevention must happen in community care.  In order to develop specialised management one needs numbers.  Like any centre of excellence around the country, one cannot develop experience without a throughput of patients.</p></speech>

Yes.</p> <p>  As a former Minister of State who had responsibility for research, I note the team has clinical leads and I seek to understand both the resourcing and the research element in this regard.  The W82GO! multidisciplinary team receives funding from the Temple Street Foundation and the HSE.  Have peer-reviewed research papers and outputs been produced?  Obviously the research is peer reviewed as Ms Sheridan has nodded her head.  I seek an insight into what is happening on the research side.  </p></speech>

From a research point of view, we have managed to establish a clinical service that is not burdened by research but which brings in additional funding to complement our work.  We are really committed to evidence-based practice.</p></speech>

Is the unit conducting live research into the types of children who attend in terms of demographics, backgrounds and the psycho-social elements?  Does all of that form part of the research?  There are short, medium and long-term effects.  I note that the unit is part of Growing Up in Ireland - National Longitudinal Study of Children.  Has the research and study had a bearing on the issue?  Fundamentally, this committee wants to find ways to stamp out obesity.  What tools are needed to tackle the problem?  To me, research is one element.  Obviously resources are required to be invested in the clinical area.  If I have read the situation correctly, there are not enough clinicians working in the sector as it is relatively new.  What can we do about that aspect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Grace O'Malley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018032100002#K01900"><p>Yes.  While my colleagues can also comment on this matter, at undergraduate curricula level there is very little education in this field.  Therefore, recently qualified health professionals have a pretty inadequate knowledge of this field because it is relatively new.  Without question, the curricula need to be examined.  Based on that, graduates will have scientific evidence because we know that the problem is far more complex than just eating too much.  We know there is a huge epigenetic component.  Epigenetics is like a light switch, by which I mean one has the ability to switch something on or off.  Let us say a person is predisposed to gaining weight and leads a lifestyle whereby he or she is very stressed, not sleeping and eating ultra processed foods.  That switch gets switched on and then he or she is more likely to become obese.  Conversely, if a person is predisposed to obesity but that light switch is kept turned off, he or she is less prone to develop obesity.</p></speech>

How do those facts present themselves?  I am open to hearing about this matter from other witnesses too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Sheridan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018032100002#K02100"><p>The first time that people meet clinicians is when they attend our intake unit.  In the past month, five children who have been in a homeless situation over the past three or four years have attended our unit.  Even though their parents were working, the family could not access cooking facilities and the children developed the habit of hoarding and hiding food because they felt insecure and stressed.  Another issue is that sometimes, due to the educational attainment of people who come from a deprived background, they do not understand the necessity for good quality food and leaning how to cook and so on.  Many cheaper food options are heavily marketed and are widely available to the extent that eating healthily is difficult to do.</p> <p>  Having safe places for children to play is another factor.  In many areas children do not feel that is safe to play outside of where they live.  When we asked them whether they play outside of their homes they told us they were scared to do so due to shootings on their road or because of a real fear of being shouted at and bullied.  It is no surprise then that children are afraid to play outside and their parents are afraid to let them do so.  When I was growing up I played outside in my area all of the time with my family, neighbours and friends.  When I asked some of the children who attend the unit whether they have played hopscotch, I was surprised to learn that they did not know what it was, which is sad.  While parents may know the value of play, there is fear.  In addition, people have busy lifestyles.</p></speech>

A hub-and-spoke model is usually recommended.  Under this model, there would be a tertiary centre that can provide bariatric procedures in the most severe cases and spokes coming out from that hub.  Thankfully, the UK's clinical excellence institute has already developed a whole framework.  The Deputy referred to data.  As part of the audit we do every year, we check how close to the standard we are and work with the business intelligence unit in the hospital in looking at the annual figures.  When we look at non-attendances, for example, we try to see how we can change the communication on the letters we write to parents to ensure they feel welcome to come to the hospital.  There is often an idea in health care that we should say "Tough - you are out the door" to those who do not attend.  We have a duty of care to the child.  If a parent is finding it difficult to attend, we must find out why that is the case and try to address those reasons.</p></speech>

We are okay at the moment.  There needs to be a plan in place for the new hospital that will be established when the hospitals amalgamate.  We need to have funding for a clinical lead - probably a paediatric endocrinologist - for the most severe children at the national children's hospital.  Funding will be needed for general paediatrics as well because we currently receive referrals from multiple consultants in the hospital.  All of this could be done through general paediatrics.  We are the health and social care professionals arm of a service which, in the new hospital, will also need to involve more nursing and dietetic hours as well as endocrinology hours and general paediatrics.</p></speech>

I thank her for the important work she does.  As the Chairman said, we have invited her in at the outset to highlight the seriousness of this problem.  I have felt for a number of years that I have been bashing my head off a brick wall in raising this issue.  It is starting to come into focus now.  I am grateful to the Chairman for putting it on the committee's agenda.  Dr. O'Malley has given us a list of organisations that should ideally attend the committee's hearings on this issue.  Perhaps we have already invited many of them.  I think the Irish College of General Practitioners needs to come before us.  Surely the introduction of free GP care for those under the age of six gives us an opportunity to track the likelihood of obesity arising in a child.  I understand that children are first weighed by GPs at the age of two.  Dr. O'Malley will correct me if I am wrong.  Does she think we need to face up to issues of societal embarrassment when we are dealing with families?  There is a reluctance to ascribe fault.  GPs should be able to tell parents that their children are becoming obese and that they need to do something about it.  A more mature approach to children's health needs to be taken at that stage in order to prevent them from being brought to Dr. O'Malley at a later stage.  Surely the fewer children she sees, the better.</p> <p>  As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I suggested that the assembly should prepare a report on this issue.  There is a lot of useful stuff in the report, which was published recently.  I am not sure whether my assistant sent it on.  The assembly usually confines its activities to Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales.  Representatives of those nations chat to one another about issues that affect them.  I argued that there was no point in talking to one another in this case because we do not know what to do where childhood obesity is concerned.  We decided instead to go to Amsterdam to examine the localised cross-departmental approach that has been adopted there.  Obviously, there is some childhood obesity in the Netherlands.  It is really interesting that local government has got involved in this issue in the Netherlands and I think we should look to mimic that approach.  The main point I took from our meetings is that patience is the big thing we need.  This problem did not develop overnight.  It will take a long time to sort it out.  Therefore, policymakers to be mindful of its gravity and complexity.  I am tired of listening to colleagues in the Seanad and elsewhere saying that children with childhood obesity are just fat and if they eat less, they will not be fat.  It is not that simple.  I am grateful that there are psychologists here who can speak to that.  I ask Dr. O'Malley to respond to the two points I have made.</p></speech>

The HSE's "Make Every Contact Count" initiative is definitely a welcome one.  It would be interesting to examine how GPs are resourced in the Netherlands by comparison with Ireland.  As far as I am aware, the current contracts here do not provide for any treatment.  That definitely has to be looked at.  We cannot expect primary care practitioners to deliver treatment when they are not paid to do so.  These patients definitely need to be treated by GPs and public health nurses, but the resourcing to facilitate this has to be guaranteed.  There is no point in a family picking up the courage to go to see a GP who might not attach any priority to a patient in respect of whom he or she is not able to be paid.  If a family gets a negative response or is not treated with the same dignity or respect that another patient would be treated with, there will be a reduction in that family's interest in attending again.  The Senator has mentioned stigmatisation, which is a huge issue.  Dr. McGuire will probably want to speak about this.  We have done a lot of work on stigmatisation across all of our society, including the Government and the media.  We need to have stricter rules on bullying people who are of a different shape.  We have rules and laws that prohibit bullying based on gender, race and sexual preference, but nothing of that kind applies to body shape.  To me and to my team, it is unacceptable that somebody of a certain shape should be bullied and stigmatised.</p></speech>

The families we see tend to have huge psychosocial issues and financial pressures.  Improvements in areas like childhood poverty and family finances would help families to make some of the changes they need to make.  I reiterate that this is a hugely complex issue.</p></speech>

There is a significant psychological element to this issue.  Obesity can affect a child regardless of the family from which he or she comes.  People say that it is the responsibility of the parents.  As I know, one can have the best parents in the world but still end up with this problem.  Sometimes it becomes an issue before parents realise it is happening.  It is very difficult to know what to do at that point because if one clamps down hard, one could potentially give one's child many other issues.  The child could become anorexic or bulimic.  It is a very delicate balance for a parent.</p></speech>

It is hugely complex for families, especially if there are financial stressors on top of that.  If a family that is struggling to pay the rent or to meet the cost of healthy eating manages to get a referral to a tertiary service like the one we provide, or an appointment in Temple Street, can it afford to pay to get a train to Dublin to attend such groups?  Basic factors like that make things much more complicated for families.</p></speech>

In the case of a child on the more severe end of the scale, there may be parental mental health issues which may or may not be dealt with.  The parent may not be accessing services and the child will often have a mental health issue as a result.  This may not be a priority for the child and adolescent mental health services because it may not reach a threshold at which it will be deemed a priority.  Because of these issues, however, such children may not be going to school.  Educational achievement is incredibly important for health outcomes in the long run.</p> <p>  We see that kind of mix from a mental health point of view.  From a physical health point of view, our general understanding of this issue is "move more, eat less".  However, these kids will experience pain, so they are not able to exercise.  As they may not be confident moving or competent in their motor skill, they are not the kids who want to join sports.  They will be sidelined at PE or, depending on the ethos of the school, they may not be encouraged to participate because they do not achieve well in movement and games.</p> <p>  As human beings, we all know that food has a multitude of uses for us.  We use it to nourish ourselves to help ourselves grow but we also use it to soothe ourselves.  If a child grows up in an environment where food is used as a reward or where it is used to sedate or placate, a cycle is set up very early.  As a society, we still think very simplistically about obesity.  The new Horizon 2020 research call includes funding in the area of endocrine disruptors.  There are huge issues around pollution, which can disrupt how hormones work within the body.  Water pollution, air pollution and plastics within our food system can affect us.  The same is true of ultra-processed foods.  It is like climate change.  The child or adult is a physical manifestation of the environment in which he or she is living.  This does not just include the family home.  It pertains to people's own biology, the family home and the society they are living in. </p></speech>

We will have a lot of these people before the committee.  In advance of that, I am interested in Dr. O'Malley's perception of their role in this regard.  I did some research on the deals available in supermarkets and how likely they are to drive consumer purchasing.  Does Dr. O'Malley have any comments to make on that area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Grace O'Malley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018032100002#M00800"><p>Unfortunately, our senior dietician could not join us today.  I am sure she would have some really interesting observations from a dietetic point of view.  As part of our treatment, the dietician leads a supermarket trip where she brings families to the supermarket to learn how to read food labels and how to shop.  We take it for granted.  Speaking for myself, if we grow up with a privileged middle-class lifestyle, we do not really appreciate the skills we glean by osmosis when surrounded by capable, skilled parents.  There is definitely an issue around the promotion of unhealthy ultra-processed products.  The sugar tax is definitely going to help that, but we need to evaluate how promotions change within supermarkets.  As the cost of one beverage goes up, are they promoted differently?  We must also examine how they are marketed.  The Sydney principles call for the regulation of food marketing to children but we have not been very good about moving on that in Ireland.  The Irish Heart Foundation, whose representatives the committee will hopefully invite, has done a lot of work around online advertising, which is hugely important.</p> <p>  In the realm of technology, retail stores are now using really pervasive techniques to draw people into the retail environment.  Because the child is not really protected in the online world, there is even more vigorous marketing towards children.  There is a big difference between different supermarkets.  Some are much better at providing a balance between healthy foods and ultra-processed foods, but when one walks into some corner stores and local shops, one is confronted solely by ultra-processed food.  That has to be addressed.  </p></speech>

Obviously its efficacy remains to be seen.  Does she think we need to have a sugar tax on more of the items available in shops?  Experts have said that if there is one item we should tax, it would be sugar-sweetened drinks.  The big effect of that, even in advance of the tax's implementation, is the reformulation.  A lot less sugar is going into foods because at the end of the day, these companies want to sell their products.  It is all about profits.  At the same time, there are still super-sugary milk drinks.  God forbid we touch the dairy industry in Ireland but where do we go with this?  As policy makers and regulators, there is only so much we can do without creating a complete nanny state.</p></speech>

We have to let that embed and must evaluate it.  We do need a process by which to evaluate that sugar tax.  Evidence shows that consumption can be affected by putting a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.  It is important to evaluate how that affects the economy and how it affects attitudes.  As Senator Noone mentioned, reformulation has already started.  That is a huge success already.  Even before a tax take, we have seen a change in behaviour by industry, which would not have happened had the Government not given a strong signal.  With regard to taxing other foods, we have to give this enough time to embed and evaluate it, to look at evidence internationally and see where we are going but that is a really positive sign.  It is a brave step.</p></speech>

She has been really active in advocating for liquid sugar reductions.  We know that dental caries have increased.  Separate to any influence on weight, having sugar-sweetened beverages will increase dental caries.  The UK ran a study last year with the World Health Organization, WHO, examining sugar limits.  The current guidelines are already too high to try to address.  In the UK National Health Service, NHS, dental caries is one of the highest cost burdens.  For the reduction in dental caries alone, forgetting about the long-term effect on weight, the sugar tax will be positive.  However, we have to be able to evaluate that.</p></speech>

That depends on where they live, the age of the child and how the child and the parents are functioning.  If they are able to work in a group dynamic, we encourage that because we get a peer effect.  It is really helpful for parents to learn from one another and the teenagers and children learn from one another.  <br/><br/>For 60% of our patient population, we see them in one to one clinics.  That is more of a traditional outpatient clinic.  The child first comes to the hospital and is seen by a consultant paediatrician, an endocrinologist or another medical consultant.  The consultant then refers the patient to us and we see him or her in an assessment clinic.  Such children will have screening from a physiotherapist, a dietician, and a psychologist.  We very much believe in holistic assessment in order that we can really try to unpick what is the factor for this family that is important.  Our treatment comes out of that.<b></b>Sometimes the child is eating very well and the family is fully educated on how to eat well but there may be an issue around sleep, there could be real stressors in the family and it may be an issue that is for a psychologist or for mental health.  Very rarely there are genetic conditions but that is dealt with in a different situation.  At other times, it is more of a social problem and we have to try to link in.  My colleagues, Dr. Sarah McGuire and Ms Michelle Strahan will speak on how we link in with other community supports.  There is no step-down service for a child with obesity.<br/><br/>There is a wonderful team working in Tallaght community and we can refer patients to them, if the child lives in that area.  That is the problem with community services.  One has to come from that community to access services in the community.  There may be dieticians working in areas around the country but there is no standardised acceptance of referrals.  Unfortunately the paediatric dieticians are under such pressure that they have to prioritise children who are peg fed, that is, where the child is fed through a tube in their stomach.  If those children have complex disabilities they will be seen before children with obesity because there simply are not enough posts.</p></speech>

We make referrals to Tusla if we feel there is a risk to the child's welfare in the future.  Sometimes we can link them in with some additional services as a result of that, for example a family support service.  That is usually when there are other issues going on in the family as well.  It is not just that we can refer on to them as a follow up.</p></speech>

We have some provision for one-to-one psychology if it is related to emotional eating or directly related to a barrier to making positive lifestyle change.  If the issue is primarily mental health, we would be referring the child to the local child and adolescent mental health service.  Access to that service is dependent on the waiting list.</p> <p>  Children who have a history of self-harm or suicidal intent are more adequately placed in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Consequently, we sometimes must conduct a review and refer them on to CAMHS, requesting an urgent appointment.  Access to those services is all determined by waiting lists as well.</p></speech>

We can refer to those when they are accepted.  The administrative time it takes to figure out what is available in every community in the country is really difficult.  It would be really helpful for teams like ours that operate out of one site if there could be a national database of what is available, where it is located and the acceptance criteria to get on a programme.</p></speech>

I may have a tiny bit of silver lining.  We often see after group, that children who hate PE and physical activity get the confidence to move.  They become involved in groups locally.  It might be that they go back to a team sport, which is less likely, but they often get involved in activities such as swimming, boxing or a teen gym because this is the first time they have ever had a positive physical activity experience where they are exercising together with people who are the same as them.  There is no bullying, they are enjoying the experience and they can see the positivity of physical activity.  That can take them into the community to an extent.</p></speech>

I am coming to this issue from a mental health background.  The witnesses mentioned co-morbidity.  I am doing work on co-morbidity, be it alcohol or substance misuse and mental health issues.  That would be the first focus in respect of what the witnesses mentioned about co-morbidity and what they would see as a solution to tackle it.  From what the witnesses have said, these unfortunate patients may be falling between two stools.  The same is happening with the mental health and addiction services.  There are movements within the Government to address that.  I seek a comment from the witnesses on that because it might be a way to highlight this issue, as well as other eating disorders.  We tend not to think of obesity falling into the category of anorexia or bulimia.  If I am using the wrong terminology, excuse my ignorance.</p> <p>  May I clarify whether the witnesses mentioned that approximately 40% come from the lower socio-economic background?  </p></speech>

Will they outline the top three or four reasons why this is such a phenomenon now, as opposed to years ago?  </p> <p>  From the witnesses' experience in other jurisdictions where they have a sugar tax, do manufacturers actually alter their products by deviating from sugar but using alternative products that may be as damaging?</p> <p>  The witnesses have spoken about people who have issues with body image  How much does the body image on social media play a part in this and can they give me an outline of what is involved?</p></speech>

It is very complex.  The children we see present also with a lot of internalising problems.  They may have anxiety, for example, or become very withdrawn.</p><p>Sometimes they might refuse to attend school or leisure activities that they once loved.  As much as 75% of that population experience some form of bullying with 10% of that being very severe, which has a huge impact on self-esteem.  It is very difficult for families to be armed with education but then be expected to manage all of these issues.  Parents are tasked with supporting those issues as well.  They have a huge role to play in managing those issues and spearheading some of the management at home.  That is why the unit is more family orientated and parents attend as well.  Children with low self-esteem and maybe suffering anxiety too cannot be expected to run with all of this matter.  There is an onus placed on parents to support their children throughout the process.   </p></speech>

First, I shall outline the physical comorbidities that go with obesity.  Amazingly, the human body is able to store fat in every cell of the body, which is why the human race has survived so long.  Unfortunately, it means that every organ of the body is affected by obesity.  Unlike most other conditions, with obesity children and adults present with multiple comorbidities.  In other words, heart problems, breathing problems, liver problems and mental health problems, which increases the complexity of the condition.</p> <p>  Second, there are social comorbidities that go with deprivation.  We have encountered homelessness, parental anxiety, depression, financial distress, and sometimes substance abuse, and also unsafe neighbourhoods.  There is a huge difference if a child grows up in a deprived area in Ireland.  For example, advertisements and the food environment seem to be quite different.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the no-fry zone.  The call to limit fastfood outlets in areas of high socio-economic status is different from people who do not have as much of a voice in the public forum and where there is a greater density of fastfood outlines in lower socio-economic areas.  The issue must be addressed by planners using a whole-of-government approach.  The EU is considering the matter and it is an issue for all of Europe.</p> <p>  Community supports and mental health services have been mentioned.  Understanding what the acceptance criteria of these services are is really important.  Why do some services accept children with certain conditions but some will not even though they all receive funding from the public purse?  We believe that every child needs to be able to access a service.  Of course we accept that there must be prioritisation.  If professionals have not been trained in a certain area, such as mental health services and obesity, then it must be acknowledged that the professionals need training and, importantly, such training must be provided.</p> <p>  In terms of determining the percentage of obese children who come from low socio-economic status, it is very hard to collect the data in a hospital.  The only data that we have access to is the child's address, whether the child attends a DEIS school and, perhaps, whether he or she has private health insurance or a medical card.  Collecting the data is not as easy as saying we think it is a certain percentage.  Without questions around parental educational attainment, maternal educational attainment and income, it is very hard to get good data.  We can use small area research unit data, based on the child's address, of whether he or she is from an area of disadvantage.  We have stated that the percentage is in or around 40% but we extrapolated the figure from data that is four or five years old.  The percentage may now be higher.  </p></speech>

Let us consider national representative data such as Growing Up in Ireland - National Longitudinal Study of Children or the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative, COSI.  That data is representative data for the whole population and is, therefore, more accurate.  It shows that children who attend DEIS schools are twice as likely to be obese.  The W82GO! unit only sees the children who have been referred to us and the ones that come straight to the unit.  If we have referrals of more children who live in a more deprived situation then they may be the ones that cannot come to the hospital and, therefore, do not attend.  We can only comment on who we see.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the fact that obesity has increased over the years.  Without question, the food environment has changed in the past 20 years.  I do not think anybody would disagree with such a view.  More ultra processed foods are available and marketed, particularly to vulnerable groups such as children.  Sadly, children are considered to be a vulnerable group.  Also, physical activity has decreased throughout our society.  In terms of running, there is more litigation in schools.  The matter must be considered.  One cannot have a situation where children are not allowed to run about during break time at their schools due to a fear of litigation.  Internationally, there is a sleep debt.  It has been discovered that people sleep two hours less now compared with 50 years ago.  A proper amount of sleep is important if one wants to manage hormones that affect weight.  Children sleep less due their use of technology.  I know that some Oireachtas committees have recently discussed technology usage by children.  It is important that all of us switch off our mobile telephones at night in order to protect our health.  There are more online advertisements, and people spend more time online and have more screen time.  All of these issues feed into how bodies gain weight.  Social media is another issue.   </p></speech>

The stigma still exists and is very prevalent.  Do the witnesses believe the stigma associated with obesity is greater than that associated with mental health?</p></speech>

It occurs to me as someone who will go through this process with his colleagues over the next number of months - it could be six or seven months and well into the autumn before we complete it - that, when trying to figure out how to approach it and what the best model would be, there are three or four main themes, those being, food intake and education, psychology, and health, exercise and activity.  If the witnesses put themselves in our shoes for a moment, how would they approach it?  From my perspective, it is not just about physical activity, although that is an important aspect.  A fear of litigation was mentioned.  That situation is crazy.  While I was in a primary school in my constituency not that long ago, I heard a teacher roaring "stop running" as I walked through the yard.  I wondered why anyone would stop a child running.  I would not mind, but it was on grass.  I thought it might be the small break and the school had that element of discipline so I did not interfere, but it appeared strange.  I did not remember it happening in my yard.  I still have some of the scars on my knees from my old school yard.</p> <p>  This is an issue with which we need to try to get to grips.  We must try to break the cycle of screen time and the other elements that the committee discussed in our previous reporting.</p> <p>  On the healthy eating side, ease of access to foodstuffs that are saturated in fat, sugar or worse is an issue.  I noted the interesting discussion between Senators Noone and Reilly and Deputy Neville on sugar tax and its effectiveness.  I was always concerned that a sugar tax might have a detrimental effect on certain socioeconomic groupings.  That remains to be borne out, but it is positive to see the industry taking the initiative and opting for drinks that are less sugar sweetened.  Senator Noone has done considerable work in that regard, at least from the perspective of public perception.  It is noted and appreciated.</p> <p>  The other side of the situation is the question of psychological issues with food and food intake, be those relating to bullying, the body image issues that Deputy Neville alluded to or a failure to parent, which might be an abuse in itself or a result of abuse or lack of knowledge about how to parent in respect of food intake.  There are multiple strands.</p> <p>  If the witnesses were involved in the process that we are going through, what steps would they take?  Would they follow this thematic approach?  Do they have suggestions?</p></speech>

That is important for implementation.  The committee should link with the European Association for the Study of Obesity and the World Obesity Federation, which have considerable European and international experience of what are the low-hanging fruit that governments can pick.  It can seem like there is too much to do.</p> <p>  Prevention and treatment must go together.  We must look after children who are already obese and give them what they need to prevent progression.  These are the kids with a red flag over their heads who will cost the health service more.  There must also be prevention efforts.  I agree with a sugar tax, but the provision of water is a significant factor and is included in the obesity policy.  There should be an option in schools to drink from water fountains and to make that the norm.  Often, we meet families for which the idea of drinking water is-----</p></speech>

They think that water is from the toilet.  I have had children say that.  Their understanding of water as a drink is not there.</p> <p>  The Government's approach to transport is important.  Neighbourhoods could have walking school buses that facilitate walking to school.  Online advertising is a major issue, and with the GDPR coming into force in May, the Government must be courageous on this front and protect people, particularly those under 18 years of age.  As we discussed with Deputy Neville, planning is a further issue.  We must ensure that we are not adding consistently to a food environment that encourages obesity.</p> <p>  When these legislative pieces are in place, industry will respond like it did with the sugar tax.  There are many aspects of the food industry that are positive.  For example, Ireland's fruit and vegetable growers are among the best in the world and there is a significant opportunity for them to tap into this market and encourage whole foods.</p> <p>  There is a large amount of data on what is the best approach to take initially.  The Health Research Board-sponsored Centre for Health and Diet Research between UCC and UCD would be delighted to present its evidence to the committee, as would the Institute of Public Health in Ireland.</p></speech>

I presume that would be co-ordinated by the HSE.  I cannot identify them, as I do not have a grip of the level of services across the regions, but I know of certain facilities that are available locally.  Given the proximity to Dublin and Temple Street Children's University Hospital, we are fortunate to have that type of service available to us on our doorstep, albeit with significant waiting lists.</p> <p>  Regarding the proliferation of the types of service that will be required in future, the witnesses referred to the - I will not say "slow" - gradual process of eliciting interest in a subject matter such as this and how that might pose issues in terms of recognising if we are at epidemic levels or whether that is just a phrase used in the media.  Maybe we are.  We must qualify what an epidemic is and its significance in terms of its effects across the board on the State's ability to provide the level of medical and other care that is necessary.  Are the witnesses aware of any programme whereby the State is in the process of providing the level of service that is required within each geographic district of the HSE?  Has there been any call for the provision of the types of service that the witnesses would view as basic for children and young adults in particular, but also for their parents?  One usually follows the other.</p> <p>  My final question is a societal one.  The point about there being less tolerance in a nanny state was made.  I see that in virtually every aspect of what I do.  In the 15 years I have been doing this, people's traditional expectations of the services provided versus what is now the norm have graduated to the point of disbelief on my part.  Is there a clinical way that this can be dealt with at the point of a young child's entry into the witnesses' facility?  How would they tackle that?  What level of involvement would they have with the child's parent?  For example, would they tell him or her to say "No"?</p> <p>  This is a broad subject matter.  I began looking at it and reading about it a month or so ago.  I thought I could be reading for a month.  The question of how to tackle it is important.</p><p>I have certainly gained a lot of insight.  The opening statement and remarks have been incredibly useful.  </p></speech>

We do not have a database.  Investment in technology in the health service is very limited.  Going towards the new children's hospital, it would be a very opportune time to develop a database that could be used and that could also link in with GPs.  It is a huge ask technically because we then need unique identifiers.  Trying to get that sorted has been challenging.  We need a database as we would for rare conditions or infant deaths.  In 2014 and 2015, we were involved with the HSE in training community practitioners in four areas of the country.  It was a pilot initiative to see whether we could work with some community health care professionals to provide services locally.  It was a really interesting project.  We were very much operating on a wing and a prayer.  It did not involve a huge amount of planning or communication around how we might get the best outputs from it but the community teams were really wonderful.  They were very committed and we did our best to try and set up a system of sorts.  What came out of that was some really valuable information about understanding the community and working with it before trying to say "do it this way" and understanding the needs of that community.  From that work, we have a template on how we might go further.  In 2014 and 2015, the Government and the HSE did commit some funding to experiment a bit.  We got a lot of learning from that and we can build on that for a hub and bespoke model or to improve community services in the future.</p> <p>  Failure to parent was mentioned.  We very rarely see a failure to parent.  It is usually around capacity issues or opportunities for parents to parent because often both parents are working shift work and there is very little time when the parents are actually in the home in many cases.  We very much work with parents.  From a young age, we are working with parents and linking parents in with parenting programmes around how to say "No" and behaviour.  Dr. McGuire will probably have more to say.  </p></speech>

Tackling this can be very overwhelming.  A lot of the work we do involves supporting them to set smaller goals that are reachable and the inherent reinforcement that comes from reaching the goal allows the children to make progress in modelling that within the house.  Maybe they have to make systemic changes in the house such as not bringing in treats.  It becomes about the whole family as opposed to just the one person.  Families tend to need support with that even to get started initially.  When they come to the initial group, they are able to go away and put in some of those changes but they do need support around it in respect of getting started, keeping that motivation going and setting realistic goals.</p></speech>

I got an award recently for being Queen Nanny from a smoking group and actually turned up to receive it.  I am all for whatever measures need to be put in place.  There is a fine line between us actually taking over the parenting of children as a Government.  Once a child is obese, it will be an issue for them in the vast majority of cases.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Malley is the expert but I would say that once those fat cells are created, the person is constantly fighting that.  They are fighting their body's wish to get back to what it was.  I have heard Professor Donal O'Shea talk about the body's memory and wanting to get back to that space.  It is clearly so important that we deal with this.  Bariatric surgery is a big issue for the witnesses.  Am I missing something?  How short-sighted is it that we do not take care of these more quickly so that they do not cost the State much more in the long term?  Can the witnesses explain something?  Am I missing something?  Who is missing something here?</p></speech>

We, as policy makers, are conscious of both children and adults and how an obese child can end up an obese adult; even if their mother is obese when she pregnant, there is a high likelihood that the child will be obese.

On a positive note, one thing we got from Amsterdam was that it got these bottles, got children to design engraving and made drinking water cool rather than just acceptable or knowledgeable.  Drinking water has become cool because they have these special bottles.  If as a society, we work on all the little things, eventually, with a lot of patience and hard work, this issue might start to reduce rather than increase.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Mark Murphy and Dr. John O'Brien from the ICGP, Professor Mary Horgan from the RCPI and Professor Tom Fahey from the RCSI.</p><p>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are thereafter only entitled to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I also advise the witnesses that any opening statements they have made to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We will now accept the opening statements, starting with Professor Tom Fahey.</p></speech>

To provide the committee with some background, I am a clinically and research-active GP who trained in epidemiology and public health.  I have been based in the UK for 14 years, working in Oxford, Bristol and latterly Dundee.  Since returning to the RCSI in 2006, I have led the Centre for Primary Care Research, which is nationally funded by the Health Research Board, HRB.  To give the committee a brief idea of what we have done in that time, our research group is active in the area of prescription medicines and drug safety.  We work with colleagues in the school of pharmacy in Queen's University Belfast, and this has enabled us to examine the quality and safety of prescribing in Ireland both North and South and to benchmark Irish prescribing practice to other countries.</p> <p>  The current challenges in Ireland are that prescribing in many hospitals remains a paper-based activity; communication regarding medication for patients between hospitals, general practice and pharmacy is also predominantly paper-based.  This means that transcription, dosage and monitoring errors are more common and patients are at greater risk of adverse drug events.  Electronic prescribing and dispensing are the standard in general practice and pharmacy practice, but electronic prescribing and dispensing systems do not interact effectively, meaning the process of prescribing and dispensing is disjointed and poorly integrated across the health sectors.  Lastly, access to prescribing data for research, education and quality improvement purposes is very limited in Ireland.  The solution to all these issues is to develop an e-prescribing platform in Ireland with appropriate training and education for all health professionals involved in prescribing.  Enhanced transparency in respect of prescribing practice will enable a culture of professional reflection and engagement with nationally established quality improvement initiatives, such as the medicines management programme.</p></speech>

The college is committed to helping doctors to enhance their skills, competencies and professionalism throughout their working lives.  The RCPI includes six of the 13 postgraduate medical training bodies, including the faculty of occupational medicine, the faculty of paediatrics, the faculty of pathology, the faculty of public health medicine, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Irish committee on higher medical training, which includes medicine.  It also has two joint faculties, namely, the joint faculty of intensive care medicine of Ireland with the College of Anaesthetists of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the faculty of sports and exercise medicine, which is a joint faculty with the RCSI.  The college also provides lifelong learning and continuous professional development for members and allied health care professionals.  The RCPI leads 20 ground-breaking national clinical programmes in conjunction with the HSE that are helping to transform health care in Ireland.  The college is also a passionate advocate to improve the health of the nation.<br/><br/><b></b>As for medical training and education, the prescribing of medicines is a fundamental part of the interaction between doctors and patients and is an integral part of the postgraduate medical training programmes and continuous professional development courses provided by the RCPI.  Every year, the RCPI delivers over 200 courses to approximately 7,000 participants to equip health care professionals with the skills to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving society.  As a college, our objective is to deliver world-class specialist training to the 1,200 doctors in our basic and higher postgraduate medical training programmes across all the specialties alluded to above, which are in the main delivered in hospitals across Ireland.  As these trainees are responsible for a substantial amount of prescriptions given to patients in hospitals, it is fundamental that they are equipped with the knowledge and skills to do this safely and effectively.  All of our courses on safe prescribing are mandatory for doctors in our basic specialist training programmes, which is a programme just after intern year.  They include awareness of prescription pattern monitoring and the audit of usage and effectiveness trends for prescribed medications and the economics of prescribing.  All the doctors who come to the RCPI already will have some knowledge of prescribing as it falls within the remit of undergraduate medical schools.  As I have just completed a term as dean of the medical school in University College Cork, UCC, I am aware of this. <br/><br/>In our basic specialist training programmes, safe prescribing is embedded in our curriculum and focuses on prescribing in various medical speciality areas such as obstetrics and gynaecology, general internal medicine and paediatrics.  We also deliver a clinical pharmacology training programme for a small number of specialist doctors at a higher level.  Our courses are designed to support doctors to prescribe the right dose of the right drug for the right diagnosis to the right patient at the right time.  Trainees learn about the elements of safe and appropriate prescribing, adverse drug reactions and to how report them to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, risk management and legislation related to prescribing in Ireland.  A mandatory course has also been developed for doctors in haematology and oncology that covers the essentials of chemotherapy.  Doctors learn about the essentials of chemotherapy, including classification of chemotherapeutic agents, the principles of chemotherapy, standards and the mechanics of chemotherapy and common supportive medications, pharmaeconomics, which is very important, and drug access.  In addition to safe prescribing, trainees are taught to help to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.  I am an infectious disease physician and this is a particularly challenging area of our job in hospital-based medicine.</p><p>Antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed drugs and our course outlines the general principles regarding antibiotic prescribing, the mechanism of action and spectrum of activity of commonly prescribed antibiotic, the rates of antibiotic resistance in Ireland and key aspects relating to antibiotic stewardship.  This online course is approved by the national hospital antibiotic stewardship committee.  Value for money and efficiencies are addressed through an online introduction to the health economics landscape in Ireland that focuses on health service funding models, equity, cost effectiveness analysis and health technology assessments.  These courses have all recently been reviewed and updated and are generally updated every three to five years.  RCPI is committed to providing world class postgraduate medical training and education for the next generation of specialists and will continue to explore how to enhance this experience in all areas, including prescribing of medicine.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032100002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their invitation to the ICGP to discuss prescription pattern monitoring and the audit of usage and effectiveness trends for prescribed medications.  We intend to split our five minute opening statement into several sections and I will begin.</p> <p>  To provide some context, there is a rising prevalence of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity in Irish society and while this is not currently reflected in the new GP contract, we hope that it will be soon.  This increased prevalence coupled with the fact that we have an ageing population means that we have seen a rise in the number of dispensed items and in the cost of medications in the annual health budget.  Our submission outlines in detail the expenditure on pharmaceutical products but in summary, we spend approximately &euro;2 billion on pharmaceutical products per year.  That money comes exclusively from the community budget, even if the product is prescribed in a hospital setting.  In contrast to our drug budget, Irish general practice is extremely poorly resourced.  We spend less than 4.5% of our overall health care budget on general practice.  At a time when GP led, community oriented health care should have happened, we have seen a massive retraction in GP funding and in the time we have with each patient.  The FEMPI cuts are still imposed on general practice, which limits time for patient care.  We work off a 40 year old contract and have severe capacity restraints, with the lowest number of GPs per head of population in Europe.  We are also seeing an exodus of our GP graduates.</p> <p>  I will now provide some context for how repeat prescribing works.  In the context of acute consultations, it is estimated that two out of every three will result in an acute prescription but GPs manage the repeat prescribing.  All of the repeat prescriptions that are issued in pharmacies are delivered by GPs.  We might issue a repeat script every three to six months but this can be more frequent if there is a clinical need.  While the GP takes the responsibility and assumes the risk for repeat prescribing, the GP may not have been the original prescribing doctor.  If a drug is initiated in hospital, the GP transcribes that prescription to a GMS script for a GMS eligible patient.</p> <p>  The ICGP supports evidence based and cost effective treatments in the Irish health care setting, including prescriptions.  The ICGP also supports initiatives from the medicines management programme to support effective prescribing.  Opportunity costs are evident throughout the health care system, whereby we spend money on low value products with limited benefit and excessive costs which results in other areas of our public health care system being under funded. </p> <p>  Finally, with respect to evidence of trends, from a general perspective raw data from the annual Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, statistical analysis is very helpful but we must remember that it is raw.  I point committee members to the work of the department of general practice staff of the Royal College of Surgeons, where I also work.  Professor Tom Fahey and Dr. Frank Moriarty have published research in this area which shows that from 1997 to 2012, there has been a massive increase in prescribing.  The prescribing of ten or more drugs for over 65s in 1997 stood at 2% but by 2012 this had increased to 22%.  Prescribing has increased massively and we must ask if this is appropriate.  The Health Research Board has examined this and found that the odds of what is called "potentially inappropriate" prescribing in 2012 compared to 1997 have reduced by 60%.</p><p>GPs and hospitals are prescribing more medications for an ageing, more complex and more multimorbid population but they are doing a better job at it.  Our submission also outlines valuable research from other cohort studies, such as the Irish longitudinal study on ageing.  That has shown that we can save more than &euro;150 million each year if we introduce a system of reference pricing.</p><p> Finally, I will address the prescription of benzodiazepines, anti-depressants, opioids and antibiotics.  These are high-profile, topical drugs.  We can discuss this in the questions-and-answers session but I will discuss anti-depressants as an example.  In 2016, we spent more than &euro;40 million on anti-depressants.  To put that in context, we spent only &euro;10 million on counselling in primary care.  All evidence suggests that GPs are prescribing very appropriately in the context of a severe capacity shortage in general practice and primary care.  Our prescribing of anti-depressants largely reflects a lack of psychological therapies and a lack of social therapies to deal with issues including isolation, fragmented communities and austerity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032100002#L00200"><p>What can we do about it?  It is pivotal that GPs are provided with sufficient time and resources to enable shared discussion on medicines management.  We need to address the challenge of medicines reconciliation across health interfaces and promote electronic discharges to reduce error and improve quality.  The role of clinical pharmacists in the general practice team or in a nursing home setting should be explored albeit as part of a new GP contract.  Monitoring and audit of prescribing, if done correctly, has the potential to be an extremely powerful tool for GPs in their ongoing efforts to deliver the very best care for their patients.</p> <p>  Research and audit needs to be actively supported and promoted at the highest level.  We need to be careful when comparing raw prescribing data from individuals with national standards.  We need to take account of confounders such as poverty and deprivation or conditions such as multimorbidity and depression.  Continuous medical education has seen a curtailment in funding in recent years and this needs to be reversed.  Pharmaceutical advertising in the national media indirectly promoting certain products has been an unwelcome development in recent years.  This should come under legislative control, as GPs are encountering demand for drugs and services which have dubious cost-benefit.  This committee should endorse a recommendation for a ban on non-governmental health care advertising, especially the indirect promotion of drugs in the media.</p> <p>  GPs need time to deal with complex cases.  This will require a modern GP contract that facilitates the management of chronic conditions and medication management.  Before this, there is need for the urgent reversal of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, provisions, which have curtailed the ability of general practices to grow at a time when GP services should be expanding in the light of multimorbidity, ageing and increased numbers.  We also need to retain our brightest and best GPs.  Some 20% leave the country.  They see other health care systems as a preferable career option.  The ICGP is becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of Government action on these key matters. </p> <p>  We need to direct any savings that we make in drug prescribing back into general practice to reinforce a cycle that is to the benefit of the patient and of the health system more widely.  A medicines management programme, led by GPs, needs to be created as part of the new contract.  The ICGP is willing to continue to work and collaborate with the HSE and educational bodies to promote cost-effective, evidence-based prescribing.  Sometimes collaboration has not happened.  An example would be online ratification for the issuing of certain drugs, which is time-consuming and often quite complicated.  This has disenfranchised and increased frustration among GPs as they try to deliver care.  Prescribing trends can only be identified through research and audit.  Academic career structures for GPs have not been sufficiently facilitated by the HSE or the Department of Health.</p><p>Similarly, research on our electronic health records is underdeveloped in the Irish setting - I refer, for example, to the research done through the Irish Primary Care Research Network, which is run through the ICGP - and will require expansion and State funding in order to deliver savings in the future.</p></speech>

The attention of this committee was drawn to this issue in recent weeks by media reports suggesting that the medical profession is over-prescribing medication.  That is why we have asked the witnesses to attend this morning's meeting.  We will take questions from three members at a time.  I ask the witnesses to note the questions that are asked and we will come to them after the third speaker.  The first three members I will call are Senator Colm Burke and Deputies Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and Louise O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032100002#M00300"><p>I thank those who have presented here this morning for the work they are doing.  We appreciate their commitment to trying to improve the health care sector.  As the Chairman has outlined, we decided to look at the increase in the prescribing of drugs on foot of media coverage of the issue.  According to the paper submitted by Professor Fahey, the percentage of people over the age of 65 to whom five or more medicines are prescribed has increased from 17.8% to 60.4% and the percentage of people in this older cohort to whom ten or more medicines are prescribed has increased from 1.5% to 21.9%.  I wonder how this country compares with other countries in this regard.  Are comparisons available?  Can what has occurred in this country in this area be compared with what has occurred in other countries in this area?</p> <p>  I know there have been huge demographic changes in Ireland.  People are living longer.  Life expectancy has increased by 2.5 years since 2000.  This means we have more people over the age of 65.  The number of such people will continue to increase.  I am sure the witnesses have looked at the changes in demographics we will face over the next 12 years.  How can we best deal with this issue?  If we have more people over the age of 65, will we have an increased level of demand for medications and will costs continue to increase?  The cost of medication has increased dramatically over the past ten or 15 years.  I think the annual cost of pharmaceuticals was approximately &euro;570 million in 2000, but now it is slightly over &euro;2 billion.  When there is such a substantial increase, other areas like GP funding lose out.  I agree with the witnesses that the whole GP contract needs to be reformed.  That needs to be fast-tracked.  I have been one of the people looking for that.</p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is electronic prescribing, which is used very effectively in other countries.  Sample prescriptions have been given to us today.  If we tried in the morning to set a target for the introduction of electronic prescribing across GPs, hospitals and pharmacies, and if the necessary funding were provided, what kind of timescale would be required for the introduction of such a system?  Should we be setting targets to be achieved?  My concern about health care is that we seem to be doing budgets on a year-to-year basis without also doing long-term planning.  We have lost out in the whole area of electronic records.  Someone who goes to three different hospitals will have three different files.  The same point can be made with regard to prescribing.  I wonder whether we can set targets and, if so, what kind of timescale would be required for us to implement those targets.</p> <p>  My final point relates to the substantial increase in the number of people applying for GP training this year.  There has been a slight increase in the number of places, but this has not been substantial enough.  Do the witnesses believe we can reverse the exodus of GPs out of the Irish system?  If a new contract is offered, obviously it has to be attractive.</p><p>Will Ireland still compete on the world market?  This is one of the problems we are now dealing with in all areas of medicine.  We are no longer competing in an Irish market or a UK market, rather we are competing with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America.  What else do we need to do besides providing a new contract?  What else do we need to do to keep medical personnel in Ireland and to provide a better level of service at community level?</p></speech>

Dr. Murphy and Dr. O'Brien have said that prescribing antidepressants reflects a lack of psychological therapies and a lack of social therapies.  This is serious and has the potential of snowballing and becoming more serious.  Do the doctors have statistics to back up this contention and could they comment further on this issue?</p> <p>  The committee recently discussed the need for GPs to be transparent on the issue of gifts received, for example, from pharmaceutical companies.  Do the witnesses feel that this is relevant with regard to the overall regulations around prescribed drugs?  Perhaps the doctors will also comment on the medicines management programme.</p> <p>  Professor Horgan said that trainees are taught to combat the rise of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections.  This is an ongoing concern.  Surely training is not enough.  Will Professor Horgan please comment on this issue?</p> <p>  Will Professor Fahey explain why he believes that electronic prescribing and dispensing of drugs do not interact effectively?  Are there any plans to introduce the system that is currently in place in the UK?</p></speech>

Would this be true of drugs for pain management?  In the absence of access to proper physiotherapy, are GPs finding themselves in situations where they now have to prescribe painkillers?  Would we see a reduction in the amount of pain management medication being prescribed if the resources and personnel were available in the primary care centres and if there was a fully functioning primary care team that included physiotherapy and other therapies?  We are aware that these services are not in primary care centres but would this be more appropriate?  Could it be better managed if more supports were available in the community?  Perhaps the witnesses could give their views on where those supports should be based and how people might be able to access them.  I understand that the majority of supports that are provided are in the private sector and are for people who have the money, and that the supports are not available for people on medical cards.</p> <p>  We cannot sit here and not talk about the pain medication patch, Versatis.  This issue has been in the media where it was highlighted that the level of use of the patch in Ireland is out of kilter with its use in other jurisdictions.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on this issue in the context of the availability of therapies.</p> <p>  I have another query that is related to the use of Versatis.  Is it the witnesses' opinion that GPs want to be in a position to prescribe it but cannot do so?  Clearly GPs were prescribing Versatis, and I am sure the witnesses will tell me the GPs were prescribing it in line with procedures and so on, and that is fine.  They were, however, prescribing it and now they cannot.  Are there other drugs such as this?  Are GPs sitting in their surgeries this morning with medical card patients in front of them thinking, "I would like to be in a position to prescribe these drugs"?</p><p>Can the witnesses give an estimation of whether that is a problem?  We are currently debating legislation on the eighth amendment.  People know my view on that which I will not rehearse as it is not for this committee.  In the event that the amendment is repealed, it is proposed to roll out a GP-led model.  I do not propose to go into the merits of that, but will specific training be required of GPs and how long will it take?  Are we equipped to upskill GPs in the event that the eighth amendment is repealed?</p><p> Dr. Murphy said that having controlled the issue for polypharmacy, the odds of potentially inappropriate prescribing in 2012 compared to 1997 have reduced by 60%.  What he is saying is that, in essence, we are prescribing more drugs but getting better at prescribing them.  How do we fit with the rest of Europe on this?  What I have read in the newspapers indicates that we are out of line and have a problem as a nation with prescription drugs.  I am sure Dr. Murphy has seen that.  Clearly, we are not writing the prescriptions for ourselves; they come from somewhere.  Perhaps Dr. Murphy could give us a view on that.</p><p> As to nurses prescribing, is there much interaction between the GP service and nurse prescribers?  Are there many nurse prescribers in the community?  Could we make better use of the skills of nurses within the community with regard to prescribing?</p></speech>

We are not that far out of kilter with other countries.  Every country in the developing world has experienced a substantial increase in the use of medicines which, by and large, has been a very good thing.  We should not forget that.  While we can, rightly, worry about inappropriate medicines, many of these drugs are very efficacious and helpful for patients and they have improved the length and quality of people's lives.  While that is likely to continue, I do not know if many projections on demographic trends have been done in that regard.  Most of the focus now is on trying to alleviate errors of omission.  In other words, we must prescribe drugs which we know are effective to patients who benefit from them.  Then there are errors of commission, which are those Dr. Mark Murphy just mentioned where potentially inappropriate drugs are prescribed and the risk-benefit ratio is marginal at best and potentially harmful.  That is the context of what has happened.  As we have all seen over our professional careers, the main challenge is to get the balance right in terms of drugs which are effective and helpful for patients while reducing as much as we can the use of potentially inappropriate drugs.</p></speech>

More than training is required.  There needs to be ongoing education, not only of health-care professionals but of the public too.  Not all infectious diseases I see require antibiotics.  Many of them are viral infections for which there may not be any treatment.  It is often fluids and paracetamol that cure those.  People are under pressure to get back to work and get their kids to school and it is important to keep that in mind, but ongoing sustained education of the public is important.  Immunisation is important also, in particular for influenza.  We had another outbreak this year.  There is a very effective vaccine available.  While it changes a little from year to year, it is safe and effective and it prevents infections.  There are other vaccines, for example the pneumococcal vaccine which prevents a certain type of pneumonia.  With that, one can reduce the use of antibiotics.  A lot of us may also prescribe courses of antibiotics which are a bit too long.  Using shorter courses of antibiotics can cure a lot of the infections we see.</p><p> Lastly, it is important to educate doctors on prescribing the correct antibiotic for the appropriate infection.  Sometimes doctors prescribe very broad spectrum antibiotics for an infection such as cellulitis which can be targeted with a very narrow range antibiotic.  This is just a reminder on prescribing.  Just because an antibiotic is new and more expensive does not mean that it is the best one for a particular condition.  There is a need for ongoing education and training on prescribing that should be integrated in our daily practice.</p></speech>

I have no expertise in this area, but I have spoken to people who say individuals do not like to leave the surgery without a prescription.  Their thinking is that as they have paid their money, they want to get something for it.  In the event that general practice had access to near-patient testing, would that enable the doctor to be able to target infections with specific rather than broad spectrum drugs?.</p></speech>

People with many of the common infections present at general practice surgeries.  If the doctor had point of care testing for Group A streptococcal infection or influenza, the doctor could target what they need to treat, or it would indicate if the patient needed treatment at all.  That would be an important resource on the front line, of which my colleagues in general practice would avail.</p></speech>

One can give a patient what is known as a delayed prescription.  One can give somebody a prescription, but inform him or her how long the illness will last, leave the decision to take medication with the patient and give him or her appropriate safety netting advice on what to do.  All the evidence shows that only 15% of people use the prescriptions but it also de-medalicalises them so that the next time their child or they themselves get an infectious-like disease, they manage it appropriately without seeking antibiotics or help from their GPs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032100002#P00800"><p>A number of questions were raised and I suppose there is a common piece that perhaps ties many of them together.  Some 40% of the funding of general practice has been taken out of the system.  The first point that one must realise is that this has had consequences.  GPs need time with people for a variety of reasons.  The management of medication is only one of those reason, but there is also the management of their other problems, such as social and psychological problems.  In order to provide time, one needs staff and staff cost money.  This is linked to the issue that we are losing 20% of our GPs each year.  They are choosing to go abroad.  Their career opportunities are being impaired by what is taking place.</p> <p>  On the question of Versatis, it is worth noting that today there will be approximately 650 people on trolleys and some 500,000 people are waiting for appointments.  Where do those people go for care?  They actually end up in general practices and there is little in the line of immediate support in general practice for many of the conditions people have.  We are talking about psychological therapies, physiotherapy and access to consultations with consultants, but those services are not available.  The GPs are left in a predicament where they have to do something with the person who is in front of them who may be in pain.  Not all of the 500,000 people who are on waiting lists are in pain, but some are.  It ends up that medication is tried and if it is effective, that is great.  Everybody has a pain tree, so one might start in the first instance by taking paracetamol and then one might take opioids.</p><p> Another is that one does not like to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatories in elderly people because of the impact on the kidneys.  One might then wonder if there might be a neurogenic aspect to it or whether a Versatis patch might be a suitable way of prescribing in respect of a particular person.  The Versatis patch is now much more difficult to get, so one finds oneself scratching around for other forms of nerve-blocking agents.  As a result, one looks at anti-depressants, which are used but which tend to sedate.  There is increased use of pregabalin, which has the brand name Lyrica and of which the members may have heard.  It diverts prescribing into other areas.  As a result, that issue arises again.  The net problem is that there is not enough provision where it is necessary.  It is necessary to bring the guns up to the front line.  The front line is general practice.  GPs deal with their patients in a holistic way and on a continuous basis.  There is a whole iterative process that takes place and they are comprehensive, dealing with everything from people with diabetes to children with ear infections.  If one is prepared to bring the assets to bear in the place of least expense and at the point of earliest contact, one is likely to have the best impact possible.  If one does not do so, one is in trouble.  We see the trolley numbers, the waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists, but what we cannot see is the contraction in the amount of time that GPs have to give to their patients, which is a major source of much of what the members are speaking about this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.413" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032100002#Q00200"><p>I will take a number of the remaining questions, some of which are difficult.  Senator Colm Burke asked about ehealth.  It is a very heterogenous, complex and large phenomenon.  We are very saddened to see the loss of Richard Corbridge.  We need to retain people and build incrementally.  It is a loss to our health system that multi-annual capital funding was not put in place in respect of this.  Professor Horgan and I would agree that it is not about blaming GPs and community-based doctors or hospital doctors, but errors can happen with handwriting and paper.  That is the reality.  My practice lives off fax machines, which is not good enough.  Professor Fahey has shown examples of prescriptions that are illegible.  I am frequently unable to read a prescription of 16 drugs, and would not be able to contact the prescribing doctor in the hospital.  I am not blaming that doctor.  That is a State error, because we have not invested sufficiently in electronic discharges.  Electronic referrals have started, which go to the hospitals, and I now do that.  It is very useful for the clerking doctor in the emergency department, but we need a full roll-out of electronic discharges when the patients returns to me.  We are ready to go on electronic prescribing but, unfortunately, our electronic health records, which have been there for 15 years, do not talk to the secondary care electronic health records, nor do they talk to the pharmacy electronic health records.  We are ready to go now.  The question of timescale is one for the Department of Health and the Minister to answer.  It also requires funding.</p> <p>  GP training numbers have increased to 202 this year.  We have now filled 194 places, which is welcome.  On whether we can reverse the exodus with a new GP contract, I am of the view that if GPs can do what they are trained to do and manage chronic illnesses, access diagnostics and have a satisfying work environment, we will absolutely retain them.  I am very committed to that.</p> <p>  Responding to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, to put it in context, GPs manage the majority of mental health problems in the State.  This includes patients with severe anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder, panic attacks, severe depression and labels that we do not even use for people - just mental health complex phenomena.  In my practice, I probably start patients on anti-depressants each week.  They work and there is a strong evidence base to show that they are effective.  They are in every guideline for managing mental health problems across the world for moderate and severe depression.  The first-line treatments are lifestyle, social treatments and psychological treatments.  I am afraid that sometimes those psychological services are not there.  In the case of private patients, I had a patient recently who spent &euro;1,200 accessing cognitive behaviour therapy for their son aged 15 years.  It is an absolute disgrace.</p><p>That patient did not start on anti-depressants, although that would have been a lot cheaper.  First-line therapy was started but it is prohibitively expensive.  I am afraid that it can take a GMS patient up to six months to access psychological services which, when accessed, are excellent.  That is the reality.  </p><p> Gifts from pharmaceutical companies is a complicated issue.  I personally do not see pharmaceutical company representatives but indirectly, a lot of our medical education is partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry.  It is not a black and white issue but I personally do not deal with company representatives.  Transparency is absolutely required in this area.  A recent development in this area is the IPHA's Transfers of Value register, which allows one to go online and see who has voluntarily declared income from pharmaceutical companies.  The voluntary aspect of that probably needs to change.  We need to know those numbers and I would stand over that.</p><p> The medicines management programme is an excellent programme run by the HSE that delivers education to patients and doctors.  Doctors always need to improve quality and standards.  In terms of antibiotic stewardship, for example, it has developed a suite and platform to enable GPs and patients to understand appropriate prescribing.  However, sometimes that involves a transfer of workload and that must be factored in, as a matter of basic respect.</p><p> I will deal briefly with Versatis before touching on nurse prescribing and the eighth amendment.  We can only prescribe cost effective drugs.  If there is an indication, we will prescribe it and for neuropathic pain, the prescribing of Versatis by GPs is both legitimate and understandable.  I am not blaming anyone but much of the Versatis prescribing came from the secondary care setting, that is, from pain clinics.  As a GP, if I referred a patient to a pain specialist and he or she waited for 18 months to be seen and was then referred back to me, I could not just say that I did not agree with the pain specialist, if the drug had been prescribed already.  I welcome the initiative to reduce inappropriate prescribing but as a GP, I am expected to spend 15 minutes on an online platform for each patient.  As a matter of respect, the HSE must talk to our representative bodies about that.  Let us do it and let us consider other drugs on which money can be saved but we must bear in mind that there is a cost aspect to that.</p><p> On nurse prescribing, I work with a nurse who is a prescriber and I believe we should get going on this.  This is all part of the GP contract.  There has been a feeling within general practice for the past 15 years that they have not believed in the current model of general practice.  They are finally coming around to that.  It is to the detriment of patient care that funding to allow practice nurses to train in this area and to upskill has not been provided.  That must happen.  Obviously there are quality and educational issues that need to be factored in but most other health care systems have allowed nurses to expand their portfolio of skills and we should allow that to happen here.</p><p>On the eighth amendment, Deputy O'Reilly knows my personal opinion.  However, I am speaking here on behalf of the Irish College of General Practitioners.  The college made a submission to the Citizen's Assembly and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, both of which came up with what they believe are workable recommendations.  There is a problem with the phrase "GP led" because in the future, we do not know what model will develop.  Specialists and clinicians who have an interest in this area, whether in secondary care or in the community, will provide the service.  I know there are many clinicians who will do so and that model needs to be thrashed out and delivered.  Early medical abortion is delivered with an abortion pill and 1,500 women here took that pill last year.  We are talking here about mifepristone and misoprostol pills.  There will be a licensing issue and that needs to be factored into the legislation.  That is all I can say on the matter.  We are talking about two tablets that will need to be licensed.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of e-prescribing and the cost-benefit analysis of same.  What are the potential benefits of a greater reliance on and upgrading of technology in terms of making prescribing more effective and efficient?</p><p>For instance, how do we rate at the present time in comparison with other jurisdictions in terms of our GPs, consultants, hospitals and so on?  I got a report from somebody recently to the effect that we are light years behind.  Everything has a waiting time.  One has to wait for X-rays, for scans and for reports.  This waiting time intrigues me.  I have raised it in this committee on numerous occasions in the past.  I presume that technology is the way around that issue.  However, if the person to whom a message is given at a particular time also has a list of people waiting, it does not serve any useful purpose at all.  Everybody is in a circle of waiting.  Essentially I am asking how fully that issue has been studied.  How do the witnesses see efficiencies in that area benefitting the patient?<br/><br/>On under-prescribing and over-prescribing, how much evidence exists of under-prescribing, for example, ultimately resulting in a longer duration of prescription by virtue of an inadequate prescription in the beginning?  This is something that certainly has been brought to my attention in the past.  As a result of trying to ensure that we do not cause the problems about which we are all worried in respect of resistance to antibiotics, there is a tendency to under-prescribe, resulting in a longer period of medication, which ultimately has the reverse effect.  The patient consumes far more than they would have done if he or she had got an adequate prescription in the beginning.<br/><br/>The last question I want to raise relates to Versatis and the alleged excessive use of it.  I take the points that have been made in respect of solving the particular problem which presents itself at a particular time.  I am concerned, however, that in comparison with the UK, we seem to be way ahead in terms of prescription in that area.  There has to be some reason for that.  It escapes me at the moment.  I do not know what it is.  If it is an instant solution, why is it not an instant solution in the UK?  I fully appreciate the fact that pain can be a factor that can drive people to seek the ultimate solution in the shortest possible time, but why is it that our use <i>per capita</i>is way ahead of that of the UK?  To what is that attributable?</p></speech>

I could spend all day talking about this.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  First, regarding formularies, I am sure that everyone on the committee is aware of it but I am a pharmacist by profession.  When I worked in the UK approximately 15 years ago, formulary prescribing was standard across the NHS.  I was surprised when I came back to Ireland that this was not the case.  For example, the particular trust in which I worked made a deal with Wyeth, the company which made Zoton at the time.  Everybody who was admitted to the hospital in which I worked, no matter what proton pump inhibitor, PPI, they were on, left on Zoton unless there was contraindications relating to diarrhoea, an intolerance to the drug or so forth.  We seem never to have done that in this country.  I understand that GPs want autonomy over their prescribing in the same way that pharmacists want a degree of autonomy, but that sort of logic on bulk-buying never seems to have transferred here.  That said, it is not all bad.  When I came back there were no generics on the market in Ireland and we could not substitute generics.  If a doctor such as the Chairman wrote a prescription for Zoton, we had to give Zoton.  That has obviously been resolved since.</p> <p>  With regard to formularies and our guidelines, I will move onto Brexit.  We all depend on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines for our prescribing and that may now be taken from us with Brexit.  Do the witnesses think that Ireland needs its own group or should there be prescribing guidelines from Europe to govern European countries?</p><p>I missed the start of the presentation but I heard very little reference to pharmacists in the contributions.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I asked my colleagues on either side of me and they did not hear mention of pharmacists either.  It seems bizarre that we would talk about polypharmacy and medicines management without mentioning pharmacists.  I was a medicines management pharmacist in the UK and I can read this perfectly.  It is very bad, but is a very good example of why we have errors and why we cannot collate data.  As Dr. Murphy outlined - and Dr. Harty knows this - the situation is that this comes rattling through on a fax machine.  It has probably been crumpled by the person on the far side.  This is the practical situation, and people do not know this is going on.  Some of the hospitals have the old feeder faxes which have a big crease down the middle.  The controlled drugs are not legal because of the way it is written.  The pharmacist is then caught.  The doctor in the hospital wants to discharge a patient as soon as possible and the pharmacist wants to fix them up.  Suddenly it is 7 o'clock in the evening and there is nobody to call about what is written down the crease.  It is so unsafe.  We have done work on tracking errors, but I would imagine that there are many instances where there are problems for six or seven years because of a crease in the paper or because the wrong person answered the phone.  </p><p> There is also a huge confidentiality issue when it comes to what doctors, pharmacists, nurses and ward managers have to do with medical records.  There has to be an element of trust, otherwise we would find out nothing.  One has to hope that the person at the end of the phone is the actual patient or is a doctor.  If a malicious person out there wanted to get a person's information they probably could get it.  One might wonder why a person would do that, but it is very possible given how the system is set up at the minute.  Furthermore, the lack of electronic prescribing and the prevalence of this sort of paperwork means that we cannot collate the data.  We are only aware of what goes through the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  We do not know anything about what is going on with private prescriptions.  </p><p> Dr. O'Brien said that different areas have different requirements.  In my particular area we deal with many patients who require cancer drugs because St. Luke's Hospital is beside us.  There are obviously spikes in the data.  For example, in areas with high addiction rates there will be issues, or if there are particular pockets of illness in an area.  </p><p> It was mentioned that GPs are under pressure, and I understand that.  The figure of 40% was mentioned.  Some people say 35% while others say that it depends on the mix of practice.  It is a large amount to be taken from anyone's bottom line.  The headroom was not there in general practice.  People thought it was, but it clearly was not.  It is now a case of getting people in and out as quickly as possible, and that is no way to provide a service.  I have long thought that the GP is the key person in people's lives in the community.  The rest of us assist people from that base.  Without the anchor of a GP and that relationship that people have, things just go unnoticed.  That rapport is only built up through consultation, from people being comforted in their time of need.  The other stuff can be fixed.  It is almost a preventative form of medicine.  </p><p> I understand where the witnesses are coming from.  Do they have any views on the outsourcing duties to other professions?  I am talking about nurse prescribers and pharmacists who would deal with things like the contraceptive pill and people who are established on cholesterol medication.  These things are fairly standard, and this approach has been taken in some other countries, such as Canada where there have been pilot schemes where pharmacists deal with hypertension management.  Vaccinations also work exceptionally well in the community pharmacy setting.  We were told at the time that people would be having anaphylactic reactions, and some GP friends of mine asked me how I would cope and suggested that people would be dropping dead.</p><p>One in 2 million is the incidence of anaphylaxis to the influenza vaccine.  I am not sure if anyone has dropped dead from it in that setting.  It is very much risk free and pharmacists have embraced it.  At the time, personally, I felt I did not train to inject people and I did not want to do this but we got over it.  Like that, can we not train up other health-care professionals in the delivery of other vaccinations?  I note the pneumococcal vaccine is out now.  Obviously, I am aware vaccinating children is a specialist area and I firmly believe that should be in the GPs' hands.</p><p> Also, I see there is a larger role for pharmacists in addiction.  We tend to be the profession that often meets people twice a day and because of the nature of pharmacy businesses, the doors are open.  This was particularly evident to me during the recent snow when those with addiction, probably, a bit like the women who could not travel to the UK, were the ones who were without necessary medication.  A number of us in the Dublin area worked closely together to ensure they were fixed up.  Pharmacists in the role of addiction treatment, obviously with specialist training, would take a bit of heat off the GPs.</p><p> The Versatis patch is an issue I do not want to go into at length.  It is the case that these patches have provided many with really good pain relief but when one has a situation where the total spend in Ireland, at &euro;36 million if we did nothing, was the same as the total spend in the UK - Deputy Durkan asked why that is - I genuinely believe the reason is as simple as that this company just had very good representatives on the road.  As a product - they mentioned about non-steroidals in older people with reduced renal function - it was a particularly clean drug.  As a prescriber, one could hop it on and one need not worry about this list because it did not interact with anything.  It has a huge and convenient role.  Also, it left the secondary care setting and arrived in to GPs but those who had to deal with the hassle were the GP and the pharmacist, and the bad news had to be delivered by the GP.  I am aware, from talking to colleagues because I am not working in practice anymore, that the letter arrived in September to the pharmacist to say this was happening.  Normally, people on stable medication would have three to six months prescriptions and with three month prescriptions this fell right at Christmas to stop people's pain relief.  Yet again the doctor had to tell patients they could not have this drug and then the pharmacists in many cases were the ones who were caught in that we knew we were not going to get reimbursed.  There was no way around it.  The way the HSE handled it was bad and the way GPs and pharmacists were allocated the job of delivering the bad news to those with chronic was quite disrespectful to both professions, which do a great deal for nothing much of the time.</p><p> Non-government health-care advertising is something I have seen an emergence of.  There is a testosterone advertisement I heard somewhere - I think it was on the radio.  This is something I was only aware of in the United States.  I would be supportive of the proposal to ban this advertising.  I will endeavour to speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, about this.  The witnesses may be aware I am working on a particular piece of legislation to do with the advertising of fake cures or false remedies for cancer at present.  This, in some way, is linked with it. </p><p> On Versatis, the 15 minutes of paperwork was mentioned.  This is also true of the new anticoagulant drugs.  I refer to this idea that pharmacists and doctors would have to spend 15 or 20 minutes, and that is in Dublin with broadband.  I have heard of people in areas with poor broadband who literally cannot get the form done as the system crashes.  When one is a health-care professional, one generally wants to be doing the business of providing health care.  One does not want to be filling in forms and justifying why Mrs. Whoever needs whatever.</p><p>I understand there have to be guidelines and parameters but when we have shortages, we cannot have skilled people in the medical field filling in forms.</p><p> On the total cost of drugs over the past ten or 15 years, since reference pricing came in, it is worth noting that the high-tech drugs are pushing up the total spend.  There is this idea that Irish drugs are more expensive than anywhere else in the world.  When I qualified, it was about &euro;110 for a box of Lipitor but one can get a box of generic atorvastatin for about a tenner now and that is a blockbuster drug.  Many of those drugs came off patent in recent years.  However, that slack has been picked up by the high-techs.  I feel that is the area we have to really target when it comes to pricing.  We are not going to get the atorvastatin any cheaper and even if it came down to &euro;6, it is not going to make any odds.  It is the box of whatever high-tech drug that costs a couple of thousand euro.  There could be more stringent auditing of these products by the HSE.  Sometimes, when supply is restricted until the prescription arrives there is a gap in care, so there are ways of making it better for patients.  That said, in the case of the new anti-coagulant drugs, although they are increasing the price of prescribed drugs, there is a knock-on benefit in that we are not going to have people attending Warfarin clinics in hospital.  The cost that is being put onto the drugs is coming off outpatients and that has to be recognised.  Consequently, people not going into Warfarin clinics and queuing up with snotty noses, coughs and 'flus means the exposure to disease is reduced.  The hospital car parks and staff are freed up also.  It is not a simple sum - I just wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have any views on the use of combo drugs like Vimovo that are coming onto the market?  Two molecules are combined by a company to reduce the drug from two to one.  However, the two components are far cheaper individually.  We have seen an emergence of that kind of smartness, as I would consider it, on the part of drug companies, where two off-patent drugs are combined.  For the prescriber, it is sold to some extent as having the patient on one tablet instead of two, leading to better adherence to a regime.  How can we deal with that and the cost of it?</p> <p>  Somebody spoke about cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants.  This is a huge issue and I have seen it in community regarding people with certain means, the mental capacity, and the people within their lives to assist them.  I know one particular girl in her 30s who spent &euro;5,000 on cognitive behavioural therapy over six months.  She did not want to go on antidepressants.  She did not really have the means but she got them and she was fixed up fine.  That is just prohibitively expensive for anybody, however.  In the case of a 15 year old, it is so important that, where possible, we do not medicate young minds unless absolutely necessary.  If there is a cognitive behavioural method available, it should definitely be prioritised for young people.</p> <p>  It was said that there were 650 people on trolleys.  There are now 362 people, which is down 20% on the same day last year.  I have to do something for the Government while I am here.</p></speech>

Prescribing is such an important and, I can see from the questions, impassioned issue for everybody in Ireland.  I want to put things in the context of initiatives that are going on at present and how we might build on them.  There are some very good and important initiatives in respect of prescribing under way Ireland at the moment.  I will mention two.  On prescribing guidelines, there are two clinical care programmes that I think do pretty good work.</p><p>There is no particular conflict of interest in my saying so.  The medicines management programme does good work because it provides guidance on prescribing practice that is based on current evidence.  Deputy Durkan asked what will happen in terms of Brexit.  We have evidence-based prescribing guidance already but we need to build on that through the medicines management programme.</p><p> Professor Horgan is better able to talk about antibiotic resistance than I am.  We have a good clinical care programme in the primary and secondary care sector that provides very good evidence on first and second line antibiotic prescribing.  To build on such initiatives, and returning to the reason for my attendance here this morning, there is an e-prescribing issue.  We are falling behind other countries, and European countries in particular, in the aggregation and usage of prescribing data and in how we might continue to improve both the equality and safety of prescribing.  That is what we need to take away from today.  We have a base of good initiatives but we need to develop a national system where access to public data on prescriptions, retained as part of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, must be more widely available.  I mean anonymised data that researchers or postgraduate training bodies or quality improvement bodies can access and use in realtime for prescribing, reflection, practice, audit and feedback.  We should prioritise the initiative.  </p><p> Lastly, there was a question about the high-tech drug versus a generic substitution.  We are going in the right direction in terms of generic substitution.  The preferred drugs initiative, via the medicines management programme, reflects this.  Again, we can do more about that by reducing or enhancing the amount of drugs that we prescribe generically.  </p></speech>

Quite often a patient may get 12 different generic substitutions in a year.  In other words, he or she goes into a pharmacist and receives a product.  On his or her next visit the chemist will suggest that another generic substitute is the same as the last one but it has been produced by a different company.  People react to products in different ways.  Not all generic drugs are the same and not all generics drugs are the same as the proprietary drug.  Patients using multiple versions of the same drug is a huge problem and it is very difficult to identify the culprit when they, inevitably, develop an adverse reaction.  Multiple generic substitutions is an issue for patients and GPs.</p></speech>

There is a peculiar set-up in Ireland as many generic manufacturers provide different generic drugs.  Earlier I mentioned pharmacists.  I work in the  research area and receive a lot of helpful advice from pharmacy colleagues.  General practice and pharmacy practice can work more closely together but, again, that goes back to the prescribing aspect.  Let us say one has a list of generic drugs, and please correct me if I am wrong about the following, a pharmacist can prescribe an equivalent generic if he or she has it in stock.  One must convey such information clearly to the patient.  We must move in that direction because otherwise we will have a very high proprietary prescription rate and a much more costly prescribing environment here.</p></speech>

In the States I was trained in the area of infectious diseases where the hospital pharmacist was absolutely essential.  Not only did the hospital pharmacist save about $1.5 million a year in the infectious disease service of a  large university hospital, they contributed to good outcomes for patients.  Pharmacy and medical students are taught safe prescribing at undergraduate level but we should do more with hospital-based pharmacists at postgraduate level.  Such instruction is given for antibiotic stewardship and cancer chemotherapy.</p><p>However, it must be expanded above that.  It should be a team-based approach.  That is how we should be educating our trainees.  We recruit very smart people into undergraduate programmes in pharmacy and medicine.  The two groups can work very well together and that should continue.  I can speak for a hospital where most of our trainees, members and fellows are based.  Dr. Mark Murphy and Dr. John O'Brien might wish to comment on that.  More integrated education at postgraduate level is essential.  I frequently ring the pharmacist to ask about adverse drug effects and interactions before I send patients out.</p><p> The other thing I find helpful is that I always look at the drugs the patients are on when they come into hospital because I do general medicine.  A lot of the time they do not need to be on all of the drugs.  This is about working with the pharmacist to go through everything, what the patient needs, what interacts with what and what we can stop.</p></speech>

There is a specific paragraph here and I apologise to Deputy O'Connell if I did not quote it.  However, it is here and I have said it at previous meetings.  The first sentence is that the community pharmacist is an essential and extremely valued member of the primary care team.  I talk with multiple pharmacists each day.  They are critical to the delivery of safe and effective care.  As we move forward we need to have a debate about the fragmentation of care.  We have a privatisation and corporatisation agenda in the Irish health care services which has absolutely undermined the ability of our health care system to function effectively.  Our system should have moved to GP-led, community-based care working closely with community pharmacists, but it has not.  We have been moving increasingly away from that.  We need to disentangle that fragmentation.</p> <p>  There are enhanced roles of practice-based pharmacists, practice-based nurses, nurse prescribers and enhanced roles for community pharmacists as well.  However, when talking about prevention of cardiovascular disease or addiction services I do not want the services to be further fragmented for patients.  They need to have a system where they are not over-medicalised and made more vulnerable by having multiple sources and avenues of accessing health care.  Consider contraception.  We have to balance that with access.  The Deputy has been a particularly strong advocate on sexual and reproductive health care.  We have to ensure that all patients have accessible care.  I believe that is primarily in the GP setting but not only there, and the Deputy has highlighted a few reasons.  However, we cannot fragment care further.</p> <p>  I will make a couple of comments on the issue of advertising.  General practitioners are extremely frustrated with the manipulation and erroneous marketing and advertising on radio and in newspapers by private hospitals and, indirectly, pharmaceutical companies.  They are targeting vulnerable patients and it is an absolute disgrace.  It promotes an over-medicalisation in our society.  We must think long and hard at State level about the harm that is happening because of this agenda.  For GPs it is very upsetting to see the anxiety and frustrations visible in our waiting rooms because of the frightening perception that is created in patients' minds.</p> <p>  Combination drugs is a complicated issue.  One is balancing compliance, because it is one medication rather than two, versus cost.  We have to be responsible in the health care system.  We must prescribe cost effectively.  When we spend somewhere we lose out somewhere else.  With regard to high-tech drugs, we spend &euro;700 million on high-tech drugs while we spend approximately &euro;1.4 billion on other pharmaceutical products.  It is astronomical.  It is very upsetting, for example, for a provider of home care packages in the community, one of the most valuable interventions one can make to keep people living at home for longer.  We cannot afford home care packages but we can afford medications at astronomical costs with very limited benefit.</p><p>Some drugs have a definite cost-effective balance but others do not.  We can work that out in the medicine management programme, which Professor Michael Barry has specified.  The politicisation of certain drugs has led directly to the reduction of community-based care.  We need to get very honest about that in our society.  We have a responsibility, given that we have one budget in health care, to spend money where we get a bang for our buck.  I will let my colleague, Dr. John O'Brien, talk about formularies and guidelines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032100002#Y00200"><p>We do not want to be the dog in the manger.  That is not the issue.  There are issues around fragmentation which need to be taken on board.  The reason a GP needs to lead primary care is not because he or she is such a wonderful thing, but, rather, because the model of general practice is one which provides for integrated care, which is what is proposed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Integrated care depends on the GP delivering care in a holistic manner, which means that one is looking at all of the contexts of a patient's problems, be they biological, social, psychological or even existential.  The model has to be comprehensive and deal with everything.  A GP may deal with lupus, diabetes, oesophagitis or psychiatry.  The care has to be totally comprehensive.</p> <p>  Another important aspect is continuous care.  This is all within the European definition of general practice but I am distilling it down for the committee.  Continuity of care is important because with each consultation another twist in the relationship with the doctor and patient takes place.  All of that iterative building over a period leads to a resource which the patient can draw down during times when they are in difficulties.  It also helps in terms of balance.</p> <p>  We discussed multimorbidity, which means that a person has a range of different diseases.  If one is going to introduce into the community specialist nurses in cardiac care, respiratory care, diabetes or whatever else they will all follow the guidelines pertinent to their area of expertise.  Who takes all of that, marries it together and integrates it for a single person?  That is what a GP should be doing.</p> <p>  This brings me back to the issue of time.  If GPs are not given enough time to do that, then they cannot do it.  People will go on to waiting lists or into casualty departments where they should not be, which is another cost to the system.  Savings can be made by taking a lot of funds out of general practice, but we lose out on a whole load of other things, including the budget, which is what we are discussing today.</p></speech>

Patients have an expectation that is a cure for everything.  It is very difficult to get that message across.  Professor Fahey has a prescription with 14 items on it for a patient who has vitamin and iron deficiencies, probably has atrial fibrillation, has a pancreas deficiency, has chronic obstructive airways disease and is taking MST opiates for pain, something to counteract constipation and a PPI to protect the tummy against all of the other drugs he or she is taking.  It is a very interesting prescription and learning tool.</p> <p>  When I have students with me, I often show them a prescription and ask them which two items they would remove from the list because they are unnecessary.  As professionals, we can be drawn into the idea that there is a pill for every ill and, as a consequence, there can be a prescription with 14 items.  If an elderly patient has a prescription with 14 items the likelihood of compliance is low unless the medication is blister-packed, and there are issues around that.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment on the perception that there is a pill for every ill.</p><p>Reference was made in one of the opening statements to low value items having a high cost and how these are screened out in the context of medication reviews.  In regard to general practice, general practitioners and geriatricians are probably the only generalists practising medicine now.  As stated, to get a holistic picture of a patient general practitioners often have to distil down through prescriptions.  I note Professor Fahey is smiling.  I am sure he will have some comments to make on that issue.</p><p> In regard to Sl&aacute;intecare, the report is with the Department of Health.  We have not yet had a reaction to it.  It is a radical report in that it proposes so many different changes to our health system, one of which is a transfer from hospital to general practice and community services, which are essential.  It is important that we have a robust primary care service because the rest of the health service is built on sand.  Perhaps the witnesses would like to extrapolate on that issue on the GP contract, which is a 24-7 and 365 day contract and on the concept of the doctor taking on all of the responsibility and paying for everything which is dead in the water.</p></speech>

Usually, I see between ten and 15 people per morning clinic such that the clinic mentioned was a fairly typical one.  On prescription pattern monitoring and audit of usage, this script is not that bad; it is possible to read it.  What the Deputy is doing is trying to surmise the indication for these drugs but the indication is not on this prescription.  Under the current system, the prescription of a drug is not linked to a diagnostic code for indication.  This is something we should have because it enables people, either in the community or the hospital sector, to make more rational decisions about the need for a prescription and to have a meaningful discussion with the patient.  If we had an interoperable system that spoke to the hospital system, we could then make a joint decision or at least identify that a person has been in a hospital and was refused a drug for a particular reason.</p> <p>  The system around prescribing needs to be enhanced in the short term.  Education and training in Ireland is reasonably okay, but it can always be improved.  The systems around supporting prescriptions in the community, dispensing pharmacies and hospitals is lagging behind and this should be addressed.</p></speech>

We try to incorporate this practice into our training.  In 1995, when I was training in the US, I led the roll-out of a pilot on electronic medical records in a large institution.  I work in a system here within a hospital where there are no electronic medical records other than discharge summaries and these are not available to everybody.  Some 23 years on, I do not think we are hugely further along.  If we cannot do everything together, why can we not do it piecemeal?  Perhaps the patient journey from prevention to general practice to hospital care and back to general practice is the priority that e-health needs to be working on.</p></speech>

One of the things that worries me is hearing people talk about the worried well.  Since when were the well worried?  I think people do have an expectation of medicine and what it can do for them which is perhaps not exactly what medicine can do.  As part of their relationship and dialogue with their GPs some of this can be thrashed out, although I am back again to the issue of time.  We spoke earlier about issues that arise out of advertising, specifically the advertising of medication but there are even campaigns such as those I have heard on the radio asking listeners whether they could have cancer or heart disease or suggesting colonoscopies.  This can be driven by marketing and advertising, but equally I think there is a national admiration for what medicine can do, and rightly so.  However, perhaps that admiration goes a little too far in terms of what it actually delivers because what it does not say is that medicine can do this but there is a cost.  It is a question of that balance between the benefits that people will accrue from various interventions and the cost to them of all that.  Going back again to the business, we were talking about the advertising of medications on the television and radio - on the radio anyway.  I was away recently and listened to CNN for two hours, and in that two hours there were separate advertisements for 12 different medications and one for colonoscopies.  I do not know that that is a wonderful place for us to be going; I think we need to back away.</p> <p>  Lastly, when people get to the back end of their lives, very often they are on a great deal of medication and have had a great deal of intervention.  Whether further intervention, or even the medications they are already taking, is appropriate for their care and what their care will be at the end of their lives are questions that need to be planned with them.  They need to have those kinds of discussions with their GPs and that is not happening because of lack of time.  The net effect is that people who really should not be in emergency departments are ending up there.  This is inappropriate care and goes back to a wider exposition of the Chairman's comments on a pill for every ill.</p></speech>

Social Justice Ireland published a report recently.  There were a number of elements to it, but Social Justice Ireland identified a particular category, a regrettably growing number of people whom one could loosely call the working poor.  These are people who would not necessarily qualify for medical cards but who have no immunity from illness either so will have occasion to visit their GPs.  I appreciate the witnesses may have to follow up with us on this, and that would be fine, but could they offer us a view as to whether, in their experience, there are people for whom GPs may prescribe medication but who do not have the means to fill that prescription and who may find themselves at the doors of accident and emergency departments or elsewhere because they are not getting the treatment they need, even though they may have been prescribed it?  This is something I have seen but it is anecdotal.  Is there evidence of or information on this that we might be able to look up?</p></speech>

Further to this, we learned at some stage on that committee of the huge expense of long-acting reversible contraception - for example, Mirena.  People put it off because of the price.  It is allowed under the drug payment scheme, but there is the insertion and so on.  It is therefore worth noting, following on from Deputy O'Reilly's comments, that one in five women without a medical card has difficulty accessing contraception due to cost.</p></speech>

I have been speaking about loneliness and have set up a task force to address the issue.  We all know the devastating effects the epidemic of loneliness can have on both physical and mental health.  It is estimated that 400,000 people in Ireland suffer from loneliness, and more than 9 million people in the UK, where it costs the NHS &euro;35 billion.  That is an incredible amount of money.  It is linked with an increase in mortality rates and dementia, and is considered to be as bad for a person as obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p> <p>  There is a taboo around loneliness and a shame around admitting that one is lonely.  People will often say to me that they are depressed but when asked, they agree that they are lonely.  They are not really depressed but rather are lonely.  Do the witnesses think that the medical profession has overcompensated in terms of prescribing unnecessarily for those people?  Could savings be made in that respect?</p></speech>

In an evidence-based consultation, a doctor uses his or her own clinical experience.  He or she also considers the evidence available about the drug, which will often have limited benefit but which is beneficial nonetheless.  There may be side effects of the drug.  The decision is shared with the patient and their preferences are considered.  That takes time.  For a patient who is on 14 different drugs, considering the fact that all of those drugs are dynamic and that at any one time they are not definite or absolute forever, a medication review every six months takes a significant amount of time.  If one wants to take the prescription of medication seriously, apart from the capital infrastructure to make prescribing between interfaces safe, that time needs to be resourced.  This is particularly true in the last five to ten years of a person's life.  If a person is over 80 or 90 years of age the evidence base for those medications is limited, particularly for primary preventative purposes, and we need to fund that time to have those long conversations with patients.  I believe we would reap dividends in terms of a reduction in health care spending.</p> <p>  On Sl&aacute;intecare, the Irish College of General Practitioners really wants to commend the Chair and every Deputy and Senator here on their hard work in advocating for a long-term vision for a fairer and better health care system that is more community orientated.  We absolutely support the initiative taken.  We really are getting frustrated that the Department of the Taoiseach and other high offices have not taken this on to implement it.  </p> <p>  On Social Justice Ireland and the working poor, it is those persons who are above the means threshold for a medical card, who have to pay to see the GP and who perhaps must pay &euro;149 every month for their medications.  It is extremely unfair, and it is a definite phenomenon that those patients are not compliant in returning to us or with taking their medications because of cost.  Some of those patients end up with catastrophic out-of-pocket payments, which is simply wrong and immoral.  It is a difficult issue, and I believe that Sl&aacute;intecare is seeking to address it.</p> <p>  On the question of loneliness, I agree entirely with Senator Swanick.  There are issues in the health care system about which we have to be honest.  We cannot do anything about some of the issues.  Much of the life expectancy improvement that has taken place over the last 50 years is not due to the medical profession but because of advances in other areas of the civic environment, such as education and social protection.  A community health care system is very important and is useful for the prevention of loneliness.  Having a day in a community hospital, accessing a GP, a public health nurse and a home care package are some of the benefits.  However, we have to get real and not over-medicalise this.  This is an issue of a fragmentation of our communities and a change in culture.  It is a wider civic societal issue as well.  GPs have a pivotal role in identifying loneliness but in terms of social prescribing and other phenomena to try to help loneliness, it is a major issue and I believe we should not over-medicalise it.  It is a very important issue to raise.  </p></speech>

This brings me back to the business of holistic care.  In the main, depression does not fall out of the sky.  Generally speaking, people are depressed for reasons which are immediately clear.  This is not be true in all cases, but it is true in many.  Certainly, the social circumstances of the individual will have an impact on his or her psychological state.  As to how that all plays out, two particular pressure areas in general practice are emerging.  The first is deprived urban areas where the resources are just not there and the second is rural practice.  Rural practices are shutting because they are not economically viable and large swathes of the countryside are without GPs.  Patients use GPs in a manner which is not just about the ordinary taxonomy of diseases we were all taught in medical school.  There is a lot more that transacts within a general practice than that.  This part of what Senator Swanick refers to - loneliness.  The loss of those critical services within communities is where all that stems from.  The Chairman was involved in the "No Doctor, No Village" campaign.  It is the critical end of things.  The people who get the raw deal out of all of this every time with health are poor people.  They have twice the problems of the rest of the community but  they get the same level of allocation.  That means they get half the service.  I find that hard to stand over.</p></speech>

We had a very important meeting with Deep End Ireland, which outlined the inverse care law and the deprivation index that should be applied to payments and resources for general practice.</p> <p>  Coming back to the reason we are here, the media articles to which we responded were about the medical profession overprescribing anti-depressants, benzodiazepines, painkillers and opiates.  There may or may  not be a basis for that but certainly there is a delay in people receiving chronic care for conditions such as osteoarthritis and hip and knee replacements.  I am very impressed with the prescription the professor has brought along because the patient is not on a sleeping pill or benzodiazepine.  That is probably an exception to the rule because there is an increasing demand for benzodiazepines which we, as a profession, are trying to resist.  Many years ago, GPs were accused of under-prescribing for depression.  The accusation now, perhaps, is that we are overprescribing.  Is there a response to that?</p></speech>

Each of those drug classes is a separate issue which needs to be looked at separately.  We have to stand over safe, high-quality prescribing.  Are there cases when certain drugs should not have been prescribed?  There is no doubt.  There are human errors, complex phenomena and there may be certain doctors who might overprescribe a certain drug.  That might be the case.  It is true in every health care system.  As training bodies and health care professionals, we all want to do our best and need a robust postgraduate education infrastructure which facilitates colleagues to have the very best evidence base and understanding of cost-effectiveness.  We also need to provide them with time so that they can share those decisions with patients.</p><p> Some of the drug classes are more problematic than others.  The case has been made for anti-depressants, which it is very appropriate to prescribe in very challenging psychological and social circumstances for patients without psychological services.  Benzodiazepines are sedative medications.  While raw prescribing shows that is going up, the extent to which people are prescribed a benzodiazepine for over eight weeks, which is known as chronic benzodiazepine prescribing, has decreased in the past 15 years.  I have not started a patient on a benzodiazepine for more than eight weeks in five years.  While I prescribe benzodiazepines once every few weeks, it is a short course and it relates to a variety of phenomena, for example, severe, acute bereavement.  I give one tablet for back spasm where there is extreme pain.  That is not wrong or inappropriate.  Prescribing for more than eight weeks, however, is largely a legacy issue.  Some patients are addicted and have been on the drug for more than 15 years.  The ICGP works with colleagues in the RCPI and the HSE on guidelines to manage benzodiazepines and opiates.  We will continue to work with these guidelines.  It is a challenge to tell an 82 year old who has been on a benzodiazepine to try to come off it.  It is a challenging issue.  While we can probably do better, we have to be mindful of the personal and unique circumstances of patients.  We will continue to promote the highest quality and standards going forward.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Colin Byrne, to my right, a senior adviser in the Department's water and marine advisory unit.</p> <p>  This proposal is a result of the EU REFIT process which is aimed at making EU law simpler and more cost effective.  It implements the European Commission's response to the European citizens' initiative on access to water which was submitted to it in December 2013.  It is also a contribution to meeting the targets of the UN sustainable development goals.  It has three core objectives, namely, to improve access to water, update drinking water standards, and provide more information on drinking water to consumers.</p><p>As the drinking water directive has been in place for 20 years now, it is entirely appropriate that it be revised to update existing standards taking account of the most recent international scientific advice and to provide customers with more information regarding the quality and management of drinking water.  We look forward to a detailed examination of the proposals, in conjunction with our fellow EU member states, at both official level in the working party on the environment and at ministerial level.  The current Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of Ministers is progressing work on that.<br/><br/>The European Commission proposals were published on 1 February 2018 and the Department is now engaging with key stakeholders, including the organisations before the committee, as an important part of our internal deliberative process.  We also want to seek the views of An F&oacute;ram Uisce, the national water forum.  The forum was established in 2017 under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom Collins to facilitate national stakeholder engagement on water issues and to provide a strong, independent voice and advice on water policy issues.  The proposals will also be examined by the water policy advisory committee which was established by regulation in 2014 to provide advice to the Minister on, <i>inter alia</i>, the protection and management of the aquatic environment and water resources.  With regard to the timetable for progressing the proposals, the European Commission has set us all an ambitious target of concluding negotiations with the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament under the co-decision process by May 2019 when the next European Parliament elections are due to take place.  However, it remains to be seen whether this is achievable given the range of issues to be considered.<br/><br/>At this moment in time, therefore, the Department cannot set out definitive policy positions on the proposals but I would like to highlight some issues that will require careful consideration and set out the main building blocks of the proposals.  With regard to technical standards, the Commission proposes the inclusion of a range of new parameters largely based on recommendations by the World Health Organization, WHO.  However, in a number of instances, the parametric values proposed by the Commission go beyond the WHO recommendations.  It will be important, therefore, to examine whether what is being proposed is proportionate and why there is deviation from the recommendations.  It is also important to be sure that additional monitoring provides added value.  A risk-based assessment of waters to identify possible risks to water sources is proposed.  The principle of linking up what happens at the water source with what comes out of the tap is one that we fully support and my colleagues from Irish Water and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes will brief the committee on the progress being made to protect drinking water sources.<br/><br/>The proposals would also introduce new obligations on member states to improve access to public drinking water with a specific focus on vulnerable or marginalised groups that might have inadequate access to drinking water.  The practical implications of this particular proposal will need to be examined carefully.  The proposal is also intended to contribute to a reduction in the use of plastic bottles by promoting confidence in, and consumption of, tap water and through improved access.  Given the impact of microplastics on our water environment, this is a welcome contribution.<br/><br/>The recast directive would also require the provision of significantly more information by water providers to consumers on issues such as drinking water quality, the input costs and the price of drinking water, the overall performance of the water systems, household consumption levels, the types of water treatment and information on consumer complaints.  This will present challenges for water suppliers but, as a general principle, a broadening of awareness of the value and quality of water is a laudable goal.  My colleagues and I look forward to the discussion and we would be happy to meet bilaterally with members who have a particular interest in these proposals.

I am joined today by Mr. Se&aacute;n Laffey, head of asset management.  I would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present our observations on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of water intended for human consumption.  It is not my intention to repeat the observations given by previous presenters to the committee but rather to offer the viewpoint of a provider of public water services and comment on the potential effects on the operation of water services and the delivery of capital programmes by Irish Water should the draft directive, as presented, be adopted and subsequently transposed into Irish law.  Notwithstanding any views or comments offered to the committee, Irish Water, as a public utility, will take any actions required to implement future changes made in law regulating the production and supply of drinking water.</p> <p>  The current legislation that regulates the quality of drinking water is 20 years old.  We welcome the proposed revision of the standards and the approach to the supply of water which reflects the greater understanding that has been gained over that time about how we manage our natural resources.  Article 7 proposes to formally introduce a risk-based approach to the management of bodies of water used to supply our treatment plants.  This approach is one which Irish Water is currently utilising and reflects best practice worldwide.  However, the emphasis in the proposed legislation is on the identification of hazards in a catchment serving a treatment plant and the monitoring of pollutants.  For completeness, any enacted legislation transcribing this proposal should also include provision for action to be taken to regulate, remove or mitigate identified hazards.  Hazards to drinking water quality that are identified are much more effectively and economically addressed at source rather than through the treatment process at the water treatment plant.</p> <p>  Article 10 proposes that each member state ensures that a distribution risk assessment is performed for domestic properties.  Under current legislation, Irish Water is required to test for water quality at the point of consumption, that is, the customer's tap with the responsibility for the condition of internal plumbing residing with the property owner.  This proposal fundamentally alters this position and may result in owners being required to carry out remedial actions to the water distribution systems in properties they own.</p> <p>  With respect to Article 13, which relates to access to water intended for human consumption, we will fully support whatever measures are enacted in law.  Irish Water provides a great deal of information on the quality of the drinking water we provide across all of our water supply zones.  We believe that provision of this type of information is critical to the confidence that the public have in the water they are consuming and we make such information freely available on our website.  However, the provisions, as set out in Article 14, are detailed and may, in certain circumstances, be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with.  For instance, the requirement to provide a household with the volume consumed on a yearly basis will not be possible where a household is not metered or where an address is located in an apartment block in which water consumption data is supplied on a bulk meter basis to the management company.</p> <p>  The proposed changes to the limits of current parameters used for water quality testing and the addition of new parameters will have two main effects.  First, the introduction of new testing parameters will result in increased costs and may require Irish Water to significantly alter proposed capital investment plans to meet non-compliances with those parameters.  Second, the reduction of limits for existing parameters will, in some instances, fundamentally affect our current agreed treatment strategies.  Of note is the proposed reduction in the lead limit from 10 mg per litre to 5 mg per litre.  Irish Water's strategy currently is to introduce orthophosphate dosing as a short to medium-term solution to high lead levels with a longer-term plan to remove all lead connections.  A reduction in the levels as proposed will result in the orthophosphate solution being insufficient with a move to lead removal at a substantially increased short-term cost.  This would result in a collateral effect on other investment priorities.  Additionally, it has been recognised that even in properties with no lead plumbing brass fittings can give rise to lead levels in excess of 5 mg per litre, which may necessitate some internal replumbing of properties.</p> <p>  In summary the adoption of the new proposals as set out in the revised directive will have three main effects on our operations and capital investment activities.  First, the proposed new parameters for chemicals in drinking water may result in the need for additional treatment at some plants or a revised treatment strategy at new plants, which, in turn, will result in the need for additional capital.  Second, Irish Water operations will need to alter its current monitoring programme for drinking water to include enhanced testing for new parameters, which will need further allocation of operational funding, and, third, additional staff will be needed to carry out enhanced monitoring plans and to operate more complex water treatment plants.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Aoife Loughnane, a senior inspector with the drinking water team.  I am the programme manager for the office of environmental enforcement.  The EPA welcomes the Commission proposal to review the directive in light of scientific and technical developments that have occurred since 1998.  In particular, the EPA supports the risk-based approach to the management of drinking water supplies using the water safety plan approach, which the agency has long promoted.  The EPA has assisted the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the drinking water expert group established under the existing drinking water directive and has been active in the various consultation phases prior to the publication of the recast directive.</p> <p>  The draft proposal represents a significant change compared to the existing directive and I will outline two of the main scientific and technical changes that will impact on Ireland.</p><p>The first is the change to drinking water standards.  The World Health Organization carried out a review on behalf of the Commission of the existing standards in order to identify new potential standards.  While the Commission had regard to the review, it did not adopt the recommendations of the WHO, a fact that it has been keen to stress.  The proposal includes the introduction of standards for ten new chemical parameters, namely, beta-estradiol, bisphenol A, chlorate, chlorite, haloacetic acids, microcystin-LR, nonlyphenol, PFAS (individual), PFAS (total) and uranium.  With the exception of uranium, very little historical monitoring has been carried out in Ireland within these parameters.  The Commission has chosen to adopt the existing WHO guideline values for the parameters mentioned, with the exception of chlorate and chlorite.  The adoption of a more stringent standard for chlorate would have significant consequences as it would greatly restrict the use of sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant.  If the less stringent WHO guideline value was applied, this would not be an issue.</p><p> The Commission has also decided to retain the standards for some parameters such as nickel, boron, selenium and antimony, contrary to the advice of the WHO which had recommended revising the standards upwards.  The draft proposal also proposes to reduce the lead standard to 5 g/l from 10 g/l.  As was outlined by Irish Water, this standard cannot be complied with without the full removal of all lead from the public water supply network and private and commercial plumbing systems. </p><p> A further significant change to the directive is that all exceedances of the standards must be considered to be a potential danger to human health.  Currently, each exceedance is assessed in consultation with the HSE and a decision made as to whether there is a risk.  This will be particularly problematic for those parameters where the Commission has opted to impose a standard that is more stringent than the WHO guideline value.</p><p> The second area in which there have been significant changes is monitoring.  The draft proposal proposes a significant increase in monitoring frequencies and changes to those parameters that have to be monitored.  The directive does permit a reduction in monitoring frequency for some of the parameters but only after a minimum of three years' monitoring has been carried out.  For example, a supply for 4,000 people, or around 800 cu. m, is currently required to be monitored five times a year, or four times for a small group of parameters and once for the full suite.  This will now need to be monitored ten times for the full suites of parameters irrespective.  I have included a table in the document which I do not propose to go through, giving an outline of the main implications.  It will result in significantly increased monitoring by Irish Water and of private water supplies.</p></speech>

While the NFGWS welcomes the overall proposal, there are several aspects which are likely to present a significant challenge for the private group water schemes sector.  The following is a summary our initial observations.<br/><br/><b></b>The requirement for a risk assessment approach to monitoring, from catchment to consumer, outlined in Articles 7 and 8, with particular emphasis on the source catchment, is recognised internationally as best practice in identifying risks that can potentially impact on drinking water supplies.  The NFGWS is committed to this approach as the first step in protecting drinking water supplies and has been advancing work in this area on all regulated private supplies in recent years.  However, the completion of detailed assessments and the implementation of associated measures to overcome identified risks on every scheme could pose a significant challenge in the short term.  Any timeframe for the completion of assessments and the implementation of mitigating measures that might arise needs to be closely considered from a practical perspective.  The group water schemes sector does not have the power of enforcement to implement significant measures to mitigate risk at catchment level and relies heavily on the good will of the community and the enforcement powers of the local authority to overcome significant issues. <br/><br/><b></b>On monitoring implications,<b></b>the schedule of parameters to be monitored under the proposed directive sees the addition of several new parameters to the annexed list.  The requirement to monitor water for new and emerging threats to water supplies is essential from a public health perspective.  However, the scale and frequency of water quality monitoring proposed would see a significant increase in the current monitoring requirements.  The proposal outlines significant increases in the level of compliance monitoring required, to a minimum of ten samples per annum for all small supplies of under 1,000 cu. m per day, and 52 samples per annum for supplies greater than 1,000 cu. m per day.  In addition, all suppliers are required to monitor all parameters initially, even if there is a exceptionally low risk of occurrence, until sufficient evidence is obtained to justify ruling them out.  By their nature, group water schemes are low-cost, community-owned, community-run co-operatives which would not have the capacity to carry out the increased level of quite expensive monitoring.  We looked to get an indication of the costs that would be involved for a private, accredited laboratory to carry out this testing.  We are looking at in the region of &euro;1,857 to test for all parameters.  For a group water scheme serving 30 houses, the cost over a 12-month period would be &euro;18,570, or about &euro;619 per house, which is quite significant.  From our initial research, all of the proposed new parameters cannot be analysed in this country.  For microplastics, we were unable to get a quote.<br/><br/><b></b>It appears that some parametric values in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal differ from those recommended by the WHO.  It will be difficult for individuals in group water schemes to understand and accept the need for such a change.  The WHO produces international norms for water quality and human health in the form of guidelines that are used as the basis for regulation and standard setting worldwide.  The proposal to introduce lower parametric values for certain parameters may also have practical and financial implications for the level of treatment required for certain water supplies. <br/><br/>On the practical implications for the group water schemes sector,<b></b>under the proposed directive, responsibility for carrying out monitoring is placed on the water provider.  In Ireland compliance monitoring of the private group water schemes sector is carried out by the water services authority which for group water schemes is the local authority, with only operational monitoring being carried out by schemes.  Extensive guidance training for group water schemes will be required to fulfil this obligation.  All monitoring results must also be published online, which, again, will provide a challenge for small schemes.Article 10 relates to the assessment of domestic distribution systems and monitoring for lead and legionella.  Group water schemes are not technically competent to complete such assessments.  Access and property rights would need to be considered to fulfil this role, as well as funding to implement measures to deal with issues identified. <br/><br/>The group water schemes sector's overall compliance with drinking water regulations has improved in recent years, with over 96% microbiological compliance in 2016.  With the proposed changes to parametric values and the inclusion of new parameters, there will be a period of uncertainty about future compliance levels until further analysis is completed. <br/><br/>These are just some initial observations.  The NFGWS will continue to review the proposal in the coming weeks to establish all potential implications for the group water schemes sector.  It would welcome an extensive consultation process for this proposal prior to its implementation.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if somebody could explain for the benefit of the committee what is meant by a risk based approach.  I think I understand it from the presentations, but it would be helpful to have it explained in plain English and more detail.</p> <p>  One of the things that comes to mind first is cost.  The NFGWS has given indications of cost in one area.  In its presentation Irish Water stated new testing parameters would result in increased costs and might require it to significantly alter proposed capital investment plans.  Given the heavy strains on existing infrastructure and the need for all of the capital identified to go where it is needed, is Irish Water suggesting it would be looking to absorb new costs within existing capital budgets?  Would there be a conversation between the Department and Irish Water about increased capital funding, or increased borrowing capacity, over and above what has been committed to?  We are talking about monitoring, lead piping and having to move away from the use of sodium chlorate, particularly in group schemes.  Has there been any attempt made to get a sense of the costs that would arise if the revision of the directive was to move in a certain direction?  Perhaps the answer is no at this stage.  At what point would the delegates start to have that information?</p> <p>  Beyond the issue of cost is capacity.  We know that the State is before the European Court of Justice for a failure to comply with aspects of the urban wastewater treatment directive.</p><p> My next question is as much for Irish Water and the Department as the EPA.  Given the capacity problems that limit the ability of water service providers to meet EU obligations, to what extent would an additional layer of demand be added?  This is not just about funding; it is also about staff and expertise.  What are the delegates' thoughts on that matter?</p><p> I am interested in knowing in a little more detail why the Commission rejected the WHO's recommendations.  This question is for the EPA and the Department.  Has a rationale been provided?  Has it given an explanation?  Any information on that issue would be useful.</p><p> Perhaps the EPA might give the committee its sense of the current state or standard of drinking water in public and private systems and group water schemes, based on its research.  It published a report on this issue last year.  Will it share the findings?</p><p> My last question is for the Department.  This is obviously a major issue.  It is very worthwhile for us to have this conversation.  Is there a role the committee could play between now and the deadline of May 2019 or a date beyond it, depending on developments?  Could it have an additional scrutiny role, even if is beyond its the formal legislative responsibility?  A public airing of some of the issues as the negotiations are taking place might be 6very useful from our perspective and that of the public.</p></speech>

I will start with the last question on a future role for the committee and pick up on a few of the other comments made.  </p> <p>  Other members states also have many questions about the proposals made.  They are trying to understand why the Commission has gone beyond the WHO's recommendations.  Initially, it stated as this was the direction of travel, it might as well go ahead of the WHO, but that could present practical challenges on the ground.  At the meetings of the working party in Brussels and the Council of Ministers, the process will evolve a lot.  Therefore, there would be logic in coming back to the committee towards the end of the year to update it on how the process had evolved.  From initial interactions in Brussels, I know that many questions are being raised.</p> <p>  On the risk-based approach, I will hand over to Mr. Colin Byrne who will talk about the technicalities.  Perhaps the EPA might also like to contribute.  There are other questions, but I will stop talking and hand over to Mr. Byrne.</p></speech>

It is an expensive end-of-pipe solution.  What the directive is trying to do - it is very much linked with Article 7 of the water framework directive - is bring the focus back to the catchment areas, from where the water comes in the first place.  A current issue identified in EPA water quality reports is pesticides.  A small number of water supplies have been contaminated by pesticides.  Clearly, that is the result of their use in land areas in the catchment areas.  Essentially, the risk-based approach is trying to determine the risks within the catchment area, identify the problems such as pesticides and determine exactly where the problems arise.  MCPA, for example, is a pesticide used to control rushes in damp areas.  It is a question of trying to pinpoint those areas and engage with relevant stakeholders to adopt best practice in the use of such chemicals and, in turn, protect the drinking water source.</p> <p>  My colleagues in the EPA and Irish Water might want to add more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Darragh Page" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032100002#D00400"><p>In its simplest terms, the risk-based approach involves determining whether there is something that might have an impact on the quality of drinking water in the catchment, treatment process or distribution network.  Once it is identified, it is a matter of deciding what one is going to do to deal with the risk and ensure it will not become a reality.</p> <p>  On the Commission's interpretation, it has pushed the risk-based approach to monitoring and is not considering the wider risk-based approach.  For example, it is requiring the monitoring of microcystin which is blue-green algae in all water supplies, even though it occurs only in supplies that originate from lakes.  It cannot occur in groundwater.  Therefore, there is an issue with how the directive has been written in that context.</p> <p>  Let me refer to some of the other questions asked in so far as they pertain to the EPA.  As to why the Commission has opted for standards that are different from those of the WHO, we are really not clear at this stage.  At the recent meeting many member states were quite surprised that the Commission had taken the approach it had.  In fact, the WHO's representative made a point of stressing that the recommendations applied were not the WHO's recommendations.  We are not quite clear on the reason.  The Commission seems to have taken a precautionary approach with many of the standards and in including some of the standards that have been included.  In failing to remove some of the ones where clearly there is no possibility of the presence of certain contaminants in the water supply, the precautionary approach has been taken.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the quality of drinking water in Ireland.  The EPA publishes a report every year that examines all of the monitoring carried out by Irish Water and local authorities of private water supplies.  What we have seen is that microbiological compliance is very high in the public water supply system.  The level is 99.9% and the figure has improved dramatically in the past ten to 15 years.  The level of chemicals compliance is relatively high, but we do have a problem with trihalomethanes, a disinfectant by-product of the reaction of chlorine with coloured water.  We are seeing improvements, but it is still an issue.  An issue will definitely arise under the directive if the standard for chlorate is put at 0.25.  We will have significant difficulties in complying with the directive in using chlorate simply because of the amount of chlorine that needs to be used in treating surface water supplies.  It is a particular problem in Ireland because we have the highest proportion of water which comes from rivers and lakes by comparison with any other European country.  Most European countries use groundwater predominantly.</p></speech>

We have carried out quite a number of studies in the past four years of the sources available to us.  We firmly believe many of the chemicals about which we are talking are best controlled at source and on a catchment basis, rather than by allowing them to get to a point where we are required to treat for them.</p> <p>  I will talk a little about capital, but I will preface my comments by referring to the outcome if the draft proposal were included in law and all of the requirements were introduced exactly as they stand.  If we had to deal with the chemicals listed, the ones that would come in as part of the raw water supply would, according to a quick calculation, require an investment of additional capital of between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million.  We would have to provide for tertiary treatment, which would probably require products such as activated charcoal.</p></speech>

Depending on how often we would have to change the filter, operational expenditure could be as high as &euro;100 million per year, in addition to what we are spending.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the money would come from existing or additional budgets.  We have not examined that issue.  We are seeking to spend in the region of &euro;650 million this year on capital infrastructure, which represents an historical high.  We hope to maintain such a level of expenditure.  On the supply chain and our own capacity, we find that a sum of approximately &euro;650 million per year is comfortable for us.  We do not propose to spend any more than that figure.  There is never any difficulty with spending money; it is a matter of getting value from it.</p></speech>

We have a quality assurance system which allows us to identify potential hazards and take steps to eliminate them.  It is in that regard that we see a weakness in the directive.  While it is good in many respects in taking a risk-based approach to drinking water, as stated by Mr. Page, it is overly excessive in monitoring a lot of parameters.  For example, there are 180 group water schemes with bore hole supplies, predominantly groundwater.  The majority of the remainder use springs which produce very good water.  Since 2007, taking account of all of the parametric analyses that have been made, we have been close to a figure of 100% for all of the chemical parameters.  If we could use this evidence retrospectively such that we would not have to carry out certain tests, that would be a good starting point for us.  One parameter which has not been yet mentioned and that will have a major affect is turbidity - dirt in water that comes from a pipe.  The parametric value in that regard is one nephelometric unit.  Under the proposal, water suppliers will be asked to produce it at a level of between 0.3 and 0.5.  As Mr. Page pointed out, that means that we would not be able to use a slow sand filtration system anymore because in putting it through a slow sand filter it would increase the level upwards.  That will require the installation of a filtration system in advance, even in a good spring or bore hole supply.  We have not costed the proposal, but it will be very be significant.  There is a need for a rethink on this issue.  That said, we agree that there is a need for closer monitoring of turbidity as an indicative parameter.  The Environmental Protection Agency has been preaching this for years.  We are not afraid of monitoring.  We believe it is good, but the monitoring proposed is grossly excessive and potentially crippling.</p></speech>

If one was dealing with a full shaft system, major capital investment would be required.  The level of capital investment would be smaller in the case of a single sleeve filtration system.  It would only be by trial and error that one would know what filtration system would be required and that would require a fair degree of monitoring of turbidity.</p></speech>

In the first instance, these are EU proposals.  It is not a directive or a done deal.  It was stated other countries had similar queries and reservations about what was being put forward.  In any set of negotiations one does not expect to walk out at the point at which one walked in.  May I take it that the Department will be co-ordinating a response which will be cognisant of all of the stakeholders for whom this issue is relevant?</p> <p>  On the associated capital costs for Irish Water, it is 20 years since the standards were updated.  I would have thought there was an expectation that this was in the offing such that Irish Water, given its expertise, would have catered for it but so be it.  I know that there are negotiations taking place on revising the service level agreements with local authorities and that cost savings are expected to be achieved.  When everything is agreed between all of the parties, including the Department, Irish Water, the local authorities and the associated unions, any costs saving could be offset by Irish Water in whatever way it saw fit.  However, the group water schemes do not have this option available to them.  While their funding has been reinstated, there should be a commitment from the Government in advance of any agreement that it will meet any additional cost that may be incurred by them arising from this proposal.  In the main, group water schemes are voluntary organisations and they will be challenged far more in this area than Irish Water.  The Department should be mindful of that commitment and our expectation, as public representatives, that it will be stated, categorically and vehemently.  We acknowledge that within the service level agreement which was rushed into some years ago there is a commitment from all parties to renegotiate it.  As I said, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, but there is an expectation on everybody's part that there will be cost savings in the event that the commitment period to 2025 is reduced to 2021.  The negotiations are ongoing.  The Department needs to come clean on the areas that will benefit from cost savings, or if it is solely the reserve of Irish Water, notwithstanding the challenge to meet the demands of an old and creaking system which is only being invested in to the levels one would have expected in the past ten or 12 years, rather than preceding decades. </p> <p>  As I said, this is only the start of the process.  There is an expectation that there will be improvements in the quality of water that will arrive through the tap, which is only right and proper and we will support all efforts to do this.  I would have thought the WHO recommendations went as far as one needed to go.  I do not see any need to go beyond them and neither does anyone we represent.  This should be reflected in the negotiations and consultations with the European Union and I wish all involved every success.  The committee is more than willing to provide any help or assistance required in the intervening months.  We would welcome an update during the course of the deliberations such that we would not be hit with a sledgehammer come next May.</p></speech>

What steps are being taken to have filtration systems or other mechanisms to ensure the public is drinking high quality water, not water that is contaminated by the new beast, of which we have become aware through different publications in the United States and the United Kingdom?

I will deal with the questions from Deputy Cowen.  He is right that this is the start of a negotiating process.  The challenge for Ireland as a member state is to balance in the best way possible the environmental and health outcomes with achieving the best cost-benefit outcomes such that we are not spending unnecessary money on stuff that will not achieve health or environmental benefits.  With regard to co-ordinating that response, the Department has already had initial meetings with all the colleagues that are here.  We want to talk to other potential actors that would have an interest in this, for example, the Department of Health.  I have already mentioned An F&oacute;ram Uisce which brings under its umbrella environmental, industry, agriculture and consumers - the whole gamut of parties interested in water.  With regard to support to the group water sector, the Department and the Minister provide strong and consistent support to that sector.  The potential cost implications of these proposals, both for the group water sector and Irish Water, is at the forefront of our minds and of other member states.  The reports that we are getting back from Brussels say that we are not alone in this and that many member states are raising these specific questions.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's questions about whether the Commission is going beyond its powers with these proposals, our initial view is that it is probably not but this is something that will have to be teased out in the working party initially in Brussels, to ensure that there is no overreach there.  With regard to Article 13 and the proposals on access to water in public places, this is an issue that many other member states have raised too because there are the practical implications of it versus the desirability.  We will definitely have to tease that out.  I do not know if there are any technical aspects that Mr. Byrne might want to add to that.</p></speech>

It is very early days and we are still examining it but we would be concerned that that is not taken into account, particularly with the broad requirement for access to water, which could be quite different in southern member states compared to northern member states.  There are some other aspects, as colleagues mentioned earlier.  The monitoring requirement is quite onerous and we think there needs to be an element of judgment and balance in how the risk assessment is carried out.</p></speech>

Some work was funded by the EPA in the past and some very recent useful work was done on microplastics as part of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, looking at the levels found.  We are effectively finding microplastics in almost all drinking water samples to some degree or another.  The levels are relatively low.  They are usually in the range of between one and ten microparticles per 500 ml.  We have been looking around Europe to see what else is being done.  A limited amount of research is being done around Europe but it is only looking at the levels of microplastics present.  There has not necessarily been a huge amount of work done on the impact and health implications of it.  The EPA is about to launch a new research call.  A project that we have identified as one we would like to proceed in the next call is a project to evaluate the potential human health impacts of microplastics and nanoparticles.  That call will be going out in April.  We will start looking to see if we can get some research in that particular area.  Microplastics are mentioned in passing in the directive but not in detail because the difficulty is that while we all recognise that microplastics are becoming an issue, the health implications have not been determined yet, so setting a standard is not possible at this time.  It is something that most member states, if not all, are actively looking at.</p></speech>

We do not test for it so we cannot offer any views of the efficacy or otherwise of our treatment systems at the moment.  All we know from research is that microplastics, by their very nature, range from particles which are extraordinarily small up to ones which our treatment processes would catch quite easily.  I would imagine that, across a range of sizes, our processes have different efficiencies.</p></speech>

A study was done on 20 lakes across Europe.  One of our lakes, in County Monaghan, came in second worst with regard to microparticles.  It is ubiquitous.  We know it is in the environment.  It will be an additional level of monitoring that we have to do this year that is not even included as part of the parameters.  We have not been able to get somebody who can actually do it here yet.  It is a worry for everybody.  We are in the early stages and will take our guidance from the EPA.</p></speech>

Can I take it that the witnesses think the current draft might have some subsidiarity issues that will have to be teased out during the course of the negotiations?  Equally, on the basis of the queries about going beyond the World Health Organization, WHO, recommendations and testing for certain types of things that may not be relevant, would the witnesses be concerned that what is currently being proposed may not be proportional?  Are those issues that the witnesses will seek to tease out in the negotiations?  The other question arises with regard to enforcement.  I take it that Irish Water is already working on the risk-based approach.  If that becomes the norm everywhere and if, for example, there are problems at source with pesticides, some of which might have nothing to do with the operations of the water services provider but might come from agriculture or industry, who enforces that?  If, at a subsequent stage, the State is found to be in breach, is that part of the conversation and what are the considerations there?</p> <p>  Finally, while it is slightly off-topic but relevant, there has been some media coverage recently and we previously considered in the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services the idea of a drinking water inspectorate, whether that is something located as an additional function of the EPA or independent.  Should we now be talking about that in the context of this rather than having Irish Water or the local authorities as the only inspector of water supplies?  Maybe it is a question for the EPA.  Is this something that we now need to seriously consider as an additional piece of infrastructure to ensure compliance with standards?</p></speech>

One relates to the reduction in lead standards.  Maybe Irish Water could answer what percentage of the pipe network is currently lead.  What is the timeframe it proposes to have the lead removed, regardless of the new standards coming in?  I have a specific question for Mr. Page.  He mentioned lakewater and algae bloom.  We have had a number of issues with that in Vartry Reservoir over the last years.  We do not seem to be able to get a handle on it.  Algae bloom nearly brought the supply to Dublin to a stop this year.  We are not dealing with the current issues that we are facing either.  That may be a point of interest.</p></speech>

I want to clarify what role local authorities will have in this.  I know there are big plans.  The last time we had Irish Water in, we were speaking about 2021.  I welcome that the witnesses said the requirement to monitor water for new and emerging threats to the water supply is essential from a public health perspective.  We know how crucial that is.  The witnesses know how important it is.  What will the role of local authorities be and how will the witnesses' organisations and local authorities work together?  Will there be talks with local authorities, or what is happening?  Legislation will probably affect local authorities.  I know that in my local area, we have many old water pipes and massive issues with that.  What do the witnesses plan for that?</p></speech>

We are working away on that.  As Mr. O'Leary outlined, our lead strategy was predicated on a two part approach.</p><p>The first part was that we would look at using orthophosphate to reduce lead levels in properties to an acceptable standard.  Then the long-term plan was that we would remove all lead.  To reassure Deputy Casey, none of the Irish Water public network has any lead in it.  All of the lead we are dealing with is on private property or in houses generally built before the 1970s.  One of the main issues we have with reducing the lead standard to 5 mg per litre, which is an incredibly low standard of five millionths of a gram of lead per litre which is effectively zero, is that orthophosphate will not get one below that standard all the time so lead replacement is the only way to go.  The other issue we are encountering is that modern brass fittings are between 5% and 7% lead and one will get the 5 mg per litre limit from the brass fittings even in new houses.  We are talking about a limit which effectively means that one can have no components in one's water distribution system which have any type of lead in them.</p></speech>

They would rest primarily with the local authorities but we work very closely with them.  On the pesticide issue, for example, we work very closely with all the stakeholders such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the local authorities to try to eliminate the pesticides from the catchment.  However, Irish Water does not have enforcement powers within the catchment.  One of the concerns we have with the risk based approach is that we can identify the risk but we cannot deal directly with it.  In terms of pesticides, however, there is very good cross-functional co-operation in addressing the issue with all the stakeholders.</p></speech>

In terms of whether there is a subsidiarity issue, that is something we have to determine by the middle of April when we have to send our comments back.  We will take on board all of the comments here but there is still another piece of work to be done collaboratively on this.  Regarding the drinking water inspectorate, as the Deputy said that is a little off topic so I am not in a position to comment on it.</p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor had a question about the role for local authorities.  There is an incredibly important role for local authorities in terms of collaboration and community engagement.  My colleague, Mr. Colin Byrne, has been leading on the river basin management plan so I will ask him to comment quickly on that.</p></speech>

That involves collaboration between Irish Water, local authorities, the EPA and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, recognising that Irish Water's role does not extend beyond the boundaries of the treatment plant and that it is reliant on local authorities to enforce whatever relevant environmental legislation is in place if that is deemed to be a cause of the problem.  Undoubtedly this proposal will bring the governance of drinking water source protection into more focus.  While we have a good working arrangement in place for this river basin planning cycle up to 2021, I have no doubt that we will have to revisit this and look at the governance into the future.</p></speech>

A review is currently being carried out of the best approach to deliver that service.  Whether a shared service might be considered is a business case being examined at present.  It is probably pertinent at this time when we are talking about the roles, particularly the monitoring and the water service authority element of it.  It fits nicely in with that.  The review needs to take account of it.</p> <p>  I should mention the work we are involved in with regard to source protection.  While enforcement is certainly needed, in many cases we actively try to engage with the communities to try to get community buy-in.  We are probably unique in that sense.  The group water scheme sector is owned by the communities the schemes serve so we have been engaged with a number of projects.  The local authorities water and communities office, LAWCO, has been involved with a number of projects with us and we have plans for further projects in this area.  We should try to create a behavioural change within the catchment rather than rely solely on the enforcement element.  That will be a key issue into the future.</p></speech>

We can offer consumption data to those properties.  There are approximately 500,000 remaining properties that are not metered.  The best we can do at present is offer them what the average consumption would be for a property of their type.  As was outlined by Michael O'Leary, there is also an issue with multi-unit developments.  An apartment block is generally managed by management companies.  We put a bulk meter on those properties but we do not meter individual properties.  If that article is transposed into law there is an issue in that regard with us complying with it.</p></speech>

The purpose of the first part of today's session is to meet representatives from the Policing Authority to discuss two main issues.  First, we will revisit the committee's report, published in December 2016, in respect of Garda oversight and accountability and consider what progress has been made in this area in the meantime, including implementation of the committee's recommendations and, second, we will discuss issues surrounding the recording and classification of Garda homicide figures, including, in particular, the review being conducted by the force into the classification of homicides and reasons for the delay in publishing the findings of that review and furnishing a report to the Policing Authority.</p> <p>  I welcome from the Policing Authority Ms Josephine Feehily, chairperson, and Ms Helen Hall, chief executive.  Before we begin, I have to offer the same caution to members and guests alike.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I invite Ms Feehily to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I must apologise at the outset as the version of the statement that we sent initially contained some typographical errors.  Another version was supplied to the clerk late last night.  We will blame the holiday weekend.</p> <p>  The Chairman has invited us today to discuss four topics.  I thank him for the opportunity to make these opening remarks.  It may be helpful if I touch on each topic briefly.  The first topic is issues surrounding ICT, specifically the Garda internal audit service audit report 2017 in respect of ICT payment processes.  The position on this item is that the Policing Authority does not receive the Garda internal audit reports on a routine basis.  They are mandated, undertaken and overseen by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na audit committee, the members of which we do appoint.  We are aware of media reports about this particular audit but it is appropriate to allow the audit committee to do its job first, before we get involved.  We will shortly be receiving the annual report of the Garda audit committee.  We will be meeting the chair of that committee and will have an opportunity to raise any matters arising from the annual report.</p> <p>  The second item was the report from the chief administrative officer in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the history of email usage in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the mechanisms for protecting security.  I understand that the Garda has supplied the committee with a copy of the relevant report and I believe the committee heard evidence on this point recently from Garda senior management, which broadly corresponds with the information supplied to the authority.  The main point I want to make this morning is that the roll-out of a new enterprise content management system is under way.  It is an important step as it enables the secure, remote access of files from mobile devices and negates the need to send files via email.  The sooner that is completed, the better.  We would also like to see the key commitments the Garda has made to us being met, namely, to have in place a policy on Internet and email usage.  </p> <p>  The third item is progress since the committee's report in respect of Garda oversight and accountability of December 2016 to which the Chairman referred.  By way of the update requested, I thought the most useful thing I could do would be to circulate two important documents the authority has prepared and published recently.  One is the authority's statutory report on its effectiveness and the adequacy of its functions at the end of two years.  Committee members had several questions on this matter when I last appeared before them.  The second document is the authority's submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Between them, these two reports address and set out the authority's position on many of the key matters discussed in the committee's report on oversight and accountability.  For example, we call for the removal of duplication and ambiguity as to who does what in Garda oversight and accountability.  We call for steps to be taken to ensure that there is a single pair of eyes on Garda performance, either by including security in the remit of a future policing authority or by having authority members included on a security oversight body.  We call for much greater transparency by the Garda, including the extension of the Freedom of Information Acts to a broader range of Garda functions.  We call for a future policing authority to have significant oversight competence in respect of the use of resources, both people and money.  We also raise concerns about training and formation, culture and integrity.</p> <p>  The fourth item, which the Chairman has also mentioned, is the review of domestic homicides.  As I said at the authority's most recent meeting in public in February, in many ways this has been the most frustrating and most troubling piece of work in which the authority has engaged.  We began to examine the matter in March of last year.  We are still not finished and we are still not fully satisfied.  From the outset, the authority has made it clear that its key concern is the risk that wrong classification could have affected the quality of Garda investigations.</p><p>We have emphasised time and again the importance of good data for intelligence, public policy, risk assessment and crime prevention.  This is not confined to domestic violence risks.  </p><p> Related to that, the Policing Authority is concerned not to prematurely or unnecessarily alarm families.  For that reason, and for reasons of practicality, much of the authority&rsquo;s detailed work on this matter has been carried out outside of public fora through our committee structure or between officials.  Before the most recent meeting in public about the homicide review, we pressed the Garda for assurances that in the 12 cases where it was reclassifying a death upwards into or within the homicide category, family liaison had been put in place and families had been contacted.</p><p> The authority&rsquo;s approach to assessing any significant aspect of Garda performance is to gather data and information from a broad range of sources.  We then compare and critically examine the information, and use it to inform ourselves and develop our oversight approach to a particular matter.  With the Garda, we persist in private and public until we are satisfied or report to the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p> Our approach to the homicide data was no different.  For example in addition to the Garda, authority officials engaged with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  We had the benefit of Garda Inspectorate reports and a report from a Department of Justice and Equality working group on the crime counting rules.  Since late March 2017, we had intelligence in addition to the official Garda documentation.  Since then, there have been at least 20 formal authority meetings on the topic in plenary or committee and as many or more engagements at official level. </p><p> Several documents received from the Garda were rejected as inadequate, beginning with the correspondence we received for our meeting in public on 27 April 2017 where those watching would have been left in no doubt that the authority was not best pleased.  Certainly, the media reports the following day got the drift.  The paperwork which we received did not merit the title of report and I believe I made that very clear publicly.  </p><p> Professional tensions within the Garda organisation regarding this matter were very clearly visible to us at the April 2017 public meeting, after which we had four key concerns.  Despite assurances, was there an article 2 compliant investigation in each case?  Were there arrangements in place to speak to families?  Had the PULSE records been updated with sufficient information to mitigate risks to potential victims?  Had the Garda analysis service been fully involved and signed off on the work?</p><p> I wish to address the concerns regarding the role of the Policing Authority and the witnesses, Ms Galligan and Ms West, from the analysis service.  I am taking it, based on the committee&rsquo;s discussion in public session and related comments, that Ms West and Ms Galligan have given their permission for certain matters relating to their contact with the authority to be discussed with the committee.  I believe the chief executive raised this matter yesterday with the clerk to the committee.  </p><p> At the outset, I would like to say that their evidence about how they were treated in their workplace sounded deplorable and is very concerning.  It speaks to issues of culture and speaking out, matters which the authority raises continually.  Differing perspectives and professional tensions are healthy and are to be expected, and ought to be welcomed.  Although it is an employment matter, their experiences seem in this instance to have made the whole review more contentious than it needed to be.</p><p> Returning to the homicide review, the position is that the authority has many sources of intelligence and information regarding the review - perhaps more than Ms West and Ms Galligan realised - and has done a huge amount of work.  The concerns which they brought to the authority&rsquo;s attention were already well known to us before their contact.  At a point where the analysts seemed to be having difficulty getting access to certain information, authority members and staff were being offered opportunities to review investigation files, which we declined, and be briefed in detail on cases. </p><p> In fact, having reviewed their evidence to the committee, I can honestly say that there was very little of substance in it about the review which we did not know or have grounds to believe since late March or early April of last year.  Far from being misled, the authority rejected the document submitted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to our 27 April 2017 meeting in very strong terms.</p><p>In addition to expressing serious disappointment at the late arrival of correspondence at 8.30 p.m. the night before, we wrote to the Commissioner to express significant concerns about its tone, content and accuracy.  This was also covered by the media subsequently.  </p><p> The analyst's professional concerns were widely known, and the fact they were in contact with the authority could not have been considered by the authority to be confidential.  For example, the analysts indicated it was a member of senior Garda management who provided the personal contact details of the authority staff member who was first telephoned in April 2017.  In the interests of transparency, it was Garda management which gave us a copy of the letter of 11 May, addressed to several people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This letter sent out the concerns it had and its disquiet about them.  The analysts were advised by authority staff that we had the letter dated 11 May.  They were given an assurance that the authority was live to all of their concerns and that those concerns would be followed up.  They were followed up.  That letter further underlined the professional tensions around this whole matter which were already very visible to the authority.  </p><p> The names and the facts and details which caused the analysts' disquiet was a matter of record and in no way confidential.  However, the context of their direct communication with the authority subsequently was recognised as sometimes sensitive, and it was treated as confidential.  The analysts specifically declined to allow later correspondence to be shared with Garda management, and that was fully honoured.  </p><p> In terms of where are we now, the committee is aware that the Policing Authority received a report dated 21 September.  This report differed so much from the April correspondence that initially we did not accept it either.  Following robust engagement over the period from October to January, we have very recently reached a position where we accept that a police investigation did take place in each of the 41 cases which are the subject of this review.  It is important that I say this for the information of the community.  However, we have not yet been reassured about the quality of those investigations.  At an authority committee meeting on 3 November 2017, we pressed for and secured agreement from the Garda for a peer review of the investigations in a number of cases.  The Garda gave evidence to the committee recently about its approach to this work.</p><p> On the question of classification, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has re-classified 12 of the 41 cases upwards, either into homicide or between classifications within the homicide group.  We understand now how those positions were reached.  From our work, we would say that some change was made to the classification of a further 16 cases, meaning that only 13 are unchanged.  Authority staff have personally confirmed that the PULSE system has been appropriately updated in these cases, which is really important from the point of view of risks to any potential victims.  The Garda have given us assurances that in those 12 re-classified cases, the families had been contacted before we discussed the matter in public.  That was very important to us. </p><p> Another concern related to the role of the analysis service.  We have been assured, as has this committee at its recent hearings, that the analysis service signed off on the report given to the authority in September and that it will be fully involved in the next phase.  The authority intends to meet the working group charged with the next phase, which I understand includes Ms Galligan and Ms West, to ensure that it fully understands our concerns.  It is important to us that this working group is managed in a way which allows all voices to be respectfully heard and considered.  It is also important to us that it proceeds with some pace and reaches conclusions which we can interrogate.  Furthermore. we will require interim reports.  In the meantime, the homicide review remains a standing item on our agenda, and given the timelines outlined for the next phase it will clearly be there for some time to come.  </p><p> The authority takes its statutory responsibility to oversee Garda performance very seriously.  Our work is broad-ranging and complex.  I hope I have provided a flavour of the approach we have adopted.  It uses external performance indicators where they exist, and intelligence or information from a broad range of other sources in addition to that we receive from the Garda.  Crime classification, PULSE, data quality and performance management are by now enduring themes for us and the 2018 policing plan contains some important actions in this regard.</p><p>At all times the authority is mindful that it must strike a careful balance between challenging An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and undermining it, and between transparency and concern for victims and families. </p></speech>

There are many questions and while my colleagues will inquire about other areas, I wish to focus on two areas in regard to Ms Feehily's opening statement.</p> <p>  In her comments on the Garda report that was presented to her in April, her tone and the reportage of that meeting clearly indicated that the Policing Authority was unhappy with the report.  Can Ms Feehily enlarge on that and does she think it was sloppy?  Does she think there was a deliberate attempt by senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to present a report to the Policing Authority which would mislead it?  Does she believe that items were specifically excluded from that report because Garda management did not want them included, either because they felt they would not reflect well on them or for some other reason of which we are not aware?  Did a process take place in the preparation of that report which was not accidental and was not caused by a bad management decision here or there but by a deliberate decision by the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to mislead the Policing Authority? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.528" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018032100002#N00300"><p>I have asked myself that question on an ongoing basis.  I do not think so.  At the time, the Policing Authority was 15 months old.  The relationship between the authority and the Garda has been a maturing one in the past couple of years.  There was a certain lack of understanding that when the authority said it wanted something, it actually meant it.  In fact, a senior person recently said to me that they are now realising that when we ask for something, we do not go away.  We were asking for material.  For perhaps 95 years, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not have the experience of being obliged to publically explain themselves in regard to minute details of management.  I apologise for meandering.</p> <p>  I think that the professional tensions had not been resolved.  The professional tensions that we saw were not just those between garda&iacute; and the analyst service.  That is an important point to make.  We also saw professional tensions within the Garda service itself.  As those tensions were not resolved, they gave us a submission that was certainly inadequate.  It was about a half a dozen pages long and it came too late, at 8.30 p.m. the night before a public meeting.  I cannot put myself in the minds of those concerned and know their intention but I would say that it was more that things were not resolved than it was a deliberate attempt to mislead.  </p></speech>

Does she not think, because of some things that have transpired since that meeting took place and some things of which we are now aware, that it might even be naive to believe that there was not a deliberate attempt to mislead?</p></speech>

I think that is fair.  However, that would be to underestimate the capacity of the authority and its members to analyse material and to see through the presentation of material.  Perhaps if we had accepted it, it would have gone away.  I do not know.  We did not accept it and at our most recent public meeting, we received an on-the-record acknowledgement from the acting Garda Commissioner that the material was inaccurate.  That is helpful.</p></speech>

How would Ms Feehily classify the way that report was presented to her?  They have had four months to do it.  Does she believe it was an honest attempt to produce a report or does she believe there was a residual attempt to keep her in the dark?</p></speech>

We had asked for a report with a start and an end, with a methodology and an outcome.  It had the appearance of a report but when we got it, because of our experiences in April and the work we had been doing between April and September, we did not take it at face value.  We did a compare-and-contrast exercise between the two sets of documentation and set it all out on a big spreadsheet, before sending it back to them with a thousand questions.  We had many committee meetings and official engagements, on which Ms Hall can elaborate, in which we questioned every line of it before, in February this year, we were prepared to accept that we had got the information we wanted.</p></speech>

Although I accept what Ms Feehily says on the subject, to many people it seems - at least initially in the April presentation - some deliberately misleading information was supplied.</p> <p>  I have questions on the manner in which the Policing Authority worked on this report.  Does it have a view on how it should engage with people within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who decide to make contact, be they serving members of the force or civilian staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.534" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018032100002#O00400"><p>I will turn it the other way around.  We have a policy in place on how we engage as an oversight body with the characteristics of a regulator.  We have to engage in a structured way, for good order, with the body we are overseeing because we have to be able to hold it to account for the material that comes into us and for the quality of that engagement.  Formal liaison structures are in place and we observe the principle of transparency.  Visits made by members and meetings at which we ask for documents are all funnelled through a liaison officer so that there is full line of sight on that engagement within the Garda.  We learned at an early stage that we cannot hold the Commissioner or the senior team to account for material that does not come formally to us as such material does not have any status.  We have made it clear to the Commissioner that people who attend the authority have to have the power to commit the organisation and the people we meet have to speak for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, rather than themselves.  We are an overseer and not a complaints body, and that is a really important distinction.  We get a lot of contacts from individual garda&iacute;, serving and retired, and the vast majority of what they want to tell us is appropriate to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  The statutory plan is to refer them to GSOC and if other people want to talk to us about something that is not a GSOC matter, they have to come as part of a Garda delegation.</p></speech>

Even allowing for what Ms Feehily said was a policy, she seems to have adjusted that half way through because she seems to have engaged with them by indicating she accepted their letters and kept them confidential at a later stage, etc.  However, from their evidence to us, Ms Feehily ignored their initial contacts.  There was no response.  Does Ms Feehily consider that was an appropriate way to act as a policing authority, having been contacted by people who were trying to supply very relevant and pertinent information?  In her statement, she said she felt she had the knowledge and a range of sources outside them, of which they would be unaware.  Does that excuse the way in which she engaged with those two people, or is it that she had a blanket policy that she would not engage with people coming to her? </p></speech>

The first contact from Ms West resulted in a telephone call back to her - that was a request to attend a meeting that had been arranged for later that week.  The response which was given to her was that it was a matter for the Garda as to who attended the meeting.  We had no objection to them attending the meeting, but it was a matter for the Garda as to who would come.  It was a meeting that was scheduled with the analysis service.  That was the first contact.  It was not ignored.  They phoned, they asked a question and they got a telephone call back saying that this is the position.  It was an entirely unremarkable, uncontentious unengagement.  It was simply a courtesy.</p> <p>  The second contact resulted in a call back to them, again as a courtesy, which pointed out to them that we had their letter to the senior Garda team and that all the items on that agenda were on our agenda.  We were live to all their concerns and that we would be following up on them.  They were not ignored.  Each time they contacted us by telephone, they received a telephone call back and they were given assurances that their concerns were on our agenda and we were live to them.  In many ways, I would say the most useful service the authority could do for Ms Galligan and Ms West was to listen to their concerns from their official paperwork and use that paperwork to continue to persist and follow through in our questioning with the Garda.</p></speech>

I read their evidence carefully over the weekend.  I think that at no point did they say that, rather I think what they said was that a meeting simply did not occur.  They were careful in how they represented the engagement with us.  All I am saying is that from our point of view we believe that in the first two instances in response to their telephone contact they received responses, assurances and thanks.  Their subsequent correspondence was of an entirely different nature, entirely confidential, and was treated as such.  They were not prepared to allow us to use their subsequent correspondence which left us with a very significant dilemma and so we respected their confidence and thanked them again.</p></speech>

Is there an internal process that the Policing Authority should be examining in regard to how it deals with people who contact it in these kinds of circumstances?  Ms Feehily seems to say she did nothing wrong and that the authority does not need to change anything.  Does she actually believe that if in the future she receives a communication from either garda&iacute; or civilian members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a more robust effort should be made to determine whether it is a useful communication?</p></speech>

I would never say we would not consider and revise our procedures.  I must return, however, to my earlier remark.  As an oversight body, we are in daily contact with the Garda at official and authority levels and by telephone, letter, etc.  For us, the Garda organisation is the body we oversee.  It is not a matter of making a distinction between civilian and uniformed members; we oversee the performance of the organisation.  As an oversight body and a regulator, we could be at severe risk of becoming conflicted, and that is why we have these procedures.  Within the constraint concerning how we avoid becoming conflicted, becoming involved in an employment matter that is not our business or becoming involved with an issue that has internal dynamics for which we are not responsible or of which we could never be fully aware, we have to be extraordinarily careful not to become conflicted.  That is the reason we have procedures in place that mean all our engagements are on the record.  They take place through the liaison office and they are transparent.  The Commissioner and the Commissioner's senior team have a line of sight on our engagement.  Then we can say to the Commissioner this is the information we received.</p> <p>  As a regulator and overseer, one must guard oneself absolutely against becoming involved in factions that might cause one to become conflicted.  Within that principle, we will absolutely revisit and review in light of this experience what we might have done differently but we would always have that constraint because we regulate the entire organisation.  It could just as easily be that we would have a performance issue with one side this week and another side next week.  Therefore, we have to be extraordinarily careful and take the official front door.</p></speech>

The vast majority of people in the Garda, and sometimes recently retired members, raise issues in the statutory frame that are actually matters for GSOC, particularly in respect of the enlarged GSOC responsibilities.  We make sure they know that and we help them.  We try to explain to them the limits of our functions.  I have no problem with the contact but we have to be careful how we handle the contact and not leave ourselves exposed as a regulator.</p></speech>

I echo Ms Feehily's sentiments on getting this done as quickly as possible and on circulating the information as quickly as possible because there are victims, families and people with genuine concerns.  In the section of her opening remarks that dealt with how the investigation is proceeding, she noted that there were a number of reclassifications and a number of instances in the 12 cases.  Does she believe overall that there has been some type of enlargement and that the reporting of the distortion in the figures has almost become out of proportion by comparison with the reality?  Might this have come about because of the internal arguments within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that have arisen because of the reports?  Would it be accurate to take it from the way Ms Feehily phrased her opening remarks that the argument on classification is very technical in many instances and, importantly, that the authority was happy at all times that an actual investigation took place?</p></speech>

It takes place within a set of rules called the crime accounting rules, which are even more technical and in some cases were at the heart of the issues.  Professional disagreement about the balance of probability can go on and on.  In many cases, the classification debate is technical.  It would be unfortunate if that unnecessarily worried people who are unaffected.  That is one reason we handle a lot of this in private.</p> <p>  We will be uneasy, however, until we are assured about the quality of the investigation.  It took us until February to be prepared to say we are now satisfied that there was an investigation.  What worries us is whether, if the classification was flawed at the beginning, the Garda will do the right things to make sure an investigation proceeds in a manner that is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of securing crime scenes and following lines of inquiry.  That has been our question since last April, and we are not there yet regarding quality.  We are at the point, albeit quite a bit later, where we now have evidence of significant investigative activity in all of the cases.  That is reassuring.</p></speech>

At our most recent public meeting, we were visibly annoyed over having received material at 6.30 p.m. the evening before in regard to a review of the policing of the Jobstown protest.  Whether those concerned like it or not, it means they will have to ensure a second outing on the matter because we are now going to consider the material in April.  We receive significant material very late all the time.</p> <p>  We also have major concerns over data quality.  Again, that sounds technical but it is not.  Homicide data comprise a really good example.  Issues have arisen regarding breath-test and homicide data.  There is a casual attitude to data and recording data on PULSE.  The committee will probably be discussing with the Chief Inspector from the Garda Inspectorate his recent report on child sexual abuse.  One will find data quality issues at play in that regard.  We have had issues over what was or was not on PULSE in the Jobstown review we got.</p> <p>  We have decided this year that no matter what policing topic we are discussing, we will examine it through the lenses of data quality, governance, supervision and ethics because the issue is just pervasive.</p></speech>

It is absolutely disappointing and unacceptable to hear that the attitude still has not changed, if what Ms Feehily is outlining is the process.</p></speech>

This frustration runs right through the authority.</p> <p>  With regard to the broader issue on data quality, there is a large cultural dimension.  We spoke about this when I was here before.  Trained investigators &mdash; police officers &mdash; tend to be more focused on investigating crime and perhaps regard the capturing of the detail of information as a secondary piece.  I have seen that in other professions; it is not confined to policing.  Therefore, it is understandable but not good enough.  I am particularly worried that the data produced are subsequently relied on for public policy and crime-prevention purposes.</p><p>That one will be cultural and will take time.  I do not think that could have changed in the timeframe to which the Deputy referred.  </p></speech>

I must also apologise as I must leave to go to the Chamber soon.</p> <p>  I wish first to deal with the Policing Authority's oversight of ICT within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In her opening statement, Ms Feehily stated that she does not receive Garda audit service reports on a routine basis but that she is aware of media reports on this particular audit.  This audit concerned ICT payments and processes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I raised this during Leaders' Questions in January.  I will not go over the whole thing again but to give an idea of the figures involved, ICT costs in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2016 were &euro;49.9 million, of which &euro;26.6 million went to Accenture, based on a contract dated August 2009 which the audit found breached public procurement guidelines.  </p> <p>  I have been looking at the Policing Authority's most recent quarterly report to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, in December 2017 on progress by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in implementing the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate report, particularly on ICT which has a full chapter.  On external ICT contractors, the Policing Authority's report states that "It is clear that the financial burden of supporting external contractors is high" and that "contractors have a strong financial incentive to remain".</p> <p>  These statements by the authority seem to indicate that it is aware that there is a high price connected with external contractors.  Did the authority ask for the details of the expenditure associated with external IT contractors?  The phrase "financial burden" in particular seems to indicate that the authority is aware that there is a high spend in the area of external contractors.  The authority states that it is aware of media reports about the audit.  I am asking if how ICT functions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is news to the Policing Authority.  The authority seems at least to be aware of a high spend on contractors.  Was the Policing Authority aware of any of the public procurement breaches by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 appropriation accounts list 94 breaches totalling &euro;27.8 million and it lists security ICT as one of the main areas.  That information is available to everyone online.  Will Ms Feehily answer those questions first?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.560" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018032100002#S00400"><p>We were aware of the appropriation account information, and, in fact, we followed that discussion closely.  Something the Deputy will have seen in our various reports that I mentioned, including the two year report and the submission to the commission, is that we have asked for the removal of duplication and for the removal of ambiguity.  Our role in relation to the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very circumscribed and very narrow.  From the outset, we have tried to get ourselves more closely involved with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so that we become part of that resourcing discussion.  When we cannot do it that way, we come at the issue a different way and we do it from a performance perspective.  We also come at it from the point of view of our determination to increase the proportion of civilians in the Garda.</p> <p>  Part of our concern about the spend on ICT would have been that we think some of it could have been done by skilled professionals hired directly by the Garda, probably for less money.  That partly is what would have been behind the comment in the quarterly report to the Minister.  Also, it is the case that for private sector bodies, the bottom line is repeat business.  That is what they do.  We were extremely concerned.  We have not been able to get good benefits realisation statements from the Garda about what it was actually getting for this spend in detailed form.  That is what is behind our concerns.  We come at it through whatever areas we have power, which is civilianisation and the implementation of the modernisation plan, and ask what it is getting for the money, rather than our oversight of the money.</p> <p>  Turning to the public procurement breaches, we took the view when the Comptroller and Auditor General audited, which is as high as one can get in auditing terms, and of which the Committee of Public Accounts had oversight, that it had its own oversight machine and we had enough to get on with.</p><p>When the chair of the audit committee comes before us in a couple of months' time with its annual report, we will ask how the committee assures itself.  There is a great deal of statutory machinery in the form of an audit committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, and we follow their work with interest.</p></speech>

Our competence is narrow, however.  If we had solid competence, we would go into it in detail.  In the next wave of reform, we have called for the authority to have very specific competence.  One thing that frustrates one of my authority colleagues, for example, is that if the Garda wants to hire a clerical officer, it has to get approval from the authority but if it wants to spend &euro;10 million on ICT, it does not.  We have a very narrow competence in respect of money.  We believe it should be broader and at least equal to the competence we have in connection with the appointment of clerical officers.</p> <p>  We would like to get into what the Deputy is talking about but we do not have the powers to do so.  We made this clear in our submission to the Minister.  As I said here last year, or at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, we have always seen this as a gap in our powers.</p></speech>

Mr. Joseph Nugent, the chief administrative officer, is the chair and representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform also sit on the board.  The Policing Authority has attended three meetings of the board in an observer capacity.  Who attended on behalf of the authority?</p> <p>  One of the roles of the ICT governance board, according to its terms of reference, is to ensure that decisions on the commencement of projects are informed by defined business cases, consistent with the requirements of the public spending code and circulars relating to ICT expenditure and consistent with agreed resource allocations.  In the three meetings attended by the authority, were tendering or procurement issues or payments to external contractors discussed?  Given that &euro;26 million which was paid to Accenture in 2016 was deemed to be in breach of public procurement guidelines, it would seem the governance board is not really doing its job.  What is the authority's opinion on the work of the governance board?</p> <p>  The minutes of the meeting of the Policing Authority with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 26 January 2017 state that the authority executive was to explore a link with the ICT governance board and ensure that the authority has access to all relevant information.  Did this ever happen?  Has the authority ever requested a full-time place on the board?  It is strange that the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform can sit on the board but that the authority can only observe.</p></speech>

We declined a seat on the governance board because we are an oversight body and we would be entirely conflicted if we were part of an internal governance structure.  We have taken the same position in respect of many other invitations we have received from the Garda to get involved in internal governance.  We cannot stand above it and challenge if we are part of it.  We decided to ask one of our senior team to attend in an observer capacity so that we could learn what goes on at the meetings.  The chief executive will elaborate on that.</p> <p>  One of our other enduring concerns about governance in the Garda is that there are too many governance boards.  Their discrete roles are not entirely clear and there is a lot of internal conflict over who sits on governance boards.</p></speech>

In particular, in much of its project reporting, there is not any clear sense, even for the members who attend, of what is the value for money - I refer to some of the questions the Deputy would have asked.

One of the items in the policing plan is that by the end of quarter one, they will produce a strategy so that the committee or the board has something to focus on.</p></speech>

The costs associated with the STO are included in the overall ICT budget but I note from the authority's quarterly report that nobody is willing to take responsibility for its budget.  The authority's report states ICT "could give no greater clarity since they have no line of sight or responsibility for this budget despite it appearing within their budget lines".  The STO states, according to the report, "their understanding was that this was part of the ICT budget and therefore not the responsibility of the STO".  Instead, it seems an external contractor is running the office.  Accenture was paid &euro;2.8 million in 2015 to set up the STO and the contract has been renewed every year without a tender.  The contract states that Accenture is to support the set-up and running of the strategic transformation office.  The authority's quarterly report states there will be a 100% overspend of the STO budget for 2017, &euro;4 million instead of &euro;2.1 million.  Surprise, surprise, Accenture is the company that will profit from the budget overspend.  Did anyone in the Policing Authority investigate this budget overspend of 100% and did any alarm bells start ringing?</p></speech>

The alarm bells certainly started ringing.  We rang them in that report and we gave it to the Minister.  We are not auditors.  We are not investigators.  Our authority in relation to spending by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is limited.  There is a tiny section in the Act which states we must give the Minister a view once a year as to the adequacy of Garda resources.  Not being able to deal with them in terms of the financial Vote, we deal with the issue through our oversight of the modernisation plan and through our insistence that they should be engaging more professional civilians to do their work.  In fact, in the past year we approved a number of senior positions for permanent civil servants to staff the strategic transformation office.  We come at the issues that bother us using the levers we have of the modernisation plan and reports to the Minister but we have no function in investigating or overseeing the day to day spending by the Commissioner.  That is just the way it is.</p></speech>

In her opening statement, Ms Feehily said that the authority appoints the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na audit committee.  In September 2017, it appointed Joe Nugent as a member of the committee.  As chief administrative officer, he has overall responsibility for finance in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes ICT.  Joe Nugent is also the chairperson of the ICT governance board, which seems not to impose any governance.  Now he has been appointed to the auditing committee.  Is there not a conflict of interest there?</p></speech>

There is a conflict of interest.  I have discussed that conflict both with the chair of the audit committee and with Mr. Nugent.  Unfortunately, the legislation allows us to appoint only Mr. Nugent or Deputy Commissioner Twomey.  Both, in my view, are equally conflicted.  Deputy Commissioner Twomey is responsible, as the deputy commissioner in charge of policing, for spending all the money.  The legislation provides that we must appoint one person, either the deputy commissioner or the chief administrative officer, and up to four others.  We can appoint as many others as we like.  We do not have a choice.</p> <p>  We had a very interesting discussion about this with the acting Garda Commissioner recently and with the chair of the audit committee.  The chair of the audit committee is keen to have a uniformed policing presence on the audit committee to help its members understand the policing issues.  We were asked if we could appoint an assistant commissioner but I had to say we cannot.  The Act allows us to appoint only one person from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that appointment must be at deputy level.  I apologise but we have identified the issue and made it transparent to the committee, the acting Garda Commissioner and the person we appointed.  We said it was not an ideal outcome and they all accepted it and therefore are all hopefully taking steps to mitigate the risk.  The Act does not allow us to do what we would like to do.</p></speech>

In the closing paragraphs of the chapter on ICT in the authority's most recent report, it is stated that the forthright way in which Garda ICT has laid out an unvarnished picture of the current situation in its interactions with the authority is to be welcomed.  I am wondering if Ms Feehily stands over that statement.  If ICT had given the authority an unvarnished picture, would that not have involved it saying it had been giving contracts out to Accenture without tender, that Accenture staff are the only external IT contractors who do not record their attendance and hours on an electronic clocking system, that the Garda had been paying Accenture in advance and that the lack of expenditure controls may not satisfy the European Commission?  That would have been unvarnished.  Instead, what the authority got was fiction.  It gives a glowing appraisal yet it is supposed to have an oversight function.  Does Ms Feehily stand over the statement that its presentation was unvarnished and good?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.587" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018032100002#V00900"><p>Were I to ask them, I am sure that my colleagues on that particular committee certainly would stand over that statement in the following sense.  The quality of the engagement with the people from the ICT side and the modernisation programme has improved dramatically in the last year or so.  It was unvarnished in the sense of admitting what they were not doing, admitting the inadequacy of their technology and admitting to us things that were not complete.  The Deputy might recall that in an earlier report, we had to identify the fact that we were effectively being sold a pup and had projects marked as complete that were not even begun.  It is against that background that we were commenting on a frankness that has emerged in respect of the technology.  It was not a discussion about procurement or budgets.  As I have said, we are not in that space because other actors in the system are.  It was an unvarnished presentation by them.</p><p>There was also an acceptance of something.  The Deputy mentioned in his remarks the question of who takes decisions about spending.  This is also in our report, if not the latest one then the one before it.  The authority believes there has not been a dynamic prioritisation of a proper documented process to say why project X was chosen over project Y.  We are getting some traction on that now.  It is in that context that we talk about an unvarnished acceptance.  The Deputy has the advantage over me as he has the report in front of him.  It is an honesty and a robustness in the engagement that we found refreshing.  That is the context in which that remark was made.</p></speech>

I would be worried about that.  I will read a brief section of the transcript of my interactions with Mr. Nugent regarding the issue here.  I asked Mr. Nugent about the report compiled on use of the Gmail account by the former Garda Commissioner, and whether he had given that report to the Department of Justice and Equality.  He actually denied that he had produced the report.  To quote him, he said:</p><blockquote>I do not know if I did a specific report.  I certainly looked at emails about 12 months ago.  Can I remember if it was sent to the Department?  I do not know.  It is more than 12 months ago since the issue occurred, and I do not remember ... I am saying that I do not believe I did a report.  I said that I had a look at emails that were there but I do not recall producing a report...  I am fairly sure I did not send a report to the Department of Justice and Equality.  My point was that I do not believe I produced an actual report.  That was my point.</blockquote> <p>I am not so sure about his memory or how it works.  I also asked whether any of the senior management present received emails from the Garda Commissioner's Gmail account in respect of Garda business and they all said &quot;No&quot;.  Given that the disclosures tribunal has established through the examination of N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan's iPad that the former Commissioner was sending emails from her Gmail to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, which contained draft speeches to be read out in the D&aacute;il and on RT&Eacute; in respect of the O'Higgins commission, I find the response that no senior management member ever received emails regarding Garda business to be a bit of a joke.  Does Ms Feehily believe the committee was told the truth when all the senior Garda members present, including Mr. Nugent, denied ever receiving emails from the former Garda Commissioner's Gmail account on Garda-related business?</p></speech>

We asked similar questions about whether the Gmail accounts were used for Garda business, rather than the point about the report.  In fact, it was us who reminded him that he had given us a report, after he gave the committee that evidence.  It was the other part of it.  We have received the same assurances that the committee received.  We have received assurances also that Mr. Nugent personally reviewed a lot of Gmail activity to make sure that there was no Garda business.  We were focused on Garda business in the sense of sensitive information, security information, investigations, personal information and so on.  In that context, we received similar assurances to those which the committee received.</p> <p>  I would certainly decline to comment on anything related to the Charleton tribunal until Mr. Justice Charleton has finished his work.</p></speech>

It did not really deal with the matter it was supposed to deal with.  I got another email from Ms Hall which was very interesting, from 2016.  It was sent to the authority and was a statement from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The opening line of the statement from Mr. Nugent states that due to restrictions with the Garda email system, such as email size and storage, the Commissioner occasionally used a Gmail account to ensure that Garda business was discharged effectively.  This completely flies in the face of what Mr. Nugent told the committee when he appeared before it.  He told us first that he did not do a report and then, in his statement on 21 November 2016, he told us that the Commissioner was using her Gmail account.  </p></speech>

My recollection of it is that there was a fairly robust engagement with one of our members, Maureen Lynott, on that topic and we got further assurances on the record from them.  We did not accept that at the time at face value; we followed it up in public.  It is important to make the point that there are technical solutions that law enforcement agencies and other agencies charged with matters that are confidential must deal with all of the time.  They have a responsibility to ensure they use those technical solutions such that it is not necessary to use commercial providers.  It is in this regard I referenced the enterprise content management in my remarks.  It is really important that the Garda remove the need for the use of external providers.  Often Garda officers on the ground do not have the most sophisticated technology and consequently, in trying to do their jobs, they may inadvertently use a commercial provider, which is not a good idea.  We are keen to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rolls out the technology that makes it possible for Garda business to be done in a secure way at all times.  The focus is on ensuring they do this right going forward.</p></speech>

Does Ms Feehily agree that the Government needs to take another look at the powers of the Policing Authority?</p></speech>

I agree that the powers need to be looked at again and we have written to the Minister to that effect.  I do not agree that we do not have an appropriate degree of independence.  If it was not for our independence, even within the limited powers and functions we have, the committee would not have much of the material it has today.  By way of the various reports that we have published, we have put more material in the public domain and we have operated more transparency.  I believe we have been a disruptor in terms of Garda oversight for positive and good outcomes.</p></speech>

I would like to put a few brief questions to the witnesses on the selection process for the new Garda Commissioner.  The Policing Authority told the committee in October last that it expected to have detailed engagement regarding composition of the selection board and the processes to be used by the Public Appointments Service and so on.  Given that the closing date is upon us, what has been the level of engagement and correspondence in this regard?  Has the collaborative approach anticipated come to fruition?</p></speech>

Will the witnesses enlighten members as to what they perceive to be the current stumbling blocks in this regard?  What areas do the witness think of when they say that?</p></speech>

We are not convinced that it needs three layers - the Government, the Policing Authority and the Public Appointments Service - in such a rigid hierarchy, for want of a better word, to give us the best outcome.  The Policing Authority would have been quite capable of running a process for the selection of a person to serve as Garda Commissioner.  This might have given us the kind of outcome described by the Deputy whereby we might have had a slate of candidates.  Who knows?  When we use words like "flexible", it is more that the Policing Authority could itself run the process.  That would be consistent with other comparable bodies on these islands.  This is not in any way to say that the process will not be run properly and in accordance with the law; it is simply to do with the future, being more agile and more like other authorities.</p></speech>

This is already provided for in legislation.  Is the authority referring to sanctions or what is it saying?  Does this reflect the fact that the Policing Authority has had a difficulty obtaining material from a proactive point of view?</p></speech>

We consider that quite a lot of the training interventions could be delivered externally and at other third-level education campuses.  We are absolutely and seriously worried about and bothered by the fact that recruits come out of the Garda College without being qualified to drive.  This could be outsourced.  We also believe that another way of letting in light to the process would be to have a better mix between professional educators and police officers.  There is a very high-----</p></speech>

When Deputy Brophy asked whether it was the Policing Authority's opinion that it had been specifically misled by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or if it was just an oversight, Ms Feehily said "I do not think so".  A report designed specifically for Ms Feehily's eyes and ears and for the Policing Authority was prepared by the two expert data analysts and presented on 11 April.  This report was not directed to the Policing Authority as per protocol.  The two analysts subsequently went to a public meeting with the Policing Authority and presented a very different view to that contained in their written proposal.  What would we call that if it was not misleading?</p></speech>

Deputy Brophy asked if we felt misled at the time.  What I meant to convey to Deputy Brophy was that at the time we did not believe there was a deliberate attempt to mislead.  I acknowledged, however, that I could not put myself in the minds of the people who sent the material.</p><p>I felt at the time that the strong professional tensions that were clearly visible to us - and remember we had private meetings as well, not just with the analysis service but also on the policing side - were playing out somewhere else and that they simply were not ready.  As it happens, we never received that report.  The report that was given to us in April - or the document because I will not call it a report - has been accepted by the Garda Commissioner as inaccurate.  The line has been drawn under it and we lost six months.  Clearly, looking back, we did not get what we should have received.  There is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

We had a commitment that we would receive the document in advance of the April meeting.  The piece of paper we received the night before the meeting did not measure up to what we had been led to expect.  We knew that what we received on the night beforehand was inadequate, incomplete and, as we said in our letter to the Garda Commissioner, inaccurate.  We did not like its tone.  We knew straight away that there was stuff we had not received.  I am trying to say that at that moment there was strong evidence available to us of unresolved matters within the Garda.  I do not wish to assume it was misleading.  They might simply have not been ready.</p></speech>

She talks about it speaking to issues of culture and speaking out, which it most certainly does.  However, she then appears to downplay it a little and says that it is an employment issue.  She said the authority would be conflicted if it got involved with factions.  To be honest, I found that shocking.  I do not know how one would describe professional expertise in terms of data analysis, on the one hand, and rank structure, on the other, as being two factions.  They are different skill sets.  I am trying to get my head around how the Policing Authority, which had 20 meetings with the rank structure about the homicide review, felt it was not within its remit to meet the professional staff who offered their services to enlighten the authority on that.</p><p> Does Ms Feehily still think that this was just an employment issue?  She referred to the most useful thing she could do for the two women.  Does she not accept that the issues that were being raised were not for the two individuals?  They had absolutely nothing to do with something that would end up going to GSOC.  They were raising an issue which is a function of the authority, the performance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions in terms of the classification of data relating to homicide.  How could that not be something the Policing Authority would not investigate or discuss with them?</p></speech>

In the engagement with Deputy Brophy, I was trying to convey that the Garda organisation is full of different perspectives, including the analysis service and the uniformed service.  In this instance there were certainly differing views within the uniformed service.  I was trying to convey that a body that oversees an organisation must be very careful not to get involved with one side of an argument.  That is what that word was intended to convey.</p> <p>  Our 20 meetings and meetings at official level were not with the uniformed service but with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The committee's witnesses are members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are not sworn members but they are members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from our point of view and we oversee the organisation.  There were non-sworn members at these meetings.  Earlier, I was trying to convey that in order for us to do our job properly, in a statutory sense, we must be able to deal openly with those people who the Garda Commissioner designates as the representative body people for that organisation.</p> <p>  The analysis service was fully represented.  Who came to our meetings was a matter for the analysis service and the Garda Commissioner.  At no point had we any difficulty.  If the Garda Commissioner had included Ms West and Ms Galligan at those meetings, that would have been fine.  That was conveyed in the first telephone call to Ms West.  When she asked to attend a meeting with the analysis service we said it was a matter for the analysis service and the Garda Commissioner who attends the meetings.  We are having a meeting but we are not saying who is coming.  We are simply inviting people to a meeting.  That was conveyed to them.  The only way we can do our job properly is to work transparently and insist that we get people at meetings, so we can go back to the Garda Commissioner and say what the representatives said and did or did not provide.</p></speech>

One of the powerful points made by Ms West last week was her statement that if she was in a position where she was made aware of people who wanted to tell her something - individuals who were uniquely in possession of the facts of this analysis - she would want to talk to those people and find out what they had to say.  That struck a chord with me because I would be like that too.  Does Ms Feehily not accept that she should have done that and that the six months would not have been lost?  The impression has been given that the authority has been doing this work on the report and the background with the Garda, as of course it has, but it is almost presented as if it is in isolation.  A huge amount of work has been done by these analysts within the ranks of the Garda.  If the authority and they had worked together when the analysts first contacted the authority, it might have saved the six or seven months it has taken to get to this stage.</p></speech>

To suggest that those were not ventilated to the authority would be wrong.  Looking back, the only possible course of action we might have taken might have been to ask the Garda Commissioner to include Ms West and Ms Galligan in the Garda delegation that came to meet us.  That is the only way we could have got their voices formally into the room.</p><p>We had two telephone calls and, later, a letter which we cannot discuss because they have said it is confidential.  During one of those telephone calls, they were given specific assurances that we were live to all of their issues and that all of their issues had been brought into those meetings.  We have pursued all those issues in those meetings.  That is what I was trying to convey when I said that was probably the most important service that we could do for them at that point, having been given knowledge by them and putting in writing to the Commissioner all of their concerns.  They were all followed through and they were given that assurance.  They were given an assurance on the telephone by my colleague that all of those concerns were on our agenda, would continue to be on our agenda and we persisted with them.  I personally spoke on a number of occasions to senior people to make it clear that we were aware of the discontent and that we would not let this matter go unless the analysis service was satisfied.</p><p> The Deputy remarked that I was downplaying something in my opening remarks.  I am in no way downplaying their evidence about how they were treated.  What I am saying is that it is primarily an employment matter and, I imagine, it is a matter the Deputy will want to discuss with their employer when the Commissioner comes before the committee.  I was simply echoing that my reaction to that testimony was that I found it deplorable.  When listening to them, I wondered whether the authority's activity in May 2017 may have caused the pressure they described because we were pressing very hard for the report.</p></speech>

In her opening statement, Ms Feehily spoke about this being an employment matter and she stated that, therefore, the authority was excluded from involvement.  I do not accept that.  They did not bring to the attention of the authority for action any allegations about the manner in which they were being treated.  They did not ask for that.  In their professional capacity, they were drawing the attention of the authority to the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not properly carrying out its function in terms of data classification.  They flagged that to the authority.  Oversight of the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter for the Policing Authority.</p></speech>

Ms Feehily also said in her opening statement that there was very little of substance that they said that the authority did not already know about.  I find that difficult to understand.  Very concerning evidence was given about people who remained at risk potentially through 2017, mainly domestic violence victims.  In saying that there was nothing of substance that the authority did not know in March of last year, is Ms Feehily saying that she was aware then that there were women in domestic violence situations who were possibly at risk because of misclassification and because risk indicators were not being recorded properly?</p></speech>

The issue of risk to victims and potential victims does not arise only in relation to domestic violence; it arises everywhere, including in regard to child sex abuse reports.  This comes back to the data quality point.  It may be boring to be wittering on about data quality but there are people, risks and victims involved.  This is pervasive in the Garda culture and in the casual attitude to data, which I discussed with Deputy Brophy.  We have been talking about this in public and in private to senior Garda representatives for well over a year.</p></speech>

The working group is about completing a review of homicides.  The issue around amending the PULSE system, improving data quality, and managing the risks to future victims right across the crime spectrum, is an ongoing issue.</p><p>The working group will not fix that issue.  It will continue to look review files, cases and data.  The much more important piece in terms of future potential victims is the improvement by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the PULSE system, the supervision of entries on the PULSE system and that it insist on certain parts of drop-down menus being completed.  This is day-to-day work that is not the job of the working group.</p></speech>

This is March 2018.  If the authority had taken on board their information and brought it to the attention of the Minister in the course of the last year, we could have been where we are now a year ago.  That is the point.  They raised the issue with their management but they would not deal with them so they took the matter to the authority, but they found the door closed to them.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

Their interventions were by telephone.  They were received professionally and courteously and all of their concerns were known to us.  We assured them that we had their letters and that we would not let their concerns drop.  Specifically on the risk to victims, the authority has been raising this issue since April 2017 at the highest level within the Garda organisation.  It runs across our work.  It is not confined to this area.  This is just one lens through which data quality is being looked at.  When the Deputy studies the child sex abuse report, she will find it equally reflected there.</p></speech>

It was generally known and so the telephone call could have been made by anyone, including me.  It was a matter that was generally known.  It was certainly something that I was impressing on a range of people during July and August of last year because I was extremely concerned that no progress was being made to bring us a report.  I was impressing upon a range of people, including at Commissioner level, that we were alive to the disquiet within the analysis service and that we would not accept a report unless it could be established to our satisfaction that it had been fully signed off by the analysis service.

What I am saying is that during the months of July and August, following our June public meeting, there was a huge degree of concern within the authority on a range of matters.

I was actively encouraging that we needed to see real progress by September and that we would not accept a report unless it had been signed off by the analysis service.

I apologise if I am asking the same question but I feel it is not being answered.

That is not what I said.  If that is the impression I conveyed, I apologise and I will try to be clearer.  What I intended to convey in my opening remarks was that I found their testimony in respect of how they were treated in their workplace to be deplorable and that it had echoes for me in other matters with which the Policing Authority was dealing.  That is their employment matter.  My issue about conflict is entirely different.  We have no business being involved in the employment matter.  My issue about conflict is that we are a regulator, an overseer.  In order to be able to do our jobs properly, we have to have good order about how we engage with the body we oversee.  We have established that order through the liaison office.  We operate on the basis of transparency in all our engagements with the Garda.  From that point of view, when we were asked by a person if they could come to a meeting with the authority, we had no trouble with it.  The specific response was that we had no difficulty with their attendance but that it was a matter for the Garda as to who attended.  The difficulty for an oversight body in terms of conflicts is that if we become involved in resolving a professional conflict, then we ourselves become conflicted.  I am talking about a professional conflict rather than an employment matter.  We try to provide structures, we are transparent in our engagement and we invite the Commissioner to meetings.  We also insist that people who attend are authorised to commit the organisation.  The only way to oversee performance is to deal with people who are authorised to speak.</p></speech>

The idea being put forward is that Ms West contacted the authority and said "Listen, I'm in awful trouble with the job here.  I want to go to a meeting with the authority and the lads won't let me.  Any chance you could put in a good word for me to go?  Clearly, nobody rang and asked that she be allowed to go the meeting.  I presume she asked to attend the meeting because she had fundamental, diametrically opposed views to other people who were attending it.  I come from a catering background.  I am not being derogatory when I say that this is not the person who makes the sandwiches; she is the top person and has hands-on access to information in this area.  She is of a rank whereby she would not normally be obliged to pick up the phone and ask for the help of the Policing Authority.</p><p>Does the witness normally get phone calls from people at that high a level?  The analyst told the witness that she should be at the meeting.  If that did not set alarm bells ringing then, given all the points the witness has made about her awareness of the culture, the problems and the professional tensions, how can that be a conflict?  It is the witness's job to deal with this; she is there to oversee that and to shake it up.</p></speech>

These actions took place last April, not last week.  Last April, we were very alive to all of the issues.  We had taken the initiative and had set up a meeting.  Our records of the telephone exchange are very simple.  The analysts understood that there was a meeting and they asked if they could come.  The answer was that the authority had no difficulty with their attendance but that it was a matter for the Garda as to who was to attend.  We are examining that engagement now through the lens of something that happened a couple of weeks ago.  At the end of the day, the most important thing is that the homicide review proceeds. All of the authority's work has been to insist that the analysis service was fully involved and that it signed off on the material that came to us, and that happened.  However, our capacity to engage must be open.  We oversee the entire organisation, which includes the analysis service as well as the sworn side, and we have to take a view on its performance also.  That is the reason we have to be very careful that we are not in a position of moderating in a situation that is clearly a matter for the Commissioner to resolve.</p></speech>

I see it as the authority denying itself access to information that would have assisted it in fulfilling its statutory role, which is to oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its functions, because that was the nature of the information that was brought to it, and the analysts were the only people who had that information.</p></speech>

I have had to take the decision to excuse the representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, Mr. Mark Toland and his colleagues.  They understood that we have overextended our engagement here this morning.  We will meet them in a stand-alone engagement to discuss the very important matters discussed today.  Today's engagement with the representatives of the Policing Authority is clearly of huge importance and interest to members.  That said, I do not want people to abuse that fact, because we are going to have a little more time today.  I hope that the members of the committee are in agreement with that decision.  We will write to Mr. Toland, the Chief Inspector, to convey our apologies for the inconvenience they were subjected to this morning.</p> <p>  Before inviting Deputy O'Callaghan to speak I wanted to say that while answering Deputy Clare Daly's question Ms Feehily indicated that perhaps the one thing she might have done would have been to indicate that both Ms West and Ms Galligan would be part of the meeting.  I want to share with her that this committee said quite specifically in its request to the acting Commissioner that Ms West and Ms Galligan would be part of the delegation that would present, and they were not.  This committee, quite rightly in my view, provided an opportunity for the two serving members of the analysis unit to come before us.  We would be no better informed than what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na presented here on the day it attended unless we had taken the decision to accommodate both Ms West and Ms Galligan.</p><p>There are lessons for everybody in that because the Policing Authority would be no further on either.  That simply would not be enough.  I call Deputy O'Callaghan.</p></speech>

The broader issue of the spontaneous notification of events and material to the authority is something we have raised in public as long ago as June 2016, if I am not mistaken, when we felt we had not been given a spontaneous disclosure about whatever was the problem at that time; it was the fixed charge penalty notices in June 2016.  We subsequently raised it in the context of our work on breath tests and it is included in one of our submissions to which I referred.</p></speech>

Was the Policing Authority aware that the individuals who carried out the homicide review had been excluded by Garda senior management?</p></speech>

As I referenced earlier, there certainly was a tension between science and investigators.  There was also a tension within the Garda side that was very visible to us.  There was a range of different points of view and some of that is entirely understandable because the crime counting rules allow for balance of probability.  The Deputy would be more familiar than most of us with how complicated that can get.</p> <p>  The authority has also referenced that until such time as there is a much stronger critical mass of senior professional civilians in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there will always be a tension between Garda uniformed and civilian personnel.  That just is the way it is.  That was another tension that we saw playing out.  </p> <p>  It is impossible to avoid at least speculating that the findings were likely to be troublesome and whether there was a risk of that.  I am speculating.</p></speech>

As I said in my remarks earlier, looking back with the benefit of what we now know, the one step we could have taken, as the Chairman has referenced, would have been to ask that they be included and, like yourselves, if they were then excluded, we would then perhaps have been able to draw the same conclusion the Chairman drew in his remarks a moment ago.  I will not go back over the conflict risks of meeting one group and then another and finding ourselves in the middle.</p></speech>

That is my memory of when I knew there was a report being prepared.  It comes from that date, without it necessarily being labelled as a report that we were not given, if the Deputy understands the point I am making.</p></speech>

In her opening statement, Ms Feehily said that by late March or early April there was very little of substance in what was stated by Ms West and Ms Galligan regarding the review of which the Policing Authority was not aware at that stage.  Did Ms Feehily not think it appropriate to raise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's senior management the fact that the persons carrying out the review had concerns about it?</p></speech>

At that point, their concerns, which were brought to our attention by letter in May, were about how they were treated as opposed to the issues to do with homicides.  We were focused on issues to do with homicide and homicide investigations and on challenging the Commissioner to complete the work and give us assurances for the victims and families.  We were not focused at that point on who did what precisely.</p></speech>

Much of the time when Ms Feehily was being asked about whether she was misled, she was concentrating on the motivation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This is the point I was trying to make.  We did not accept it and we told the Garda we did not accept it.  We had a robust private meeting before the public session.  We wrote to the Garda immediately after the meeting saying, "We take the strongest possible objection to this in terms of its tone, its content and its accuracy."  I am not trying to be difficult.  If I say we were misled, that sounds like we sat there passively and accepted what was presented.  We did not do so and we rejected it in very direct terms.</p></speech>

We were aware that it was not a report.  It did not have a start and an end, it had no methodology or detail and it did not set out the work the analysis service had done, and we had rejected it.  Following on from my point that there was nothing of substance that was new, we knew that the material we received was inadequate, incomplete and inaccurate.</p></speech>

I remember feeling at the time that I had been robust in my response.</p><p>I am very conscious of fair procedure and we received the material at 8.30 p.m. the night before.  We had read it quickly.  That particular meeting in public was at 11 a.m., which is unusual, because the Commissioner had a security engagement.  We said we would consider it in detail in the afternoon and then we wrote the letter.  To that extent, I was trying to make sure that we had not jumped to conclusions.  We wanted to study these eight pages and to see if there was something.  We also asked a number of questions in public session that might have helped us understand.  Before coming to a conclusion, which we did that evening, we felt it was reasonable to give the Commissioner an opportunity to answer some questions and then for us to go back and consider carefully what we had received.  We formed a view and we conveyed that view to the Commissioner a couple of days later about the non-acceptance of the material.</p></speech>

She expressed concerns about the homicide review and the classification of data.  The person she telephoned was not dealing with the matter and had to consult colleagues.  She called her back; the conversation was short.  She was not in a position to speak.  She then called my colleague back and she was assured that, as she would have seen from the authority's meeting with the Commissioner in public, the matter was being taken very seriously by the authority.  She was also advised, and that seemed to be news to her, that we had their letter of 11 May.  She was advised that we were demanding additional material, that we were also broadening our inquiry to include the CSO to get their perspectives, and that we absolutely had all of the matters on her letter of 11 May on our agenda.  The note I have states that she appeared to be satisfied with the assurances and she thanked my colleague for calling her and giving her that information.</p></speech>

This is in the helpful timeline that Ms Feehily provided to the committee yesterday.  The Policing Authority stated that it wanted a response and four bullet points were set out.  One of them was a <i>Sunday Times</i>article with a headline, &quot;Garda analyst washes hands of figures fiasco&quot;.  Why did the authority not put in as a bullet point there that it wanted a response to the letter of 11 May from the deputy head who is conducting the homicide analysis?  They seem to have been airbrushed out of the communication with Garda senior management.</p></speech>

These are key oversight events.  The substance of that letter was at all times part of the engagement at committee.  It was not named.

At that stage, the authority knew an awful lot, in terms of the information it got from a variety of sources, including the five page letter of 11 May and the concerns expressed in the phone calls.  At that meeting, it was presented to the witness, again by the representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that the issues in respect of the database had been rectified.  Looking back on what she was told at the meeting of 29 June 2017, does Ms Feehily think she was given an accurate account of the status of the homicide review at that stage?</p></speech>

That was news.  That took us off on a whole other direction which we then had to follow up with the Road Safety Authority because we have reached a point where we try to find external sources, wherever we can, to confirm Garda data.</p></speech>

I know the witness does not want to go into the detail of that on the grounds of confidentiality, but at that stage the authority must have been saying that it had now had two lengthy communications from the person carrying out the review and two phone calls from her.

My focus was on making sure that the work was being done.  I spoke to a number of people, including at Commissioner level.  I also indicated to them that the authority would not be accepting any material on this unless we were satisfied the analysis service had signed off.  As I said earlier, I thought that was the most useful thing I could do with material that I could not use otherwise because it was confidential.</p></speech>

I have been struck, listening to their evidence, about some of the date symmetry.  It is possible that the pressure we were exerting may have led in turn to some of the mistreatment that they accounted because there are dates where we intervened and certain things seemed to happen.  If we added to that distress by pressing the Commissioner for responses, that is certainly regrettable.  I do believe, had we known, that we could have insisted earlier on the inclusion of Ms Galligan and Ms West in some of the meetings that we had.</p></speech>

They believed the authority was not being given accurate information by Garda senior management.  It concerned an important issue.

There probably would have been a benefit from meeting them.</p></speech>

We were challenging everything.  We accepted nothing.  In fact, one of the things that struck me about their evidence to the committee was that they were more reassured in September than we were.  We were not reassured in September.  Ms West said she was reassured in September.  They also indicated that they had no reason to lack confidence in the new group.  We are not at that stage yet, until we meet it and see its product.  In some ways, we have been less reassured than some of the evidence that they gave the committee.  While I accept that it is their belief that they had information we did not have, I can only assure this committee and Deputy O'Callaghan that we did have it.</p></speech>

I must apologise because I will have to depart for another engagement as soon as I finish my questions.  First, I wish to deal with the initial public presentation of the homicide report, or document, as Ms Feehily has referred to it, in April.  It is fair to say that it was an extraordinary episode when taken in the context of everything we have learnt since.  This document was heavily criticised by Ms Feehily and the Policing Authority.  It was stated by Dr. Gurchand Singh that although he did not raise it at that meeting, he had serious concerns and was not satisfied with it, and clearly Ms West and Ms Galligan were not at all happy with it.  It appears that only the senior garda&iacute; who presented the document at the meeting were satisfied with it.</p> <p>  One of the key issues with the document was not only its content but the process that took place before it was presented to the Policing Authority and the fact that Ms Galligan, Ms West and the Garda analysis service were not consulted, despite being significantly involved in the audit and Ms Galligan and Ms West being the primary analysts.  The analysts were not involved in the report that was presented.  Does Ms Feehily agree that it was unusual and remarkable and that if a comparable report were to have been prepared by the drugs section and presented to the Policing Authority, those involved would have been consulted?</p></speech>

When a range of units in any large organisation is involved in a piece of work, the authority is entitled to expect that the product that emerges from the work will have involved the voices and expertise of all of the functions.  The answer is "Yes" but I also have to say that I would have expected that it was the Commissioner's responsibility to resolve matters and present us with a unified document, and we got neither.</p></speech>

During the course of the testimony I put it to Ms West whether the fact that they were not consulted could be an oversight and she responded that she was not sure she could conclude it was an oversight.  I must say I am inclined to agree.  Does Ms Feehily believe that it was an oversight or that it was something else?</p></speech>

The complaints and concerns had already been presented to them.  Does Ms Feehily agree that they would have been aware of that, and in that context, is it credible that it would simply have been an oversight?  Is it the case that the members of the senior Garda management who were present at the meeting were perfectly aware of the concerns that existed and proceeded to present the document anyway?</p></speech>

It was an inadequate document and inaccurate in several respects.  I can see where the Deputy is going with it, but I am trying to be fair and think what was in somebody's mind in sending us a piece of paper at 8.30 p.m.  I do not believe, however, that it was an oversight.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Ms Feehily has to be even-minded.  However, she has said that, had the Policing Authority accepted the testimony given to it, it would have been misled and that she believes it was not an oversight.  For any of us listening to her and the testimony we received two weeks ago, it is hard to conclude that there was not an attempt to railroad the report through the Policing Authority, as well as an attempt not to draw too much attention to it and allow the process to be completed without the serious concerns of Ms Galligan and Ms West to be taken on board.  When one combines this with the fact that it may not have been an oversight and that the authority could have been misled, it is quite an extraordinary set of circumstances.  At what stage did Ms Feehily become aware of the particular pressure put on Ms Galligan and Ms West on 8 and 10 May?</p></speech>

We had intelligence which had been given to us in March from several sources.  In the first instance, it caused us to invite the analysis service to a meeting.  I am not in a position to elaborate further, but we had a significant amount of information in late March at the level of the authority.</p></speech>

That is the best way I can describe it.  I am minded by the strictures of the Chairman not to talk about people outside the committee.  I really cannot go much further into it.

That is a fine distinction to try and draw.</p><p>I want to put several quotes from the committee meeting on 7 March with Ms West and Ms Galligan.</p><p>Deputy Jack Chambers asked Ms West, &quot;Was she concerned that the Policing Authority had made no contact with her or Ms Galligan?&quot;  She responded, &quot;I have to be honest and say yes, I was very concerned.&quot;</p><p>She was further asked, &quot;Ms West was concerned that the Policing Authority had made no attempt to engage with her on the issues she had brought to bear.&quot;  She responded:</p><blockquote>Yes; I am sure it must have had a rationale.  I know that there are governance structures in place and chains of command, but I felt that if I was in that position and had people who clearly wanted to tell me something or be sure I was in possession of all the facts, I would have wanted to sit down and listen to what they had to say.</blockquote> <p>Deputy Kelly asked, &quot;If people from the Policing Authority were watching Ms West and me talking now and they asked to meet her, would Ms West accept that request and welcome it?&quot;  Ms West responded, &quot;Absolutely, yes.&quot;</p><p>Further on, Deputy Brophy observed, &quot;It is not just that the Policing Authority ignored it, then; it formally declined.&quot;  He later asked, &quot;Do the witnesses believe the Policing Authority let them down in how it dealt with them?&quot;  Ms West answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>I know Ms Feehily has offered a defence of the Policing Authority's response to this.  However, it is clear Ms Galligan and Ms West felt that they were let down and their concerns were not dealt with promptly or adequately.</p></speech>

I can only tell the Deputy, based on facts, what we did and the work that we did.  At no point did we decline.  That is not something I recall or can agree with in terms of their testimony.  I cannot accept either that they were not contacted.  Each time they made contact, they got a response - twice on the telephone and once in writing.  Each time they were thanked.  Each time they were assured we were not letting this issue drop and we were live to all of their concerns.</p> <p>  I accept this is perception.  They perceive things in a certain way.  Our belief is that we responded each time and that we persisted with all of the issues.  I suppose we felt that the most important thing we could do was persist in not letting this matter go away.  We persisted in ensuring that anything that came to the authority had to have complete sign-off by the analysis service.  Our perception and our belief is that we did not ignore their concerns.  We treated them as part of that intelligence that we had.  We persisted and continue to persist.  As I indicated earlier, we are not quite as reassured about the current state of play as they represented to the committee, based on our broader work.</p></speech>

Deputy Clare Daly asked:</p><blockquote>Ms West was told on 1 August by a member of Garda management that the Policing Authority was aware of her approaches and so on.  Did Ms West find this strange?</blockquote> <p>Ms West responded:</p><blockquote>That was in the context of a management meeting I was part of. It was raised with me as part of a wider management meeting.  Obviously, there were not many people present but I was immediately concerned.  To be honest I felt quite compromised.  I absolutely understand that there are governance structures and that people are very wary of sharing data, as are we.  We have been the souls of discretion in protecting data and case-specific information.  I felt it was a breach of trust and a compromise.  Where we had been trying to raise the issues and do what we felt was right to try to get the truthful message to enable the authority to be able to craft and ask pertinent questions at meetings, not only was our voice not being heard, they kind of told tales on us.</blockquote><p>It is hard to reconcile Ms Feehily's statements that it was common knowledge or whatever that they had elevated this issue to the Policing Authority with the comments made.  Perhaps I am not characterising that correctly.  Is it fair to say from Ms Feehily's previous answers to questions and from her opening statement that it was essentially common knowledge that these issues had been elevated by Ms West and Ms Galligan to the Policing Authority, such was their concern?</p></speech>

It was known and it was entirely unremarkable.  I stated earlier the fact that the Garda authorities gave us a copy of their letter and it was communicated back to Ms West that we had it.  The Deputy has to understand that the Policing Authority is engaging every day with people who work in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Telephone calls are made.  Matters received on headed paper, we are entitled to assume, are official, etc.  The fact that there was contact from the analysis service with the authority was certainly well known.  The first introduction from Ms West was that she had been given the name and personal number of the authority's secretary by a member of Garda senior management.  In that case, we were entitled to assume that it was knowledge.</p></speech>

Surely those are distinct.</p></speech>

The fact we said straight away that this was different indicates how unremarkable the previous contact had been.  The authority's chief executive contacted, wrote back and asked if we could use this information, and at that point, they indicated that we were not free to use that information which is why I am not in a position to discuss the content of that letter.  However, routine engagement, such as a telephone call asking if we can come to a meeting or asking about concerns, which was responded to was not regarded as confidential.</p></speech>

In the phone calls which Ms Feehily has described and has detailed to us, it sounds as though the sensitive details of this were not necessarily discussed.  As I say, there is clearly a distinction between official correspondence to the Garda commission and then across to the Policing Authority and the letter that was sent to the Policing Authority but the point at which Ms West was told that the Policing Authority - this is how it was put - "was aware of her approaches" was on 1 August, which is a considerable period after 11 May.  Is there any possibility that there was any indication from the Policing Authority to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there was direct contact between Ms Galligan and Ms West and the Policing Authority?  Was that ever conveyed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

I would indicate that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has taken the shortest time so far.  I am only reflecting to members that I had overlooked, and was reminded only a short time ago, that we are likely to have a vote in the D&aacute;il Chamber some time after 1 p.m.  I have sent a text to check.</p> <p>  I do not want to curtail anybody.  I want all members to have the full opportunity but I ask that each member be more precise and bring it to the earliest possible close.  I ask Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to continue.</p></speech>

It seems Ms Galligan and Ms West felt let down.  We can have differences of opinion on all of this.  There is a clear distinction between those initial phone calls, which are information inquiries, etc., and the later correspondence.  The later correspondence, which Ms Feehily stated is confidential, clearly was an escalation of a complaint and the detail of the concern to the Policing Authority.  It appears from their testimony that something of that nature, not necessarily the detail of it, was communicated back to them.  They appeared to be of the understanding that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had become aware, not that inquiries had been made about the progress of matters or where things were but that this had been escalated to the Policing Authority, and it was clearly their sense that this was not information that would be shared or that they could be confident that knowledge would not come back to them through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I must also underline that people perceive things differently.  For example, I noted in their evidence to the committee that they were surprised that we had received their letter to the Commissioner which they gave the Commissioner in May.  They had a particular perception about that also, whereas that was shared with us officially on the record and we confirmed that.  Their perceptions and our perceptions are perhaps different, in terms of the knowledge in the system about their concerns and about their disquiet, but their direct communication was handled confidentially.</p></speech>

We have no function and nowhere to go with it and refer it on.

I listened to the evidence of the ladies in great detail.  They were very clear that while there were issues, that was not the reason they had contacted the Policing Authority.  It is quite clear that they are very disillusioned and disheartened by the manner in which the authority has engaged with them.  Ms Feehily has offered a significant defence of the authority and its engagement.  I suggest she needs to look at her agency's protocols for dealing with this type of situation.</p> <p>  The other problem the Policing Authority has is one of gaining public confidence.  It is the most serious problem.  It is possible that public confidence in the authority has been eroded somewhat as a result of this issue.  If that is the case, the challenge for Ms Feehily is to regain public confidence.</p><p>I would like her opinion on the matter of public confidence.  She has already spoken about perception.  Public perception is most important in the work the Policing Authority does.</p></speech>

I think public confidence in policing and in policing accountability is enormously important, and I have spoken lots of times about it.  If public confidence in the authority has been dented by this, then we will have to work harder at it.  I would say, as I am biased and I have a lot of professional pride in the work the authority has done, that I believe that the authority has gained a lot of public confidence by the persistent way in which it has pursued a range of matters.  This is only one.  As I said in my earlier engagement, were it not for the authority, limited as it is, light would not be shone on a lot of Garda performance issues.</p></speech>

Their confidence in the Policing Authority was not what it should have been.  The public listening to their testimony here were beginning to wonder if there was an issue here and to ask what was going on.  The Policing Authority's representatives have given a fairly robust account of themselves, but they need to revisit their protocols and look at how they deal with people.  Those two ladies had a lot to offer, and the authority should have been engaging with them in a one-to-one meeting.  Ms Feehily talks about structures and that the authority wants things done officially through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Sometimes that does not work.  Sometimes when the Policing Authority gets information, it should be possible to pick up the phone and ask someone to come in for a chat.  Ms Feehily said that the authority gathers intelligence regularly from different sources.  Maybe it is now time to look at the authority's protocols again and meet some of these people.</p></speech>

I would still retain a very strong caveat.  We meet representative bodies, for example.  We meet victims' representative groups.  We have to be in a position to meet people in an official context.  Otherwise we are stuck with what we can do with the material.  This is one of the points the authority made in its review of its own effectiveness.  We are a particular type of creature of statute.  People assess the authority's performance by reference to what they think we ought to be able to do.  An oversight body has to stand above the body it is overseeing.  We have to be extremely careful about conflicts.  Otherwise we are reducing and damaging our capacity to do our job.</p></speech>

If all parties are happy to hand over transcripts for full accountability, I think it is quite extraordinary that the authority does not have that facility whereby most professional outlets have a system for recording calls for training and quality purposes, especially now that Ms Feehily has told the committee that the authority gathers intelligence over the phone and in writing from a host of people.  I am quite shocked that this type of record does not exist for the sake of accuracy.</p></speech>

It states, "Since late March 2017, we had intelligence" and also that the concerns of the two Garda analysts "were already well known to us before their contact".  Ms Feehily also stated: "I can honestly say that there was very little of substance in it about the review which we did not know or have grounds to believe since late March or early April of last year."  In her statement she referred three or four times to evidence and intelligence she already had.  She also mentioned that intelligence had been disclosed to her on the record for her to probe it.  If the intelligence is on the record, surely she can enlighten us on what it is and from whom it came because it seems to contradict some of the evidence given by the two analysts?  There is a contradiction and Ms Feehily must clarify the matter.</p></speech>

Obviously, I did not make myself clear.</p><p>When we receive intelligence, we seek to get it on the record.  The intelligence we had was not on the record.  The first step we took was to invite the analysis service to a meeting.  That happened.  The invitation was issued on or around 29 or 30 March.  We receive intelligence from a lot of sources and try to get material on the record which we can then interrogate.  The intelligence we had was not on the record.</p></speech>

When we receive intelligence about something which causes concern, we set about trying to verify it.

The people who were uncovering the evidence and actually investigating the whole process were the two people who contacted the Policing Authority.  I am not aware of anyone else who was actively pursuing PULSE system files at the time, apart from the two people who were actively involved and came before the committee.  On a weekly basis they were uncovering new evidence which they were willing to present to the authority.  However, Ms Feehily has said the authority already had it.  That is contradictory.</p></speech>

The detail of their issues and disquiet was contained in the letter of 11 May they had sent to the Commissioner.  From our records, the contact before that was simply a request to attend a meeting.  The response they received was that, from the Policing Authority's point of view, there was no difficulty with them attending.  It was a matter for the Garda.</p></speech>

From my perspective and that of others on the committee, the people concerned had a torch of intelligence that they wanted to provide for the authority on which to engage.  Their perception of the response of the authority is that they hit a brick wall.  Despite the assurances given, there is a difference between Ms Feehily's assurance and what they believe they received.  What is the reason their perception is one of stone-walling?

It is a big concern if the authority was aware of pressure that was imposed on the analysts to change, retrospectively, something the authority had rejected.

We pursued all of the concerns by insisting right up to Garda Commissioner level during July and August that we would accept nothing on this topic unless it was fully signed off by the analysts, which is why I reflected earlier that perhaps our pressure may have added to the pressure on them inadvertently.  That is how we dealt with their concerns.  When we could not deal with them directly, we dealt with them by treating it as intelligence and it informed our work.</p></speech>

We were aware of their disquiet and of their concerns.  I can go no further than to describe what was going on in July in general terms because I cannot talk about something I do not know.</p></speech>

If people approached the Department of Justice and Equality about a file that was submitted to it and about which they had concerns and someone from the Department contacted the Garda about the contact that had been made, there would be a level of concern about telephone contact on a disclosure someone had made regarding an issue it was pursuing.  The Policing Authority, as a regulator, has to be careful in the interests of transparency about the level of telephone contact.  I raised the issue about a year ago.  There is regulation and there is oversight and then there is this collaboration and active input.  The authority has to be very clear about separating the two, otherwise this will arise again.  I brought it up over a year and a half ago.  If there is collaboration and active input and involvement where the authority becomes the central point of policy input, how does it provide oversight for that?</p></speech>

How then, in the interests of the two people who appeared before us, can it provide the level of transparency for them when they feel they were rejected?</p><p>Procedures within the Policing Authority need to be reformed to ensure anyone who gives intelligence will believe it will be dealt with in such a way that they will be able to feel confident in bringing it to its attention.  There is the issue of perception and confidence.  Whether Ms Feehily agrees or disagrees, that is the reality and perception.  I brought up this issue a year and half ago when I said I had concerns about the level of collaboration.  It is equivalent to the Central Bank making decisions on the policy of a particular bank and the way in which it runs its show and then trying to provide for its oversight.  In governance terms, it is important that we have that degree of separation, which regular telephone contact does not achieve.  That is why there should be a separation that probably was not visible in this instance.  I do not know whether Ms Feehily wishes to respond on the issues I have raised or how she proposes to address them in order that if this were to happen again, persons bringing evidence to the committee would not have such a perception.</p></speech>

The Deputy has described very well, better than I did, the point of conflict and risk regarding how we could get involved or not, as the case may be.  I recall very clearly the Deputy raising this issue with me over a year and a half ago and I heard him then.  I hope the robust nature of some of the reports we have written on Garda performance gives him some comfort that we have not been captured.  It is the circular dilemma to which he referred.  If people are to come to us in confidence, will we be conflicted if we hear them?  Will we be conflicted if we meet them, as is being suggested, or would we better off in saying we will not even hear them?  The approach we have taken is that we should hear people and treat what they disclose as intelligence, in other words, it is not named, and that we should then seek, through the official channels, something we could oversee by calling for a meeting or the production of a report.  The Deputy has described very well how difficult it is to achieve this balance.</p></speech>

The process should be more formal than that, particularly for an authority, and removed in terms of the need for regulatory oversight.  I know that this is a procedural aspect, but when the authority will not meet people who wish to present matters to it, it should provide for the same distance and level of governance for those whom it regulates.  That is why there should be analysis and rigour in the formal public session or it should be done by way of correspondence.  There is a need to step back from telephone contact.  When those who were making the disclosures received the information from whoever it was in management, they felt a discussion was ongoing informally about what they were presenting to the Policing Authority.  They felt undermined and that their evidence was not being valued to the degree it should have been.  That is the issue of perception and we need to ensure it will not recur.</p></speech>

The legislation from which the authority works is not fit for purpose.  The powers of the authority need to be extended.  I had sympathy for Ms Feehily when she talked about how she had tried to influence the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get around certain issues.  </p> <p>  On the issue of ICT, which Deputy Wallace raised and which I have raised on numerous occasions, I, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, have greater capacity to deal with it than Ms Feehily.  That is insane.</p><p>Ms Feehily is chairperson of the Policing Authority.  We will deal with this soon, but I wish to run through a number of other issues first.</p><p> I am still not in any way clear about the use of Gmail.  Deputy Wallace and others raised this.  I raised it too and I specifically asked questions of all the senior managers, who all said they did not use it.  Obviously, Ms Feehily cannot talk about what is going on in the Charleton tribunal, but it is obvious that information has been given out in the tribunal which shows that Gmail is being used.  If the CAO said one thing in a committee, as seems to be the case, and said the complete opposite about providing a report to the authority, does that not raise huge concerns?  I am still not clear what has happened here.  I am still not clear whether a full report was done.  I know about the report.  Was it comprehensive?  Has it dealt with all the issues?  All the senior assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners, who answered the question one by one in another committee room, said they never used it for any official policing purposes, but I do not know what to believe any more.</p></speech>

There was an acknowledgement to us and to this committee some time ago that there was Gmail traffic.  Magazine articles were referred to, but the material did not in any way raise a concern.  My recollection is that we got that assurance on the record at the November 2016 authority meeting.  We called for the report; the report has been shared.  Deputy Wallace obviously has it.  I am inclined to the view that the CAO just forgot he had supplied us with a report.  We reminded him of this about two days later, or perhaps the day we realised he had indicated to the committee that there was no report.  Our focus has been on ensuring they get the technical fix in to ensure that it cannot be done, and that is progressing.  The thing we are disappointed with is that they have not yet signed off on a policy.</p></speech>

We are caught for time, and I am not trying to be rude.  I have great personal admiration for the work Ms Feehily has done previously, but I am not satisfied that the evidence that has been given is consistent on this issue.  I am not satisfied that the Garda Commissioner's Gmail account was not being used.  I am not satisfied that assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners have not been using Gmail for official Garda business either, and I ask Ms Feehily to look at that.  I understand the point about the policy going forward.  However, I want to know definitively and once and for all whether previous Commissioners, deputy commissioners or assistant commissioners have used Gmail for official Garda purposes in recent years, since Ms Feehily's inauguration.  I am not happy with how this is being dealt with or the evidence that has been given.  I know Ms Feehily pointed out what she said.</p> <p>  I referred before to a similarity regarding how evidence is being given to the Policing Authority regarding fixed notices, homicides and breath tests, juvenile liaison being next.  I refer to the Crowe Horwarth, CH, report on breath tests and the fact that there was an admonishment of chief superintendents regarding the fact that they had not done anything.  Then we were made aware that Assistant Commissioner Twomey had sent out a circular stating they were not to reply to Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan's request for information on this.  When was the authority made aware of the circular's existence?  Does-----</p></speech>

I have watched some of it.  The issue here is that on one side there is an attempt to mislead the Policing Authority and-or on the other side there is the question of the capacity of those presenting to the authority in the first place.  That raises even more alarming issues, that is, if those who are presenting such rubbish, lack of information or lack of detail to the authority in the first place are in such significant roles.  It is deeply worrying that there is an attempt to mislead the authority, and the members of the committee have all more or less come to that conclusion, or not provide sufficient information at the very least.  However, it is another thing to say that the capacity of those who were presenting and what they felt they could provide to the authority at that meeting on 27 April was of such a standard.</p></speech>

Ms Feehily spoke earlier on about when a clerk had to be appointed.  I refer to the &euro;26 million and ICT.  As I said earlier, the Committee of Public Accounts would probably have more capacity to look at that than the Policing Authority.  Obviously, the appointment of a clerk through the Policing Authority would have to go through a process.  This is nothing to do with the Charleton tribunal but it is to do with the Charleton liaison committee.  Was the Policing Authority consulted in any way about the hiring of any individuals in relation to that and should it have been?</p></speech>

Bear in mind that our approval is us, followed by the Department of Justice and Equality followed by Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not us on our own.  The first step had been missed and by the time I became aware of it, step two and three had happened.</p></speech>

That is an honest comment to the witnesses.  I am a supporter of the Policing Authority.  My political party created it.  We got some things right and some things wrong, which I will admit.

The committee commenced its consideration on Committee Stage at the meeting on 28 February last.  Today, we will continue our consideration of the Bill and then report back to the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  I remind members and people in the Gallery to switch off their mobile telephones completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording equipment in committee rooms even when on silent mode.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his officials.  Since our earlier meeting and in accordance with procedure, the Bills Office has accepted a further four amendments in the names of Deputies Troy, Michael Collins, Mattie McGrath and Danny Healy Rae.  It is proposed to group amendments Nos. 1 to 1d, inclusive, for the purposes of today's debate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 2 to 8, inclusive, have been ruled out of order and members have been advised accordingly.</p></speech>

We have a problem here sometimes with drafting.  I understand Deputy Troy's intent but the effect of what he has set down is not the same as what he intended.  We often hear complaints that drink-driving cases take too long to go to court.  According to the wording of the amendment, Deputy Troy wishes to move these cases from trial in front of a judge in a District Court to trial by jury in a higher court.  This would further delay the process.  That is what it would mean if we were to change the reference in the legislation from summary offences to, as suggested in the amendment, trial on indictment.  I am sure what is proposed is unintentional but it would further delay what is already a very lengthy process.  If there were a trial on indictment in every case, it would involve a jury having to be called and the case going to the Circuit Court.  There might be up to 1,800 people and a very long process.  I do not believe the Deputy meant for every case to go to trial on indictment but that is the effect of the amendment.</p> <p>  If the amendment were accepted, people in the lowest range of alcohol while driving - 50 mg for standard drivers and 20 mg for specified drivers such as learners or novices - would have to go to trial by jury, with a possible penalty of up to &euro;10,000 and-or two years in prison.  I am slightly at a loss.  I have been subject to much criticism about this Bill being disproportionate.  This amendment is disproportionate as well.  It would be an extraordinary move to bring every case of prosecution for alcohol while driving straight to the Circuit Court and before a jury.  I do not believe it could possibly be the intention to go straight to the Circuit Court.</p> <p>  The proposed amendment will unbalance the legislation on intoxicated driving.  Deputy Troy is proposing to make this change to section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which deals with intoxicated driving.  The Deputy might not have noticed that section 5 of that Act, which deals with intoxicants and being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle, parallels section 4 in structure and in offences.  By proposing to amend one and not the other, he is doubling one set of penalties and leaving the other untouched.  This seems to be a disproportionate response.  The Deputy probably meant, and would like, to make these equalised in one way or the other but he has not done so.</p> <p>  There is a general difficulty here.  I see it in several of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.  Members of the Opposition have difficulties in drafting amendments.  The fact is that they have certain intentions - whether they be the best or worst of intentions and with which we may or may not agree - but the meaning of the amendments when they are drafted and tabled is not exactly what they intended.  That raises the question of whether parties in the opposition have enough expertise at hand to draft complicated amendments to traffic legislation which is, by definition, extraordinarily complicated and difficult.  I am not being obstructive here but this happened with the last Bill we dealt with and the Clancy amendment.  We had a very well meaning amendment, the sentiments of which I agreed with and accepted, but when it came to it being implemented, it was drafted in a way which made that difficult.  I will remedy that on Report Stage of this Bill.  However, I will raise this question at Government level.  Members of the Opposition do not necessarily have the facilities to draft legislation in the way it should be drafted and whereby it means what they intend.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.1014" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018032100002#B00800"><p>The Minister is right.  I have highlighted my intention on every occasion we have discussed this legislation.  The Minister is correct that the Opposition is somewhat hamstrung due to the lack of resources.  The Minister originally mooted this Bill over 14 months ago and, even with the support of a full Department and its officials, it has still taken him this long to bring it to Committee Stage.  He can appreciate the frustration on this side of the House in terms of the lack of resources available to us.  We put forward amendments to try to improve legislation, which is why there are Committee and Report Stages.  If the Minister believes in the intention of an amendment, he has the wherewithal in the Department, while not accepting the amendment on Committee Stage, to work with me or any other Deputy who the Minister believes is making a worthwhile suggestion to try to address the anomalies that may have arisen and accept it on Report Stage.</p> <p>  This amendment relates to the fact that I believe the Minister is tackling the wrong element of this Bill.  We are going on the figures for fatal collisions that were produced in the period 2008 to 2012 by the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  We have no updated figures despite the fact that I have requested updated figures on numerous occasions from the Department of Justice and Equality and the fact that we know there have been 1 million fake breath tests.  The figures we are working on, from the report for the period 2008 to 2012, indicate that 38 of the fatal collisions involved alcohol as a factor, correlating to 39% of the fatalities.  Half of that 39% of fatalities involved blood alcohol levels in excess of 200 mg, four times the legal limit.  The Minister has done nothing about that.  He has decided to pick the low-hanging fruit in terms of putting people who might be marginally over the limit off the road.  We are not changing the limits here.  We are changing the penalty.  In the context of my proposed amendment, I am of the view that we should introduce much stricter penalties for people who are two, three and four times above the legal limit.  In the period to which I refer, people who were four times the legal limit contributed to half of the fatalities and the Minister has chosen to ignore that.</p></speech>

The parliamentary legal office is being beefed up, which is part of D&aacute;il reform, but that obviously has not become fully effective yet.  We all acknowledge that there must be robustness in amendments and legislation from the Opposition.  There was a great deal in the Minister's response relating to the quality of drafting and how complex legislation is in this area, and I acknowledge that it is.  However, I did not hear what he had to say about addressing the substance of the proposed amendment.  What does he have to say on that?</p> <p>  The Minister also referred to the Clancy amendment which will be introduced on Report Stage and which we were to see as soon as possible.  There will have to be a short debate in the House in advance of Report Stage to introduce it.  What is the position in terms of seeing that amendment?  I thought we would see it within days.  Perhaps I have missed it but I have not seen it.</p></speech>

The Minister said at the last meeting that he would have that amendment for members of the committee.  Can he give us an update on it?  In the interest of transparent and open debate, it is important that members see his amendment before it can be fully debated.  It probably cannot happen on Committee Stage now unless we adjourn it until he can show it to us.</p></speech>

It is still in the Attorney General's office.  I can never give an actual date for the Attorney General's office but we made an inquiry about it in the last day or two and I gather it is at a very late stage there.  I do not believe there is any major problem.  The moment I get it, I will circulate it to the committee members.  We are putting that office under pressure.</p></speech>

Where we have a debate in advance of it, that is really a return to a Second Stage debate, so it is a fait accompli where we either accept or reject the wording as opposed to having the ability to amend it.  It is a very flawed process.  It is not the first time we have seen this process used, and sometimes it is useful to get something included in a Bill that otherwise would have to wait for the next legislative measure.  However, it is very unsatisfactory at the same time.  It would be helpful if we had time to process the amendment in advance of Report Stage, at least.</p></speech>

I am somewhat caught in a bind here.  I am keen to get this amendment into the legislation but I do not wish to delay Committee Stage again.  Deputy Troy is correct that this Bill has taken an incredibly long time and if we were to delay the legislation further in anticipation of that, it could take ages.  We want to get this legislation through and there have been efforts to filibuster it, as members might be aware.  I am trying to keep the momentum going on the legislation as it is.  It is open to members to table amendments for Report Stage, which would be welcome.  All I can promise is that I will circulate the amendment as soon as I get it.  That will give members time to debate it and they can table their own amendments on Report Stage because they have given notice of their interest in this subject as well.  I do not have any other options short of delaying this procedure now, which I am reluctant to do.  We must try to get this legislation through because we believe it is going to save lives.  That is the motivation behind it.  The delay is only due to what I believe is serious legal scrutiny, and the last thing I want after this legislation is passed, hopefully, is to have this clause being challenged or getting into the same state as happened with the Opposition's amendment, which was that it was impossible to implement and legally unsound.</p> <p>  The options for me are to go ahead or delay this Bill now in favour of having one legislative measure.  I am happy to go through it in the D&aacute;il with absolute and total scrutiny and I am happy, as I have been in road traffic cases, to accept amendments from the Opposition.  I have no difficulty with input from the Opposition here.  That is why, while I do not agree with the substance of what Deputy Troy is saying, I expressed frustration at what was happening with his amendment because it is so badly drafted that it cannot possibly be accepted.</p></speech>

In my experience in the House, and the Minister has been a Member of the Oireachtas for longer than me, if the Opposition proposes an amendment the Minister is often advised that whereas the substance of the amendment is fine, its wording is flawed so the Minister must bring it back to the Parliamentary Counsel.  Therefore, introducing an amendment from the Opposition for the first time on Report Stage is a recipe for ensuring that there can be no amendment.  The Minister knows that as well as I do because he has been here for longer than me.</p></speech>

One can see how difficult it is to get something from the Attorney General's office.  If something is introduced on Report Stage, there is not the head space or time to scrutinise Opposition amendments.  That is a fair comment to make.  It is not a slight on the Minister.  We understand he is trying to introduce something positive, but, for something that is so important, there is a deficiency in the approach being taken.

First, I take serious issue with the Minister's comment that there was filibustering on this issue in the D&aacute;il.  It is a false accusation.  The Minister is like a dog with a bone.  Before Christmas 2015 there was a spike in the number of road fatalities and without due investigation and a proper examination, he jumped straightaway to increase fines for those found to be above the lower drink limits.  The committee engaged in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill nearly 12 months ago.  I remind it that the former Chairman, now a Minister of State at the Minister's Department, produced a report which was inconclusive on whether this amendment to the Road Traffic Act was necessary.  Also in support of my argument, in the Minister's deliberations 12 months ago he stated the reason he was introducing the increased penalties was the system was being abused.  At the same time, however, when I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue of repeat offenders, no figures were available in respect of this section which we are being asked to amend to increase the penalties.</p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy is correct when he says the Minister is trying to pick the fruit from the lower branches of the tree and that he is not assessing the entire issue.  What has the Minister been doing about the flaws in existing road traffic legislation dating back to the 1960s?  We saw a programme - it might have been a "Prime Time" programme - which showed that people caught driving while excessively over the limit had been able to walk out of the court because of flaws in the Road Traffic Act.  What are we doing about this?  Why are we not bundling that legislation?  Nothing is being done about it.  I refer to some of my colleagues who asked questions about this issue in the D&aacute;il.  At the end of the day, we have to acknowledge that in 2015 there was an upturn in the economy, but there was a smaller Garda presence.  I bet that tomorrow morning, because of the extra Garda presence, the existing legislation would be shown to be working perfectly.  I refer to a well known traffic expert referring to other legislation.  He asked why we needed more legislation when we could just enforce existing legislation.  That is the kernel of the point being made.</p> <p>  The Minister has become like a dog with a bone on this issue.  We must not forget the impact this legislation will have on rural Ireland.  The Minister can come here with gimmicks such as tax incentives, rural transport initiatives and measures to increase the provision of taxis - he has also talked about insurance - but no one from any organisation is coming forward to say the Bill will work and that it is a solution.  The Minister is going down the wrong track.  There is no need for this legislation.  We have already discussed the issue and are wasting more time here.  The Minister has to be fair; take his beating on this one and focus on other major issues in the transport network which need to be resolved.  Where was his reaction when there were two fatalities before Christmas at dangerous junctions on national primary roads?  There was no sign of him.  Even with regard to the number of cyclist fatalities----</p></speech>

Deputy Kevin O'Keefe is pretty good at firsts.  I do not really wish to respond as we have been over this ground before.  I do not question the sincerity of Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe, but he is completely and utterly wrong.  I am not sure there if is an awful lot I can add to what he has had to say.  I will just say I do not think any Minister has introduced more legislation or been more determined on the issue of road safety and saving lives than I have, but that is not to say there is not a lot to be done.  The Deputy is absolutely right, tre is a huge amount to be done.  We completed the drugs Bill and hope to complete this one.  We will introduce measures to tackle speeding.  I have announced that I am to introduce and sign a statutory instrument on the passing distance in respect of cyclists.  We have put an enormous amount of energy into trying to save lives.</p><p>I accept the criticism that we have not done enough because one never can do enough to save lives.  It has been difficult but we have got momentum going on this and we are determined to continue with it, whatever the opposition.  The Deputy is also right that there are other areas we could address but we cannot do everything all at once.  This Bill has had a very long passage because of opposition, which was genuinely felt.  The next Bill will probably also have a long passage because road traffic legislation is difficult but we are going to introduce it and we are going to implement it.</p></speech>

It is he who has failed to secure Government time to debate this measure in the D&aacute;il, and it is not the Opposition.  If he had secured time in the D&aacute;il, as he said he would, before the last summer recess it would have been dealt with.  I will move amendment No. 1a.</p> <p>  The Minister is cynically presenting this Bill as a fix-all for drink driving and condemning the quality of the amendments that have been put by the Opposition.  At the same time, he claims he is advancing this Bill to save lives.  I accept there might be quality issues but we are working on independently audited figures from the Road Safety Authority from 2008-2012.  Is the Minister and the Department still working from those figures or has the Road Safety Authority submitted new, updated figures?</p> <p>  Can the Minister confirm the current strength of the traffic corps?  Does he accept my amendment, on a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a fine of &euro;10,000?  One half of fatality cases in the report on the 2008-2012 period involved alcohol in excess of 200 mg, four times over the legal limit, but the Minister is saying that, because of a quality issue with an amendment, he cannot accept it.  Can he accept the principle of the proposal?  If so, can he work with us and his officials to see if we can improve on the amendment for Report Stage, to ensure we can enable a judge to send out a very clear message to someone who has four times the legal limit of alcohol in their system?</p></speech>

A good case could be made for me to accept that there should be fiercer penalties for those who have offended in a more excessive way but I will not accept people being liable on an indictable conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000.  The effect of this amendment is to make every single case go straight to the Circuit Court in front of a jury.  Is that what the Deputy wants?</p></speech>

He is being pedantic.  He has chosen to focus on one element of a report on the period between 2008 and 2012 and ignored what contributed to the vast majority of fatalities, instead bringing in an amendment to disqualify people with between 50 mg and 80 mg of alcohol in their system.  He is saying he does not want to work with Opposition Members to bring about stiffer penalties for repeat offenders.  If he was serious about reducing deaths on our roads he would start with the area that contributed to the most fatalities, not the one that contributed to the least number.</p></speech>

Instead, his amendments avoid the issue of disqualification and would continue to allow people to drive with between 50 mg and 80 mg of alcohol in their system.

It costs more lives at higher levels than it costs at lower levels.  It still costs lives at lower levels and people should be disqualified at the lower levels.  This is the fundamental disagreement we have.  I want to disqualify these drivers with the lower levels of alcohol and the Deputies do not.  That is the members' view and the fundamental disagreement about the Bill.  Presumably this is why the Deputies are refusing to support the Bill and this is their right as democratically elected representatives.</p> <p>  Reference was made to statistics.  We do sometimes quote 2008 to 2012 figures.  They are very powerful statistics, especially the 38% figure we quoted a legendary number of times, but that figure is probably worse now that it was.  We have quoted an enormous number of detailed figures in the D&aacute;il and I will give some of them to the committee if it wants me to.  During 2013 to 2018 a total of 381 road users died in road traffic accidents in the State.  The 2013 to 2014 coroners' data captures 269 of these fatalities with 82 of these fatalities, or 30.5%, having alcohol present as a factor in the accident.  Eight of the fatalities were in the 21 mg to 50 mg range.  Six of the fatalities were in the 51 mg to 80 mg range.  Four of the fatalities were in the 81 mg to 100 mg range.  I put it to Deputy Troy that I do not like quoting these figures in that particularly inhuman way.  I do not regard human beings as figures.  We keep coming out with figures but every time we quote a figure in this regard we are speaking of a dead person.  To save one life is enough, if we are sure of it, for legislation.  We want to save that life.  That is what we are about here.</p> <p>  The Deputies want to continually quote figures and they say we should be doing this, that or the other.  I believe the Deputies should stop talking about figures and start talking about human beings.  If we can show that one or two people will be saved by this legislation then it is good and it is enough.  In time we will address every other issue also.  Of the 82 fatalities where alcohol was a factor, 44% of the cases also had one or more drugs present; in 63% of these cases it was the driver, in 17% of the cases it was pedestrians and in 11% it was the passengers.  The 38% figure from the pre-crash 2008 to 2012 study refers to fatal collisions; the 30% cited above refers to fatalities.  I do not need any more convincing than that to know that this is a major and difficult problem, and that drink impairs driving and causes death.</p> <p>  I can quote statistics until the cows come home.  I do not believe the Chairman wants me to.   </p></speech>

The Minister is right but he is wrong in some of his assertions.  We helped and ensured the passage of the Bill on Second Stage to allow it to move on to Committee Stage.  I am concerned and worried based on the length of time it has taken the Minister to bring in this one piece of legislation.  In his contribution a few moments ago the Minister seemed to believe he was the most reforming Minister on road safety, but this is the only Bill that he has initiated that he will bring to the end.  The Road Traffic Bill dealing with drug driving was left by the Minister's predecessor and the current Minister has brought it through the D&aacute;il, to be enacted, after eight months.  It has taken the Minister 14 months to bring this legislation to this stage.  I am concerned that if the Minister is to address road traffic fatalities on a piecemeal basis and it takes 14 months at every stage, then it would have made more sense to address the causes of fatalities at the higher end than at the lower end.  This is a simple point.</p><p>It is not contradictory for me to believe that the Minister's proposal is disproportionate.  A much more proportionate sanction would be five penalty points and a &euro;500 fine.  Figures were give to the committee and to the D&aacute;il by the Minister during deliberations in the committee last year.  The Minister has never answered a question to me directly about the 2016 last full set of figures the Minister made available to members during Committee Stage.  Of the 8,100 motoring offences for drink driving, 93% of the people convicted were found to be in excess of 80 mg.  This means that 93% of people who were convicted were subject to automatic disqualification and 7% were in the lower category of the penalty points system and a fixed fine.  If automatic disqualification was the deterrent the Minister says it is, then one would expect it to have been a reverse of those figures.  With regard to the regulatory impact analysis of the road traffic (fixed penalty - drink driving) Bill 2017, presented to committee members on 30 January 2017, one of the things considered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was an increase in the fixed penalty amount.  The regulatory impact analysis states:</p><blockquote>An increase in the fixed penalty amount was also considered, but given that this would impact on the timelines for implementing this change (significant IT administration changes in both An Post and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) coupled with the fact that the real deterrent is the disqualification and not the monetary amount, it was considered not necessary to increase the fixed penalty amounts at this time. </blockquote> <p>This says that the Minister's and the Department's considerations are the increased cost and the timeline for implementation of change, along with significant changes to IT systems.  It is not just I who have considered this measure; the Minister's own Department has also considered it.  Some of the reasons it was ruled out of order were the increase in &quot;the timelines for implementing this change&quot; and the IT administrative changes that would be needed.  </p></speech>

The expectation of being caught is a very sizeable deterrent.  As I said at the previous meeting, the issues around fake breath tests and so on have done no service to this area and there is a need to come back from that.</p><p>Like other members of the committee, I have been lobbied on this legislation but not by the large drinks companies.  It was very much local lobbying on issues such as employment in the area and the impact of the legislation in that regard.  It was targeted.  People and businesses are entitled to make those points, but let us not ignore the fact that that is a backdrop to what has happened.  We have all experienced it.  </p><p> We have to make a decision in the public interest.  The committee met the Road Safety Authority to discuss the issue.  The statistics it provided were not dry.  They were derived from inquests into fatal road accidents.  I came here with an open mind.  It is a big deal to put a person off the road, even if for only three months because it can be life-changing in terms of work and being able to get insurance into the future.  In its responses to the committee the Road Safety Authority was very convincing.  We need to focus on the evidence.  I was particularly concerned about the morning after a conviction.  Several people who had contacted me said they were very concerned about this being an impediment.  As I have said previously, I tend to think it has more to do with home drinking than drinking in pubs and so on, but that would probably require some analysis.  According to the Road Safety Authority, 14% of all alcohol related fatal crashes occur between 6 a.m. and noon and that 15% of all alcohol related fatal crashes involving a driver or motor cyclist occur between 6 a.m. and noon.  This is an issue about which I had a particular concern, but the evidence must be acknowledged.</p><p> Getting legislation of this type over the line is never easy.  I can remember a time when there were no drink driving limits.  There is a supermarket in my area, which was previously the Hitchin Post.  People used to drive there and back, but this behaviour was modified by the introduction of drink driving limits.  Reducing the limits helped to save lives.  If we find evidence that will further enhance road safety and saves lives, there is an obligation on us to legislate in that regard, regardless of how unpopular it makes us.  I am supporting this legislation because the evidence supports it.  The public attitude surveys show that people support it and that support is greater in rural than in urban areas, which is remarkable when one considers the impact it will have on people's social lives, the level of rural isolation and so on, which is better understood in rural areas because it is a lived life.</p><p> I am not satisfied with the enforcement provisions and believe there is a piece of work yet to be done in that regard, but this change will be beneficial.  While it will impact on a small number of people only, if it is to have a positive impact, it will need to be enforced.</p></speech>

The Minister will probably try to ban contact sports in situations where people end up paralysed owing to freak accidents.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has become loaded.  Has the committee heard submissions from the Irish Road Haulage Association or similar organisations?</p> <p>  It has to be acknowledged that following on from the provision of additional resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it has become more competent in enforcing road traffic legislation.  As I said, if existing legislation was enforced better, we would have better results.  In sport, a player is issued with a yellow card and then a red card.  If what is provided for in this legislation comes into force, people's lives will be ruined.  Under current legislation, they are given a second chance, but under this legislation, despite having committed only a minute offence, they will be banned from driving.  By way of example, a girl interviewed in the public survey mentioned how she had consumed a moderate amount of alcohol on a night out but because of her physique when she was stopped on the roadside the following morning and tested she was over the limit.  However, by the time she had reached the Garda station and been retested, she was okay and got away with a fine.  She said she had learned her lesson.  There are many people who will find themselves in a similar position.  We need to give people a chance and not destroy their lives.  </p> <p>  We should also not seek to destroy the lives of people living in rural areas.  Mental health is a big issue in the context of this legislation, particularly for those living in isolated areas.  I do not like going on and on like a broken record, but I would like to give an example to show how this legislation will impact on such individuals.  A general practitioner told me that when he and his wife were out walking, they would often have been passed along the way by a person they knew driving to the local pub and that since the introduction of the drink driving limits, he no longer went to the pub and that when they passed his house, they would see piles of cans and so on stacking up at the side.  When one is drinking in a pub, one is doing so in a controlled environment.  People who live in isolated areas were doing so, but now they are drinking at home with no control over the level of alcohol they are consuming.  This may be good in the context of road safety, but it will lead to a lack of engagement with neighbours and others and isolation.  What about these lives?  The impact of this legislation on the lives of such individuals will be huge.  </p> <p>  The Minister referred to crashes in which alcohol was a factor.  Does he have data for the roadworthiness of the vehicles involved or the condition of the roads?  When a person is found to be over the limit, is the condition of a vehicle also taken into account in the even of an accident?  In other words, are the brakes and tyres examined?  All of these things come into play when an accident occurs, but they are being pushed aside for the Minister's gain in having this legislation enacted quickly.  He needs to take on board the points we are making.  On the surveys he mentioned which were carried out by the RSA, what questions were put to those surveyed and when were they put to them?  If I were to ask people in my area tomorrow morning if they were happy with the drink driving laws, they might say yes.</p><p>What way were questions put to people?  Are they in favour of drink-driving?  No one is in favour of drunk-driving.  As for where Deputy Troy is coming from, those who go beyond the one or two drinks maybe need to be penalised more to teach them a lesson.  I ask that those people be given the yellow card as we go ahead.</p></speech>

Somebody asked the Minister about it earlier.  I nipped out for a couple of minutes or did not get the answer.  The Minister promised in the last quarter of last year to have a 10% increase in the traffic corps.  He gave a commitment just before or just after the summer that we would absolutely see a 10% increase.  I want his view on that.  Did he deliver on that?  What plans does he have to increase the traffic corps further for this year?  On the amendments that were not allowed, I had put one down about the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport reviewing rural transport and looking at additional initiatives.  This is an age-old problem that has been around for a long time.  I read that the Minister said that he would look at initiatives.

It takes lives in many ways.  It definitely takes lives on the roads but it also takes lives through illness.  It makes a misery of other people's lives and all we have to do is go down the main street of our towns on the weekends to see what is happening, or go into the emergency departments of hospitals.  I have spoken many times about the need to deal with this huge cultural issue in our society.  I welcome the Bill that is before the Houses about the alcohol issue.  Surprisingly, I have not been lobbied that strongly about this Bill.  I cannot remember any significant lobbying on the Bill.  I believe that when one tackles any problem, one goes to where the biggest gain is possible.  When we look at statistics, we know where the big gains are, such as people far exceeding speed limits, not the person who, at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. at night, goes through some country village at 60 km/h.  They are not the big killers.  Those of us who are perennially on the road see them.</p> <p>  Let us talk about enforcement.  Since 2011, I have travelled something like 500,000 km of road in Ireland in my car.  I think I was breathalysed three times.  I assure the House that each of the three times was, of course, random.  I was breathalysed about two months ago, one evening, after having driven from Tipperary to Dublin, on a very quiet suburban street.  There was no problem.  I guarantee that I had no alcohol on board.  It was the easiest thing to take a deep breath.  That was three times over 500,000 km.  I drive on main roads, on byroads and on rural roads.  The first thing we have to face up to is that all one is creating is a mega-lottery.  Without consistent enforcement, all of this is a waste of time.  It will just be a matter of luck whether one is caught or not.  I would say that if one checked out the number of actual, real checkpoints that have taken place, one would find that, because it is so random in my case as to where I am, what time it is, day and night, and so on, it is fairly representative for anybody else.</p> <p>  The Minister has done nothing to ensure that students or workers from Galway, for example, can get bus services after 6 p.m. on many of the radial routes out of the city to areas 30 km or 40 km away from the city.  The Minister has done very little about rural transport and rural transport options.  I always believe that if one wants to reduce occurrences of an incident, one makes it much easier for people to avoid it.  Every one of us has been at too many funerals over the years of people who have been killed in alcohol-related accidents.  One of the great successes between 1997 and 2011 was the dramatic decrease in road fatalities.  Legislation was brought in during that time, most of which I spent at Cabinet and I supported that legislation.  Much of it related to both speeding and the issue of alcohol in blood.  There is no question that we went from being a country with a very high level of fatalities and reduced it.  Other factors were involved, since we increased enforcement, and also better roads.  There is not a need here, in my view, for a moral lecture.  The problem here is twofold.  If I am reading the right statistics, drivers with more than 251 mg comprised 39 fatalities, those with more than 201 mg comprised 37 fatalities, those with 151 mg to 200 mg comprised 25 fatalities and those with 101 mg to 150 mg comprised 20 fatalities.</p><p>Qualitatively, given the funerals we attend and the tragedies that happen, any of us could have said that this is where the major problem is.  How does one stop that major carnage?  Compared with that, the figure is seven for drivers between 51 and 80 mg per millilitre.  I agree that if the Minister was going to reduce that figure to zero it would be significant.  However, it would not be half as significant as reducing the figure of 39 to ten for the 251 mg per millilitre or from 39 to 30, if the Minister is saying that every life counts.</p><p> Why do I have a problem with the Minister's proposal?  There are two reasons.  Incidentally, I wish to make it clear that I have no support for the argument for going to the pub, having three or four pints and then toddling home.  I accept that on many rural roads, for older people, statistically the risk is small because there is just no traffic.  On many a night that I drive 30 miles home from meetings, and I assure the Minister I would not be drinking, I do not meet another car on the road.  I might meet one or two but on certain stretches of road I would not meet any car on most nights.  However, I am not justifying that or making a case for that.  The Minister is saying that if people have a few drinks on a night out and if they drive to work and are between 50 and 80 mg per millilitre he will disqualify them from driving.  One of the problems is that most people will not know that they are between 50 and 80 mg per millilitre.  We know that, statistically, the body mass of women is less than that of men so they are more likely to get caught having consumed the same amount of alcohol.  Heavier people and so forth have a better chance.  Then there are metabolism issues and the like.  I have a problem with the lottery element of this and the proportionality of the penalty, not the principle.</p><p> The Minister seems to think that there is no penalty that has any measure of deterrent in it other than being put off the road.  However, if that were true the horrendous statistics at the high end would be long gone as a thing of the past due to the deterrent of the penalty.  It is also a disproportionate penalty, as I said in the D&aacute;il previously, for rural people versus urban people.  In this city and in Galway city we are told there is, effectively, a bus service within 500 m. of everybody's house.  Where I live there is one bus service eight miles away that goes to Galway in the morning and returns in the evening.  There is no way of getting children to school or of getting to work.  The penalty of getting disqualified in a rural area, therefore, is totally disproportionate in terms of the cost to the person, his or her livelihood and the daily things the person must do.  One of things we must do with law is try to make it proportionately equal for everybody.</p><p> Deputy Troy has tried to propose two things to deal with the 39, 37 and 25 figures, that is, the areas where we are getting the big numbers.  Yes, it is probably badly drafted.  However, what one does in that situation on Committee Stage is say, "That is a great idea.  I will come back to it on Report Stage."  Deputy Troy is taking out the big figures, but for some reason the Minister is not running with something that would deal with those figures.  He is wedded to the exact formulation.  We agree with the principle of stiffer penalties, but the Minister will not even look at the formulation of his proposal in respect of the very small figure.</p></speech>

I wish to explain exactly what my personal concerns are, and they are not the concerns of any lobby group.  They are about the lottery effect.</p> <p>  I will explain the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal.  If somebody is prone to not obeying the rules of the road, is careless about speed and various other matters and if there is reasonable enforcement, there is a high chance that the person will have over seven penalty points.  When one adds five points to that there is a total of 12 and the person will get six months off the road.</p> <p>  If the person is persistently careless, unless the person is very lucky and there is no enforcement, under our proposal that person with seven or more penalty points will end up with twice the length of disqualification.  We are trying to protect somebody who in good faith did not realise that they had between 51 and 80 mg per millilitre.  As I said, it depends on so many variables.  One could have 49 mg per millilitre and one will be fine but if one has 51 one is in trouble.  At the low end of that, such as 52 mg per millilitre, one does not realise it.  One does not realise, because of how one's metabolism works, that one is still over the limit.  Somebody who has never had other driving issues, who has always adhered to speed limits, driven with care and thought he or she was all right could suddenly end up in a situation where he or she cannot do the essentials for which one needs a car in most parts of the country, such as bringing children here and there and getting to work.  If I live and work in the city and I am on one of the bus routes I can get the bus.  To be unable to drive in rural Ireland is a massive cost.  In some cases people would have to pay a driver for three months.  That is the problem. </p> <p>  As I said, the person who is careless will have the seven penalty points anyway so that person will be off the road.  I am talking about the person with the unblemished record who drove in good faith and did not realise.</p><p>If someone goes into a pub and knocks back three or four pints, he or she knows that a risk is being taken and that he or she will be put off the road.</p></speech>

I ask that the Minister consider carefully the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment which is balanced and reasonable.  I will support him in anything he does to tackle what we all know is the real problem - the carnage on the roads caused by people who are driving, despite having been disqualified after consuming enormous amounts of alcohol.  Many complain about speeding offences on the grounds that someone who toddles along at 5 km/h or 7 km/h over the speed limit - I accept that it is against the law - receive three penalty points when someone else who is 20 km/h or 30 km/h over the limit receive exactly the same number of penalty points.  I am arguing for proportionality.  The further someone is over the speed or alcohol limits, the greater the risk and the bigger the penalty should be.  It should be a graded system.  What disqualification could mean for ordinary, decent people should be understood.</p></speech>

I thank him for his reasoned and eloquent explanation of the views he and many people in rural Ireland hold.  His comments were representative of the views of other's.  I am not saying he is pleading for it, but we cannot make a different law for rural Ireland than for urban Ireland.  I do not see that as a possibility or probability, nor would it be right to do so.</p> <p>  The Deputy was correct to refer to the carnage on the roads.  Carnage is one, two or three deaths.  What is important in the Bill, apart from its detail which is critical, is that it sends the message that we are serious about tackling drink driving.  While the Bill, rightly, affects the 50-80 mg group that is its target, the message must also go out that we will not tolerate drink driving.  People take disqualification more seriously than penalty points because it has a more dramatic effect on their lives.  Consequently, it will deter them.  It is a heavy price to pay, but it is not the price paid people who are killed.  That is why it is worth paying.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Catherine Murphy's point, all of the evidence from rural Ireland is subjective, whereas we are discussing independent evidence provided by the Road Safety Authority and, as far as I know, in the survey conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes.  The evidence is that people living in rural Ireland want such measures.  The evidence is clear that more lives are lost in rural Ireland than in urban Ireland as a result of drink driving.  There is sometimes an extraordinary mismatch between the advocates for rural Ireland and the cold statistics provided by such surveys which are scientific.  I am not sure what is happening, as I do not believe people living in rural Ireland are up in arms on this issue.  Being disqualified affects people badly, but there are more people in rural Ireland who have been bereaved and support the introduction of such a Bill.  We, in this House, may have created something of a false divide.</p></speech>

That point has been made by many people.  Deputies Robert Troy, Kevin O'Keeffe, Catherine Murphy and Imelda Munster also raised it and I accept that it has been a problem.  It is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am not washing my hands of it in any way, but I cannot speak for that Department.  What I will say is that it was a serious problem, as the number of personnel in the traffic corps was decreasing.  I have some figures.  At the end of 2013 the number of personnel in the traffic corps was 804.  In 2014 it had decreased to 742.  In 2015 it had decreased to 716.  By the end of 2016 it had decreased to 674.  The Deputies are right, in that this has been a difficulty.  I am not saying it has been sorted, but I will discuss what has happened since.  There was a target to increase Garda traffic corps numbers by 10% in 2017 and a further 10% in 2018.</p></speech>

There is a road safety meeting every two months involving the principal stakeholders, namely, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Attorney General, various other Ministers, the RSA and all other such stakeholders.</p><p>At every single meeting, the Garda representatives are being put under pressure to say what is happening with the traffic corps and enforcement.  We are acutely aware of it.  It has turned that corner.  Obviously, one can say there are 150 in the last two years, which is 10% per year by the end of this year.  They have to be trained as well and the Deputy will raise that, as is quite right.  It is improving and it has got to improve.  They are going to be under pressure to enforce this law more strictly.  It is a fair point.  It was bad but we are not unaware of it and are certainly doing something about it.  It is a question I ask every single time, as does the RSA and others.  The Department of Justice and Equality is there as is the Garda.  It is not restricted to public statements in the D&aacute;il but is also regarded as very important behind closed doors.  Figures are going to be released on a very regular basis.</p><p> I hope that the message is getting out.  Deputies may say the measure is small and we should be tackling a lot of other things; that is what Deputy O'Keeffe says.  However, I disagree with Deputy O'Keeffe about the RSA.  It has been producing some very strong advertising.  This, together with the debate to which all Deputies present have contributed, is sending a message out to people to be more careful on the roads and that road safety is their responsibility.  There are indications over the years that the general trend is improving.  There is greater consciousness.  There have been some very moving advertisements on television with the victims' groups very bravely coming forward and telling their own stories.  I am not claiming credit myself for them.  I think that has had an effect.  We just marginally got the lowest figures ever last year for deaths on the roads.  That is not a cause of satisfaction at all.  I think it was 160, which is appalling and totally unacceptable.  However, there is a message going out that road safety has moved up the agenda and that people have a responsibility.  The Bill is part of that message and I hope it is going to continue with further legislation on other issues.  It will continue as long as I am here.  I will introduce more legislation this year on road safety.  We are deadly serious about it.</p><p> I am very sorry if I gave the Deputy a moral lecture.  I did not mean to do that.  That is not the objective.  It is a kind of moral issue but it was not meant to be a moral lecture at all.  Far be it from me to give anyone a moral lecture about anything.  It does seem to me to be a no-brainer that if a measure of this sort saves lives, we should pursue it.  It is not a moral issue but a matter of trying to see that more families are not bereaved.  I will submit to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and come second to him on morality.  I am happy to do that.</p><p> Deputy Munster raised the issue of the traffic corps and the 10%.  I think I have answered that.  Yes, it is happening by the end of this quarter, which is now.  That should be completed and there should be 150 new members, which I think is actually over the 10%.  There is a bit of a time lag on it.  Enforcement is absolutely vital, the Deputy is quite right.  The introduction of the measures in some way acts as an impetus and incentive for the Garda to enforce.  They realise that as well.  There is an onus on the Government to produce the garda&iacute; to enforce the measures we are introducing.  I do not think we should hold back because enforcement was inadequate.  I do not think it is now.  I actually think this acts as some sort of pressure on other Departments to do what is necessary in terms of enforcement.</p></speech>

Where the Minister and Government let themselves and families down is in failing to provide the practical tools to enforce the legislation.  That is what gives weight to the argument that it is not worth the paper it is written on.  The resources to enforce it must be provided.</p> <p>  I distinctly remember that when I raised the matter with the Minister last year, he was 100% confident that by the final quarter of last year, we would see a 10% increase in the traffic corps.  I am not blaming the Minister directly but he can see the point where everything falls down.  His whole argument, the whole justification falls down when he or the Government do not see to it that the resources are provided to back it up.  That is extremely disappointing.  Now we have to wait all of this year and who knows, come the final quarter of this year, if we will even see that or even one tenth of the 150.  Even at that, 150 is actually just 20 more in the traffic corps than in 2013.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>

Nobody is arguing that enforcement was adequate up to recently or that the traffic corps is at full strength.  It is not.  However, in respect of the numbers I gave, 150 is going to be over 10%.  I do not know what the up-to-date numbers are today but we will get that in the next-----</p></speech>

That will be well over 10% per annum.  The Deputy questions introducing this legislation without having the enforcement there.  Enforcement has been increasing during the passage of this legislation even though the legislation is not even on the Statute Books yet.  The increase in the traffic corps, happily, will coincide almost exactly with the passage of this legislation.  That may be a coincidence, but I think it will take the sting out of the criticism the Deputy is rightly making.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe raised enforcement as well.  He referred to this as a minute offence.  I suppose that is where I disagree with him more fundamentally.  I regard it as a serious offence, not a minute offence.  I think it would be absolutely wrong and I take issue with the Deputy when he talks so casually about the one or two drinks.  That kind of statement encourages people to think that having two drinks is acceptable.  That leads to a culture of acceptance of drinking and driving.  I do not accept the jargon we use about a yellow card.  There are no yellow cards in drinking and driving; it is a red card situation and that is it as far as I am concerned.  It is impairment.  One drink impairs driving and two drinks impair it more.  It is that kind of casual talk that leads to a culture of people getting into their cars and saying it will be alright when it will not be.  I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy and I do not think we are going to agree about this.  Deputy O'Keeffe has always taken that point of view and that is perfectly legitimate.</p> <p>  The other thing Deputy O'Keeffe regularly addresses here is the fact that there are lots of other problems.  There are; he is right.  He refers to bad brakes, bad roads and bad road conditions.  There are problems there as well.  However, that does not mean we should not address this one.  It may mean we should be more progressive and energetic in respect of other problems as well.  That does not mean this one should not be addressed, however.  It is a diversionary argument.</p> <p>  I was interested in what Deputy Catherine Murphy said about not being lobbied, particularly by the vintners.</p><p>If I were in the Vintners Federation of Ireland, I would not lobby the Deputy either.  I would give up.  On the point the Deputy made about small lobbyists and small businesses, the measure does cause inconvenience and difficulties.  There are certainly small off-licences complaining about it also.  There has been pressure exerted in this regard but what we are doing is right as far as I am concerned.  This measure is correct and we have to pay a bit of a price for introducing it.  There will be a cost and perhaps it will cost some people dearly in the context of their livelihoods.  I do not want to do that at all but sometimes one has to pay a price in order to save lives and for the greater good.  That is really what it is about.</p><p> On the morning-after pill, we have asked a lot of questions.</p></speech>

Therefore, one cannot really make a distinction.  Alcohol impairs a driver's judgment and ability to drive.  Drivers feel they are okay but they are not; they are impaired.  The level is too high and they are still impaired by the alcohol in their system.  International evidence shows that alcohol, even at low levels, has an impact on driving ability.  The WHO warns that the risks from alcohol begin at very low levels.  The risk posed by being over the limit is caused by the alcohol and it makes no difference to that risk how long it is since the person consumed the alcohol.  People who drank very heavily the night before must take responsibility for their own behaviour.  If they have any doubts, they should not drive.  It is a cardinal rule that one should not get in the car if one has any doubts at all.  One cannot necessarily self-test so the rule is, "Do not do it."  It is easy enough.</p> <p>  I agree on public attitudes in rural areas.  I have addressed that already.  I refer to the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes polls in rural areas that the RSA quoted.  The results were very powerful and indicated support for this measure, presumably because people in those areas are so conscious that it saves lives.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the very small number of people affected.  It is probably true but I do not like addressing the subject in that way.  While the number is small, it is a very big message.  A very strong message is coming out from here that drinking and driving do not mix in any way.  What we want to do through the disqualification is fight the impression that it is acceptable to drive after one, two or three drinks; it is not.  We want to make people think twice about drinking and driving.</p> <p>  People can quote statistics and say that there are only so many affected.  However, saying "only so many" is just not acceptable.  It may be one life, two lives or three lives.</p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy said that this is the only Bill I have taken through the Oireachtas.  That is wrong.  He mentioned five penalty points.  We have been through that before.  On his point that 93% of convictions are associated with the higher category and 7% with the lower, I am of the view that the 7% matters.  We would not dispute that 93% of those convicted are in the higher category and that 7% are in the lower category.  Those in the 7% category have the potential to cost lives and have done so in the past.  This is the category we are addressing.  We believe the penalty is appropriate.  It is not right to suggest that the proportion is only 7%.  I understand the Deputy's point in respect of  addressing the higher limit further but those exceeding it are being disqualified and taken off the road.  That is an appropriate punishment for them.  There is a good case for punishing them further, and I am happy to discuss that with the Deputy.  To be consistent, it might be more helpful if the Deputy withdrew his opposition to this Bill and accepted the disqualification we are introducing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-21a.1153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018032100002#M00700"><p>I thank the Minister.  I do not minimise the loss of one life at all.  The point I was making is that, based on the figures supplied by the RSA and the Department, the greatest number of fatalities relate to the higher category.  It is currently illegal to exceed 50 mg per 100 ml and that is not going to change.  The point I was making on number of people caught in 2016 and subjected to automatic disqualification is that if automatic disqualification were such a deterrent, there would be more people in the lesser category.  This is not the case, however.  Unfortunately, automatic disqualification is not the great deterrent the Minister believes it to be because the greatest number of offenders have blood alcohol levels in the higher category.  If we were really serious about taking impaired drivers off the road, we would do so through enforcement.  I have said that all along.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's statement that there will be 150 additional garda&iacute; in the traffic corps this year but he should forgive us if we are somewhat sceptical.  He said last year that there would be an additional 10% in 2017 but this did not happen.  According to the figures I obtained through a parliamentary question on 16 January last, the number decreased from 669 to 643 between 2016 and 2017.  Forgive me if I am somewhat sceptical about promises made at committee meetings, particularly as previous promises were not honoured.  Even if the 150 come on board, how many of the existing traffic corps members will retire?  The number decreased from 669 to 643 last year.  Was that through natural wastage owing to retirements?  Will there be a similar reduction before there is an increase this year?  This must be figured out.</p> <p>  The Minister should not suggest that some lobby group has come to me.  I did not meet the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  I refused to meet it.  I am not here as a voice for the vintners at all; what I want to see is proportionality.  Based on that, I was advocating an increase in penalty points for what is already illegal, namely, having a blood alcohol level between 50 mg per 100 ml and 80 mg per 100 ml.  I want to see a stiffer penalty introduced for people in the higher echelon.  There is already automatic disqualification for those in the higher echelon.  It is simply not deterring them.  Perhaps we should be considering greater penalties.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister suggested he is willing to work with me on this.  I will happily work with him.</p></speech>

It does not matter what the penalty is if there is no prospect of being caught.  Part of the problem is that people will take the risk because the prospect of being caught is minimal.  I accept that breath-testing is not confined to the traffic corps.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I have only once ever been randomly breath-tested.  It happened on Victoria Quay in Dublin.  Even the spread of testing appears to be disproportionate.  What will it be like with 600 odd over the whole country?</p> <p>  We have something in theory but it needs to be there practice.  If what we had was even enforced, that would certainly improve matters dramatically.  It is important that we come back to this issue with some reassurances.  I realise that much of it crosses over to the Department of Justice and Equality.  The reality is, however, that the remit in this case is road safety.  We need to be assured that whatever we are doing, we are not doing it in theory but in practice.</p></speech>

While it is important that more Garda are visible, there can be drawbacks.  If a cat is going to pounce on a mouse, will it make itself more visible?  The same goes for the Garda presence in dealing with road traffic offences.    The number of people breaking speed limits, for example, is an issue in the context of all aspects of road traffic legislation.  When Gatso vans first came out, the law stated that a notice was to be put on the road that a speed camera was ahead.  People told me when I was a local authority representative that such signs significantly reduced the number of motorists speeding.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to pressure groups.  When this proposal was first mooted, I was the first out of the blocks to condemn it and to state that it will have an impact on livelihoods and people's mental health.  This just does not impact on rural areas, it also impacts on urban areas.  In most large towns, the local pub is in the town centre and the latter may not be within walking distance for most customers.</p> <p>  The younger generation is aware of the dangers of excessive drink-driving.  If the Minister gets his way with this proposal, we will be killing a dying breed.  The culture is changing and excessive drink-driving will fade away in time.</p> <p>  The Minister made an argument about the effect of drink.  There is a clich&eacute; about having a drop to settle the nerves.  Has the Chairman ever heard it?</p></speech>

That leads to the problem that school traffic wardens cannot be provided to ensure the safety of students.  This issue came up in Belmayne where a child was recently knocked down.  The amendment would address that issue by adding roads which it is intended to take in charge.  That is what I am trying to do.  Amendment No. 5 would allow local authorities to provide school traffic wardens to ensure the safety of children at Luas and other railway line crossings.  The Minister is aware of the situation for the constituents we share in Rathdown.  There is a huge safety issue at Windy Arbour Luas stop which is near Our Lady's of Clonskeagh.  Recently a national school child ran out onto the line.  The local authority cannot provide a school traffic warden there because it is not on its land.  The amendment would address the issue simply by adding to "places where schoolchildren cross public roads" the words "or railways".  It is my intention to move the amendments again on Report Stage.  Is the Minister willing to reconsider them?</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Martin is well able to articulate her own amendments and the rationale for proposing them.  This is the Road Traffic Bill and the Minister can, if he agrees with the sentiments behind any amendment proposed, work with the proposer to bring about an amendment on Report Stage to facilitate the implementation of the principle behind the amendment.  Considering the number of pedestrians who have lost their lives on the roads, my proposal, the sentiments behind which the Minister said he agreed with when we spoke about it before, relates to the need for pedestrians on unlit rural roads to wear reflective gear for their own safety.  It is in their own interests to do so.  Is that something that can be looked at on Report Stage?</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's conversion on the need to bring forward legislation in that regard, which was announced on the morning of the previous meeting.

Obviously, that prompts a question about future legislation.  I have noted that the Road Safety Authority has embarked on a public information campaign on minimum passing distances, which is very welcome and was probably prompted by the debate here.  The voices of cyclists have become much more prominent.  It will not exclusively be about legislation; it will also be about facilities.  There is value in putting the issue in its totality on our agenda, in addition to legislation.  We are very deficient in the infrastructure that makes cycling safe.</p></speech>

The statutory instrument is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and will be brought back, I hope, very shortly, although one can never be certain, but I do not think there are too many complications with it.  It will be, as announced, a distance of 1.5 m for those travelling in excess of 50 km/h and 1 m for those travelling below that speed.  It will not be any more complicated than that.  The reason for it is that cyclists' lives are at stake and they are as important as the lives of others.  We want to send them a clear signal that we want to save their lives.</p><p>We want to send them a clear signal that we want to save their lives.  The number of deaths went up from ten to 15 last year.  That is a really serious increase which we should feel obliged to address, and that is what we are doing.

It is not done by primary legislation.  </p></speech>

It has absolutely nothing to do with me.  I regret that these things have been ruled out of order, apart from the fact that the Bill will obviously go through a little bit more quickly.  A ruling that an amendment is out of order is not something over which I have any jurisdiction.  I deeply regret that the amendments were so ruled, particularly the one on Windy Arbour, because it is a pressing problem.  I intend to work with the people of Windy Arbour to sort out this problem, and have been doing so.  It is a private road, however.  I will continue to strive to sort it out, because it is a really serious difficulty for them.  I will work with Deputy Martin and anybody else on that, but I will do so as a constituency TD.  I cannot address it in this committee or in the House if I am not allowed to by those who make the rules.</p></speech>

Lobbyists approach me from the motor sector.  In principle I have no problem in regard to the requirement of 1.5 m clearance for cyclists.  However, the Minister is bringing it in by statutory instrument, and he will have to accept exceptional circumstances.  I will give a typical example.  On a rural road, a motorist may be approaching a cyclist from behind, unbeknownst to the cyclist.  The cyclist sees a pothole, swerves out, and the motorist hits him.  There are no witnesses.  Straight away, the statutory instrument says that the motorist is wrong, because he did not maintain a clearance of 1.5 m.  How are these issues of road safety going to be addressed by a statutory instrument?  Judges will be against it.</p></speech>

We spoke about this before here, and the Minister was somewhat sympathetic to the principle of the proposal, maybe before his officials spoke to him.  At that point he undertook to look into it.  Perhaps it is something we could look at for Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am perfectly happy to look at this.  I have considered this, and the amendment which Deputy Troy addressed is flawed, like others.  It criminalises children in the first place, and that is not what he intended to do.</p></speech>
