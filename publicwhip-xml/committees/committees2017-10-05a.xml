He is accompanied by Mr. Mark Brady.  </p> <p>  Before we begin, I extend the sympathy of the Committee of Public Accounts to the family of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, who passed away yesterday evening.  May he rest in peace.  With the agreement of the committee, I propose that we adjourn at noon to allow members be in the D&aacute;il Chamber for the expressions of sympathy.  The Business Committee has indicated that all D&aacute;il business will be suspended for the day, other than the expressions of sympathy, but this has not had an impact on committees which are meeting this morning.  The request is that, as a mark of respect, we adjourn at noon in order that members may attend the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  There will be no business conducted after the expressions of sympathy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#B00600"><p>We will be very tight on time.  </p><p>Apologies have been received from Deputies Alan Farrell and Josepha Madigan.  </p><p>Are the minutes of the meeting held on 28 September agreed to?  Agreed.  One item brought to my attention as arising from the minutes is that we received a letter last week about the Higher Education Authority, third level institutions and consultancy fees.  It relates to our ongoing concern about and interest in spending by the various third level institutions.  We have discussed the Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, on a number of occasions.  I have been presented with an article from the <i>Evening Echo</i>which indicates that Cork Institute of Technology recently spent almost &euro;13,000 in marking the retirement of the outgoing president.  This information was provided as part of the freedom of information process.  There was &euro;5,000 spent on catering and &euro;3,000 on providing tables.  There were also pipes and drapes and other elements.  I propose that in view of current difficulties we write to Cork Institute of Technology for a detailed explanation as to why it felt it was appropriate to spend &euro;13,000.  The student hardship fund would have benefited more from the &euro;13,000 rather having than a banquet to celebrate a retiring official.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#B00700"><p>We can agree to it.  It seems similar to the portraits about which we know.  I have been going back through the documentation on Cork Institute of Technology and have a couple of other questions to ask.  I know that we are waiting for the redacted document to be given to us, but it may not.  May I add a couple of questions, all to be sent in one item of correspondence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#B00800"><p>Is that agreed to by the committee?  Agreed.  I will ask the clerk to consult me about the letter to be sent from the committee.  We will include in it the questions to which I referred.  </p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  The first items, Nos. 784A and 785A, are the briefing document and opening statement from IDA Ireland for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish them.  </p> <p>  Item No. 774B is correspondence received from Mr. Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, confirming that third level institutions have been requested to provide details of the engagement of all external consultancy firms and consultants and associated costs, as well as of those appointed to carry out investigations and provide legal advice.  The HEA expects to be in a position to provide the information requested by the committee later this month.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  Item No. 775B is correspondence, dated 26 September, received from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general of the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It includes the independent review of the cost associated with the care of "Grace" and the Deloitte report to which we referred.  Does any member wish to comment on it?  We are scheduled to meet representatives of the HSE on 26 October to discuss section 38 and section 39 organisations.  It might be worth having this matter as part of the discussion and engagement with the HSE on that day.  We will put it on notice that we will raise the specific matter at that meeting.  We will, however, have to be mindful of the work of the commission of investigation established by the Oireachtas.  We need to stick to that exact report.  It could go very far and deep, but we do not want to trespass across the work of the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#B00900"><p>Perhaps that is a sensible suggestion.  The inquiry is none of our business, but we are concerned with the expenditure of money and a specific report.  We do not have many occasions on which to do this, but there is a whistleblower and two people have put their names to a letter sent by them; they deserve a medal for doing so.  They deserve some award as they have taken so much time to go through a report we have difficulty in going through because of time constraints.  They have analysed it and perhaps we might deal with their letter now also.  They have written to the committee.</p></speech>

Will we leave it until next week to comment on it together?  It should all be dealt with together, as they have now sent a letter.  Serious matters have been highlighted.  I will leave it at that and will not take up the committee's time.</p></speech>

I am very happy for the matter to be discussed on 26 October, but we need to leave enough time on that day for a discussion.</p></speech>

I think we will discuss it on that day, perhaps in a specific period.  The section 38 and section 39 organisations have available to them &euro;4 billion of taxpayers' money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has a comment on it in the annual report.</p></speech>

As we will need a full day, people can schedule it at this stage.</p><p>The next item is No. 782B, correspondence dated 3 October in my name.  I forwarded a link to the Garda interim report as I did not think it had been formally sent to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think we all got a copy of it so I have made sure that the committee received one.  We note that.  The Garda will feature on our work programme later on again.  <br/><br/>No. 783B is correspondence dated 3 October 2017 from HIQA providing some of the follow-up information requested last week.  The correspondence includes details of an error in staffing numbers in the business plan, a breakdown on source of concerns raised with HIQA, human resource risks and risk profiling in the organisation.  We will note that and await receipt of the full information.  Also, we will ask the Department of Health questions on that day.  I am sure that we will receive all of the information within the week.  <br/><br/>No. 788B is correspondence dated 4 October 2017.  I shall sigh with exasperation before I deal with this matter.  The correspondence is from the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, on the payment of moneys due to Console staff.  We awaited this item.  The Minister has pointed out that the liquidation is ongoing but, in the event that there is no money to pay staff, he considers it inappropriate to pay the money out of voted expenditure.  I think the committee has made its views very clear on this matter.  I wish to reiterate publicly the opinion that there is an onus on the Department to make an <i>ex gratia</i>payment to these individuals because a significant reason these people were not paid moneys due to them can be attributed to the lack of oversight by the HSE, in the first place, in terms of monitoring the Console organisation.  While we cannot force the Minister to take action, we again appeal to him to reconsider.  I propose that we do not let this matter go.  The Committee of Public Accounts will issue a report in the course of the coming month on various issues.  I think it is an issue that the committee will not stand back from.  I know, technically, there might be a point.  I think there have been other precedents where payments have been made and if there is a will, there is a way.  Can we agree to note his response?  Effectively we are saying we are not satisfied with his response.  We will examine the topic again but there it rests just for today.  <br/><br/>The next item is two documents, Nos. 790(i) B and 790 (ii) B, which have just come from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They are on the screen but I have not had an opportunity to print them.  The documents update the committee on the audit status of the educational and training boards and third level colleges.  The documents can be viewed on the screen now and I suggest that we start at the top.  <br/><br/>Document No. 790(i) B clearly shows that the audits for 2015 have all been cleared until we reach the line that refers to Kildare and Wicklow where audit queries are still outstanding, Limerick and Clare has an audit &quot;in progress&quot; and Louth and Meath has &quot;audit queries outstanding.&quot;  Is that the end of the ETBs? </p></speech>

I will allow people to comment but I think we need to write to the chairmen.  We are asking that the chairmen formally put our letter on the agenda of their next meetings, not just dealt with inhouse but at their ETB meeting, publicly, and at local level.

He referred to the 2015 audit, to the fact that a number of issues were brought to the attention of the Department of Education and Skills, and that the Department sought a response from the ETB on the issues.  He continued:</p><blockquote>Having considered the issues raised by the C&amp;amp;AG and the subsequent correspondence between the Department and the ETB, in exercise of his power under Section 40 of the ETB Act 2013 the Minister for Education and Skills has appointed an investigator to carry out an investigation into the performance by the board of its functions particularly in relation to public procurement, usage and disposal of assets and propriety matters and to submit a final report to the Minister as soon as practical ....<br /><br />Mr Richard Thorn, President Emeritus of Sligo Institute of Technology has been appointed to carry out the investigation.  It is envisaged that the investigation will be completed in Quarter 1 2018.</blockquote> <p>That is the end of the March.  He continued: &quot;The terms of reference for the investigation are enclosed for the information of the Public Accounts Committee.  The Department will keep us updated.&quot;</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General expects that he will be unable to complete his audit until after that report is completed.</p></speech>

The organisation talked about training that had been provided to various board members, etc. across all of the ETBs, and the training modules it has in place.  However, I think it is important that the letters we issue to the three or four ETBs that we have already highlighted insist that our letter be put on their public agenda because it may be possible that some members are not fully aware of everything that is going on.  </p></speech>

Is that okay?</p> <p>  The next item is category C, which is correspondence that relates to private individuals.  No. 769C is correspondence dated 25 September 2017 from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith requesting the committee to consider inviting representatives of the National Transport Authority to a meeting of the committee regarding bus routes following a tendering process.  It appears the contract remains to be awarded.  I propose that we refer the matter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Is that reasonable?  I think that is reasonable.  If that is okay, we will refer it to the transport committee.</p> <p>  No. 770C is correspondence dated 25 September 2017 from an individual requesting the committee follow-up on a matter raised in relation to what has been referred to as a SIPTU-F&Aacute;S slush fund.  Recently we have written to the Garda fraud office for an update on this matter but we have yet to receive a reply.</p><p>The secretariat has followed up on the matter.  I propose that we write to the individual informing him of this and reminding him that it is not within the committee's remit to examine criminal matters.  This is an ongoing issue that the Garda is examining.  It came through us, so we are asking the Garda for an update on whether there has been a prosecution.  However, it is not our job to investigate potential criminal matters.  We will notify the correspondent of this.</p><p> Next is No. 771C, correspondence from an individual regarding a property deal relating to NAMA.  The individual believes that a sweetheart deal was done and wants to know what we can do about it.  The clerk has had other correspondence from the individual.  I propose that we respond to the individual and say that, while we do not investigate individual cases normally, we can seek a response from NAMA to the details if he sends them to us.  He has given us no details of what he is talking about.  He just refers to a sweetheart deal.  Unless we receive specific information, we will take the matter no further and we will tell him that.</p><p> No. 776C, correspondence dated 18 September 2017 from an individual, relates to Dublin City Council's entry into an insurance contract to a value of &euro;5 million more than its previous contract.  The individual questions the value for money of this.  I propose that we write to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for a response regarding Dublin City Council and its procurement process specifically, but also regarding the insurance contract procurement process followed by other local authorities throughout the country.  We all know of claims against local authorities.  Many have been paying these claims themselves while others have had some insurance cover.  Dublin City Council seems to have entered into a contract, the value for money of which someone has queried.  We need to get a picture of this topic across all local authorities from the Department.  We will write to it.</p></speech>

The secretariat informs me that we last dealt with this item on 7 July 2016 and, following correspondence from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding an ongoing case, it was decided not to pursue the matter.

It is not our practice to have the Minister attend, but it should be considered in light of the level of importance attaching.  There is an omission.  On further consideration, the assistant commissioner for Dublin, Mr. Pat Leahy, could usefully contribute to this discussion.  One meeting would do it, but, if possible, we will need the Minister as well.  That would be my preference.  One meeting with Mr. Noel Waters, Mr. John Barrett and Mr. Pat Leahy would do it.  Perhaps it could be a morning session.  We would get the opportunity to put these issues on record.</p> <p>  I am conscious that some of our colleagues are not present and that people might view pursuing this as being political.  However, there are tangible reasons for this to be of concern - value for money in the first instance.  Political considerations come second.  Previously, Deputy Cassells gave clear examples in the context of Meath.  I cited an example relating to Sligo whereby a Garda station that had been condemned was awaiting this process.  We received the interim report and there were media leaks over the weekend.  The committee was told approximately five times in a row that the criteria for opening and closing were exactly the same, but we have reason to believe that is not the case and there is a suggestion that the decision was based on population increases.  To follow on from Deputy Cassells's contribution at our previous meeting, County Meath has had precisely the same percentage increase that Dublin has had, namely, 5.9%.  It has suffered closures and downgrades to brass buttons and the Deputy cited an increase in crime levels there, yet these other Garda stations were opened.</p> <p>  A decent morning session of three hours - with the Minister present if possible, but certainly Mr. Waters, Mr. Barrett and Mr. Leahy - would be useful.</p></speech>

We need to do this quickly and put it to bed.  I have read the report from cover to cover, and it asks more questions than it gives answers based on the evidence that was provided last week.  Value for money and appropriate spending are major issues.  What was cited at the committee's meeting last week does not come across in the report that was released.  Some people would like to believe that the report put the matter to bed, but it did not.  The criteria that were outlined to us and those that were used, and the fact that the Department of Justice and Equality set the criteria, which is unacceptable, do not add up.</p> <p>  As to how certain stations were picked, there is the problem of the report referring to crime levels actually decreasing in an area where a station is to be opened but where the population is increasing.  If that is the case, then there are many Garda stations in areas where populations are increasing that will be opened.  Many others will have arguments for same.</p> <p>  I subscribe 100% to this request.  We can handle this in a morning or afternoon session, whichever the committee decides, but we cannot do it without the attendance of the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  He has many questions to answer and a considerable role to play.  Previously, we requested that the human resources director, Mr. Barrett, attend because he would have had a critical role, particularly in view of the fact that a decision to open a Garda station cannot be made in the absence of resources.  They are a key component.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute; and civilians must be assigned and the station must be ramped up.  Three individuals are intrinsic to this issue.

I was away last week so I missed last week's exchanges, but it was more of the same: witnesses came in and gave their views, members asked questions and the witnesses were away on their toes.  Now we are looking for them to come back again, not, I hope, in order that we have the same exchange and the same one-day outing again, after which we are none the wiser.  When we say we want to put the matter to bed, what do we mean?  I see it this way - the central question being put was whether the reopening of one Garda station was a stroke.  That is the question people were asking.  Let us cut to the chase - that is it, or was the reopening based on evidence, proper process, proper procedures and so on.</p> <p>  We have a report and we should examine it.  The job of this committee is to come down one way or another on the practice, process and procedures followed.  This goes back to what I have been saying about all the work we do.  Again, people are coming before the committee for the sake of it.  We have our say, they have theirs, they are away and we and the public are none the wiser.  Either this was done right or it was not.  I believe the committee must look at the report and hear from the witnesses.  It does not have to be a big report; it can be a one or two page view of what we believe happened or did not happen.  However, there must be some conclusion, in my view.  Otherwise, what are we doing?  I would, therefore, put that caveat on people coming back in.  There is a logic to it.  I speak in an unbiased way because I do not know what the answer is, and it may well be that proper process and proper procedures were followed or that may not be the case.  Let us examine the matter and then let us adjudicate on it based on what we are here to do, which is to examine the practices, processes and procedures around the decision-making that led to the reopening of this Garda station.</p></speech>

We must be careful not to stray into the area in which the justice committee most properly would have an involvement.  There are costs in picking particular stations out for refurbishment.  I heard something on the radio about Rush, where a community group has put &euro;20,000 into the refurbishment of a former Garda station because it is using it as a community facility.  There are issues regarding the refurbishment costs and there are other costs.  There are also sometimes incomes from these stations in respect of the masts, on which I have asked a question to which I hope to have an answer this week.  I asked N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan when she was before the committee about the deployment of resources.  For years, I have been running up and down to meet Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners because the census of population has not been used in the determination of the deployment of Garda resources.  In fact, the lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to population is-----</p></speech>

They are all areas that have had high growth and are now playing catch-up.  This is the first time I have seen the census of population used for this purpose.  I warmly welcome the idea that we are taking a strategic approach if this is the new approach to the deployment of resources, but it has not happened before.  We also must understand what is the role of the Policing Authority, not to be crossing lines, because my understanding is that it has a role in the distribution of resources and I do not know whether it has been bypassed in respect of this initiative.  We need to separate the lines of our responsibility and value for money.  The refurbishment is one thing, but why are some stations picked out over others?  The area we need to consider is whether there is a value for money aspect to this.  The one thing we do not want to do is give the impression that we have a remit beyond the remit we do have.</p></speech>

It is all set out on her record.  I think we are clear as to what is our remit.  It is public money and decisions to allocate, spend and discharge public moneys and the associated processes and procedures around that.  We are not proposing to stray beyond that, and we need to bring people back before the committee.</p> <p>  I broadly agree with the proposals to bring back those individuals who have been cited but, as my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, said, there must then be some outcome as a result.  I have read the report and I will go back and read it again to try to ascertain what kind of systematic application of criteria, if any, was in place and to get under the bonnet of that issue.  The reason that is important, including for this committee, is not simply in respect of this particular case study of decision-making, but also lessons that might be learned or advice that might be given regarding how work within the system happens generally.  There is a concept used in the North called targeting objective need, and to those right-minded among us it sounds sensible that one would target resources where they are needed.  It has not always been straightforward in Northern politics for many different reasons, but we have battled to get that concept embedded in decision-making processes.  As I was reading the report, I wondered to myself the extent to which this was about targeting objective need, or indeed the use of census data and so on, so I agree with Deputies Kelly, MacSharry and others that we need another session on this issue.  However, I would like it to be a conclusive session shaped in that way around the use of resources and decisions.  We should bear in mind that we are not just about counting up the pounds, shillings and pence; we also have a very specific duty and remit in respect of processes and procedures.</p> <p>  By the way, I had asked about the criteria used in the closure of stations and their provenance.  I do not think we have had a response to that, although the acting Garda Commissioner said he would get back to us on it.  I am broadly in agreement with the caveat that Deputy Cullinane has entered.</p></speech>

On the previous occasion I asked for the Department of Justice and Equality, as the most important Department in the context of this issue, to come before the committee so I have no difficulty with it doing so whatsoever.  However, I believe we must be clear what is our remit.  It has been said, and I will not repeat it, that we should not stray into the remit of the justice committee, which I think we are in danger of doing.  Our workload is heavy, so I suggest an afternoon session that does not interfere with the extremely important workload we have laid down.  I agree with the Deputy who outlined the practice, process and procedures.  That is our role.</p></speech>

That depends largely on witnesses being willing participants in answering questions.  We have seen this to be an issue with Project Eagle and Templemore, when we thought we were arriving at conclusiveness and that our meeting would put the matter to bed, only for the process to have to go on and on.  A large part of it depends on the people coming before us and their not being smart or stonewalling us.  I agree with Deputy Connolly about the Department of Justice and Equality.  Its role in the Templemore issue is most pertinent in terms of this particular issue as well.  I do not think anyone is straying beyond his or her remit whatsoever because, as we proved the previous day, in terms of what people have said about value for money and impact on communities, this goes to the very heart of what we are talking about.</p></speech>

Everyone else spoke so I suppose I should say a few words. I do not know if there is any use in having any more witnesses in here because I think we have gone nearly as far as we will go.  As the previous speaker said, if we bring in further witnesses, will they stall and will they just give us the same rhetoric and the same answers?  We all know what happened in Stepaside - everyone knows.  The birds on the wire know the decision was politically motivated.  Are we wasting our time here?  The Chairman has put up a strong work programme between now and Christmas and we have a lot of work to get through.  Are we going to waste time here bringing in witnesses and getting them to repeat what they have said?  We are going to get the same answers and go nowhere.</p></speech>

Our job is to evaluate, probe, ask questions, ensure fair procedure and so on.  My point was that I want to have something that does all of that.  We do it and then we have the conclusion, which is the views of members as a committee.</p></speech>

Many different angles have been covered and there has been a broad-ranging debate.  The committee must be clear and logical and ensure we get to a conclusion if we are revisiting this.  I propose that we agree what members have accepted but I want a detailed and specific proposal to be prepared this week by the secretariat for the committee to sign off on next week as to precisely what our agenda will be.  We will set the date for that meeting next Thursday.  I agree about the importance of logic.  At the risk of incurring the wrath of some members, there have been a few major gaps in the logic of what has been said.  The assistant commissioner, John O'Driscoll, wrote the report.  If anyone is to come before the committee, it should be him.  I am amazed that members have suggested people from further down the ranks should come in and discuss a report they may have had no involvement in writing.  One person wrote the report.  I find it inconceivable that he would not be the person invited to appear before the committee.  His name has not been mentioned by members so far, so there is a lack of clear thinking in what has been said this morning.  We will come back to it next Thursday with clearer thinking.</p> <p>  It was said that the decision to allocate money is not the function of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is a function of the line committee in respect of the Estimate in the Department.  Any cost to be incurred regarding Stepaside Garda station, staff moving there and so on will be incurred in 2018.  That is a matter for the Committee on Justice and Equality to consider and approve as part of its discussion of Estimates for 2018.  It is not the job of this committee to cut across an Estimates debate in another committee with regard to expenditure next year.  We do not have a role in approving Estimates of expenditure that might be spent in an area next week.  We must be clear on that.  We want to see the logic and process of how decisions that have been taken were implemented.  I make those points to ensure the committee is within its remit.  Future expenditure is not our job; that is politics and an issue for the Government, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or the Committee on Justice and Equality.  There has been a major gap in the process of how the Committee of Public Accounts has been acting on this issue recently, given there was a debate on this matter without anyone mentioning the author of the report.  I propose that we start with the person who wrote the report.  We are agreed that we are going to do it and will need a conclusion but I will ask the secretariat to put an exact paper before the committee next week that we can sign off on and know precisely what will happen.</p> <p>  I have been most disappointed recently by the Department of Justice and Equality because when the acting Garda Commissioner was here in July, he committed to issue the report in good faith.  When the Garda checked with the Department shortly thereafter, the Department blocked the issuing of the report.  The Taoiseach was asked about that last Thursday or Friday after our meeting.  He had no problem with the interim report being issued and that was done by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, last Saturday  Had the Department not interfered with the commitment given by the acting Garda Commissioner, the committee would have had the report in July and last week's controversy that the Department brought on itself, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Committee of Public Accounts and the political establishment would not have occurred.  The Department of Justice and Equality caused the problem from beginning to end.  From the day the acting Garda Commissioner appeared before the committee to the publication of the report it was the Department and the Department alone that stalled the issue and caused the problem.  Consequently, it must be asked why it sought to block a public commitment by a very senior Garda officer.  Members understand that we are going to do that and we will not discuss it any further.</p> <p>  We want a specific detailed paper so that we have an agenda, as members said, and will be able to start, show the logic of what we are doing and draft a report at the end of the process.  We want to be able to sign off it.  We will have that on our work programme next week.  We will sign off next Thursday on who is to be invited to appear because------</p></speech>

Deputy Cullinane is aware of this or sent it to the committee.  It deals with a person's engagement with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding the carer's allowance.  The person is an employee of the Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser advises that it is not appropriate for the committee to examine the details of individual cases such as this.  In this case, it would be more appropriate for the individual to make use of the services of the Office of the Ombudsman.  We recognise the general issues raised in regard to the social welfare appeal system.  It is an independent office but we will put the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on notice that while we will be inviting it in to address the many chapters about social protection in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we will also be separately inviting in the Social Welfare Appeals Office to consider that issue.</p></speech>

We should not concentrate on people's personal or singular issues but this individual has used his experience to highlight what he says are systemic problems that could have an impact on others.  I am not sure whether that is an issue for the committee or the sectoral committee.  What is it proposed that the committee do?  The Chairman has said the person could avail of the Office of the Ombudsman and that can be communicated to him in writing.  What else is it proposed the committee do?</p></speech>

We will also bring in the Social Welfare Appeals Office in its own right.</p> <p>  Statements and accounts since the last meeting have been put up on the screen.  There is a clear audit opinion for the Marine Institute, the National Transport Authority, Pobal and the Residential Institutions Redress Board.   We will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come in on the Appropriation Accounts, comprising 850 pages, and the 340-page Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2016.  I ask him for a brief comment on those accounts.</p></speech>

The next item is a clear audit opinion for Beaumont Hospital but attention is again drawn to expenditure totalling &euro;1.3 million involving goods and services that were not procured by way of competitive process.  There is a clear audit opinion in respect of Teagasc but with non-competitive procurement of services to the value of 725,000.  I suggest we write to both organisations asking for a detailed explanation in reply.  There is a clear audit opinion for Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The Comptroller and Auditor General wishes to comment on the appropriation accounts and report on the accounts of the public service he published last Friday.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#FFF01800"><p>There are 41 accounts included in the Appropriation Accounts so the list is significantly longer than is suggested there.  One matter to which I draw attention in my report is an excess Vote in regard to Army pensions.  It is a relatively technical matter.  The D&aacute;il voted a certain level of expenditure and the Department exceeded it by a small amount in the region of &euro;23,000 to &euro;26,000.  A specific procedure called the excess Vote procedure is required in such a situation, whereby the committee considers the circumstances of the excess Vote and sends a message to the Oireachtas and the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister proposes that an excess Vote be taken, it legitimises that additional expenditure.</p><p>The circumstances were that the audit discovered payments in the year that had been charged to suspense and not the Appropriation Account.  When they are taken into account, the expenditure was over what was permitted.  It is a relatively technical point.  To my mind, there is no significant matter but a process has to be gone through.  I propose to work with the clerk to have a paper for the committee next week with a view to putting that process in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#G00200"><p>It is a technical adjustment.  It was not captured in the Supplementary Estimate of December of that year and when the audit later came up there was an issue with procedures requiring Oireachtas approval retrospectively.  It happened to be small amount though it could have been bigger.  It is a technical adjustment so I ask Mr. McCarthy to prepare a note in advance of the committee meeting next Thursday.  We will write to the Accounting Officer for his views on the matter.  We have two documents here for next week and we can formally note them and refer them to the Minister for Finance and the D&aacute;il to give technical approval.  It is a technical matter but it is the first time we have heard of it.  We learn something new every day.</p></speech>

It is on the screen in front of members.  Next Thursday, we will have a paper on how to handle Stepaside Garda station and we will incorporate it into our work programme next week.  I will go through the logic.  Today, we have IDA Ireland financial statements.  We decided at the commencement of the meeting that that meeting will adjourn at 12 o'clock as a mark of respect for the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, because the D&aacute;il is doing no business other than statements today.  Committees that are already meeting have been asked to allow members to attend the D&aacute;il Chamber for that.  We agreed that we will suspend in two hours' time for those who want to attend.  I will be very tight on people's time for these two hours.</p> <p>  Transport Infrastructure Ireland is due to attend next week, as is Tusla.  The HSE is due to address section 38 and section 39 bodies.  That is going to take a full day because we will also include the Deloitte report on the south east case.</p> <p>  The Appropriation Account for the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment is to be addressed.  That Department has not had representatives here in quite a while.</p> <p>  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about bank stabilisation.  Part of that is the cost of the bank restructuring.  We can also deal with the IBRC situation which Deputy MacSharry mentioned earlier.  They dovetail with each other so I suggest that we need to allocate the full day of 16 November.  It might take more than one meeting but we need to start addressing the costs with regard to the entire bank stabilisation issue.  I know the issue of the tax-free holiday will come up for the next approximately 20 years as part of that process.  We need to bring in the Department of Finance for that.  We might agree who, specifically, is to come later and we will have to check that they are available.</p> <p>  I propose to, early on 23 November, address the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on corporation tax receipts.  There is a very strong comment about corporation tax receipts, the effective rate and some companies paying an effective rate of 1%.  The issue of taxation, the collection of taxes and the voting of expenditure are equally under our remit.  The issue of tax paid by corporations in Ireland is very much under our remit.</p> <p>  I propose that on 30 November, social welfare and the management of social welfare overpayments, the Department review of social welfare schemes and the appeals process should be addressed.  There is a big chapter about social protection payments and people will want to talk about it.</p> <p>  I propose that on Thursday, 7 December, we address chapter 12, management of ancillary services in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will come back to that and we might write to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today because when we did our interim report before the summer, our first module, we said that we would return to that issue.  We knew that other audit reports were being conducted.  We should ask for the up-to-date status and if some are available to send on to us but I did not want to let the period go without returning to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is definitely a chapter connected with Templemore.  We want to see where we are with that.</p> <p>  That is a suggestion for the coming week.  We will deal with Stepaside next week.  I call Deputy Kelly.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General's report came out last Friday.  It has 24 chapters.  The basic function of the Committee of Public Accounts is to review those.  We have to go over them.  Some will be combined; three chapters relate to social welfare.  Our basic work, despite everything else on our agenda, is the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which will encompass the next eight weeks and we will talk about the rest later.</p></speech>

I know there are many competing items and that we need to get through the work as set out and structured by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Other members have raised this and I think we are missing something.  I do not have a concrete proposal to make except to ask if we might look again and see where we might accommodate a meeting about the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

I ask this because there are proposals by the organisations to change the procedural governance of the system they have in place.  It is mostly on a county basis or an individual basis currently and now they are talking about having eight regional bases.  There is much annoyance by people, particularly volunteers, involved in MABS and Citizens Information.  I have been approached by several people.  Do we or the Comptroller and Auditor General have any remit or could we bring them before us to find out what proposals they are bringing forward?</p></speech>

The primary role of IDA Ireland is to attract foreign direct investment to Ireland.  It does this by promoting Ireland as an attractive location to potential investors through the payment of grant aid and through the development of industrial property which is readily available for use by potential investors.  The IDA received State grants of around &euro;155 million in 2016, representing 92% of the agency's total income for the year.  Its other income streams amounted to &euro;14 million and included profits on the disposal of assets, grant refunds and rental income.</p> <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2016 amounted to &euro;160 million, including &euro;95.6 million in grants to enterprises in support of research and development activity, capital investment, employment and training; &euro;42 million spent on pay, pensions and administration; &euro;12.5 million on expenses related to the property portfolio and depreciation charges; and &euro;10 million on promotion activities.  In addition to its recurrent expenditure, the IDA expended &euro;15.4 million on property additions, including land purchases, site development and construction work on its property holdings.  At the end of 2016, the IDA&rsquo;s property portfolio had a net book value of approximately &euro;152 million.</p> <p>  The IDA revalues property based on reviews carried out internally or by independent valuers, as appropriate, where there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Following the 2016 review, the IDA reversed part of the impairment charges on its property portfolio which had been recognised over the period 2008 to 2013.  The impairment charges reflected the effects of the downturn in the property market over that period and the reversal of the impairment charges, valued at &euro;36 million, reflects a general uplift in property values. </p> <p>  The financial statement for 2016 received an unqualified opinion.</p></speech>

I now call Mr. Shanahan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#J00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present this morning.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am accompanied by Ms Mary Buckley, Ms Eileen Sharpe and Ms Regina Gannon.  The focus this morning is the financial statement for 2016.  I have submitted a detailed statement but do not plan to go through it in its entirety.  Instead, I will pick out some of the highlights.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already outlined the functions of IDA.  To focus on 2016, IDA client companies created just under 19,000 jobs on the ground during the year across a range of sectors, with every region of Ireland posting net gains in jobs.  When job losses were taken into account the net increase in employment was just under 12,000.  The strong net job creation performance is a result of a very strong pipeline of new investments and lower job losses within the employment portfolio.  Losses as a percentage of the overall employment portfolio were at their lowest level in 19 years and IDA Ireland has endeavoured to minimise the impact of job losses through its client transformation programmes.</p> <p>  The number of investments secured during 2016 rose to 244 from 213 in the previous year.  The number of new name investments increased to 99 from 94 in the previous year.  There were 199,877 people employed in IDA supported companies at the end of 2016, the highest level in the history of the State.  In addition to direct employment, IDA estimates that an additional 170,000 jobs are supported indirectly by IDA client companies, representing a significantly wider economic impact.  This trades through to the overall drop in unemployment that we have witnessed, from a high of 15.2% to 6.1%, according to the latest figures published by the CSO on Tuesday.</p> <p>  The detailed briefing document makes reference to some significant investments in 2016.  Included among these are investments by Oracle, Credit Suisse, HubSpot, Amazon and Paypal.  There were also significant regional announcements during 2016.  Most important in that regard is the areas involved which included Dunboyne, Nenagh, Drogheda, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Clonee, Waterford and Tullamore, demonstrating a wide dispersal of investments.  This performance was produced against a backdrop of unprecedented geopolitical change, an underperforming European economy and intense competition from other jurisdictions for foreign direct investment, FDI.  Many of the projects won in 2016 were capital intensive.</p> <p>  FDI has a huge impact on the economy, as evidenced by the exports from Ireland, which totalled &euro;149 billion in 2015, the latest year for which data is available.  Expenditure by FDI companies in the Irish economy totalled &euro;18.8 billion, comprising &euro;10 billion on payroll, &euro;5.2 billion on Irish services and &euro;3.6 billion on Irish materials.  Significant research and development is also undertaken by these companies, the value of which totalled &euro;1.53 billion in the last year for which figures are available.  80% of corporation tax comes from FDI multinationals and 10% of direct employment in Ireland is now accounted for by multinationals.</p> <p>  IDA has a very ambitious strategy which was set out in 2015.  The target is very clear: 80,000 new jobs to be created in the economy over the period 2015 to 2019 and 900 new investments.  If delivered, this will bring total direct employment by FDI companies in Ireland to 209,000 people by 2019.  Last year, 2016, marked the second year of the implementation of the current strategy and cumulatively, over the first two years, the agency is well ahead of the targets in the strategy.  A key element of the strategy is a focus on increasing investment into regional locations.  We have set a target to increase investments in all regions outside of Dublin by 30% to 40% while also maintaining the high level of investment into Dublin.  This target is extremely challenging given the global trend towards FDI favouring large urban centres.  Regions which do not possess urban centres of scale pose a significant challenge in terms of attracting FDI.</p><p>Despite this, IDA Ireland is making steady progress in all regions.  However, it is important to note that investors ultimately make the decision on investment location.  Each region in Ireland posted jobs growth in 2016.  A total of 52% of all jobs created by IDA Ireland clients were based outside Dublin while 59% of all employment in IDA Ireland-supported companies is outside Dublin.  We continue to work with all regions on their offering through the development and implementation of regional action plans.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned, we have a property programme where we invest in turnkey property solutions to shorten the time it takes investors to set up.</p><p> A critical element of our strategy is continued strong focus on key sectors such as technology life sciences, pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical technologies, international financial services, media and content, engineering, business services, and food.  We will continue to target these sectors.  I have set out in my submission some of the changes that are happening in these sectors.  I do not plan to go through them now but I am happy to return to them later.</p><p> Ireland's value proposition is based on offering investors a safe and stable investment location with access to the EU market, an education and skilled workforce, an attractive environment where people want to live and work, a competitive, consistent and transparent corporate tax regime and an excellent return on investment.  This value proposition remains valid, but we have to re-emphasise different parts of it and work to improve others to remain relevant in the changing global environment.  There are always areas that need attention, including the current pressing issue of residential property supply.  The effective and speedy implementation of the Government's action plan for housing is extremely important from our perspective.  We have also highlighted some of the areas that the National Competitiveness Council has identified as requiring attention to safeguard Ireland's competitiveness.</p></speech>

Not a day goes by without the House discussing Brexit so we will park that.  The reason I am butting in is that because of the statements in the House at 12 noon, our timetable is truncated.  Mr. Shanahan was going to refer to Brexit, source markets, the organisation's performance in 2017 and its 2016 annual accounts.  We will publish the full statement but we will move ahead with questions in the context of our tight timetable from members who have indicated in the following sequence: Deputy Shane Cassells with 15 minutes and ten minutes each for Deputies Peter Burke, MacSharry, Connolly, Cullinane, Kelly and Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to him for the fact that IDA Ireland has appeared before the committee with a clear set of accounts.  More important, however, is the work of IDA Ireland in securing investment and jobs for the State, particularly in the teeth of the recession.  The organisation's work, when it demonstrated resilience during those tough times, was one of the contributing factors in pulling the country through.  I am conscious that witnesses coming before the committee are often not subjected to an extreme grilling without recourse to the positives of the work they do.  It is only right and proper to acknowledge IDA Ireland's work and to pay tribute to Mr. Shanahan in promoting Ireland across the globe to secure investment and to bring much needed global entities to these shores.  Well done.  That is the niceties out of the way.</p></speech>

That is good to see in the context of expanding what is already here.  One story dominating the headlines, aside from the passing of our former Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, is the decision of Commissioner Vestager to slap down the Government and the potential for this to become a bad apple in respect of IDA Ireland's efforts in the future.  Mr. Shanahan stated one of the key tenets of Ireland's value proposition is a consistent, transparent tax regime.  The decision by the Commission to initiate court proceedings against Ireland has sent shockwaves through government circles.  Relations will deteriorate between the Government and EU officials.  How do the chief executive officers internationally whom Mr. Shanahan deals with and the potential clients the organisation is working with who may feel threatened view this?  Are future deals threatened by what has transpired?  We can talk about our educated workforce, our position within the EU and the fact that we are an English-speaking nation, but, at the end of the day, as Mr. Shanahan has reflected on himself, tax is a major component of the offer on the table.  There are serious concerns at senior Government level that the Commission decision will be followed by a renewed focus on our corporation tax rate.  What are his concise opinions on that over the past 24 hours?</p></speech>

One statement in my opening address that I did not get to, which I would like to mention, is that it is the team of 320 people who work with me across the globe that deliver those results.</p> <p>  As members will have heard from Government spokespeople and the Minister for Finance yesterday, the Government believes it is an unnecessary step.  I am aware of the effort that has gone into recouping the &euro;13 billion from Apple and the work that has gone in from both sides to setting up the framework to allow that to happen.  I do not believe that anybody has been negligent and I believe that it is an unnecessary step by the Commission.  I also reiterate that the Commission's initial findings were unwarranted and unfounded and its own decision in this regard was internally contradictory.  This will be seen as more of the same.  It is the same issue rather than a new issue and, therefore, I do not believe that there will be a great level of renewed attention on this.  Our current and prospective investors are well aware of the Apple tax issue and they will see this as a playing out of this issue and the Commission's previous findings.</p> <p>  With regard to how that has impacted on investment, the results speak for themselves.  Investment has increased and we have seen no diminution in investment since the Commission announced its initial decision in respect of Apple and Ireland.  In the first half of this year, job approvals increased by 20% year on year and we have experienced the same high level of investment.  There is nothing to signal that this is causing an impact.</p> <p>  In my discussions with chief executive officers and senior leadership teams of companies, they are well aware of Ireland's position on this issue.  If anything, they believe what I said in my opening contribution, which is that we have a consistent, stable and transparent tax regime, and Ireland will continue to have that.</p></speech>

As John Downing said in his column today, the amount involved is not one someone can ring Mick down the bank about.  How will this play out?</p></speech>

That is why the Commission's infringement procedures are so puzzling.  This is an unusual amount, much higher than in any previous decision the Commission has made and, therefore, one might have thought the Commission would have understood that it would take time to set up the appropriate framework to recoup this money.</p><p>That is the first important thing.  It is difficult to see how the overall case will work out.  It is now to be considered by the General Court of the European Union and we will have to await the outcome.  I am not going to pre-empt that.  In respect of the infringement proceedings, I understand it is a two-stage process.  We are making significant progress in setting up the appropriate framework.  I suspect events may overtake us.</p></speech>

Before the summer, IDA Ireland came under attack for its failure to renew ConnectIreland's contract to run a scheme of which the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said he was a big fan.  My party's enterprise spokesperson, Deputy Niall Collins, called Mr. Shanahan out on IDA Ireland's treatment of ConnectIreland, calling it reprehensible.  Is it the case that IDA Ireland felt threatened by ConnectIreland and its success?  Should it not be bigger than that?  From IDA Ireland's perspective, what number of jobs were deemed to have been created by ConnectIreland during that period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#L00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  At the outset, I refute the comments which he has attributed to Deputy Collins in respect of our behaviour having been reprehensible.  It has been in no way reprehensible.  A legal dispute exists between ConnectIreland and IDA Ireland.  ConnectIreland lodged a dispute notice with IDA Ireland in August 2016.  I will not comment on any aspect of that dispute or on any individual companies because it is a legal dispute.  However, I am happy to provide factual information.  The Deputy asked some factual questions.  I am happy to provide context.</p> <p>  The first thing to make clear, and to be fair to the Deputy he did so in his question, is that this is a programme operated by IDA Ireland for which ConnectIreland has the contract.  It is contracted to ConnectIreland to deliver.  Succeed in Ireland is an IDA Ireland programme.  We have a vested interest in ensuring that it works.  Our intent was to make it work.  The situation is that ConnectIreland received a commercial contract in March 2012.  It signed up to that contract and to some addenda.  The contract expired on 26 March this year.  IDA Ireland had extended the contract by one year to allow for an orderly wind-down.  The target of the Succeed in Ireland programme over the period was 5,000 jobs.  As of today, there are 544 jobs on the ground.  By way of information, 302 of those jobs are in Dublin and a further 30 are in Cork.  That means 61% of the jobs are based in Dublin and Cork.  The remaining 212 are spread across a small number of counties.  We have paid ConnectIreland more than &euro;2 million in respect of those jobs - &euro;2,270,000 to be precise.  Under the contract, IDA Ireland has also paid a termination fee to ConnectIreland in respect of 398 jobs which have yet to be created.  That termination payment was &euro;1,539,500.  If all of those 398 jobs are created, it will be great.  If more than 398 are created, we will pay ConnectIreland further.  If they are not delivered, we will recoup the moneys which we have paid to ConnectIreland.  The contract provides for all of this.</p> <p>  IDA Ireland has, at all times, behaved professionally in respect of the operation of this contract.  We have operated to both the spirit and the letter of the contract which we had in place, as we do in all our commercial dealings.  I remind the committee that IDA Ireland operates a huge number of contracts and partnerships across the public and private sectors to deliver jobs.</p></speech>

In his opening remarks and the reports which he has submitted to the committee, Mr. Shanahan put a lot of emphasis on the regional aspect.  It is an old chestnut for many public representatives and statutory bodies throughout the country.  Some statistics were included in the response to a parliamentary question which my party tabled some weeks ago which showed that of the 323 IDA Ireland site visits thus far this year, 155 or 48% took place in the capital.  Five counties, some of which still have excessively and stubbornly high rates of unemployment, received just one IDA Ireland visit so far this year.  Two counties, one of them my own county of Meath, received none.  In the sections of IDA Ireland's document, Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019, which are specifically about the regions, it talks about the existence of clusters and critical masses of population and it sets out criteria in this regard.  The big thing for major centres and provincial towns is actually to create these clusters in the first instance.  If a commuter county on the edge of Dublin such as Meath is unable to achieve that, what hope is there for other counties?</p> <p>  When I look at the statistics and go through the list of counties which have only received one visit, I see Donegal, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon.  The report mentions the wins which were achieved in 2016.  It references Shire and Facebook. Is that the kind of thing we are looking at for the regions?  Mr. Shanahan knows exactly where those locations are.  They are right on the Border.  They are not beside the clusters of population the development plans set out to create.  Are back office facilities such as those being provided for Facebook all we can expect in the regions and the wider geographical area?</p></speech>

We have set out our stall.  For the first time in any IDA Ireland strategy, we have regional targets, including to increase investment by 30% to 40%.  As the Deputy pointed out, two of the most significant investments last year, Facebook and Shire, were made in Meath.  Of course proximity to Dublin helps in that regard.  Site visits tells a part of the story, but they do not tell the whole story.  There could be one site visit to Meath, but it could be the right site visit.  We had a situation last year where one county received one site visit but got three investments.  It is part of the story.  It tells us that investors are interested in larger urban areas.  That is the reality that I and my team face.</p></speech>

Everything thereafter is below that threshold.  The analysis we have looked at suggests that issues arise where there are not urban populations of at least 10,000 people.  We are putting this in an international context.  We are competing for investment with cities like Shanghai, which has a population of 23 million, and Beijing, which has a population of 19 million.  There are 35 urban areas in Europe in which more than one million people live.  There are fifty in the US.  That is the reality of the situation.  Our strategy is to try to build clusters in the urban areas we already have.  Having a population is not sufficient.  An existing base, a supply of skills and third level educational institutions are all necessary.  These areas need to show that they are a nice place to live and work in order that they can attract investors.</p></speech>

In respect of what Mr. Shanahan has said, I have had several meetings with the director of economic affairs in my own county.  No one outside of this country knows the name of any area other than Dublin.  Mr. Shanahan's aim is to get investors into the country, but equally the focus of the pitch must be to get them to invest elsewhere in the country.  If they do not know of anywhere other than Dublin then the pitch must try to tell them about the regions.</p><p>If Mr. Shanahan is telling me this is the level of competition IDA Ireland is up against, then how in God's name are we going to achieve the regional spread that IDA Ireland aims to deliver?</p></speech>

It would make my life a great deal easier if I could achieve a regional spread, but I do not have a magic wand.  Our ambition every day of the week is to do that.  We have strengthened our regional teams.  Since I arrived in IDA Ireland we have appointed regional managers for every region.  We are working with the local authorities.  We are working in the context of the regional Action Plan for Jobs, which is about helping to develop the regions and the offerings there as well as identifying the clusters we can go after.  As a result, when my team and I are abroad we have a narrative around each of the regions and we have something to sell.</p></speech>

Last weekend, <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>reported that Uber, the hailing app company, received &euro;2 million from IDA Ireland in February this year in respect of its operations in Limerick.  Obviously, this has implications.  It has been reported that IDA Ireland is looking to meet the company to discuss the matter.  Will Mr. Shanahan elaborate on that?  That has come on top of the fact that the National Transport Authority has slapped down the company, as has the Minister, with regard to the piloting scheme in Limerick city.</p></speech>

The National Transport Authority makes decisions based on the information at hand and its rules, guidelines and policy views.  From my perspective, Uber is part of a new wave of sharing economy.

I acknowledge the extraordinary work that team IDA has undertaken in recent years, especially during a difficult time for our country and people.</p> <p>  I want to ask some questions on the accounts relating to rental income.  There seems to be a decline from &euro;1.6 million in 2014 to &euro;753,000.  Given that IDA Ireland is reversing impairments in its accounts, its property is getting more valuable and it is benefitting from the uplift in the marketplace, why is rental income collapsing at such a rate?</p></speech>

Our ambition always is to move our property on.  Our property is dynamic.  While the amount may not alter significantly from year to year in terms of our holdings, the property portfolio is dynamic.  We do not want to hold property; we want to move it on.  We want to either rent it or sell it.  The direct answer to Deputy Burke's question is that the figure is as a result of disposals.  It means that we have disposed of property within our portfolio.  Obviously, we renew the portfolio.  We buy or build new properties to move on again.</p></speech>

The Uber issue was touched on.  I understand the company is valued at &euro;70 billion.  Let us get away from that point.  Can Mr. Shanahan summarise the process in clear terms in respect of how interventions are made by IDA Ireland, including financial support, to companies that come into the country?  What conditions and policy does IDA Ireland have to get grant repayments back?  Obviously, we are looking at the uplift in the economy again.  We are seeing that the amount of repayment is reducing &ndash; I gather it fell by 86% last year and is down to &euro;346,000.  That is the figure for return of grants issued to companies.  Can Mr. Shanahan set out a short summary?  I realise it is complex.</p></speech>

Once we have identified a business, the company has to submit a business plan to us on what it is going to do in Ireland.  We are most interested in the substance that they are putting in, especially the related employment but also the research and development it intends to undertake and the capital development it intends to make.  Based on that plan we decide whether we are going to support the company.  We must establish whether we can support a company within EU state aid guidelines and on the basis of the economic case.  We do a cost benefit analysis.  As a result, we may decide to support a particular company.</p> <p>  Typically, we give the company a grant that has conditions attached to it.  For example, the company may have a plan to scale up to a certain level of employment and keep that employment in place for a certain period.  In some cases there may be a requirement that the company will make a certain level of capital investment.  We do not want a situation whereby grants are retrieved.  We want them to do exactly that.  It is not our ambition to bring those grants back in.</p></speech>

It only happens in the event that the company is not successful or does not honour the conditions that we have made.  Obviously, the levels were higher during the period when there was more economic turbulence.  However, as Deputy Burke has pointed out, that has fallen back significantly in the past year.  This means, basically, companies have done exactly what we expected them to do and what they expected to do.</p></speech>

Obviously, it can be a bone of contention throughout the country.  Let us consider the figures.  The midlands region tends to lag behind other regions in terms of IDA-supported jobs.  The relevant figure is approximately 4,000 odd.  That figure has not grown significantly in recent years, when other areas have been getting a bounce.  What criteria does IDA Ireland apply in terms of when it is seeking somewhere for an advanced factory building?</p></speech>

In summary, we look at population size - this goes back to the responses I made to the questions put by Deputy Cassells.  We look at the skills base within the area.  We look at the existing enterprise space, which could be an Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or other enterprise space &ndash; it is not exclusively to do with IDA Ireland space.  We look at proximity to third level institutions.  We look at the general infrastructure.  It is a matter of balance in ensuring that we put them into areas where there is reasonable chance of getting it to work.  Moreover, we only do this where there is market failure.  In an ideal world, we want the private sector to do this.  IDA Ireland is the developer of last resort in this area.  It is not something that anyone would want the national promotion and development agency to do.  We do it because the private market has not responded.  We also examine the existing offering within the region.  If there is existing office space or an existing factory that is available, then we market that.  We do not only market our own buildings.  We market private sector buildings too.</p> <p>  As the Deputy rightly pointed out and as he knows well, the midlands area is challenged.  Having said that, there has been some success, especially in Deputy Burke's county with Center Parcs.  We are optimistic in respect of other developments over the short to medium term.</p></speech>

I note the Comptroller and Auditor General report last week.  It is amazing how headlines do not tell the full picture.  From pages 234 or 235 onwards, we can read the reasons there is an effective tax rate of 9%.  The tax system for corporate tax is so clear; it is one of the simplest in the world.  There are few or minimal reliefs involved.  Does this come up much when IDA Ireland is marketing Ireland in terms of the negative publicity?  It is reckless of people to put out information that is specifically and factually not true.</p><p>In regard to tax, I think anyone who is quoting the Comptroller and Auditor General's report should read the analysis of the companies that are below the actual tax rate.  I note the finance committee had a number of experts before it in regard to determining what the effective tax rate of a company is, and no one can agree on it.  How it is calculated gives rise to an incredible amount of disagreement.  The IDA meets many chief executive officers, CEOs, around the world and I would like to know whether this negative commentary is affecting their view or whether many are aware of it.</p></speech>

It also shows that when one does an international comparison, which the World Bank has done, we have an effective tax rate of 12.4%.</p> <p>  On the question of how much it comes up, it probably speaks to a point Deputy Cassells raised, which is that tax is one element of the offering and it is not even necessarily the most important aspect, although that varies from company to company.  The single most important thing our clients raise with us is the availability of talent, because that is what they need.  It is only if a company can set up and is operating that everything else comes into being.  Talent is the single most important thing.</p> <p>  I was in San Francisco and San Jose last week meeting CEOs, particularly those in the med-tech sector.  I would say tax probably came up as an afterthought in some of the meetings and, where it did come up, it mainly related to the taxation reform that is under way in the US and had very little to do with our own tax issues.</p></speech>

In some quarters projected population growth for Dublin has been put at 700,000 by 2025.  On the basis of the lack of optimum levels of commercial office space and, obviously, housing, and given that Mr. Shanahan said talent is ultimately the deciding factor for FDI decision makers, what strategy and resources has the IDA employed to diversify the priority?  Mr. Shanahan can correct me if I am wrong but I assume that if Marc MacSharry Limited is coming from America to set up a company in Ireland, I would probably want to be on Baggot Street - that is probably everybody's starting position - with the appropriate accommodation and whatever else.  What are we doing to suggest we instead use counties Sligo, Meath, Waterford or elsewhere?  What are we doing to make them real alternatives?  Realistically, Dublin is bursting, and a lot of work is probably needed on this side of the room to assist the IDA in that, when we see office blocks and apartment blocks being turned down out at Dublin Airport based on traffic congestion.</p><p>Given the fact that 700,000 people are projected to come to live in Dublin, what is the medium-term strategy in terms of value for money to say we need to start using the entire building rather than 30% of it?  </p></speech>

We aim to move some of the investment outside Dublin but, more importantly, to target investment that is likely to go outside Dublin.  There are certain types of investments over which we will have very little influence.  As the Deputy pointed out, they will want to be co-located in a cluster of technology, possibly close to the Grand Canal.  However, there are other types of investments that are more amenable to a regional location.  For example, manufacturing investments are much more amenable to a regional location.  Depending on where the company is coming from, it has different views as to whether it needs to be in a capital city or even in a large city so we have targeted our work at working with companies who we believe would be willing to consider regional locations.  This means targeting outside the large cities in the US.  We also have a diversification strategy around markets so Asia-Pacific and Europe are also source markets and we are trying to grow them more quickly than the US market.</p></speech>

The witnesses will forgive me if I do not use the rest of my ten minutes for congratulatory words but well done to the team.  I was going to raise the last point raised by Deputy MacSharry but he has addressed it very comprehensively so I will not repeat it but it struck me as odd in the extreme that this money was used.  Was a business case done for that?  Was there any analysis or a post-review evaluation?  I say this in the context of being in the Gaeltacht area in Cork D&eacute; Luain - a comharchumann struggling for money.  Yesterday, we heard a presentation from a representative of the comharchumann - the co-operatives - pointing out issues and begging for money.  They create jobs and are getting a tiny amount.  I know IDA Ireland does very good work - certainly in Galway west.  I see what is there but the witnesses can see the difficulty for me listening to what was presented yesterday and what I saw on Monday in the Muscra&iacute; Gaeltacht and Oilean &Aacute;rainn as they struggle.  They are providing work.  It is difficult for me.</p></speech>

It is the function of Government and these Houses to decide how to do that.  Regarding what is within our own gift regarding how we spend money, we provide excellent value for money in terms of the return to the Exchequer from the investments we win.  In respect of the ConnectIreland and the Succeed in Ireland programmes, we have only expended money where jobs have been created but I acknowledge that there is a chasm relative to the ambition that was set out and the delivery.</p></speech>

It involves the cost of the creation of jobs under the IDA Ireland programme compared to the cost of the creation of jobs with the comharchumainn.  It is a debate that needs to happen.</p> <p>  I note IDA Ireland's figures relating to regional development are positive and that it has moved beyond the 50% from outside Dublin.  I welcome that.  In respect of Galway west, one side of the city has done extremely well, which has led to huge problems.  Mr. Shanahan is fully familiar with Parkmore.  I presume the IDA Ireland owns that park and the businesses there provide huge employment - I think over 2,000 people are employed there, but there are major problems with traffic.  I have some practical questions.  Why did the IDA Ireland strategy not look at the west side of the city where councillors did their job and zoned land as industrial?  Why has IDA Ireland not looked at that to balance the city?  How did IDA Ireland continue to invite industry, which is very welcome, into a congested site that is creating huge problems for traffic?</p></speech>

Our focus is on building out the business and technology parks we have first.  We have not ruled out where else in Galway we might develop.  In fact, our plan would be to develop significantly in Galway because we see it as very attractive location for investment.  My job is to attract investment.  Others have a significant role in terms of planning, how the city and the county of Galway are developed and how infrastructure is provided.  I regularly engage with both the city and county managers, as does my team.  There is undoubtedly a need for more impetus in how we address the issue because the alternative where we do not attract investment or rather it goes elsewhere, particularly where it goes outside the country, is not a good option from my perspective.</p></speech>

We are not talking about having no industry rather we are talking about sensible development.  If we look at Galway city where the councillors, who were often criticised in the past and rightly so, did their job, we can see that the land was zoned industrial on both sides of the city.  There is a great shortage of industrial development on the west side of the city, which means people are travelling over to the other side on a daily basis creating traffic jams.  I suppose it is too late to ask how this arose.  The land is owned.  What proposals does IDA Ireland have to rectify that?</p></speech>

We need development.  I am the first to promote development and a thriving economy in Galway but we need sensible balanced development.  When industry is located in one area, it creates huge problems relating to traffic and housing and Mr. Shanahan knows that.  Mr. Shanahan has given me a general answer.  I will be following it up specifically regarding proposals for the west of the city and Connemara.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Shanahan made a very strong comment about corporation tax.  I have a different view.  I have looked at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  He has given no opinion but has simply highlighted the fact that corporation tax receipts are highly concentrated and difficult to predict.  He goes on to point out that 70% of the receipts were paid by the top 100 and, more significantly, 13 of the 100 companies with the highest tax income had an effective rate of less than 1%.  Mr. Shanahan said today that the effective rate is much higher than that.  We have yet to discuss this report from the Comptroller and Auditor General and I know there are complexities, but 13 of the 100 companies with the highest taxable income had an effective rate of less than 1% reflecting the use of significant tax credits, reliefs and so on.</p></speech>

As I pointed out earlier, there are multiple ways to calculate this.  I neither doubt nor dispute the fact that 13 companies have a tax rate of under 1%.  There are reasons for this, which the Comptroller and Auditor General also refers to in the report.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General's role is simply to give us the report, and I accept that.  To say that there is an effective tax rate higher than that given by the Comptroller and Auditor General, however, is not acceptable.</p></speech>

When we announce jobs, it is a case of the company's ambition and telling the world what it is hoping to do.  The only figures we use in the figures I have provided to the committee today, however, are the figures for jobs on the ground.  We get these as a result of a census undertaken by our parent Department.</p></speech>

The question of regional development has been raised and I cannot let Mr. Shanahan go without mentioning issues in the south east.  It is one of two problematic areas, though I acknowledge that jobs have been created in recent years.  We had a much bigger problem five years ago, and we are in a much better situation now.  It is still a problem, however.  I am looking at the national unemployment figure of 6.4% and the figure for the south east of 8.1%.</p><p>Even within the figures there are variations and in parts of the south east the rate of unemployment is even higher.  I am constantly trying to figure out why that is the case.  I have talked to stakeholders, opinion makers, entrepreneurs and captains of industry in the south east and they all say the same thing, that there is no good reason the south east should have a higher unemployment rate.  I am trying to figure out the solutions.  This is very important because resources and infrastructure follow jobs.  We need to bring jobs to Ireland Inc. and that is the primary function of IDA Ireland.  Many jobs are brought to Dublin.  Of course, we have to build up the capital city, but if it overheats, it creates pressures in the areas of public transport, housing and rents, etc.  We need a counterbalance to it.  We have to identify such areas for that purpose.  Why does the south east have an unemployment rate much higher than in the rest of the State?  Is it due to skills shortages?  Is there a need for property solutions?  Is it due to the lack infrastructure?  As the hard analysis must have been made by IDA Ireland, I ask Mr. Shanahan to help me to understand why the south east is underperforming to the extent it is.  I am not dismissing the good work that has been done and know that Mr. Shanahan is going to say the number of jobs in the south east has increased.  I accept that, but the reality is that the unemployment rate in the region is higher than the national figure.</p></speech>

He acknowledged that the number of jobs created was growing.  That is positive and the more we can build clusters the more jobs that will be created.  We have had some very strong announcements, particularly in Waterford, and that is the starting point in building a cluster.  We have to continue to improve the attractiveness of the region relative to other options across all of the areas mentioned by the Deputy, whether it be infrastructure, providing a bigger base or the availability of skills.  When I use the word "relative", I am referring not to other regions in Ireland but to everywhere else.</p></speech>

Taxation is important as one of the factors, but I agree with him that skills and talent are the key ingredients.  That makes sense for companies, but is this a problem in the south east?  We do not have a university, but what is the level of joined-up thinking to deal with this issue?  IDA Ireland looks at the unemployment figures and also meets companies which have to make decisions on where they should locate.  There is a need for support for the regions.  Therefore, if the key ingredient is the availability of talent, is this aspect a problem in the areas where the rate of unemployment is higher?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017100500002#Q00400"><p>Yes.  It can be seen in some places in the south east that where there is an institute of technology such as in Waterford, there is more investment and there has been more indigenous growth.  IDA Ireland is not the only arm of the State involved in industrial development, but one can see the benefit of an institute.  It is not important whether it is an institute of technology or a university, although a university has more cachet; it is what the institute does that is most important.  Where there are such institutes, one can see clusters emerging.  In practical terms, we had a property solution on the ground which we were able to sell to a pharma company very quickly to create jobs and we are about to do the same again.  That is how we start to build a cluster and we move on from there.  Other counties in the south east also have opportunities.  On Monday I addressed a financial services seminar in Gorey at which some very strong players were present with which we have the ambition to build a cluster.  We also need to continue to improve on other things, not just in the south east region but also across Ireland because we are competing with everybody else.</p></speech>

How influential will IDA Ireland's view be in the new national planning framework?  There were criticisms of previous spatial strategies, in which there was something for everybody in the audience.  We are trying to move away from this in the regional cities, something I would buy into, especially in the case of the south east.  It is very important in terms of the provision of infrastructure because it follows the national planning framework and a spatial strategy, thus making it easier for IDA Ireland to attract companies to other regions.  As someone who represents the south east and sees that, despite the growth achieved and the positivity, we are still lagging behind, the national planning framework is an opportunity for us.  How is IDA Ireland going to interact with that strategy?  I will ask my final question after Mr. Shanahan has answered.</p></speech>

It is about developing centres of scale, critical mass and clusters, as we have tried to do within our own strategy.  We need the infrastructure to support it, as well as the educational institutions.  We are heavily engaged with colleagues across government on what is happening on the ground.</p></speech>

If we ask the head of Revenue for an opinion, he says it is not a matter for him but for the Government.  When the head of IDA Ireland says the rate should not be increased or decreased, it is a personal opinion because it is not the role of the head of IDA Ireland to set policy.  It is a clear function of the Government and the Government and politicians will decide whether we should increase or decrease it.  I say this to be helpful to Mr. Shanahan because he may find himself having to work with a different Government with a different opinion on these issues and it will be his job to implement Government policy.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Connolly asked for my view on the matter.  I am regularly asked what would or would not help in attracting foreign direct investment.  It is absolutely clear that it is for the Government and the Oireachtas to set policy positions on all of these issues.  In a similar fashion, the Deputy asked me what would help to support regional development from the perspective of the provision of infrastructure, education and so on and I gave my view.  I have similar views on tax matters.  I am not suggesting anybody should listen to them, but that does not mean that I should not share them.</p></speech>

He may be blamed for the lack of balance in the development of industrial policy, but companies decide why they should locate in a particular area.  I asked one major industry in my area why it had located there and was told it was because it wanted to be located near a major conurbation with a reverse traffic flow in the city.  As it is a wet industry, it requires large volumes of wastewater.  It also wanted to be located near an international airport.  It was probably a choice between north Kildare and Dublin or Glasgow.</p><p>It would be quite useful for that regional message to be understood, that in the absence of getting balanced regional development, we will continue to have those stories.  I do not necessarily ask Mr. Shanahan to comment on that.</p><p> IDA Ireland, according to the reply to a parliamentary question of mine in June, has 100 unoccupied sites.  Some of them are rented to local authorities.  I presume others are in farm land use or whatever.  Has IDA Ireland valued those?  Are many of them realistic prospects?  It is one matter for companies to visit these, but how realistic are they?  What was the methodology used in buying them in the first instance?  In buying them, had IDA Ireland a realistic prospect of bringing in foreign direct investment?</p><p> In addition, IDA Ireland has sites that will have closed.  There is one in my own area, the Hewlett-Packard site which is a high-profile and good site.  IDA Ireland will have more areas to market as well.  How many locations would IDA Ireland have on its books to which it would be able to bring investors?</p></speech>

As the Deputy points out, we own land throughout the country and that is for marketing purposes.  Some of it, frankly, is more attractive that others.  Where we have acquired land, it is obviously because we believe there is a possibility of marketing it and actually getting a result out of it.  Some of it is developed and some of it is not developed.  It changes from time to time.  I am interested in this area.  It is not a static portfolio.  Our ambition always is to move land on and to move buildings on and to sell it to clients.</p> <p>  In answer to the Deputy's question as to whether it is valued, it is absolutely valued.  It is valued every six months.  I do not have the exact valuation of the land to hand but we can provide that to the Deputy.</p></speech>

In relation to sites that close, unfortunately, it is a feature of the world we live in that enterprise fluctuates and different companies' fortunes fluctuate.  Where there has been a significant industry - Deputy Murphy cited an example in her own constituency - it has developed skills.  There is a site there to be marketed.  There is very good property on that site, to be marketed.  While the point at which a company is exiting is extremely regrettable and we make every effort to ensure it does not happen, it does give that area an opportunity to attract new investment.  It puts it ahead, maybe, of some other areas where one does not have that pool of talent, property and site available.  Unfortunately, we have a few of those examples throughout the country and it will be ever thus.</p></speech>

It has been gone through quite a bit already.  Mr. Shanahan was asked about the numbers.  It is the companies that determine the numbers and I would not dispute that.  Is there a length of time the job must have been in place for it to qualify?  Does it have to be there for six months or 12 months to qualify as a job that was delivered under the scheme?</p> <p>  Is the dispute under way being worked through internally in IDA Ireland?  Is there a timeline for the conclusion of that?</p></speech>

It is only if it is not that we claw back that money.</p> <p>  On the dispute, it is a ConnectIreland dispute with the IDA.  IDA Ireland is not in dispute with ConnectIreland.  ConnectIreland lodged a dispute notice, which it is entitled to do, with the IDA.  There is a clause in the contract which allows for this and which sets out how it should be resolved, and it is for ConnectIreland to progress that matter.</p></speech>

It is a challenge, irrespective of industrial policy.  There are opportunities in the likes of Brexit.  Thankfully, the rate of unemployment is falling quite quickly.  Successful industrial policy in which we will be investing will probably require us to bring in additional employees.  This morning we heard the announcement that 50% of the announced jobs will be for people who will be recruited domestically and 50% will be for people who come in because of the language issues.  How is the pressure on housing manifesting in terms of an impediment?  Is it nearly top of the list?  Is it making it impossible to market?  Is it being asked about?  Is it known about?  What engagement is IDA Ireland having with Government in this regard?  We probably need a much bigger workforce if we are to have balanced regional development and there probably is a requirement to grow the population.</p></speech>

First, on Brexit, there are both challenges and opportunities from an IDA perspective.  It is not all upside.  There will be more investment, and we have seen some of that already as a result of Brexit, but 13% of the IDA portfolio is exposed to the UK in terms of exports.  Some &euro;19 billion euro worth of exports out of our client companies is to UK.  That represents a challenge and a risk.  It is a two-way street, as it is, obviously, for indigenous companies.</p> <p>  In terms of the challenge of residential housing and the impact it is having, I would say in the recent past it has not posed us a difficulty in marketing Ireland, which I think was the Deputy's question.  Ireland is still seen as very attractive, as evidenced by even just this week the number of announcements that have been made, such as Veritas announcing more than 200 jobs, Microsoft, whom the Deputy herself has referenced, announcing this morning an additional 200 jobs, and Fidelity International yesterday announcing 280 jobs.</p> <p>  If I just take the Fidelity International and Microsoft examples, Fidelity International has added 250-odd posts in the past 14 months, so I think the companies are comfortable that they can still scale in Ireland.  Similarly, Microsoft this morning confirmed that it has fulfilled 80% of its previous recruitment drive which was announced less than a year ago for 500 people, so the evidence on the ground would suggest there are a lot of good things happening.</p> <p>  Undoubtedly, residential housing is an issue.  The Deputy asked about our interaction with Government.  Obviously, we engage with Government regularly on this.  It is keenly aware of the issue.  It is a priority and I have engaged directly with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on it.</p></speech>

Does IDA conduct skills audits on what is required?  Does our education policy, from an industrial perspective, require any changes?</p></speech>

We have people who work on skills.  All of our divisions feed in the skill needs of clients to the education system.  We work closely with the expert group on future skills needs to identify future skills needs.  I myself am a member of the National Skills Council so I directly articulate what is needed from a foreign direct investment, FDI, perspective.  There is huge merit in looking at the German model, which has a strong vocational element and apprenticeship element.</p> <p>  Recently, during the summer months, we did a survey of all of our clients on their satisfaction with various items in Ireland.</p><p>The feedback on education and training was overwhelmingly positive in respect of what has happened and the skills that the educational institutions are producing.</p></speech>

In 2016 there were 19,000 jobs created, with a net gain of 12,000.  I want to ask about the 7,000 jobs that must have been lost.  We are coming out of a recession now and the country is going better.  How does this figure compare with the recession years of 2012 to 2014?  Why are we losing 7,000 jobs?  Where did we lose them and was there a reason for the loss?</p></speech>

Even more importantly, as a percentage of the overall portfolio, losses are at an all-time low.  That is because we work very hard with clients to make sure they are developing and are not going to be subject to closure, loss, loss of a mandate and so on.  It is not just about attracting investment in but also keeping and growing what is already here.</p></speech>

There is no one sector that is particularly identified.  This is the ebb and flow of business, basically.  Some businesses work and some do not.  We still see some companies involved in hardware may still be exiting some of that.  The losses are also spread right across the country, both Dublin and the regions.</p></speech>

Is it on a percentage basis per annum?  If a company has a ten-year programme but goes bust after five years, is that money lost to IDA Ireland?  I presume the next instalment would not be paid as the company would be gone.</p></speech>

We require a parent company guarantee in almost all cases.  It is not just the Irish subsidiary that is on the hook but also its parent body, wherever that may be, in the US or elsewhere in Europe.  The legal agreement sets out very clearly what at any point in time is due back to the IDA, should the company fail to fulfil the conditions of the agreement.  We recoup the money that is left over.  Obviously, if a company is in liquidation or there is no recourse to the overall body, it depends on the liquidator and then the percentages and so on.  We chase everything through to the end.  Even in instances where that has happened - thankfully they are rare enough - the company has often given huge economic value to the State over the long period it has been here.</p></speech>

We both lease and sell properties.  A lot of our property is on a 999-year lease, which means we maintain control of what can and cannot be done, particularly in our business parks.  We want industrial development.  If a company goes into liquidation or receivership, it really depends on the circumstances and what the legal covenant is.  We would work with the liquidator.</p></speech>

I am from the south east, like Deputy Cullinane.  I am from Kilkenny and he is from Waterford.  We work together.  We have a great facility in Belview Port, which I know is high in IDA Ireland's ranking.  With Brexit coming and so on, the future of Belview Port looks rosy.  We have land and Kilkenny County Council is on board.  We have the services there, we have the roads, we are only an hour and a half from Dublin.  We have the rail link and, when Brexit takes place, it will be the nearest port to the mainland of Europe.  What is Mr. Shanahan's opinion on Belview Port?</p> <p>  Are we at disadvantage in the south east because we do not have a university?  We have two institutes of technology but a lot of our graduates are going to Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway.  Are IDA Ireland's businesses following graduates to where they are being educated?  Do we miss out?  We are behind as far as job creation is concerned.  </p></speech>

My own belief is that it is the quality of the graduates and what happens in institutions that counts, rather than what they are called.  That is not to say that institutes of technology should not aspire to become or to be called universities.  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, is not disadvantaged by the fact that it does not have "university" in its title.  Companies are interested in graduates, yes.  They are interested in the flow of skills.  Any region that can demonstrate that flow of skills is at an advantage-----</p></speech>

There is the flow of skills.</p> <p>  In respect of Belview Port, my view is that it is an attractive piece of infrastructure.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Buckley, on the matter.</p></speech>

It is and has been a strategic site for IDA Ireland.  It had the utilities in place, as Deputy Aylward outlined.  We worked very closely with Glanbia, which has established a facility there in the last two years.  It is putting a &euro;235 million investment into the site and creating an additional 1,600 jobs.  Those type of strategic sites are very important.  We still have some land there as well.</p></speech>

Talking personally, in the figures I see 802 for Carlow and 762 for Kilkenny.  Meanwhile Tipperary has 3,040, Waterford has 6,000 - which I do not begrudge them - and Wexford has 2,600.  We seem to be the poor relation there.  Is there any reason for that?  Have we landbanks in Carlow-Kilkenny and land available for IDA Ireland to bring in companies that are interested?  Of course companies want services, access to roads and so on.  We have those, yet we seem to be falling behind in the employment numbers.  I am not doing the poor mouth here, it is just that I have to fly my own flag.</p></speech>

I will ask Ms Buckley to comment on what is available in terms of landbanks.  Going back to my earlier response, it is a question of critical mass, co-location with institutes of technology and what is available on the ground.  I can assure the Deputy that we are doing everything to market those landbanks.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, it announced that it was expanding with 300 additional jobs between Cork and Carlow.  That site was very important at the time and it has gone to a terrific company that is continuing to grow in Carlow.</p> <p>  The second point about Carlow is that we plan to construct a building there next year.  It will be an advanced office building and is a project under our regional building programme, which aims to either attract new investment or to facilitate an existing investment to expand.</p></speech>

In Kilkenny, we have a business park and we work very closely with the local authority there.  We have land available for marketing at Belview, as I said already.  We have land available in the Kilkenny business park as well, where Bank of Ireland and VHI are.</p><p>At the Purcell's Inch industrial estate, there is a small amount of land available as well.

Will IDA Ireland be looking more closely at the south east, which is only an hour and half down the motorway?

I congratulate the agency on the approximately 200,000 people or 10% of the Irish work force in foreign direct investment companies in Ireland.  The payroll in IDA Ireland companies is probably a bit higher than in other local companies or the public sector.  They are good employers in terms of improving the local economy.  What county in Ireland has the lowest number of IDA Ireland-supported jobs?  I am sure he knows it.</p></speech>

I will not labour the point as we are short of time.  In the midlands, the figure is 4,280, which is the lowest for the regions.  Laois has been one of the fastest growing counties in terms of population and the witnesses mentioned population and urban trends in the opening statement.  The population of Portlaoise, as the witnesses know, is substantially higher than Tullamore, Athlone and Mullingar.  IDA Ireland has not responded to the change in the demographics and the witnesses know the position.  I invite Mr. Shanahan to a meeting in Laois as IDA Ireland makes an annual visit to Laois County Council.  It is the usual slagging off of IDA Ireland as we know the number of visits and jobs being created in the county.  There are approximately 100 jobs or something like that.  It is a very small number.  There is a site and Laois County Council recently purchased a site adjacent to the motorway.  I am sure the councillors will speak to the agency about that.  Could we arrange for the chief executive of the agency to meet council members?  I will liaise with Mr. Shanahan's office in that regard.  It is great to have the good news stories all the time but the agency does have an obligation to other counties.  For a long number of years, Laois has been the lowest performing area for IDA Ireland.</p></speech>

I am Gerry Mallon, chief executive officer of Ulster Bank Ireland, designated activity company, DAC.  With me today from Ulster Bank DAC are Paul Stanley, chief finance officer, Eddie Cullen, managing director, commercial banking division and Andrew Blair, head of customer debt solutions.</p> <p>  In my opening statement I would like to update members on the progress we have made since we last met with the committee.  I will describe some developments we have implemented across a range of services and products to improve what we do for our customers.  I will provide an update on the tracker mortgage examination and the progress we are making towards resolving that issue and I will also provide an update on Brexit preparations.</p> <p>  Ulster Bank is a strong bank with a long history in the Irish market and a loyal customer base.  We have provided banking services in Ireland for 180 years so far.  We are the third largest player in the Irish market and we want to grow our market share.  We are the only systemic bank operating in the Republic that has an overseas parent.  Together with our parent Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, we are developing and investing in a long term strategy for the future of Ulster Bank in Ireland.</p> <p>  Our half year results published recently show that we are making some good in progress in building a more sustainable, safer and stronger future.  Comparing the first half of 2016 to the first half of 2017 we have increased our operating profit and reduced our operating expenses.  New lending has increased by 11%, risk weighted assets have reduced by 17.7% and customer deposit balances have risen by 10.3% compared to the first half of 2016, supporting a reduction in the loan to deposit ratio.</p> <p>  Our conduct and litigation charges were &euro;39 million in the first half of 2017.  This charge reflects a provision for remediation and project costs associated with legacy business issues where we believe errors may have occurred.</p> <p>  In the year to June of this year we saw an 11% increase in lending to personal and business customers.  We continue to see year on year growth in new mortgage lending and are targeting to lend approximately &euro;1 billion to mortgage customers in 2017.  I will provide members with more details on our mortgage services shortly.</p> <p>  For business customers we saw strong performance in new lending, which reflects a positive response to initiatives such as our export finance roadshow with the Irish Exporters Association, the expansion of our partnership with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI on agri-business, and the revamp of our Business Achievers portal and networking hub.  Business Achievers is a new free digital business hub powered by Ulster Bank that displays our continued support for business customers in the Irish market.</p> <p>  The ways in which our customers bank with us are changing radically and in the first half of 2017 we introduced a number of changes to reflect this.  In light of the rapid migration from branch transactions towards digital methods, we introduced two new customer payment systems, Apple pay and android pay, in the first half of this year.  These services, as committee members probably know, allow customers to pay for goods and services simply by waving their mobile phone over a contactless payment terminal, with security provided by a fingerprint or a code.  We want to provide banking services where and how our customers want them.  It is not simply the case that a new generation of young urban customers want to bank exclusively online while older rural based customers want to be able to call into a local branch every day of the week.  Customers want and need a combination of both.  They want fast, convenient, secure services for their day-to-day banking but they need a very different service for those significant milestones in their lives that they reach with the assistance of their bank.</p><p> Our branch network remains an important channel for customer engagement.  We announced in March that we would close 22 of our 110 branches in 2017.  Closing any branch is a difficult decision which we do not take lightly, but it does not end our local presence in these areas.  We are improving our retail network by spending &euro;6 million on upgrading and refurbishing branches, extending the services available through An Post for our personal and business customers and introducing other improvements such as fast business cash lodgments, bulk coin deposits and cash and cheque deposit machines.  We are adding two extra banks on wheels to serve rural locations in addition to our three existing mobile banks and appointing six new community bankers to support vulnerable customers and help customers to move towards online and mobile banking channels.</p><p> In the past two years, Ulster Bank has strengthened its links with the financial technology startup community through its association with Dogpatch Labs in the Custom House Quay centre, for example involving mentorship programmes for technology startups and hackathon events.  In the past month, Ulster Bank has announced Ireland&rsquo;s first open application programme interface in the banking sector.  This move will help to take open banking in Ireland from concept to reality.  To describe this concept simply, it allows one's bank to be linked with other services.  It is similar to the sharing of information that has allowed services like Hailo and MyTaxi to transform how we use taxis.  It is revolutionary, it is happening globally and it will be happening here.  The application programme interface has been developed using market-leading technology from Ulster Bank's parent company, RBS, and will give approved third parties limited access to a customer's account balance and transaction history if the customer requests it.</p><p> RBS and Ulster Bank invest heavily in fraud prevention and detection systems to keep our customers' accounts and information safe and secure.  Training on fraud prevention and detection is mandatory for all our employees, including those who serve our customers.  We recently appointed a new community protection adviser to support our customers and front-line teams on a range of issues, including frauds and scams.  We continue to benefit from RBS's investment in fraud surveillance and its various partnerships; for example, with the UK National Trading Standards as part of the "friends against scams" initiative.  This offers up-to-the-minute training for customer-facing teams and helps us to spread the scam protection message to more of our customers and their families and friends.</p><p> I would like to make some brief points about mortgage services.  Helping our customers to buy their own homes is one of the most important services we provide.  We have put a considerable amount of work into improving our mortgage services for customers by simplifying processes and reducing the average time spent on an application.  We have introduced a new mobile mortgage manager service, which offers customers the choice of meeting mortgage advisers in their own homes at a time that suits them.  We offer free valuations on new mortgages.  We provide a &euro;1,500 legal fee contribution to provide real help with the cost of moving home.  We have steered away from large cashback offers.  Instead, we focus on consistently offering competitive headline rates.  We offer some of the most competitive rates in the market.  We have a fixed rate that is as low as 2.6% and we have 13 different variable rates that start as low as 3%.  We also offer a 3.7% discounted rate against our standard variable rate of 4.3% for customers with an income-mandated current account.</p><p> We do not offer any deal to a new customer that we are not prepared to offer an existing customer.  We have a good proposition that helps existing customers on tracker rates or in negative equity to move home.  We are always working to improve our customer proposition.  We leverage the wider capabilities from RBS to do this.  We recently amended the overpayment allowance on fixed rate products to 10% per annum.  This allows customers to avail of the certainty of a fixed rate while having more flexibility to pay down the mortgage quicker.  As one of Ireland&rsquo;s leading commercial banks, we continue to play an important role in supporting the recovery of the housing market in Ireland.  This includes the provision of financing for new housing developments and accommodation sectors such as purpose-built student accommodation market to help meet current and future housing demands.  Over the last two years, we have committed financing on schemes that will deliver in excess of 1,200 new houses, as well as financing student accommodation to deliver over 1,000 new student living units.</p><p> I would like to report briefly on the progress that has been made in the tracker mortgage examination. The Central Bank is carrying out an industry-wide review of tracker mortgage-related issues across all Irish banks.  As part of this review, lenders including Ulster Bank were required to review their entire tracker loan books to identify customers whose contractual entitlements we failed to honour, or in whose cases we did not live up to the standards of full disclosure and transparency that we and the regulator would like to have seen.  We are required to work through four phases under this examination.  The first phase, which involved the development and submission of detailed plans, is complete.  The second phase, which involved gathering information, reviewing and submitting a report, was submitted in line with the agreed Central Bank deadline of March 2017.  The third and fourth phases are running concurrently.  The third phase, which involves calculating the level of redress and compensation, is ongoing.  The fourth phase, which involves the implementation of the redress programme, is also ongoing.</p><p> Our second-phase report, which was submitted to the Central Bank in line with the agreed deadline of March 2017, is being reviewed by the Central Bank.  Until the review has been concluded, the second phase will be considered to be ongoing.  Therefore, the number of affected customers may be subject to change.  When the second-phase process was under way last December, we told the committee we had identified 2,000 affected customers.  The completed second-phase report has identified a total of just under 3,500 affected customers.  In line with the process defined by the Central Bank to stop further harm, Ulster Bank has contacted and returned existing customers to their tracker mortgages.  This has not been done in the cases of 57 customers because the original tracker rate would result in a net increase in monthly payments in this small number of cases.</p><p> Ulster Bank has begun the third phase, which involves redress and compensation, and the fourth phase. which involves the implementation of the redress programme.  The number of customers remediated so far is small.  It is just under 40 today.  We are starting the process very slowly to test all the calculations for each customer.  We are building up a process to have a much more intensive model for calculation, contact and remediation.  The process will take a number of months.  It will be well into 2018 before all cases are addressed.  Customers will then have a further 12 months to appeal if they are unhappy with any aspect of our redress and compensation payment.  We have not concluded the process of establishing the number of customers for whom the actions of the bank caused the loss of their homes.  We have identified a small number of customers for whom this is the case.  We have made contact with them to begin the process of redress and compensation.  The numbers are currently low but that could change as we work through the process.  I will not be able to confirm the final numbers until we have completed the third phase.</p><p> In line with the Central Bank guidelines, we have put in place an independent process to support customers who wish to appeal.  Two independent appeals panels have been established, each of which has a qualified barrister or solicitor as chair, an accountant or actuary and a customer voice representative.  The role of the panels is to assess customer appeals in a timely way and determine whether additional redress is required.  For reasons of efficiency, one panel is dedicated to complex appeals.  An independent secretariat to support administration and customer communication has also been established.</p><p> I will turn now to Brexit.  Ulster Bank continues to support its customers during the period of negotiations between the UK and the EU.  As part of RBS, which is a business that focuses on the UK and Ireland while maintaining a good presence in Europe, we are working through the various exit scenarios.  We have contingencies in place to ensure we continue to provide our customers with the full range of services they require, as would be expected of any prudent business.  The fundamentals of our strategic plan remain constant.  Ulster Bank, as a bank regulated in Ireland and the EU, continues to be a core part of RBS.  We have seen a limited impact on retail customers, mainly because none of the changes associated with the UK leaving the EU have crystallised yet.  There has been a mixed response from our small and medium-sized enterprise and business customers, with some sectors affected more than others.  Ulster Bank is helping businesses to prepare for the transition through the Brexit process following the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union by the UK earlier this year.  Some of our customers are looking at expansion opportunities in the UK as a result of Brexit.  We will be seeking to help to finance and support such expansion plans.  We supported a series of nationwide seminars in association with the Irish Exporters Association which offered businesses the opportunity to meet and network, while hearing from industry and business leaders at a number of regional locations on a range of topics from Brexit to innovation to how to grow one's business.</p><p>Ulster Bank engages regularly with the IDA and our colleagues in RBS to help identify businesses from the UK which are considering setting up operations in Ireland with a view to providing banking products and services to them in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p> There are many other topics I could address, but I will conclude as I am sure we will have the opportunity cover them during the discussion.</p></speech>

I will start with the examination of tracker mortgages.  A lot of Ulster Bank customers are very interested in this hearing and they have been contacting members with questions and telling us their own stories about the impact this issue has had on them.  As such, it is important that we tease it out.  The headline from the presentation is that the number of impacted customers has risen by 75% from 2,000 to just under 3,500.  How did that happen and when did the bank realise the number had grown so much?  Mr. Mallon told us last December it was around 2,000.  When did the bank start putting all of those customers back on the correct rate to stop the harm?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Mallon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017100500002#G00300"><p>The first thing to note is that until the Central Bank is completely satisfied that we have successfully concluded every one of the phases of the tracker mortgage examination, everything we say about the examination, including the numbers, could be subject to change.  It will certainly be subject to review and it could be subject to change.  We make our remarks and provide information on the understanding that nothing is final until the Cental Bank says it is.  We will provide the committee with numbers on a best-endeavours basis.</p> <p>  When we met last December, the one thing that was clear to us was that there was a primary cohort of approximately 2,000 customers where we believed there were issues relating to the tracker mortgage examination.  We had an estimate at that stage of the number that was going to be included in that.  We were also clear that this was a complex programme requiring the examination of tens of thousands of accounts.  There were no defined large individual cohorts, but rather there were multiple small cohorts which needed to be worked through over a period of time.  As we concluded phase 2, we worked through each of those cohorts and made a conclusion or decision as to whether people were impacted and whether there was a need for remediation.  We addressed the 2,000 as quickly as we could in December 2016 and in January and February 2017.  Identifying the remainder has been a gradual process between that point and the conclusion of phase 2 in March.  We were in a position to identify the full number in time for the conclusion of the process in March.</p></speech>

That process has commenced.  As I said in my opening remarks, there has been a slow start to that process because it is so complicated and there is such a great degree of manual calculation required.

As of today, we have got to fewer than 40 customers in terms of that remediation.</p></speech>

However, we are now in a process where that is being ramped up progressively to create a more systematised and effective way to reach more customers quickly.

Last December, he told us there were 2,000 customers who had been affected.  The figure is now 3,500, of whom approximately 1% have been repaid the money the bank overcharged.  If the shoe was on the other foot and these customers owed money to the bank, it would not be shy about chasing them for it.</p></speech>

We have brought back people who used to work for the bank to focus on this.  We have a large team which is working very hard on this.</p></speech>

At another point in time, that was discovered and identified.  It is not that hard to calculate how much the customer overpaid on the mortgage every month and every year over that period.  It is not that difficult.</p></speech>

I might ask Mr. Stanley to elaborate on the complexity of the calculations required.  We have to get it right consistently and treat all customers absolutely fairly.

It is also the third-party assurance process around that.  I wish it was easy to do but it is not.  In some cases it can be automated and done relatively quickly and those are the ones we want to move through at a faster pace.  Others, given their complexity, have to be done manually.</p></speech>

No one who is working on this is being allowed to drag his or her feet.  Late hours are being worked and a great deal of effort is being put in.

We have all heard some of those stories in recent weeks when people found out that the bank was coming here.  Some very harrowing stories and life changing situations were set out by people who, in some cases, paid tens of thousands of euro more than they should have over a period of years.  It is devastating.  The bank told the committee last December that 14 or 15 families had lost their homes as a result of overpaying the bank.  Is there an update on that?</p></speech>

The important thing we have tried to do is to look at where there is causality, that is where the actions of the bank have caused these people to lose their homes, or where, had we acted differently, they would not have lost their homes.  The number we have got down to is a small number and fewer than 14 or 15.</p><p>However, the numbers are still moving.  We are still working through trying to identify where we have been at fault.</p></speech>

In some cases the issue of whether a customer was on a tracker mortgage was not going to have made any significant difference because of the customer's circumstances.  The important issue for us to examine whether it could have made the marginal difference which would have allowed that customer to be in their home.  In that case it is the bank's fault.  We need to take charge of it and to be responsible.</p></speech>

There will be more.  I am quite sure we will find more.  If I was pushed to make an estimate, I think the number where we will find it was the bank's fault will probably be in the teens.

What commitment is the bank giving on that issue?

I do not think there is anything that we can do to put that right.  We are in the process of having a dialogue with the customers.  We start with a financial compensation and then we look at what more we can do.  What is clearly our fault is clearly our fault.  We are accountable and responsible for trying our best to put that right.</p></speech>

I can say for certain that it will be well into 2018 before the process of remediation and compensation is completed.  I would hesitate to give any broader commitment than that.  Each customer will also have 12 months to make an appeal, the appeals process has to be gone through, and the Central Bank has also has its opinions on what more we might need to do.</p></speech>

I want to go back over some of the ground that Deputy Michael McGrath covered, in particular, the commitment Mr. Mallon gave to the bank's customers last year when I questioned him.  I will refresh his memory.  I asked him in autumn 2016 why when this investigation had started in December 2015 customers has not been put back onto their tracker rates, which is the first thing that the Central Bank requires the bank to do, namely, do no more harm and steal no more money from its customers.  I asked Mr. Mallon, "Will all these customers receive a letter and be put back on their tracker mortgages before Christmas?"  Mr. Mallon replied, "That is certainly the intention.  We will certainly be writing to them".  Why did he not keep his word on that?</p></speech>

I accept fully that what I said in response to the Deputy was that we will be writing to them "this month".  However, I qualified that by saying, "We are moving as fast as we can.  The intention is to get those letters ... [out] this month".  Shortly after that, we repeated that it was our intention to get the letters out, at which point my colleague, Mr. Stanley, clarified that we would have as many out as we could before Christmas but that some of them may drift into the early part of the new year due to the process.  Later in the meeting a member of the committee reflected back to us on that and said, "I welcome the fact that the bank is committed to putting the 2,000 customers affected by the tracker mortgage debacle back onto the tracker mortgages by Christmas or, at the latest by early in the new year".</p></speech>

There is no way Mr. Mallon can convince me that this is any way acceptable or justifiable.  It cannot be that difficult to do that with 200 staff.  I ask Mr. Mallon to convince me on this point.  After identifying those customers were on the wrong tracker rate, how, with 200 staff, could he not organise to put those accounts onto the right tracker rate within a period of a year at that stage?</p></speech>

The bank has 1 million accounts, including current accounts, savings accounts, loan accounts, mortgage accounts and other accounts and it is able to deal with them by and large efficiently enough.  Now the Central Bank and the Ulster Bank have put their hands up that the bank has been overcharging its customers and has been doing so for quite a period of time.  We are not talking about 1 million, 0.5 million or hundreds of thousands of customs but 2,000 customers who in the period of the previous 12 months the bank had identified it was overcharging and it did not put them back on the correct rate.  I can only put it to Mr. Mallon that the bank has been dragging its heels on this.  It only put the last customer onto the appropriate rate, which is the first thing the Central Bank does, right before the deadline the Central Bank laid down of 31 March when the bank had to produce its plan.  That was when the last person was put onto the tracker rate.</p><p>The bank was dragging its heels in respect of this issue.  If it was not for the 31 March deadline, I question whether some customers would still not be on a tracker rate post that date.</p></speech>

I will not attempt to defend either the fact that the bank was overcharging or that the process for the restoration of customers to tracker rates has been frustratingly and unacceptably slow.  I reiterate my invitation for the Deputy to meet the team that is working on this to understand the degree of complexity, the honest endeavours which are being undertaken, the hours which are being worked and the best efforts the bank is making.  I can assure the Deputy that we are not in any way dragging our heels on this.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank is dragging its feet.  The bank's customers have written to me, to Deputy Michael McGrath and to other members of the committee to tell us about financial difficulties resulting from the fact that it has not gotten to grips with the issue.  Mr. Mallon told my colleague that only 40 customers have received redress.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The Central Bank told us that in February 2,600 customers across the banks were given redress.  I take it that not one of Ulster Bank's customers was given redress in February.  We have been critical of delays in some of the other banks, but how is it that they could get their act together and start not only putting people back on tracker rates but also issuing letters of redress and paying compensation?  Some seven or eight months on, Ulster Bank has still not issued any letters of redress or given redress to its customers, bar 40 individuals.  How many people are affected?  Is it 3,500?  Can Mr. Mallon explain to me and, more importantly, to its customers how the bank is so far behind other financial institutions of a similar size?</p></speech>

I reiterate my apologies for the length of time this has taken and the fact that it is not something which is about us delaying in any way, shape or form.  Rather, it is about us trying to do the best we can with the complex situation we are facing.</p> <p>  There is no incentive to delay.  This is something which causes pain and frustration for our customers.  Unless we can address this, the bank has no hope of a sustainable future based on customer service, trust and advocacy, which are our strategic objectives.  We have put money aside to resolve this issue, which includes project costs.  If I was able to double the resources and deliver the project twice as quickly, it would not cost me any more money because we would be done more quickly.  The longer this drags on, the more it costs because we need to continue employing outside consultants and so on.  The costs escalate.  There is no incentive for us to drag our feet.  It is genuinely something which I invite the Deputy to understand in more detail.  It is a genuinely complex issue which takes time to resolve.  We are working very hard on it.</p></speech>

Banks all did the same thing, namely, denied tracker mortgages to their customers and took - I would use the term "stole" because the money was taken wrongly - approximately &euro;600 per month from certain customers.  Some payments were higher or lower.  In some cases, customers are entitled to tens of thousands of euro in redress and compensation.  Others are entitled to hundreds of thousands of euro because their homes were taken from them.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, the figures are staggering.  Some 3,500 people are affected.  For an institution which deals with 1 million accounts to tell me it has given redress to fewer than 40 customers two years into its investigation is not good enough.  We have to measure it against the other banks.  If they can deal with the complexities involved, so can Ulster Bank.  It is good that bankers have come before the committee and apologised.  I am sure customers welcome that.  However, I know, based on what I have heard from them, that those customers want their money, which the bank is holding.  Ulster Bank is still issuing letters advising customers that their accounts are in arrears.  They would not be in arrears if the bank gave them back the money it took from them in the first place.</p> <p>  It was stated that phase 2 is finished and that the bank submitted the report by 31 March.  That deadline related to the plan to be issued to the Central Bank.  Was the final report issued on the same day?</p></speech>

I want to raise another issue that I have raised privately with Ulster Bank and with the Central Bank.  I understand Ulster Bank is sending out new mortgage contracts or updating the terms of contracts.  A clause in the new contract has been brought to my attention.  I ask the witnesses to explain the reason for it.</p><p>The new term the bank is inserting into existing mortgage contracts reads:</p><blockquote>The Lender will not be liable to the Borrower for any loss of any description the Borrower may suffer if the Lender fails to perform any of its obligations under these Terms and Conditions as a direct or indirect result of anything outside of the Lender's reasonable control. This includes but is not limited to industrial dispute, failure or fluctuation of power or telecommunications supplies or any equipment or error in any software, error or lack of clarity in the Borrower's instructions, failure or delay in the supply of services to us by a third party. The Lender will not under any circumstances whatsoever by liable for any indirect losses or losses of profit.</blockquote><p>The bank has entered into a legally-binding contract with its customers and now it is changing the terms of that to give it a massive get-out-of-jail card in respect of any loss that is the result of its own actions or those of third parties it has employed.  Why does the bank think this is fair?</p></speech>

That is an aspect of the complexities we have had to deal with as part of the tracker mortgage examination.  In transferring them over, they moved to the existing terms and conditions for all customers that were already on the new mortgage systems.  That is the background.<br/><br/>The intent of this is a <i>force majeure</i>clause.  The Deputy pointed it out to me and I thank him for that.  I have picked it up separately and would like to respond again to the Deputy on it.  The intent is that in the case of extreme events outside the control of the bank, it not be liable for loss.  As written, other interpretations could be put on it.  I have asked for that to be reconsidered and I will return to the Deputy in respect of it.</p></speech>

There are concerns here.  It is wrong because many people do not read the terms and conditions of their contracts.  However, the bank is inserting a condition into a contract which is extremely favourable to it and which will give it a lot of get-out clauses in respect of losses to the customer.  The latter is not being asked to take legal advice on this clause.  That is very unfair.</p></speech>

I have many concerns about that.  It hardly forms the basis of a contract at all being so open and providing so much protection.  It is certainly not an equal relationship in terms of getting the bank out of anything.</p></speech>

Has the bank identified who is responsible within the bank for moving people off these trackers?</p></speech>

The tracker mortgage was a popular product between 2001 and 2007.  As interest rates rose around 2007, there were many customers moved onto fixed rates and they were not moved against their will.  It was a sensible thing for them to do based-----</p></speech>

Was there a section in the bank which made these decisions and which said that this was the right thing to do, or which brought the matter to the board?  If so, in that process were there any dissenting voices that said this is wrong let us have another look at it?</p></speech>

I have not seen any evidence yet - and I would welcome it if there is any - that anybody in Ulster Bank sought to deny customers something to which they were legally entitled.  The area of contention and failure for us comes down to the question of whether those customers were made clearly aware, beyond any doubt, that when they left the tracker rate to go on the fixed rate, they would not be eligible, under the terms of their contracts, to move back.  There are regulatory standards and these are the minimum to which we would seek to hold ourselves.  There is even a level of customer trust and transparency for which we would hold ourselves accountable.  The issue is not about anybody trying to make a decision to move customers off or to deny them.</p></speech>

When they came before us, the representatives from the Central Bank indicated that there were concerns around the illegality of this and that it was going to investigate.  Has the Central Bank contacted Ulster Bank about that?  It was going to make referrals to the Garda at that time.  Has the Garda contacted the bank?</p></speech>

When he says to the best of his knowledge he would know because one of the first things that would happen in any investigation is what is at the root of this and who was responsible.  Surely Mr. Mallon could, perhaps, either not promote people who made these decisions or even demote those who were dissenting voices.  That would need to be sorted out in any organisation to find out where the culpability lies.</p></speech>

The debate was on that latter point of standards of accountability, transparency and communication that we held customers to when they shifted off the tracker rate in 2008.  That is the point of contention.  It was long before my time with the bank and I have not conducted any final review to try to understand those two areas.</p></speech>

Customers are at the centre of this.  I know a customer who has been waiting nine months.  When we heard from the bank last year, I reassured him that he would know by Christmas where he stood and what was happening.  He still does not know today what is happening.  What can the bank say to that customer who has not been given any direction whatsoever?  He cannot appeal because there is nothing to appeal.</p><p>Is there one bit of advice Mr. Mallon would give that person today?</p></speech>

I would happily engage with the individual to do so.  I would reiterate, however, the apology to those customers who know they are impacted and perceive that they are impacted.  The bank has let them down and we have to put that right.</p></speech>

Telling them that it will be well into 2018 before they will have any information is not the way to treat customers.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions about the vulture funds.  I was in the repossession courts in Castlebar in recent weeks where there were approximately 140 repossession cases, quite a number of which involved Ulster Bank.  People had received letters from the vulture fund saying it now owned their mortgage.  This is frightening the life out of people and, in many cases,  frightening people out of their homes.  Will Mr. Mallon tell me how many family homes, in particular, were sold off to vulture funds to date?</p></speech>

The vast majority of those portfolio sales involved commercial real estate and small and medium-sized enterprise customers.  We have conducted two sales: one in 2015 and one in 2016.  Each of those sales is subject to a confidentiality agreement, so we will not talk about price or the value of those sales.  However, I can say, and we made this public at the time of the latter of the two sales in 2016, that that sale involved just fewer than 900 people and the family home.  Of those customers, 95% of them were more than two years in arrears and 88% were more than three years in arrears.  They were deep in the litigation process and non-co-operating.  That is the basis on which we elected to include them in the sale.  Where customers will come and talk to us, our primary goal is to keep them in their homes.  We do not want to see people leaving their homes.  That remains our goal and intent.  However, for that to happen, we need to be able to talk to the customer and the customer needs to talk to us.  We also need to be able to determine the customers' capability to meet the commitments under their mortgage or make suitable arrangements that will enable them to remain in their homes and make payments on their mortgage which will be sustainable in the long term.  In this particular case, we do not intend to dispose of customers who are co-operating or are engaged with us and who are in low levels of arrears and trying to make satisfactory arrangements with us.</p></speech>

There is a very detailed examination of the customer documentation in those files.  As we did that, we discovered inconsistencies or errors unrelated to the tracker mortgage examination.  They were things that one would not expect to see such as inconsistent terms and conditions.  Part of the document might have contradicted another part of the document.

This was the investigation that the Financial Conduct Authority conducted into the activities of GRG in Great Britain.  To be clear, the investigation was undertaken by the Financial Conduct Authority within the United Kingdom.  Ulster Bank chose to adopt the things RBS had committed to at that stage.  There were two parts to that.  One was to institute a new complaints process overseen by an independent third party, who was a High Court judge.  The second part was to undertake an automatic refund of any fees which could be described as complex fees, that is, ones which were perhaps beyond the transparency requirements that might have been appropriate for small and medium-sized enterprise customers.  Throughout that process since 8 November last year, we have been keeping the Central Bank informed of the progress we have made.</p> <p>  At this point, we have made a considerable amount of progress in terms of both complaints and the refund of complex fees.  As things stand today, I am happy to share some statistics with the committee.  We have identified 19 customers who would be entitled to a refund of a complex fee.  Of those 19 customers, four have already been refunded the amount due, totalling &euro;362,000.  A further five are in the process of returning the identification documentation we need to make those refunds.  Of the remaining ten, we are working through making contact with those customers and are at the third attempt to make contact with them to make repayment.</p> <p>  On complaints, at this point Ulster Bank has received 48 complaints since we went out on the website seeking complaints, which is a period of approximately nine months now.  Of those, four have already been adjudicated.  We are expecting another 13 to be adjudicated by the end of October.  That is approximately 35% of the complaints.  The complaints process is complex and it is overseen by an independent third party.  We will work our way through them as fast as we can.  Given their complexity, we expect that some of those complaints will run into the first quarter of next year.</p></speech>

Relatively low numbers of receivers were appointed, which reflects the fact that during the period 2008 to 2013, and most notably during the period 2010 to 2013, customers were granted very significant levels of forbearance when they were in a position where they were unable to pay.  To the extent that we thought we could support people to get to viability, we did everything in our powers to get them to the point where they were viable.  The reality is that during that period, the extent of equity funds, debt funds or indeed performance of businesses was extremely limited.  If I contrast that with where we are today, in the past 18 months I can think of ten cases were there was &euro;140 million of debt involved.  Those companies were able to raise almost &euro;30 million of equity.  We were able to restructure them and move on.  Those sorts of funds could not have been raised in the period from 2010 to 2013, which meant that businesses which were already struggling for viability could not get restructured.</p></speech>

I cannot answer that more broadly for RBS or for Ulster Bank prior to my time, but I suspect that the answer is no.  The reason for that is that the decision to close a branch is only done after really detailed and thorough analysis and investigation.  A detailed cost-benefit analysis is gone through.  We obviously understand the cost of running a branch, in terms of the physical premises, the overheads and the cost of the staff, and we understand the benefits in terms of the usage of that branch by the customers and the business which it develops.</p></speech>

Does the bank talk to customers or people in the locality who are using that branch and depending on it for different cash transactions and different transactions within the bank in the community?  Does the bank consider the wider impact on the community?  I believe that Ulster Bank and other banks have a responsibility to look at the wider community and the impact that closing a branch in an area will have, and the knock-on effect it will have in any small town in Ireland.</p></speech>

We do, and we are thoughtful about what we do.  Ultimately though, we are a commercial business and we cannot support a branch which is fundamentally unviable.  The kind of dialogue that we have with customers and community groups is much more about the leave behind and the use of alternative services.

The way in which the impact of the macro-prudential rules which the Central Bank has put in place, along with funny developing market dynamics in the mortgage market, means that many customers, particularly first-time buyers, look for an exception.</p><p>First-time buyers generally require a loan-to-value ratio that is a little higher.  They will have gone to a number of banks and those banks will have ended up giving them offers.  All of a sudden, we are not sure how these offers are actually going to draw down but we have given the customer a commitment.  The consequence has been that the requirement for us in respect of the Central Bank is that we be within our ceiling for the level of exemptions at the end of the year.  This year, and this is possibly coming across in many of the banks, people have seen that, because of the number of offers put out, they are not quite sure what is going to draw down and what is not.  They have coasted up towards the top of their capability in terms of our capacity to be able to offer exemptions.  That means that a number of the banks, including ours, have had to put a little bit of a brake on the exceptions while we wait to see what is in the pipeline and is actually drawn down.  Thus, we can be completely sure that we meet our end of year target for the Central Bank.</p></speech>

I am framing the question in the context of the exceptions.  Consider the case of someone who is renting consistently and meets the requirements beyond the deposit requirement, including the requirement for an average loan no more than 3.5 times one's earnings.  The bank will obviously have its own measurements.  If one meets the requirements beyond the deposit requirement, one falls into the exception category.  If the individual is paying rent of &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,200 per month, it is very difficult or nearly impossible to save.  If he or she saves between &euro;200 and &euro;300 consistently every month with Ulster Bank over a year or two, amounting to perhaps &euro;3,000 per year, thereby demonstrating creditworthiness, could the exception limit be extended?

I have expressed privately to the bank some of the issues that arise.  The first concerns the pattern of the full-year measurement, meaning the exceptions get used up in the first half.  The second concerns very crude measures.  If crude loan-to-value and loan-to-index measures are used, one loses the ability to understand some of the more complex phenomena, such as individual customer affordability.  Some people might meet both of those criteria but still will not be able to afford the loan because they will have other debt commitments that are not taken into consideration.  The rules are doing a fantastic job.  I agree with them very much because they are taking the potential pressure associated with upward inflation and irresponsible lending out of the system-----</p></speech>

The question is purely related to sales to vulture funds.  We are getting a lot of feedback from individuals whose loans have now ended up with the various entities, Cerberus being the most high profile.  I have a few housekeeping questions first.  The loans sold on between 2014 and 2016 total approximately &euro;13.7 billion.  How much of that pertains to the Republic of Ireland and how much pertains to Northern Ireland?  I can isolate three figures: &euro;1.5 billion, &euro;800 million, and &euro;2.8 billion.</p></speech>

We have a good idea of exactly how much of this was agribusiness and the rest.  As the Senator maybe aware, the rest includes a significant number of primary businesses, including agricultural enterprises, to which an undertaking to buy a piece of land or a property as an investment was attached.

When people were borrowing from the bank, they could hardly have expected to end up in vulture fund.  Mr. Blair makes the point that it relates to assets.  My point is that customers are concerned that they have a viable businesses, take a farm where someone might have borrowed on the basis of a building or maybe a venture that has nothing to do with the farm, the economy crashed and now they are in a position where the vulture fund could sell their farm, so that their means of livelihood is gone and they are no longer dealing with Ulster Bank.  Did the bank seek any assurances from funds such as Cerberus that when the loans were being sold on it would be taken into account that these were family businesses?  We are talking about family farms, which have been farmed by successive generations, and family owned businesses in the SME sector.  Many people are sceptical, and feel that Ulster Bank outsourced the stripping of their assets in order to repay the loans.  How does the bank respond?</p></speech>

That applies to businesses that are family homes and also people with buy to let properties.  To the extent that businesses are viable we will try to find a way to restructure them and support them through that.  The number of businesses that were once viable and became non-viable because of the economic crash was extremely high.  It was an extreme time.  We supported customers over very long periods of forbearance from 2009 to 2015 and simultaneously tried to rebuild an organisation that was capable of supporting growth for our customers for the future.  Part of that process was resolving the significant overhang of customers with non-performing loans.  We could not avail of transferring assets to NAMA at the larger end, and we had to resolve the matter for ourselves, and we set about doing so with the full knowledge and understanding of both our shareholder and ultimately shareholders and the regulators.  We understand that there are customers who would prefer to be dealing with Ulster Bank still, rather than an investment fund, but we had to deal with the issues before us, which included a large overhang of customers whose situation we needed to resolve.  We have tried to deal with customers whose businesses were viable and co-operated with us.  During the period in question viability became very difficult for everyone and we appreciate that - people suffered and sacrificed enormous amounts for their businesses - but many businesses became unviable.  There is no pleasure in this for us but we needed to resolve the situation.</p></speech>

I have a set of accounts before me.  In section 9 of the notes to the financial statement, directors and secretaries interest in shares, and they are the directors and secretaries of the RBS group, Mr. Blair is listed as a director of RBS.  It is either the group but presumably, if it is the accounts for West Register, and the note relates to directors and secretaries interest in shares, it gives the name Mr. A. Blair.  I am assuming that there are not two Mr. A. Blairs, but maybe there are.</p></speech>

I am referring to an extract that I was given, as was Senator O'Donnell, in which Mr. Blair is listed, presumably as a director of the RBS group.  If it is referred to in the note of the West Register accounts, it looks as though Mr. Blair must have been a director.

I was here for almost all of the contributions and the opening statement.  I have gone through the bank's questionnaire and listened to most of the other members' contributions.  There are 200 staff working on the tracker issue and only 40 cases have been mediated.  I accept that if I ask questions about the 40 it is with regard to approximately 1% so it may not be indicative of the overall.  What has been the size of the remediation?  There is the remediation element, as in bringing people back to where they were if it had not happened, and the compensation element.  I was intrigued by why arrears versus non-arrears have different levels of compensation.  Are we saying that people who were not in arrears got less compensation than people who were in arrears?  Will the witnesses explain this to me?</p></speech>

Those customers who were in arrears, particularly with the difficulties we caused by having incorrect tracker levels, have suffered more personal difficulty and harm, and hence this is what it is recognising versus those who were not.  To be clear, we are fixing customers and they are getting remediated for the differential between the rate they were on and the tracker as it is happening.  This is a compensation.</p></speech>

Other people have told us this was not the case, and certainly there have been reports on how the GRG operated in the UK, where it was to get into businesses, get the existing owners or managers out and then dispose of the businesses relatively quickly.  The suggestion was that the GRG was there to make businesses last with their current ownership and operational structures.  It arrived as a white knight, but quite quickly it emerged, certainly in the stories we have been told, that it was not half as helpful as was initially thought, and that ultimately a significant number of GRG customers were forced out of their own businesses.  What is the response of the witnesses to this?</p></speech>

GRG has been mischaracterised in public discourse somewhat as being a unit which in some way artificially distressed businesses to enable it to exploit them and claim their assets.  I have seen no evidence in what I have seen of any of this conduct or behaviour happening in Ireland.</p></speech>

RBS also came out with a very clear statement on the firm rebuttal of that type of underlying accusation.  A Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran report was done in the Republic of Ireland, which found no instance of that type of behaviour.  RBS undertook a process on a couple of identified flaws to try to remediate past issues, one being the issue that complaints of poor treatment of customers who were in the GRG were not properly looked at, and there was a fresh opportunity for customers to complain.</p></speech>

On the point the Senator has made about allegations in the media recently, particularly in Great Britain, I refer to what the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, stated at the time.  On 8 November RBS announced the actions it would take and those actions were undertaken voluntarily by it.  The FCA stated it had seen no evidence that the bank had artificially engineered a position to cause customers to transfer to the GRG and that any customer transferred had been exhibiting signs of financial distress but that there was no widespread practice of transferring customers for inappropriate reasons.  It went on to note that the bank's communications with customers could have been better during the transfer process.  There was a focus on pricing in Great Britain of increased risk at the expense of consideration of long-term viability.  Decisions made were not necessarily well documented and explained.  The last point was about complaints.  That is why actions were taken.</p> <p>  There are and have been allegations.  As Mr. Mallon said, they are allegations.  That is the position stated by the FCA in response to the decision by RBS to go voluntarily with the complaints process and the refund of fees.  Beyond that, without getting into individual cases and people talking about what happened to them, it is difficult to address.  I return to the core objective of the bank in its totality - the GRG is a division of the bank - which is to take customers who are in distress and try to find ways to restore them.  The reality is that, unfortunately, not all customers remain viable forever.  Some, in circumstances that may be driven by actions of their own or the economic environment, will prove not to be viable and incapable of being restructured.  I understand the Senator's concerns about the allegations made, but the most we can do is explain what exactly the FCA stated at the time and what its perception of the outcome was.  It could not find support for the contention made in these allegations.</p></speech>

We still have a group of people whose core focus is on working with businesses to make them viable again and restructure them.  We are successful in that task today.

Will the delegates outline, from their perspective, the level of forbearance offered to some of these customers?  I am not asking for individual examples.  Earlier they said there was significant forbearance from 2008 onwards.  What is their pitch on this?  People lost their businesses and livelihoods.  Many of them had spent years building up their business and felt it would have survived in the long run.  As far as they are concerned, Ulster Bank pulled the rug from under them.  I accept that the delegates will have a different perspective, but I would like to hear what it is and what the level of forbearance was.</p></speech>

Others were in earlier stages of distress who would have breached convenants or undertakings they had made in respect of their financial performance or other terms and conditions of loan agreements.  We were not moving customers who were in the category of doing everything expected of them within the confines of the contractual arrangements we had made with them.  They were customers who had missed payments, of interest or capital, or who had breached loan covenants and needed attention.  The intent, when we moved them to the GRG, was to try to give them the support they needed to survive.  One could argue that it extended from the outset of the economic crisis in 2008 to 2015 before businesses began to see real recovery, probably in Dublin in the first place.  I am sure others know outlying areas of the country much better than I do and who will say parts of the country have still not recovered from a business viability perspective.  I understand people who run businesses have put their life, soul and blood into them and want to keep them alive, but there comes a time when any financial institution - Ulster Bank in this case - will need to make a decision on the future of these businesses and bring certainty to the situation.  That uncertainty wears on the customers concerned and also on the bank.  I am respectful of the fact that people want to keep their businesses alive, but it cannot be forever when circumstances are very difficult.</p></speech>

These are figures from a recent report in the UK.</p><p>Last year Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, set aside &pound;400 million to compensate small businesses.  If you are compensating the small businesses that were affected by what happened to them in GRG, then that in itself is admitting you did not help them, that they were inappropriately put into this particular scheme in the UK and they were inappropriately then dealt with.</p><p>If I relate that to what is happening in Ireland, it is in effect the same thing and to a degree, and with respect to both Mr. Mallon and Blair, this is groundhog day.  It is the same thing over and over again.  I am interested in the aspect of the debate around GRG that relates to the number of businesses that were put into GRG that were associated with other businesses, other than the core business.  What efforts were made by the bank to separate out the performing loans before the person was pushed through to GRG and then out?  Why did the bank not make an effort in those years to save the better parts of the performing companies and businesses that had their accounts in the bank before you sent them all off?  It was as if a decision was made to bundle the good, bad and the ugly into one basket and send them to GRG.</p></speech>

Mr. Blair has already referred to this.  I ask Mr. Blair to answer the other point.</p></speech>

Will he give us some idea of what it is about?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-05a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Blair" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017100500002#R00800"><p>I will certainly try.  On the compensation amount, the &pound;400 million to which the Chairman referred, that has been set aside in order to meet the costs of the programme and also to refund the complex fees.  In the context of the complex fees, I quoted some statistics for Ulster Bank earlier.  The total amount involved is just more than &euro;1 million, including interest, and it affects 19 customers that we have identified to date.  We are very close to the end of that process.</p> <p>  In terms of the point raised by the Chairman about trying to separate customers that had businesses with attendant other debt that may not have related to those businesses originally but to some other activity, in many cases, property, during the period from 2008 to 2013, as I said earlier real efforts were made to try to support customers to do things that would enable them to survive.  In a normal environment some of those activities would have been to realise the assets that were creating the burden on those businesses.  In that period, the ability to realise assets, as everybody who lives in the country knows, was extraordinary limited, if not non-existent for a period probably through to the end of 2012.  If one were outside Dublin, it would be even more limited than that.  Some of the actions that would have been available to people in order to restore businesses to health were effectively closed to them.</p> <p>  That is the perspective I have on this which is that real efforts were made to try to support people through to viability.  The separate point, which comes up in some of the questions that have been asked, is whether we then took a decision to restore the bank to financial health and restore the balance sheet of the bank to put it in a position where it could begin to support and grow in the economy.  We took the decision to realise those assets and by that I mean the loans and we did that with the full knowledge of our shareholder and indeed the views of the regulators taken into account as a necessary step to make Ulster Bank a viable business and to make Royal Bank of Scotland a viable business.  That is why we did that.  We did not "not seek" opportunities to try to separate businesses and give them a future, but at the end of the day, we had to take steps to restore the viability of our own business and we did what we thought was the right thing to ensure that we could remain a systemic organisation in this country.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about West Register, let me go back and be absolutely certain about the issue of the directorship.  I am absolutely certain as I sit here now that I never had a shareholding in West Register.  I may have been a director of that company for a short period.  I do not recall, but I will clarify that, Chairman.</p></speech>

I find it extraordinary.  I cannot pursue it any more because neither one of you knows anything about it.  We will pursue it again and the committee would like a comprehensive note on its function, its connection with the bank, the types of property it held or how property was transferred to it and what was expected of West Register, having had the property transferred to it.  I think it is extraordinary that the witnesses do not know.</p> <p>  I dispute the fact with Mr. Blair about his efforts to restructure viable businesses.  The correspondence I, as Chairman of the committee, and other members have received regarding GRG tells a different story.  It is a story of viable businesses mixed in with businesses that were in difficulty, not being separated out.</p><p>It is a story of the total package simply being dumped from Global Restructuring Group, GRG, to a vulture fund of some kind or another.  That may have been a piece of work the witnesses undertook to save their bank or to better their balance sheet, but it distinctly contrasts with the action they have taken on the trackers.</p><p> The witnesses are talking about a bad time in their bank.  I will give them an example of a bad time.  I want to tell them about a customer, and this is on the tracker issue, which does not compare with how the bank dealt with the GRG customers.  This person tells us that they overpaid their mortgage by approximately &euro;400 a month.  It is ongoing for the past seven years.  They struggle with their monthly repayments and during that time they had to assist their two children who had Asperger's syndrome.  They have gone to credit unions and banks for loans to support the care of those two children.  The person says they have gone without food, without heat in their home, without holidays, and the children of that family are suffering to this day.  They estimate they are owed approximately &euro;30,000 and, I am sure, more from the witnesses' bank, and they still have not dealt with them.  It is totally unacceptable, in any society, that the most vulnerable would be treated the way this family has been treated.</p><p> Do the witnesses know that in recent weeks, in the lead-up to this committee, the correspondence to the committee has peaked at an incredible high?  I examined that correspondence and took from it the basics, and what it is telling us is that the bank's help line is a farce, that it does not give the answers or any comfort as to the timeframe for dealing with the issue, whether the individual is in scope or not, the level of compensation and so on.  It is as if the bank just established it because the Central Bank said so, but the level of information is such that it is unhelpful because it adds to the frustration and anger of the person who contacts the help line in the first place.</p><p> Regarding help lines, I draw the witnesses' attention to other pieces of correspondence, which bear a trend across a huge number of customers.  These people have failed to deal successfully with the bank, even on the most basic pieces of information, so they have taken to employing either financial consultants, people who would assist in that regard or legal representation.  In spite of that, the bank has not responded.  Again and again, it sends out the same letters that are full of nonsense about what it is doing.  It does not answer any of the questions it has been asked and, in some of these cases, the person writing the letter tells us that the questions they have asked have not been acknowledged or answered and that the bank is not dealing with the questions in their lives that are critical to how they plan the rest of the servicing of their mortgage, and their lives.  Does that not stand in stark contrast to how the witnesses said their bank dealt with the GRG issue and then turned around and failed the ordinary citizens of this State who find themselves being pushed all over the place?  They write to us just to get the basic information.</p><p> I want to know what the witnesses intend to do to correct that and what they will do for individual families who find themselves in a particular set of circumstances where their quality of life is destroyed and where the children of that family are having to suffer as well.  Will they give those families priority if they write directly to them?  Will they instruct their staff to reply?  Will they give the front-line staff the appropriate answers to the questions we are being asked, as a finance committee, to address?  If they are so fond of their customers, why are they treating them very badly?</p></speech>

I have apologised, and I will continue to apologise and say that we will make it right for those customers.</p> <p>  It is clear that what we need to do to be able to restore the trust of customers is not only make up for what we have done in the past.  It is not about what we do to put that right but how we do it.  It is clear to me that there is a lack of clarity and transparency regarding what they can expect, when they can expect it and how we are seeking to resolve that.  Based on the Chairman's feedback and that of others, it is clear there is more work for us to do in being helpful, transparent and giving people answers as to when they can expect a response and what that-----</p></speech>

Second, I asked him about that particular case, of which there are many others - I have piles of correspondence here.  What will he do to prioritise these families if they should come to him?

For example, if a customer asked about the specific compensation they are likely to receive, until that calculation is completed, and I have described some of the complexity of that, we are not capable of giving a response on that.</p> <p>  There is a need for us to improve the clarity around what we can say and when we can say it.  There is a need for us to improve the transparency around the prioritisation process and therefore when individual customers can expect to find themselves in remediation.  We need to do all of that in the context of the fact that there is oversight by the Central Bank and whatever we say, do and commit to needs to be something with which it agrees in terms of doing the right thing at the right time for the right customers.  All we can do is keep working as hard as we possibly can in regard to remediating each of the individual customers.</p></speech>

When I asked him about the questions, he says he might not have some of the answers.</p><p>For example, why were we placed in GRG?  What was the expected outcome?  The witnesses should know the answers to these questions and they should not have to get three reminders from a customer asking the same questions over and over again.</p><p> Mr. Mallon should not have come in here today to give us another groundhog day event with all this correspondence piling in on top of us.  He has already received some of the correspondence and the bank has asked customers to contact it directly.  The bank gives a phone number but when the customers contact the bank the person at the other end cannot even answer the questions.  That is why people are annoyed.  They have no confirmation of anything and nothing definite to say the bank will deal with their case with replies to the correspondence of which I have been speaking.  It may be correspondence to us, as members of the committee, but it is also correspondence the bank has received.  I find it shocking that, in some cases, the bank does not give a straight answer.  I understand the complexities of this but the witnesses have been at this for a number of years and I am not at all happy at the manner in which they have replied to the questions here today.  They have heard what I have said and are aware of the correspondence because it is copied to them.  I would like to know, by return after this meeting, what they are going to do in regard to some of this correspondence.  I will not press them further on it today but this is appalling behaviour on the part of the bank.</p></speech>

I have a question on the tracker examination and the approximately 1,000 customers of the 3,000 whom we regard as switchers.  They have not got a huge amount of attention so far in relation to any of the banks and there has been little public debate on what is an important issue.  These are customers whose mortgage has either been redeemed in full and their account closed or who switched their mortgage to another bank.  The bank cannot do the same for the latter cohort as it has done for its existing customers, for whom the bank can stop the harm by putting them back on the correct rate.  A person who switched to AIB may be paying a variable rate of 3.5% but if they were still with Ulster Bank they would be entitled to a tracker rate of 1%.  How is the bank going to deal with that issue?  Is the bank going to take them back as customers on a tracker rate?</p></speech>

I do not believe that shadow directors are appointed <i>per se</i>.  I do not believe when it comes to the concept of a shadow director that anyone says they are putting in a shadow director.  Anybody assuming a role which had &quot;shadow&quot; in the front of it would mean he or she would be assuming potentially fiduciary responsibilities in respect of the company.  If the question was potentially where we had independent banking reviews carried out by professional firms, I may be able to clarify that for the Deputy in terms of the numbers, although I do not have them with me.

The fact that the assets and loans that were managed by GRG - or the vast majority of the portfolio -  became part of or ended up in RBS Capital Resolution Ireland and were ultimately sold off does not mean that GRG was the genesis of that portfolio sale.

The fact that only 5% of the 2,000 loans remained with the group suggests to me the GRG was an abject failure in that regard.  If it was set up to try to make businesses viable and keep things going, it is clear that it did not.</p></speech>

I cannot know the answer to that question because we do not track what happens after a sale.  The primary goal of the GRG when it was set up was to support customers.  One cannot make unviable businesses viable through financial actions alone; they have to be viable in and of themselves.  Ultimately, the bank made a strategic decision at both RBS and Ulster Bank level, with full oversight by everybody, including our partners.</p></speech>

It is my contention that it was not a great success, given that only  5% remained with the group in the long term.  I accept that some of the companies involved might have survived under different ownership, but we cannot know if that would have been the case.  </p> <p>  My final question concerns the 1,000 or so accounts of the so-called "switchers".  Of the 3,500 mortgage customers in question, 1,000 or so are no longer customers of Ulster Bank.  How have they been contacted?  The bank presumably has details for some of them, but they may not be up to date.  Some of the customers may have died; some may have moved house and some may have emigrated.  Of the 1,000, with how many has Ulster Bank been in contact?  I do not mean merely writing them a letter; how many of them have actually interacted with the bank?  Are we talking about 400 or 950?  Does the bank have an ongoing relationship with most of them?  It is clearly the case that the records held by the bank of the people concerned are not as up to date as they are for existing customers.  Some of them would have moved without getting in touch with the bank; therefore, it might not be aware of it.</p></speech>

To how many has the bank written and how many have responded?  Is it 400, 600 or 950?  Perhaps Ulster Bank might then think about engaging in an advertising campaign asking the wider public if they were Ulster Bank mortgage holders who switched their accounts and stating they might have been affected by the tracker mortgage issue.  It is one thing if the number only comes to 50, but it could be half or three quarters of the total.  Even if only one family have been affected - we have heard about many cases, as the Chairman mentioned - that family are still entitled to redress.  Ulster Bank would be chasing them if they owed it money.  They are entitled to be aware of this issue.  It is clear that some of them must not be if the bank has not yet contacted them.</p></speech>
