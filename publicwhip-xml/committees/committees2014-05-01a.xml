Since then, a number of those concerned have been in contact with me who have given information, either to Bus &Eacute;ireann, in part of the investigation or to the newspapers, and they have submitted transcripts of their conversations and the tape that is being talked about.  That information will be circulated to members.  In view of what happened in regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann and what has been said, we need clarification from the Accounting Officer or Bus &Eacute;ireann, and we will pursue that.</p></speech>

We can seek information on that, which is what I would hope that we would do.  Arising from that, we can see where we are going.</p><p>  The allegation is that we were misled.  If that is so it is very serious.  However, as I say, it is an allegation and we need to gather our information and then the questions that need to be asked can be put to the appropriate person.</p><p>  As there is no other matter, I will go through the correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers that was received since our meeting of Thursday, 10 April.  In light of the correspondence received yesterday from Rehab which was brought to the attention of members, copies of which members received since yesterday, if they want to raise any matter on that correspondence they may do so now.  It is the legal response from Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100004#C01200"><p>We should note it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100004#C01300"><p>On that aspect we held a meeting on 16 April last and the committee received that response through the clerk to the committee yesterday.  We have now received a response from all of the public bodies which provide funding to Rehab.  In summary, the position of the public bodies concerned is that other than where data protection provision applies, the information is deemed commercially sensitive or a legal arrangement has been entered into which contains confidentiality clauses, they see no impediment, legal or otherwise, that would prevent all public bodies from supplying full information they hold to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Those letters will be published on our website today.</p><p>  In addition, the committee wrote to Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins seeking their voluntary co-operation with the committee in its ongoing examination of the expenditure of the public funding that goes into Rehab, which in 2013 amounted to &euro;95.5 million.  A reply was received from the solicitor acting for Mr. Flannery and the solicitor acting for Ms Kerins late yesterday evening.  These have been circulated to members and are before the committee today in order to deal with them.  I do not have to go into the detail of these letters except to say that the committee will issue a reply rejecting the allegations contained in both letters.  While Ms Kerins has stated that she has not ruled out appearing again before the committee, it is clear from the tone of both letters that they do not accept the Committee of Public Accounts has a right to examine any matters relating to Rehab or the expenditure by it of public moneys, which in 2013 amounted to in excess of &euro;95 million.  They also wrote we should confine ourselves to examining the public bodies that supplied the funding.  They are entitled to their views, but we see the expenditure of public money as falling within our remit.</p><p>  In that regard, and as it now appears that the committee needs the powers of compellability in order to conclude its examination, I propose that we agree to proceed to that stage by placing a request before the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, in accordance with Part 7 of the 2013 Act.  The clerk to the committee informs me that a draft of the application has been prepared and is with our legal advisers.  Once that submission has been subjected to legal scrutiny, it can then be submitted.  Members may wish to comment on the two letters received.  However, I wish to get agreement that we should proceed immediately to compellability on the basis of the draft proposal for CPP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100004#C01400"><p>I fully agree with the Chairman.  It is now apparent that we have no option but to seek powers of compellability.  I am not sure there is much merit in picking over the contents of the two letters that we received, save to say the following.  My impression is that they are letters that, if you like, throw the kitchen sink at this committee.  Their allegations are bogus and designed to stall and delay, and that is a great pity.</p><p>  I support the proposal that we seek powers of compellability.  I ask the Chairman at what stage members will see the draft application that we intend to submit.  We will have to have sight of that and may have some suggestions on it.  I ask the Chairman to clarify whether it is proposed to publish the letters that we received from Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins on the committee's website.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100004#C01500"><p>The answer to Deputy McDonald's last question is, "Yes".  We will publish the material.  In answer to her first question on when the submission will be ready, it is in draft form and is being checked by the legal section.  I would hope that we would have it tomorrow because Ms Mellissa English, our legal adviser, is otherwise engaged today.  As soon as it possible within the next day or so, we will have the draft for approval by the members.  I propose that the clerk to the committee would speak to the members rather than hold a full meeting and that once the draft is agreed, it would be submitted to the CPP for its consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100004#C01600"><p>I fully agree with the proposal to immediately move to make the request to the CPP for compellability powers.  On the letter received from Dore &amp;amp; Company Solicitors on behalf of Mr. Flannery, all I can say is it contains allegations that some members of the committee, which could include me, have acted without lawful jurisdiction and abused their powers.  I take offence to that remark that I may have ever done that at this committee.  As I have said previously in regard to the correspondence from this individual, it has amounted to the most blatant attack on the powers of an Oireachtas committee by any person of standing in Irish society to block an Oireachtas committee in its work.  The allegations against us, individually and collectively, are a disgrace and I reject out of hand that at any stage I have abused my power as a member of this committee.  I am sure other members will feel the same, but I must state that for the record.  I have never seen such an effort by an individual in Ireland to go to such lengths to not appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.   We must seek compellability powers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100005#D00100"><p>I regret that Ms Kerins and Mr. Flannery have come back to us in such a fashion.  This is not personal; it is not about individuals.  Members of the Committee of Public Accounts have a body of work to do on the charities sector.  One element of that is a module on Rehab.  In terms of this committee continuing its work and coming to a conclusion &ndash; we have spoken about a beginning, middle and end &ndash; regrettably it has no option but to proceed through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the fashion it is now doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100005#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  These letters, certainly the one from Dore &amp;amp; Company solicitors, are pretty well beneath contempt.  This is a kind of contrived tissue of allegations in order to obstruct the work of the committee.  I do not believe we have any option whatsoever, in view of this long-winded letter with its large amount of fantasy suggestions about members of this committee, but to go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I fully support what was said in this regard.  It is utterly absurd for us to get a letter of this sort when we are simply seeking to make people who have handled public money come in to us and account for it.  We are not seeking to witch-hunt anybody at all.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, it is not personal.  The people we are seeking are not the people to judge whether they can help us or not; we are the people who can do that.  The Chairman and my colleagues are 100% right that we must now go straight for the compellability option.</p></speech>

We should not be sidetracked by them.  Previously, we agreed a course of action in relation to the activities of Rehab, and we should now follow that as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

It is a shame that we have come to this point.  This story has dragged on for more months than it ever needed to.  It has now become a pitched battle between this committee and the two individuals concerned, which is extremely unfortunate.  The only people who are really losing out are those in the charity sector as a whole because this matter will drag on for another few weeks.  There is not a lot more to talk about.  The committee has decided that it is to go down the route proposed anyway.  Let us just do so and move on.  Let us see what arises in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

As far as public moneys are concerned, I stress again that &euro;95.5 million was at stake in 2013.  Anyone associated with the allocation of that money, any agency that gave funding to Rehab, Rehab itself and individuals who may have information relevant to the matter can be compelled once we get powers of compellability.</p></speech>

In summary, the position of the public bodies concerned is that, other than where a data protection provision applies or the information is deemed commercially sensitive, or where a legal arrangement that contains a confidentiality clause has been entered into, there is no impediment, legal or otherwise, that would prevent all public bodies from supplying full information they hold to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

Powers of compellability would give us protection and the right to have that piece of information and any other information like that for our use.  Therefore, powers of compellability give us the full power necessary to ask for documents and papers to be presented to us and for individuals to come before us relevant to our investigation.  That case is set out clearly by the clerk and we have to legally prove it.  This is being done.  Once it is done, the matter proceeds to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It has all its regulations and protocols in place for these inquiries.  It has just concluded in this regard, I understand.  It may have to seek external legal advice on the submission we make to it.  Once that is done, it will then be in a position to make a decision on our request for powers of compellability.</p><p>  I see no reason, however, that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could not meet quickly, get its legal advice and make an early decision on this because it is clear that our only intent, despite what has been written, is to pursue how the &euro;95 million in public money was spent.</p></speech>

It is becoming clear that the way to gain that information more effectively is actually dealing with the public bodies involved.  They are willing to do that under compellability arrangements.  If they have relevant information, they will be required to give it.  If the ultimate goal is to garner that information, the most effective way of getting it is actually to pursue those public bodies and enter a compellability arrangement with them.</p></speech>

We will proceed on that basis.</p><p>  Before we move from the issue, I want to clarify another matter.  Page 5 of the correspondence from the solicitor representing Mr. Flannery, and which is addressed to Mr. Ted McEnery, states that from information received by his client in and around 14 April 2014, it further appears that the committee and-or its Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness, either verbally or in writing requested the Revenue Commissioners to review all of his client&rsquo;s financial dealings of whatsoever kind that he may have had with the Rehab Group.  I want to reject that absolutely.  I have not spoken to Revenue, nor have I written to Revenue as Chairman of this committee.  I have done nothing of the sort.  However, I ask that the members agree that the transcripts of the meetings we have held on Rehab be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the accountancy body overlooking the standards and so on of the accountants of the country.  For the sake of completeness, we should bring the matter to their attention if they want to examine the situation.</p></speech>

It is not done.  I make the suggestion because we were dealing in the hearing with issues concerning companies that might not have been registered.</p> <p>We were dealing with interpretative corporate enforcement with the governance of Rehab, the failure in that governance and the failure of the board.  We were dealing here with the accountants concerned and the fact that they may have overlooked their own governance issues.  If Mr. Dorr and Mr. Flannery wish to have all of this examined for completeness, I am willing to agree and let it proceed.</p></speech>

Mr. Dorr wrote to me directly, strictly confidentially, as &quot;John McGuinness, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee&quot;.  In that communication, he said that:<blockquote><br />In the public forum you belittled an email sent by me to the committee clerk on the evening of 9 April 2013, and you demeaned me.  It is very easy to score cheap shots for your own expedience, but at my expense, while skulking behind the shield of parliamentary privilege.  Your readiness to abuse this privilege calls into question your suitability to be a member of the Oireachtas Committee, not to mind your suitability to be Chairman of such an exalted one as the Public Accounts Committee.  No doubt this strictly confidential letter will not be leaked and will be consigned to your nonsense file.</blockquote>I will consign it to the nonsense file but after I ask the members to publish it, or formally leak it, whatever way he wants to describe it, but that is what I am doing with it.  I want to put it in the public domain and circulate it to members.<br />As far as I am concerned, we have a job of work to do.  It is set out clearly in regard to the spending of public money.  Some of that money went to deal with the issues that arose and that we dealt with over the last two meetings.  We have a right within our remit to pursue the &euro;95 million referred to and how it was spent.  It is as simple as that.  I am not making it personal and I do not think any members of the committee are making it personal either.  It is a matter that needs to be dealt with and we need to conclude our business on it.  <br />The matters that have been brought to our attention through the legal process are just delaying that.  Without any further comment, I will ask the clerk to talk to the members as soon as the draft is completed and legally tested.<br />I will now call on Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, followed by Deputy Eogan Murphy and Deputy Shane Ross.</p></speech>

We are currently looking at the charities sector and, effectively, we need to bring that to a conclusion.  I am conscious of the impact throughout the entire charity sector.  That is why it is a shame that neither Ms Angela Kerins nor Mr. Frank Flannery saw fit to work with us as a committee.  We now have no option but to go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is not personal or about individuals but the central message is very simple - people need to work with us rather than against us.  It is about people in the charities sector and especially the service users.  People working in the charities sector are doing outstanding work, including collectors.  We can never lose sight of that.  It is not about individuals but about the central issue.  When it goes to the CPP, we should get a relatively swift response so that we can conclude our body work in this area and move on.  The charities sector is entitled to that.  The key message is that it concerns the entire charities sector and is not about individuals.  No individual or individuals can be bigger than one organisation or sector.</p></speech>

When the Chairman reads out correspondence like that, it only furthers the aims of those who would like to think this is a personal witch-hunt against individuals.  That is private correspondence received by the Chairman.  He can put it in the nonsense file if he wants to, but we are only helping them to create a perception that it is the Chairman versus them, or the committee versus those two individuals.  I do not think it helps that we continue down that path.  As I said in my initial remarks, there is no need to elevate this correspondence to a status it does not deserve.  There is no need to introduce that private correspondence into the meeting because it has no bearing on what we are doing.  All it does is to give the impression that the committee is pursuing something personal, when the Chairman reads it into the record.  That is why people then make these claims.  We do not want to give them any justification for making such claims.</p></speech>

I understand that the Chairman has been specifically mentioned in this letter but if the committee engages in a tit-for-tat every time somebody writes a letter, I am not sure we are going anywhere.  We should focus on compellability.  If a claim is being made, that is fair enough but for us to start forwarding transcripts to the Revenue Commissioners, we are in danger of becoming petty.  I think we should drop it and leave it.  The Chairman has refuted this and everybody would accept that.  I think we should leave it at that.</p></speech>

The whole objective of this letter is to make it personal.  It is to make us respond in a personal way in order to obscure the real issue.  It is quite obvious that the tactics are diversionary.  I do not know how many members of the committee are criticised in this letter and I do not particularly care, to be honest.  It is a four-page rant against us individually, one by one.  We should rise above that and say that we are going for compellability.  We do not intend to respond in this arena.  We can do it outside or wherever we like, but we do not intend to respond in this arena to personal attacks because it is not a personal committee.</p><p>  I do not think they are right in saying that we have been personal against them.  They happen to be people who we are calling in and who feel very strongly about it.  Inevitably, we have to ask them questions and make comments on their behaviour because that is our job.  I do not believe, however, that there is any point in saying, point by point, that this or that is wrong.  There are so many things in it that are utter nonsense, so I see no point in treating it with anything but contempt.</p></speech>

As regards the compellability powers we are seeking - I know it is not for any named individuals - are we looking into Rehab or the entire charities sector?  About two months ago, I asked for a letter to be issued to each of the 25 other charities that have each received over &euro;5 million in funding from the HSE, to find out details about senior executive pay and related matters.  I understand from the last meeting that most, if not almost all, of those have been received.  We have not had sight of those 25 letters back yet.  It is quite possible that there might be nothing in them but it is also possible that there may be some things in those other organisations of a scale, nature or on the same lines as happened in the CRC or Rehab.  I do not know.  I would not like us to go for compellability in respect of Rehab.  We should also ascertain if, in respect of the 25 letters referred to, there are two or three for which we would like similar powers.</p><p>  We are not here because of Rehab.  We started with the section 38 hospitals and moved on to the section 39 organisations that received substantial funding for contracts for work done.  There are hundreds of them in the country, but there are at least 25 big ones from the HSE alone.  Our work does not begin and end with just two.  We are looking at the full charities sector, as Deputy O'Donnell said.  I would like to get to the end of that even if it takes a while.  We started with a lot of good work shining a light where it had never been shone before in some of these organisations.  We need to complete that task in the interests of the charities, so that public confidence can be restored in them.  Our compellability powers must include all the organisations we are potentially examining under the section 39 agreements or the 25 we have mentioned.</p> <p>I do not think we will go to all 25 organisations but we need to look at that correspondence to see whether we need to talk to any of them.</p></speech>

In respect of what we are doing, does that mean that we can ask any private company that tenders for a contract from the State and gets allocated money to come in and explain how it is spending it?

My understanding is that our job is to oversee the money the State spends.  When it has been allocated in a tender, my understanding is that it has gone outside our remit.  What happened with the CRC was obviously very necessary and what we are doing with Rehab is very necessary but I am not sure where we are and what the benefit is.  We all agree that we need to clean up the charity sector.  We are putting in place a charity board and must put in place rules concerning how accounts must be displayed and regulations concerning what people can earn and pensions.  None of this has been in place up to now.  If we go down this road, can we bring in all the solicitors, auditors and LEADER companies - everybody who receives money from the State?  Can we bring them in and ask them how they spend this money, how they pay their staff and what their pension funds are?</p></speech>

It is relative to that issue alone that we require the answers.  As soon as we get that sorted, we will conclude our report on this particular matter but we cannot conclude it because the board members who were here the last day said that they did not know the answers to a number of questions and it is still unfinished business.  If something major arises in respect of some other publicly funded body or agency, we would be interested in it but until something arises, there is no issue to investigate but there is an issue to investigate here.</p></speech>

It allows us to investigate how the public monies were spent.  In this instance, the agencies involved were wide-ranging and the money amounted to &euro;95 million.   Going back over previous committees, the National Roads Authority investigated the overspend on various road programmes.  It involved looking at how much different contractors were paid, how they were paid and the jobs they did.  That was all accounted for here in the Committee of Public Accounts so there are examples of large-scale spend of public monies being accounted for here at the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is one example but there are many more.  What we are doing here is along the same lines as the examination of accounts for Departments or agencies, which is what we must do.</p></speech>

Correspondence dated 14 April from Mr. Ray Mitchell on section 38 agencies to be noted and published.  Section 38 agencies have until 1 July 2014 to cease payment of unapproved remuneration.

It states that Rehab has received correspondence from Insight Consultants which states that Mr. Flannery has no involvement with the company and that information on payments made to Insight Consultants are commercially sensitive and will therefore not be published.  Correspondence dated 16 April from Mr. Brendan Ryan, CEO of the Courts Services, on the appointment of specialist judges of the Circuit Court to deal with insolvency cases to be noted and published.</p><p>  The next section is individual correspondence.

Correspondence received on 8 April from Dr. Br&iacute;d McGrath on the top-up payments to senior management in private schools to be noted and a copy forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills.

As part of that work, we could include the EirGrid proposal and Deputy Collins's proposal of earlier.  Separately, we could write to the Minister in the context of the legislation and ask for the review to which Deputy Fleming has referred, if members agree.

Its function is to hold the Departments to account on a regular basis and directing the time and schedule we have to that end.  I warn against extending artificially our remit to bodies that, frankly, do not come under our jurisdiction and which never have.  We should be cautious about that.  I understand the Chairman has asked the clerk to put together a note.  I, as one member, have serious reservations.  The priority for the committee is to deal with Departments and not to get sucked into areas that are secondary when it comes to the committee's jurisdiction.</p></speech>

With all due respect to Deputy Fleming and notwithstanding all the points he has made, the normal course with regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann would be that when the Department of Transport attends, members ask questions of its officials on the moneys it gives to that company.  I do not see any great need to depart from that course.</p></speech>

We can couple it with Chambers Ireland and hear about the procurement issues concering the saving and expenditure of money.  A claim has been made that we are not getting value for money from the industry.  Therefore, we need to look at that issue.  We have already agreed to do this and will do so as soon as possible.</p><p>  We have received correspondence, dated 16 April 2014, from Mr. Paul Maloney regarding information requested at a meeting on 23 January.  The correspondence is noted.</p><p>  We have received correspondence, dated 17 April 2014, from the Secretary General of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, regarding the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street.  The correspondence is noted and a copy will be forwarded to Mr. Cooney.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald raised this issue and sought a meeting to discuss it.  The clerk to the committee will examine how best this can be achieved.  We will come back to the issue.</p><p>  No. 3B.9 concerns correspondence, dated 24 April 2014, from Mr. William Treacy regarding ongoing issues with Horse Racing Ireland and the Turf Club.  No. 3B.10 concerns correspondence, dated 30 April 2014, from Dore Solicitors regarding its client Mr. Frank Flannery.  The correspondence will be noted and published.  We have already dealt with the issue.  No. 3B.11 concerns correspondence, dated 30 April 2014, from Eames Solicitors regarding its client Angela Kerins.  This correspondence will also be noted and published.</p><p>  In regard to correspondence relevant to today's meeting, 3C.1 is correspondence, dated 24 April 2014, from the Department of Social Protection regarding its briefing paper.  No. 3C.2 concerns correspondence received on 24 April from the Department regarding its anti-fraud strategy 2014-18.  No. 3C.3 concerns correspondence received on 29 April from the Department regarding its opening statement.</p><p>  Reports and statements received since our meeting on 10 April are listed.  They include reports from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Commission for Aviation Regulation, Abargrove Limited, Clonmel Greyhound Racing Company and quite a few other greyhound companies.  All of these accounts are to be noted.</p><p>  I will move to our work programme which is on screen.  The HSE has been in contact with the clerk to the committee in regard to the forthcoming  report of the special administrator of the CRC.  The administrator is finalising his work but is awaiting the 2013 audit prior to submission of his report to the director general of the HSE.  At this stage, our scheduled meeting on 15 May will come too soon.  Therefore, the meeting must be deferred until we have the report and the CRC witnesses have an opportunity to examine it in preparation for a forthcoming meeting.  It is now proposed that we bring forward the meeting on matters relating to education and leave Thursday, 22 May free.</p></speech>

It is a question of completing the 2013 audit report prior to its submission and then informing the CRC and so on of what is in contained in the report.

Around two-thirds of the expenditure was funded by the Exchequer through the Vote for Social Protection, and one third by social insurance contributions.  Chapter 16 presents a consolidated view of the expenditure funded by the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund, as well as the trends in the main categories of expenditure.  The Department has undertaken that, in future, a consolidation will be published with the appropriation account of the Vote.  This will improve the transparency and accountability about the cost of schemes.</p><p>  PRSI contributions provide the main source of income for the Social Insurance Fund.  Since 2008, the contributions received each year have been insufficient to meet the annual expenditure of the fund.  Initially, surpluses accumulated over a number of years were used to fund the deficits but since 2010, the Exchequer has met the shortfall.  This Exchequer subvention is provided through the Vote and amounted to just over &euro;2 billion in 2012.  In addition, as provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012, a sum of &euro;300 million was advanced from the Central Fund in December 2012 to meet a temporary cashflow shortfall arising from the timing of PRSI receipts.  This advance was repaid to the Central Fund before the end of 2012.  </p><p>  I have given a clear audit opinion on both the appropriation account of the Vote and the financial statements of the Social Insurance Fund.  However, I have drawn attention to a number of matters in each certificate. </p><p>  Note 6.5 of the Vote discloses four cases of possible misappropriations by staff of the Department, with a total estimated loss of &euro;1.3 million.  My audit certificate draws attention to the Department&rsquo;s response to those cases which is outlined in the Accounting Officer&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control.  The response includes the assignment of additional staff to the Department&rsquo;s internal control support unit and more rigorous monitoring by the unit of controls at local level.  The 2013 audit will examine the extent to which these enhancements have been implemented. </p><p>  In my audit certificate on the Social Insurance Fund, I have drawn attention to ongoing control deficiencies in relation to bank reconciliations and the procedures for confirming balances due to An Post.  These issues have been referred to in the audit certificates for recent years and were previously examined by the committee when it considered Chapter 39 of the 2010 report.  The statement on internal financial control for the fund outlines the actions being taken by the Department to resolve these issues.  </p><p>  The issue of the level of irregular scheme payments is referred to in the audit certificates for both accounts. Irregular scheme payments arise where welfare recipients are paid amounts to which they are not entitled or which exceed their entitlements.  Such payments can arise from administrative error by Departmental staff or from claimant error or fraud.  Fraud and error surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department potentially provides a basis for estimating the level of irregular payment.  Based on the results of the surveys, I consider that there was a material level of payment in excess of entitlement in 2012 on the Vote and on certain Social Insurance Fund schemes.  </p><p>  Chapter 17 presents the results of the latest fraud and error surveys as well as the findings of an examination of the survey process applied in the four most recent surveys.  These related to disability allowance, one-parent family payments, child benefit and jobseeker's benefit.  As well as an estimate of the overall scheme loss, these surveys now also provide an estimate of the overall net loss to the Department, which takes account of the fact that claimants found to be in receipt of excess payments on a scheme may instead be entitled to payment under a different scheme or may become a dependent on another person&rsquo;s entitlement.  The estimated net Departmental loss for three of the schemes was significant at 4.1% for disability allowance, 2.7% in the case of one-parent family and 1.6% for jobseeker's benefit.</p><p>  The fraud and error survey process is resource intensive but the results provide valuable information about the underlying level of payments in excess of entitlement and the risks associated with particular schemes.  For this reason, they should be developed and enhanced.  The examination of the survey process found that, in general, the surveys were carried out in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s procedures.  There were, however, a number of technical areas identified where improvements could be made that would improve the efficiency of the process and increase the reliability of the results. </p><p>  Chapter 18 examines the trends in recorded overpayments, as well as the level of legal action related to debt recovery.  Overpayment debt outstanding amounted to &euro;375 million at the end of 2012.  Overpayments of &euro;97 million were recorded in 2012, some of which related to excess payments spanning more than one year.  Overpayments of &euro;54 million were recovered in 2012 which represented 13% of the debt recorded for recovery.  We found that the Department&rsquo;s overpayments recording system is not effective as a debt management tool and cannot produce all the information necessary to monitor the effectiveness of debt management.  I understand that the Department expects to have a new debt management system in place before the end of this year.  </p><p>  Chapter 19 presents the results of an audit of the domiciliary care allowance scheme.  The allowance is payable to carers of children under 16 years who have a severe disability and require constant care and attention,  substantially in excess of that required by another child of the same age.  Responsibility for administration of the scheme transferred to the Department from the Health Service Executive in 2009.  Total expenditure in 2012 was &euro;102 million.  In addition, recipients of the allowance have automatic entitlement to the respite care grant resulting in associated expenditure of a further &euro;45 million.</p><p>  At April 2013, the average time taken to process an application for domiciliary care allowance was eight weeks.  Around 5,000 applications for the allowance are received each year.  For the period 2010-12, the initial decision on applications was to disallow over 60% of cases.  A high proportion of cases disallowed are appealed with around 2,100 appeals each year.  In just over 60% of the appeals cases resolved in 2012 the allowance was granted either as a result of a decision by the appeals officer or a prior revised decision by the deciding officer.</p><p>  Around 70% of the cases in payment were originally processed by the HSE.  The Department did not receive case files from the HSE for the transferred cases and has little information on the medical eligibility of those cases.  Medical review of cases is a key control in determining ongoing eligibility but no programme of reviews for those cases had been put in place.  An examination by the Department in early 2012 of a random sample of the transferred cases found that up to half could be ineligible.  Around 50% of cases put in payment by the Department and reviewed in 2010 and 2011 were also found to be no longer entitled to the allowance.  A review of the scheme policies and processes was announced in May 2012 and all medical reviews were suspended pending completion of that scheme review.</p><p>  The recommendations of the review group were brought to Government in April 2013 and their report was published.  The recommendations are set out at Annex A of the chapter.  The Department is implementing the recommended administrative changes and the policy recommendations will be considered in forthcoming budgets.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the current status of the recommendations and on the recommencement of medical reviews in domiciliary allowance cases.</p><p>  The results of an audit of the invalidity pension scheme are set out in Chapter 20.  Invalidity pension is payable to those who are incapable of work because of illness and who have sufficient social insurance contributions or credits.  In 2012, &euro;603 million was paid to around 50,000 claimants.  In 2012, there were 11,500 applications for the pension which is almost 50% more than in 2008.  Over 60% of claims decided in 2012 were either disallowed or withdrawn.  The number of appeals received doubled between 2011 and 2012 to 4,700.  Three quarters of appeal cases resolved in 2012 resulted in a revised decision.</p> <p>A person may no longer be entitled to invalidity pension if they recover the capacity to work.  Therefore, medical review of cases is a key control.  Departmental procedures require that a medical review status is assigned to all approved claims.  That status indicates whether or not the claim should be reviewed in the future and, if so, when that review should take place.</p><p> Some 5,800 or 12% of the claims in payment were found to have no review status recorded.  The Department has indicated that due to resource constraints it has not been possible to review all cases as scheduled.  The Department examined a sample of 170 cases to assess the risk of ineligibility.  At mid 2013, it estimated that approximately one in ten of the sample cases were no longer eligible for payment.  The Department indicated that it is examining ways to increase its capacity to carry out medical reviews.</p></speech>

As well as examining the Appropriation Account for the Department of Social Protection and the Social Insurance Fund statutory account for 2012, I understand that the committee wishes to examine the five chapters relevant to the Department that were in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Annual Report for 2012.  As requested, last week I provided the committee with an update on the recommendations contained in the five chapters, together with up to date expenditure figures, the provisional outturn for 2013 and estimates for 2014.</p><p> When I last appeared before this committee in July 2013, I briefed it on the three key functions of our Department - income support, activation of those of working age and control of fraud and abuse.  Our work continues on all three streams.  In seeking to realise our ambitions in each of these areas, we are mindful that this is, and will continue to be, a balance in terms of engagement with our customers and deployment of our resources.</p><p>  The Department's Customer Charter and Action Plan 2013-2015, published in 2013, sets out our commitments to delivering an excellent standard of service to all our clients.  The issue of delays in processing claims has been a cause of concern to some members of the committee.  Over the course of the past year we have worked to ensure that backlogs are cleared and that services are delivered to a high level to customers of the Department, particularly in the areas of illness and disability related payments and family income supports.  I am also pleased to report that the Department now has 44 Intreo offices in place.  These are one-stop shops for jobseekers with access to both income and employment supports.  It is planned that the full Intreo service will be rolled out to all of the Department's offices by the end of 2014, which I know will be challenging.</p><p>  The Intreo service is a new way of doing business for the Department.  The service offers employment services and supports for jobseekers and brings together income support and activation in a meaningful way for customers.  In the context of the Intreo service, we have made significant efforts to develop our relationship with employers, particularly through offering practical assistance and support in regard to the recruitment of staff from the live register.  This is an area of business that we will continue to grow and develop over the coming years.</p><p>  I will now move on to the chapters in the report.  As chapter 16 of the comptroller's annual report outlines, the Department spent &euro;20.1 billion in 2012 on welfare and employment schemes.  The comparative provisional spend for 2013 is &euro;19.6 billion and the estimate for 2014 is &euro;18.9 billion.  These figures exclude expenses incurred on the administration of the schemes which was in the order of &euro;600m in 2012.  The number of recipients of weekly payments from the Department at end 2013 was 1.47 million which was at the same level as in 2012.  This was because increased pensioner and employment support claimants balanced the fall of 40,000 in working age income support claimants.  An increase of 7,000 claimants was also recorded in the illness, disability and caring programme, mainly due to elimination of backlogs in these schemes in the period 2012-13.</p><p>  A range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is focused appropriately.  Over the past number of years, fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced.  The progress and achievements include the roll out of the public services card, PSC, which acts as a key tool in the prevention and detection of identity fraud and provides an enhanced level of assurance as to a person's identity.  To date, approximately 660,000 cards have been issued, including 140,000 PSC free travel variants; a number of legislative provisions have been introduced to strengthen the Department's capacity to tackle abuse; systematic and regular data matching exercises on both internal systems and with external agencies are ongoing; and the Department is now in a much better position to recover overpayments through increasing the contribution from persons on social welfare and by way of notice of attachment to earnings and money held in a financial institution.</p><p>  Looking to the future, the Department published its new compliance and anti-fraud strategy for 2014 to 2018 last week.  A copy of the new strategy has been provided to the committee along with my briefing paper.  A key aspect of the new strategy is the harnessing of the potential of risk analytics to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our current control activity.  This will involve the statistical analysis of large amounts of data to uncover complex patterns which will be used for predicting future risks.</p><p>  In addition, the Department's requirements in regard to debt management have evolved and expanded significantly in recent times particularly with the enhancements in debt recovery legislation.  It is now in the process of developing a new, more robust and reliable system to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department's debt management functions.  Development of the new system will enable the Department to deliver its debt management objective, which is an integral part of our overall deterrent approach.  In addition, the Department has committed to deliver the requirements in relation to debt management identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>  Chapter 19 deals with domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and I know that this support is a very important one for the parents and guardians who currently receive it in respect of some 27,400 children.  The comptroller's recommendations in regard to obtaining evidence in support of claims and the need to have a standard medical review process are accepted.  The Department is making the necessary preparations to ensure that medical eligibility and entitlement reviews recommence in Quarter 2 of 2014.  The committee will be aware that the Minister initiated a review of the operation of the DCA scheme in 2012 and the new review arrangements take cognisance of the administrative recommendations included in that report.</p><p>  In chapter 20 the comptroller recommended that medical review status should be assigned to all Invalidity pension cases and that as far as possible medical reviews should be carried out as scheduled.  The Department is conscious that there is a need to increase the numbers of medical control reviews carried out on invalidity pensioners in order to ensure that they continue to meet the medical criteria for the scheme.  The ability to achieve this is dependent on the capacity of medical assessors to carry out this control work.  The committee will be aware from the briefing I provided that the Department is continuing its efforts to increase its capacity to carry out medical reviews and that this is a particular challenge for us.  In this context and in an effort to maintain customer service levels, priority has been given to new claim assessments, reviews of new claims disallowed on medical grounds and appeals against decisions to disallow new claims.</p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the support and co-operation of all staff of the Department of Social Protection in our efforts to deliver and continually improve our services.  It is through their ongoing commitment to customer service that we have successfully implemented so many positive changes to date.  I am very happy to discuss any issues or proposals raised by the committee.</p></speech>

In this context, it does not matter whether somebody who applies for jobseeker's allowance has previously been in receipt of jobseeker's benefit.  This is part of the rights and responsibilities that now exist and which are very much built into claiming social welfare systems.  People are required to disclose their means and give such other information in relation to their circumstances to allow a decision to be made on their eligibility.  In this particular case means were not disclosed, so that information was not available to the Department or the inspector who would have assessed the eligibility of the individual.</p><p>  If the Deputy will forgive me, I will explain the context of what happened in terms of managing to establish this information.  A number of years ago we established a high-level group between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners to look at new opportunities for operational co-operation and to see if there were things that either organisation could do to assist in the work of the other.  There was some media coverage last year about the Department of Social Protection providing information on pension payments, which enabled the Revenue Commissioners to examine the tax compliance of people in receipt of those payments.  Similarly, in 2012, we received new data from the Revenue Commissioners on people who had money on deposit in financial institutions which attracted a payment of interest that certainly indicated that those deposits were substantial.  We received that information in respect of people who were in receipt of means-assessed payments from the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>Through that matching exercise we were able to focus on, identify and send for investigation cases in which it appeared means had not been disclosed to us.  This was one such case.</p></speech>

It collects PRSI through the tax system and provides the data for us that enable us to keep eligibility records and contribution histories for those who have paid PRSI.  We are also required to provide information for Revenue on payments made where they are potentially subject to tax.  We have been enhancing our ability to do this in recent years.<br />The high level group established four or five years ago set up a sub-group to see if there were other data sets we could exchange regularly.  We exchange significant data, for example, when somebody takes up employment and the employer or employee registers for tax, we receive notification of the commencement of employment which enables us to match and minimise the risk of overpayment.  We have considerably enhanced our ability internally to take that data and match it on a real-time basis across all of our means-assessed payment schemes.  Revenue holds various other data that we receive either systematically or an <i>ad hoc </i>basis.  Both organisations have to respect data protection principles and social welfare and tax law on the exchange of information.</p></speech>

There are levels of fraud which are indicators.  The fraud and error surveys to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred and which are the subject of a chapter in his report are a snapshot of what is perceived to be the level of error or fraud in a particular scheme at a particular moment.  They are designed to identify areas of risk to enable us to refine and develop our control policies to put in place new measures to try to deal with such things.  The best estimate I can give of an absolute concrete figure is the level of overpayments the Department has identified, roughly 0.5% of total expenditure across all schemes.</p></speech>

What has the Department done with its new anti-fraud strategy that is new and creates a system that will stand up to scrutiny and get results?  One has to ask whether there is room for improvement on the figure of 0.5%, or &euro;41 million out of a budget of &euro;20 billion.  What is new?</p></speech>

The Deputy is quite right; I said in my opening statement that we had to achieve a balance between customer service and ensuring it was directed at the right people.  We must keep that balance constantly in mind.  It is a question of the degree to which we process a claim speedily versus the degree of investigation.  That investigation will be informed by our risk identifiers.</p></speech>

I have given the Deputy the numbers of staff who are dedicated, whose job is control and nothing else.  Beneath this there are control sections in every local office, in all areas in which schemes have headquarters.</p> <p>We have put new measures in place - for example, new data matching so that once a claim is in payment we are actually interrogating the eligibility and the information we hold on people.  We have provided new and enhanced training for staff.  These measures are all to do with raising awareness about control and also refining the tools we use both in terms of the processing of claims in the first instance and the review and examination of claims once they are in payment.</p></speech>

It is difficult to give too much detail about them at this point.  We have provided an update on the four cases to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In one of the cases, on foot of investigation it was found that there was no evidence to support the allegation.  The four cases then became three cases.  In one case a member of staff was misappropriating - as a customer of the Department the person was claiming a benefit to which the person was no longer entitled.  In the other two cases members of staff were allegedly misappropriating funds by making payments to others that were not appropriate.</p></speech>

What is being done to prevent it happening right now?  We are discussing fraud at a time when ordinary people who are in receipt of social welfare payments are under enormous pressure.  The Department is trying to make payments to them as quickly as possible.  These individuals are often directed to their local CWOs and in many instances it is not possible to obtain payments for them.  A number of these people are very deserving of payment.  It is extremely important that there is flexibility in the system.  However, one individual has taken &euro;1 million in taxpayers' money to use for their own ends.  That person held a position of enormous responsibility and what was done has undermined the system.  The actions of the individual involved were extremely unfair to other staff who work in the Department of Social Protection, to ordinary people who are in receipt of social welfare payments and to the taxpayers whose money funds the system.  What procedures has the Department put in place to ensure that something of this nature is not happening now and that it will not occur in the future?</p></speech>

We have drawn up control checklists and requirements for officers working in the community welfare service and instituted new training for them on an ongoing basis.  Our internal control unit is now monitoring local management audit checks on a monthly basis.  In addition, quarterly compliance reports must be made to divisional managers.  The unit has completed inspections at over 23 locations and six internal control staff briefings have been held throughout the country.  Furthermore, the unit has carried out 12 reviews of community welfare services since January 2012 and while a number of areas have been identified for improvement - recommendations have been implemented in this regard - an assurance has also been given that the kind of issues identified in the cases in question are not widespread.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on activation measures, fraud and domiciliary care.</p><p>  I understand that there is only 3% activation in respect of the Gateway scheme.  I am not sure if an update is available in the context of what is currently happening with the scheme.  JobBridge has attracted mixed reviews.  Is Ms O'Donoghue in a position to indicate the number of jobs that have been created for people who went on this scheme?  What percentage of such individuals return to the live register?  There is a specific issue with T&uacute;s in that when one accepts a placement on it, one becomes an employee.  As a result, one is obliged to pay employees' PRSI.  There are people who are married with children and who are in receipt of larger social welfare payments of &euro;400 plus per week.  If they go on T&uacute;s schemes - many of them have the urge to do so when asked - they receive an additional &euro;20 per week but they actually come out with less money because they are obliged to pay the universal social charge, USC, and PRSI.  That is unfair and it would not happen if they were on community employment, CE, schemes.  Will Ms O'Donoghue comment on those points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.357" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050100015#O04200"><p>I will take the Deputy's final point first.  The application of the taxation system to individuals such as those to whom she refers is no different than it would be to people in public or private employment who are earning that amount of money.  This comes down to a decision made by Government previously in respect of PRSI and the disallowance relating thereto.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, JobBridge is an internship programme.  It is designed to give people work experience, in the first instance, and encourage employers to consider the appropriateness of creating new jobs.  An evaluation carried out by Indecon shows that progression rates from JobBridge into employment are extremely high in comparison to those which obtain in other European states.  In the region of 51% of interns move directly into employment.  After a period of five months, this increases to 61%.  Those jobs may not necessarily be with the employers with whom the people involved served their internships.  Obviously, however, the objective behind JobBridge of providing work experience has legitimate currency in the labour market.</p> <p>If one looks across Europe, that is a hugely positive outcome for JobBridge when compared with the types of internship programme that exist in other countries.</p><p> The Deputy's third question pertained to the Gateway scheme.  There is no doubt that Gateway has been much slower in terms of the Government's intention to provide for a significant number of placements.  I believe the original target in 2014 was 3,000 placements.  New arrangements now have been put in place, as well as new dialogue regarding governance of that scheme to try to remove any impediments that might have existed or any confusion regarding access to the scheme.  I am pleased to report that as of today, 177 participants are employed on the scheme and more than 250 job offers are pending.   The target we had was to have 1,200 placements by mid-year, and with those numbers, this obviously is extremely ambitious.  However, we are working hard to try to achieve that.  Obviously, it involves working with partner local authorities and trying to ensure that all the different parameters are teased out in this regard.</p></speech>

The evaluation evidence and the evidence we receive from the vast majority of participants are incredibly positive.  There has been a lot of media focus on some negative elements.  Obviously, for some interns, their experience is not great and there have been all sorts of allegations about employers.  That has been absolutely minimal.  There are regular controls and monitoring in place and there are opportunities for interns and indeed for employers who are dissatisfied with their experience to report back to us and for us to take that into account.</p></speech>

In the first instance, in applying for JobBridge employers are required to indicate what precisely they have in place and what they propose to provide by way of training and experience to the individual.  We actually have a significant programme of inspection of employment.  Moreover, we have ramped that up considerably in response to some of the suggestions in the media.  As I stated, we are satisfied that for the vast majority of residents, it has been a very successful programme.</p></speech>

As I am a tax consultant by profession, I understand the taxation system very well.  However, the Secretary General will appreciate that someone who is participating in a T&uacute;s programme is still in receipt of social welfare.  I acknowledge that he or she is working and gaining experience, but this work usually is in a community scheme.  It is very valid from a social point of view and is fantastic with regard to giving someone conference and getting activated.  However, such participants still are getting a payment from the Department of Social Protection, and this issue must be examined.  I appreciate that it is a policy issue for the Government, and the Minister will be obliged to consider it.  I am unsure whether there is a major issue in the sense of there being a large number of people on the higher level who would hit the tax and universal social charge, USC, thresholds.  With the community employment scheme, it does not come into the same-----</p></speech>

At that point, the Department took a view that electronic funds transfer, EFT, no longer would be an option for those payments that were considered to be riskier and that people would be required to take their payment through An Post.  This was particularly in the context of jobseeker payments.  Part of the reason was that there was greater assurance with regard to the presence of the individual in the country, and there was the potential for better identity checks.  The payments that go to people via EFT primarily tend to be what would be considered low-risk payments.  More often than not, they are pensions - that is, contributory State pensions - child benefit in many but not all cases, disability payments and invalidity payments.  More recently, certainly over the past five or six years, we have moved a lot of illness benefit customers into EFT on the basis that most of those people have an attachment to the workforce.  Again, it is to do with the risk of their presence or otherwise.</p></speech>

It can be done through our website and anonymous reports can be made either through the website or through a dedicated telephone line.  Some information will be sought to establish whether there may be something that must be investigated or otherwise.  The Deputy will appreciate that occasionally someone might make a report to the Department where they see someone claiming a social welfare payment who potentially is in some sort of employment, but in fact that might be allowed under the terms of the scheme.</p></speech>

Are there a lot of soft skills involved?  Is it in, and around, building confidence?  From speaking to those who have lost their job, if they do not get re-employed in the first six or 12 months their confidence hits an all-time low.  It is a big issue.</p></speech>

The Deputy may appreciate that up to about two years ago we operated on the basis of what was called an employment action plan where there was a mechanism for referral of people who presented for unemployment that after three months on the live register they were referred to F&Aacute;S at the time and consideration given to whether employment support or training was required.  That was a very blunt instrument in so far as that referral was done after three months regardless of the skills, background or experience of the individual who presented.</p><p>  What has changed in the last couple of years is that we have introduced what we call a profiling model.  This is a model that was developed with the ESRI to actually look at what are the kind of indicators of the potential for somebody to exit the live register of their own volition or what degree of support.  It is probability of exit from the live register.  It is called a PEX score.</p><p>  In 2012, we started profiling new applicants and, really, the thrust under the original Pathways to Work document and mandate that were given by Government was to try and prevent a drift into unemployment by engaging with people early and looking to identify people who needed support to a greater extent, and referring them early for such support.  What Pathways to Work did was shift the emphasis somewhat to the long-term unemployed.  I am glad to say that in the course of 2013, working with the ESRI, we have profiled the entire stock of long-term unemployed that exist on the live register and we are now engaging through the Intreo service with this cohort.  The whole thrust of that is to find out what their previous experience and vulnerabilities and needs are and to develop a personal progression plan with them that is absolutely tailored to their particular needs.  It is a combination of engaging with them, as part of a group in the first instance, to give some basic information about the process and structures and then, on a one-to-one basis, develop this plan.  Whether it is referral for soft-skills training or whether it is referral into a structured training programme, all of those opportunities exist.  Our case officers - we have substantially increased the number of case officers within the Department - have some funding available to them to allow for those kind of interventions, particularly for those who are in vulnerable situations or who need additional support over and above somebody who has, maybe, a professional background or work experience in the not-to-distant past.</p></speech>

The fact that we have been able to change the surroundings, that people have worked together and reformed the teams that they are in to support the whole Intreo process, has been a huge benefit to both sides of the service.  That will be rolled out across the entire office network by the end of this year.</p></speech>

Not everybody, who is refused, appeals, if I can put it like that.</p><p>  In terms of times for appeal, in 2012, for summary decisions, the time was 32.5 weeks.  That reduced to 27.6 weeks in 2013.  For oral hearings, it started, in 2012, at 41.4 weeks and that reduced to 34.4 weeks in 2013.  It is a significant amount of time but the Deputy will appreciate that in many instances, when there is either a request for a review or a request for appeal, there is very considerable additional evidence adduced.

As I say on each occasion, they are in a very efficient Department.  If the HSE and a few more organisations were like it, we would have a much better country.</p><p>  With regard to some of the specifics, I want to touch on a couple of different topics, the first of which is the overpayments issue.  The Department recouped &euro;70 million in overpayments in 2013.  It states in the document that its target for this year is &euro;75 million.  If somebody is owed arrears from the Department and it is spotted that there has been a previous overpayment, the sum is deducted from the arrears.  That is fine and I have seen it happen.  It is right.  Can the Department give me a figure for the value of the arrangements it has put in place?  Definitely in recent times I have encountered many cases in which the Department settled for a bit less than the 15% it was looking for.  Aside from what it actually collected in 2013, or its target, what was the value of the overpayments in respect of which the Department has arrangements in place for collection?  In other words, the Department might have an agreement with a person to take &euro;20 per week over two or three years to clear a debt.  The Department is happy with that.  If the Department does not have the figure, it should send it on.</p></speech>

The Department's system has obviously identified people who have been overpaid, for various reasons.  In the past, when the Department could collect only &euro;2 per week, it was not bothered going after it and it sat there.  I now see that when somebody is to receive a new payment, the Department checks immediately to determine whether any arrears are due.  That is fine.  I have dealt with cases of people who received overpayments, perhaps through FIS or another scheme, or perhaps because their spouses got some part-time work that would have made them ineligible.  I have seen cases where, although X thousand euro might have been due during an individual's working life, the Department waited until he or she applied for the State contributory pension before reclaiming it.  An individual might be identified by the Department as owing &euro;3,000, yet it does not recoup it until the individual hits pension age, at which time he or she is on a reduced income.  Individuals ask why the money was not taken from them by the Department when they were working and could afford it rather than when they reached 66.  One can believe what one likes about whether the overpayments were forgotten about or whether it was hoped the matter would not be noticed.  The Department waits until it receives the State pension application before taking action.</p><p>  I suggest that where the Department knows moneys are due, bearing in mind that there is now a much better exchange of information with the Revenue Commissioners, it should reclaim them during the working life of the recipient.  The recipient might be in employment, but the Department seems to wait until he or she comes to it for another payment before taking action.  The witnesses know the point I am trying to make.</p></speech>

We now have power of attachment to earnings, which we did not have previously.  The Deputy is correct that when our recovery limits were quite small, there might not have been the focus that we would have wished for.  That has obviously changed.  We now have powers of attachment and we are seeking to extend them to other State payments where they might arise.</p><p>  Second, we are now trying to eradicate and recoup overpayments at the earliest possible date so the situation described will not arise.  Unfortunately, we do not actually become aware of some of the overpayments until the recipient passes away and it becomes an estate issue for us.</p></speech>

However, one of the points is that we have better IT systems and platforms in place in relation to making our payments.  As I stated at the start of the meeting, we are now in the process of developing a new debt management and recovery system.  We will have it in place by the end of this year.  I think it will allow us to be even more efficient in getting money quicker.</p></speech>

The witnesses get the point.  I propose that money be collected a bit earlier, if possible.  If the recipient of overpayments is in employment, he might be in a position to write the cheque and pay, but he is not necessarily asked to do so.</p><p>  On the compliance and anti-fraud strategy and procurement, the Department proposes to undertake site visits, especially where contractors are working on public service projects.  Obviously, we are talking about schools.  I am on public record several times as having said several schools have been milked in my constituency.  Busloads of people were claiming social welfare outside the county and were being bussed back to the county in the afternoon where they continued to work as normal.  They showed up on a Thursday morning.  This is public information and the story has been publicly covered.  The Minister for Education and Skills announced a measure on this a while ago.  It applies to road contracts and other contracts.  Why has action been so slow?  The Department seems to have done very little on this.  It has required agitation among workers who might not have got a job on a site and also complaints to the Department through the unions or individuals.  These workers say they are registered tradesman but cannot work on a particular site.  They state they know there are people on the site who are doing the work of tradesmen but who are claiming the dole somewhere else.  It has taken a lot of shouting and screaming and complaints by people who are entitled to work on the various sites for action to be taken.  The Department has been a bit slow in that area.</p></speech>

We are doing that work.  We are not just doing it on our own behalf; we are also doing it as part of joint operations with both NERA and the Revenue Commissioners.  We have had some successes in a number of sites, but in other sites that we visited we found the workers and employers are compliant.

However, I would not underestimate the effort that will be required on the part of the Department in terms of the adjustments made to payment systems and our communication with all our customers.

At the end of 2013, we had deducted &euro;1.9 million.  Obviously, &euro;1.5 million was deducted at the end of March.  The expected deduction over the course of this year will be &euro;6 million.  The schemes from which people have asked us to make deductions are the contributory and non-contributory State pension, the widow's or surviving partner's contributory and non-contributory pension, the blind pension, the invalidity pension, one parent family payment, carer's allowance and disability allowance.  We did not extend the facility at the time to people who were in receipt of jobseeker's benefit because of the churn on the live register.</p></speech>

When the legislation relating to the local property tax was being introduced, arrangements were put in place where it could be deducted through a person's employer.  Employers are required under legislation to give a statement at the end of the year regarding the amount deducted.  There are arrangements in that legislation that specifically say that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is obliged by law to give a statement at the end of the year to people who make their payments for the local property tax from moneys received from the Department.  When it comes to the 22,971 people who pay through the Department of Social Protection and who are probably by definition people on the lowest income level, there is no requirement in the legislation for a receipt or statement to issue automatically to these people at the end of the year.</p><p>  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance some time ago relating to the cases I mentioned.  I was informed that this decision was made after consultation with the Department of Social Protection so I want to know why the 22,971 people who are paying &euro;6 million through the Department this year are the only people in Ireland who are not getting an automatic receipt for their local property tax.  I think this was bad service on the part of the Department.  It probably felt there was a cost involved and that people could request a statement of what they had paid.  That is not the point.  Everybody else gets it automatically from Revenue, their employer or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Everyone else is covered.  The Department of Social Protection was involved in the decision not to give the receipt to its customers unlike every other customer in Ireland.  The Department was not treating its customers fairly.  I would ask Ms O'Donoghue why this is the case and whether the Department would not reconsider at least giving people an annual statement because people forget.  Three or four years on, a person might die, the question of whether he or she paid the local property tax arises, people scramble around the place and there is no evidence, proof or receipt in the box or cupboard at home while a receipt or at least an annual statement is issued for every other payment of the local property tax.  Could Ms O'Donoghue comment on that because I have felt that it is unfair and have said that I would raise it with her?</p></speech>

We did so on the basis that our understanding was that all communications with the individuals involved would be done by Revenue.  We have no direct communication with the customers involved.  All of the customer communication is with Revenue and we operate on instructions from Revenue.  It is a different arrangement than perhaps exists for others because we are paying people on a weekly basis.</p></speech>

This is not something Revenue came up with.  The section in the legislation specifically states that people will receive an automatic receipt from employers or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but the Department of Social Protection is excluded from that section.  It is included in the other section setting out where these payments can be made through but it is specifically omitted from the section relating to the receipt.  Ms O'Donoghue just told me that most of these people are on State pensions.  They are old age pensioners aged between 70, 80 and 90.  Ms O'Donoghue has said that they are people on blind pensions.  The Department is an agent but it is coming through it.  The employer is an agent for Revenue but it is obliged to give a receipt.</p></speech>

Could Ms O'Donoghue give us the lowest rate for rent supplement for a single person?  As she knows, rents are increasing.  Does she have any concerns that the reduction in rent supplement is increasing homelessness to some level?  I know it must be controlled but we have crossed the tipping point where cutting it was right to keep landlords in check.  People now cannot afford rent, particularly single people on a reduced jobseeker's allowance.</p> <p>It is contributing to homelessness and we hear about cases on a daily basis.  I am not referring to some of the contrived cases that often receive publicity - every Deputy knows the difference - but to genuine cases.</p></speech>

It has not been designed to meet an individual's long-term housing needs.  There is no doubt that particular difficulties arise in certain areas of the country, but these difficulties have more to do with the supply of housing than the level of rent supplement provided.  At one stage the Department was heavily criticised for the level of rent supplement in that it was driving rents and playing a disproportionate role in the rental market.  Approximately 78,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement, which shows that it is at least working in these cases.  There is no doubt, however, that in particular areas of the country supply is a huge issue.  I am not sure that increasing rent supplement would necessarily address the issue.  It would possibly drive rents upwards in these areas.  The supplement is reviewed on a regular basis.  It was last reviewed in the middle of 2013 and the current arrangements are scheduled to remain in place until the end of this year.  We are aware of the particular difficulties that arise.  There is very limited discretion in regard to circumstances where particular vulnerabilities present.</p></speech>

Ms O'Donoghue probably does not have the relevant information to hand, but I will indicate the figures that I would like her to supply.</p><p>  There has been a reduction in the standardised maternity benefit payment.  It goes without saying the individuals affected are female.  Perhaps Ms O'Donoghue might outline the numbers and amounts involved in respect of the reductions in child benefit since 2012 and how many recipients of this payment were male.  I imagine 80% to 90% of recipients of the one parent family payment are probably female, but Ms O'Donoghue might give us the actual figure.  The one parent family payment was reduced in two respects.  The age of qualifying children has changed, which means that fewer people will qualify for the payment.  I ask for a breakdown between males and females in this regard.  The inclusion of the age of the youngest child in the equation also has a knock-on effect in that some people are not eligible for the one parent family payment, depending on the age of their children, and they are transferring to jobseeker's allowance.  I encountered several cases last summer where the income disregard for the one parent family payment was higher than the income disregard for jobseeker's allowance.  I estimated that some people had lost &euro;50 per week just by changing the title of their payments.  I understand a transition arrangement was put in place, but I ask for a breakdown of the figures, including the numbers of males and females.  The carer's respite grant was cut from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,300.  Most of the carers I know are female.  I ask how many males and females are in receipt of that grant.</p><p>  Changes were made recently to eligibility rules for the State pension in respect of the total number of contributions required over an individual's career and the average annual contribution.  These changes discriminate against women who left the paid workforce to do unpaid work.  I ask Ms O'Donoghue for an estimate of the numbers of males and females affected.  The only cases I have dealt with in my office involve women.</p><p>  There have also been changes to the household benefits package, including the telephone and fuel allowances.  As women live longer, there are more older women and widows in society.  More power to the women present for having a longer life expectancy than the Chairman or I might have.  However, I will not get into that debate.  All of the aforementioned changes have affected women more than men.  </p><p>  In respect of each of the budgets and the options for changes and impact assessments - I am leaving aside policy decisions - were gender proofing exercises conducted on these changes?  If such exercises were conducted, can we have the relevant documents?  I do not know what to say to the witnesses if gender proofing was not used in assessing the impact of cuts on different groups.  I presume these changes could have not been made in the absence of some proofing of their impacts.  I was surprised that most of the people who had come to me to complain about budgets and cuts in the Department of Social Protection were women.  Other cuts apply to men, but I am singling out the aforementioned areas.</p></speech>

Significant changes have been made to the structure of social welfare payments in recent years.  They include significant changes to the means assessments and income criteria.  In many cases, this involves standardising, but, obviously, these are decisions that Governments take in moving towards a common platform.  Similar changes have been made to the farm assist payment, in respect of which the majority of claimants are men.</p></speech>

We are not recovering 15% in all instances because a deciding officer has discretion.  While we seek to recover 15%, if the circumstances of the individual are such that it would cause great hardship, the deciding officer can come to a different arrangement.</p></speech>

The attachments facility has had a twofold impact.  The fact that we have the facility to attach, whether to bank accounts or earnings, has been very significant and it is a power of influence over people to come to voluntary arrangements with us.  In some instances, the fact that we said we had this power and would use it has encouraged people to come to an arrangement that has stopped short of our putting it in place.  There are cases in which we are in the process of putting attachment orders in place.  So far this year, 57 cases suitable for attachments have been referred for consideration in the Department and engagement is happening in most of these cases.  Final demands have issued in only 12 of these cases, ten for attachment of earnings and two for attachment to amounts held in financial institutions.  In six of the 12 cases people have begun to repay their debts or approached us with acceptable payments to do so.  In the other six we are moving to the next stage of putting the attachment procedures in place.</p></speech>

Illness benefit is a short-term, contribution-based payment for people in work who are ill.  As it originally had no particular term, one could have been in receipt of illness benefit for multiple years.  The scheme was changed and the first impact was felt in 2011.  The length of time for which one could receive illness benefit was limited to two years.  Many people who might have stayed on the payment were no longer eligible and the next progression was to invalidity pension.</p></speech>

We issue the card only to adults, not to those under 18 years.  With such numbers, it goes way beyond the customer base of the Department.

There are 15 cases in which we have definitively identified the fraudulent use of identity for claiming.  This has generated savings of several million euro for the Department already; it is an instant tool.  When somebody comes in to claim and his or her photograph is taken for a public service card, that photograph is compared almost in real time with what is contained in the Department's existing database of photographs and it identifies potential matches.</p> <p>Where potential matches are identified, they are eyeballed to ensure we are looking at the same person or whatever and then referred to investigation if necessary.  As I said, there are 15 cases where there was suspected fraud and where we have been able to investigate, cease claims and generate savings for the Department.</p></speech>

A further 3% increase was projected for 2013.  I would like to shift to something in which the Department is involved intimately, that is, the Waterford Crystal pensions issue.  Rather than outline the background, of which Ms O'Donoghue will be aware, perhaps she could outline the Department's involvement in this and the current position when it comes to dealing with those representing the workers.  The High Court has set a date in the autumn.  Many people, including me, are unhappy about that because this has dragged on a long time but perhaps Ms O'Donoghue can address the current position, the Department's involvement and, broadly, the issue of under funded pension funds in the State.  What is of interest to me is how we got to this position, how the massive under funding of the Waterford Crystal pension scheme was allowed to happen, how we will deal with the numerous other under funded pension schemes that are discussed regularly, which probably amount to billions of euro, and how we deal with the governance of these schemes, for example, how the trustees acted and so on.  It is a significant issue.</p></speech>

Workers, therefore, were caught by a double insolvency and the question arose in respect of the State's liability to protect their pension rights in that instance.  The court made findings that the State had an obligation and had failed in its obligation in regard to a particular directive to establish a rate at which such protection could be offered.  In terms of how that would be addressed, legislation was passed last year to address the gap that was identified by Europe.  The mechanism is now in place in terms of future proofing to ensure there is some protection for workers but, obviously, a number of companies, including Waterford Crystal, are caught in that gap between the directive and last year's legislation.  Given that it is the subject of a court case, I cannot comment on it except to say the court case is ongoing but the predominant group is the workers n the Waterford Crystal case.  A small number of other schemes are in the same situation with a much smaller number of workers.</p></speech>

It has been dragged out for too long and there needs to be some resolution regarding this scheme, notwithstanding the massive issue of under funded pension schemes.  Has the Department examined the governance of the Waterford Crystal pension scheme and how that hole came to be in the first place?  Has this been investigated?</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 5 arise from the renumbering caused by amendment No. 7 while amendment No. 6 is a drafting amendment to bring it into line with amendment No. 7.<br />The purpose of amendments Nos. 6 and 7 is to introduce an explicit public interest consideration where the Minister is making regulations in relation to the following matters: adding to the list of authorised disclosees as per the definition of authorised disclosee in section 2(1); adding to the list of specified persons as per the definition of specified person in section 2(1); adding to the health related purposes in secondary purposes for which the individual health identifier, IHI, and the related identifying particulars can be processed as per the substantive amendment, amendment No. 4, to paragraph (g) of secondary purposes; restricting access to the information in the individual health identifier register as per the substantive amendment, amendment No. 10, to section 10; and restricting the disclosure by specified persons of information in the register to other specified persons and authorised disclosees as well as limiting the secondary purposes for which such information might be used by authorised disclosees.  This relates to substantive amendment No. 11 to section 11.<br />In determining the public interest, the Minister is required to have due regard to protecting the privacy of individuals and securing the effective achievement of one or more than one relevant purpose.  I should add, for completeness, that in all the above cases, any such regulations will also be subject to consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.607" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014050100003#D01300"><p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote><br />In page 10, to delete lines 19 and 20 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(d) the carrying out of health research that is the subject of a research ethics approval (or any cognate expression) under an enactment or European act prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph,&rdquo;.</blockquote>The Bill provides that the IHI and its related identifying particulars - called relevant information, individual, in the Bill - can be used for relevant purposes, that is, primary and secondary purposes.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 relate to a better focusing of the secondary purposes in the Bill.  Consequently, I propose to take them together.<br />Currently, in the Bill, one of the permitted secondary purposes as per paragraph (d) of the definition of secondary purposes is the carrying out of health research that is governed by an enactment or a European Act prescribed for the purposes of that paragraph.  Consistent with the objective of focusing the use of the IHI and its dataset, the intention had been that the provision should cover research that had been the subject of research ethics approval under national or EU law, for example, clinical trials or clinical investigations into medical products and medical devices.  In addition, in the future, paragraph (d) was also intended to encompass other health research that would come through the voluntary but governed research ethics approval arrangements to be provided for in the proposed Health Information Bill.<br />However, the legal view was that the wording was too broad to achieve the intended objective.  Hence, amendment No. 3<b></b>makes explicit reference to the carrying out of health<b></b>research that is the subject of a research ethics approval, or any cognate expression, under an enactment or European Act where the Minister has prescribed that enactment or European Act for the purposes of paragraph (d).  Amendment No. 4 relates to paragraph (g) of the definition of secondary purposes which currently refers to &quot;any processing of personal data that is in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003&quot;.  Paragraph (g) is potentially very broad and could allow the use of the IHI and the disclosure of identifying particulars beyond what is intended.<br />Again, consistent with our desire to control and limit the use of the IHI and its dataset, it is proposed to replace the existing paragraph (g) with a more specific provision allowing the processing of the IHI and its dataset under the Bill where required to protect or prevent injury or other damage to the health or safety of an individual; where required under the law or by order of a court; where the processing is in accordance with the Data Protection Acts; and where required for the purposes of obtaining legal advice, the purposes of legal proceeding or the purposes of, or in the course of, alternative dispute resolution procedures.<br />In recognition that some flexibility may be desirable, the Minister will be able to prescribe other health related processing of the IHI and its identifying particulars not already covered under secondary purposes should experience show that to be necessary.  This would only be done where, as per amendment No. 7, the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so and he or she has also consulted the Data Protection Commissioner.  Both amendments Nos. 3 and 4 have been positively discussed with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></speech>

This is not a criticism of the Parliamentary Counsel, as I have been a Member of the House for a while and I understand the legalese that is necessary in the preparation of legislation and the explanatory memorandum, but I found the explanatory memorandum heavy work in this instance.</p> <p>Perhaps the Parliamentary Counsel will appreciate my remarks and revisit it.</p><p> Can the Minister, in his own words, give an assurance about the full implications of the passage of the Bill?  For instance, it was my initial understanding that we were dealing with individual identifier numbers that would assist patients in their dealings with GPs and GP referrals to hospitals, hospital accident and emergency departments, etc.  Also, it would ensure people would have immediate access to the full facts on any one of us.</p><p> There is also the issue of the gathering of statistics and building files on individual citizens which we must tease out here.  There is some concern among people and, naturally, they have had an initial reaction to that type of further oversight and information gathering.  All of us need to be in a position to assure them - if we support the passage of the legislation - that the provision is first and foremost in the interest of the individual citizen.  </p><p> I listened to what the Minister had to say and acknowledge that his explanation went some way to clarifying the matter but I ask him to expand on it.  Are there sufficient safeguards in place to protect the personal data of citizens?  Colleagues have raised the question with me.  </p><p> Amendment No. 3 covers the carrying out of research and suggests that private concerns which carry out research, such as research institutes and pharmaceutical companies, would have access to a person's personal data.  Can the Minister answer my question and give an assurance which we can relay?  Can he assure us that people's personal data will not be utilised except in their primary interest and the interest of the most successful management of all their healthcare needs, which is the primary focus and intent of the legislation.</p></speech>

There is a need for information to be shared by agencies and Departments.  However, it is the utilisation of the data that has exercised some people and, rightly or wrongly, they are concerned about the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-01a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014050100004#E00300"><p>I appreciate what the Deputy and Chairman have said.  I, too, have a concern about the matter which I have been very clear about and that is why we ran it by the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p>  I do not want to mention names but recently we had a very sad case concerning somebody who passed away.  People will know who I am talking about.  It has turned out that 113 people listed with the primary care reimbursement service share the same name.  There would not have been the same amount of hassle over the individual's medical care if she had a health identifier because the service would have known straightaway who she was and whatever.  An identifier number can remove many of the problems that people encounter and will be hugely important.  It is also a patient safety issue.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out, it is important for one to be able to look at the right file for each person.  It is the nature of any country that areas have people who share a name because families spread out.  This leads to confusion so correct identification is critically important.  For example, Toomevara is home to the O'Mara surname.  In other words, a lot of O'Maras live in the region and, therefore, an individual health identifier will greatly help to identify people.  This is also a patient safety issue.</p><p>  With regard the gathering of information, the patient's name, address and date of birth will be the only information on the individual health identifier register.  It simply identifies particulars.  There is no medical information and researchers will find little of value to them on the register. </p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the specific issue about private companies and pharmaceutical companies.  The law, as it stands, will not change the right to access information and it is very clear about the ethics associated with research.  Those laws will still pertain and the Data Commissioner will be very much involved.  There will be no clinical data on the register and it will only deal with identification issues.  It does not provide any rights on the usage of patient information not currently enjoyed under the legislation on data protection.  It is important to clarify that the Bill will introduce a framework for using the individual health identifier number but it does not change the existing law on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of personal health data, or the creation of medical record databases.</p><p>  The processing of personal health data continues to be governed by the Data Protection Acts.  The Bill has been fully discussed with the Data Protection Commissioner and is designed to ensure that individual health identifiers are associated with an individual's medical records and related medical correspondence.  This will help ensure that the individual can be uniquely and quickly identified during each engagement with the health system thus leading to better care and safety.</p><p>  That is the official note, but I have already said in my own words that this is about patient safety.  There is no data on the register other than identifying data; there is no medical data whatsoever.  People are right to be concerned about the matter.  I support their concerns and they are supported in the Bill.  The failure in other jurisdictions has been the idea that Big Brother can access an individual's information.  That is not the case here because we have an identifier which simply identifies a person and nothing else. </p><p>  I am aware about the controversy in England over the national record database belonging to the NHS, the use to which the data can be put to and the persons to whom the data can be disclosed.  This Bill is not about such databases.  The only national register to be created by the Bill are the registers to hold individual health identifiers, the providers' identifiers and related identifying particulars such as name, address, etc.  It is specifically provided in the Bill that the identifying particulars on an individual's IHI cannot contain clinical data on the individual.  I hope that I have made the issues very clear.  </p><p>  Further, the persons who can access the register, the purposes for which they can access the register and use the individual health identifier, and the identifying particulars in the register, are set out fully in the Bill, as indeed are the persons to whom they can disclose such information.  Therefore, I believe that there is adequate and clear protection for people.  They do not have to worry about their medical information being available on the register because no clinical data will be held on the register.</p></speech>

I do not doubt what he has assured me to be the case.  Like him, I must confidently assuage people's fears and, therefore, ask him the following again.  The Minister's amendment No. 3 is a substitute for an almost two-line provision that already exists on page 10 which states: "[T]he carrying out of health research that is the subject of a research ethics approval ... under an enactment or European act prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph."  He has told me that the clinical data will not be accessible to those who are not the intended accessors to our individual needs.  How can anything other than the information be of value in "the carrying out of health research" as provided for in his amendment?  I am a little stumped by the amendment and did not purposely intend to labour the issue.  Today's meeting is the appropriate opportunity to get as much clarity as we possible can.  The Minister has acknowledged that he shares my concerns and that of Deputy Buttimer.  Will he consider any other provision, amendment or strengthening mechanism that would give a greater assurance to public concern about this area?  I do not doubt his intent which he explained.</p> <p> The Minister has read the official note.  It would be remiss of me if I did not focus on the fact that we are providing for access for health research purposes and without the clinical data I am at a loss to understand how that could be of any specific assistance.  I am sure there is an answer.   As it is not just for me, but for every citizen I ask the Minister to come back to it again.</p></speech>

I do not believe for one moment that the Deputy is being difficult.  I appreciate that he has a duty of care to the people who elected him to reassure them and I am delighted to have the opportunity to do so for the people who elected me.  The only value in this from a researcher's point of view would be to be assured they have the right person's clinical data which they could not get unless they already had consent from the person concerned.  That is the only way I see this being of any value to them, where they can be absolutely assured that this clinical data relates to a particular person.  It does not change anything under the law on research.  The current pieces of research that are ongoing, which people have a right to, is all based on the premise of having the consent of the person concerned and that does not change in any way.  Therefore, the only value this would have from a researcher's point of view is a further reassurance that they have the right person's information, that they are not looking at somebody else's information.  Let us call a spade a spade, we have had mix-ups in people's files in the past.  Who is to know, when one goes back, what one is looking at.  The system is only a further protection in many respects and it is only of value from a researcher's point of view in reassuring them.  I have the list of what is on the register - name, address, forename, date of birth, place of birth, gender, all former  surnames, mother's surname, address, nationality, personal public service number, date of birth in the case of a deceased individual, signature, photograph, and any other particulars prescribed, excluding clinical information.  It is really only an extra layer of reassurance for research purposes but from the clinical patient point of view this is hugely important for a whole host of reasons that we have already mentioned.</p></speech>

This is not my stand-alone concern, there is always a body of concern in respect of this type of provision.  I ask the Minister and his officials to look at this again to consider if there is anything further they can do in the intervening period until Report Stage.  I cannot present a formula off the top of my head.  Let me take a look at this to see if there is anything further that can be done that would assuage any concerns in this regard.  I offer that comment only to assuage any other fears outside this room.</p></speech>

My officials will certainly look at it again but I think they have closed it off.  I reiterate that just because one gets approval to look at the individual health identifiers one still needs the patients' consent to use their medical data.  There is no medical data on individual health identifiers register; it is purely an identification register.  We will continue to examine the issue to see if we can improve the Bill and improve people's sense of privacy.</p></speech>

However, the reality is that while the provision of this particular subsection states that the individual health identifier shall not be regarded  as indicating entitlement to health services, there is a lack of clarity in the overall body of health legislation about what exactly we are entitled to.<br />The Minister will recall sitting in this committee room as his party's spokesperson on health during a long period when we both, with our Labour Party counterpart, persistently challenged the former Government on eligibility for health and personal social services Bill, long promised by previous governments, each of which was Fianna F&aacute;il led.  Eventually the Bill disappeared.  It was supposed to clarify and update the provisions relating to eligibility to health and personal social services.  We have no such legislative provision.  Section 5(3) provides that even if one has a health identifier number, that does not of itself mean one has any particular entitlements.  I am concerned about that. <b></b>I would have expected that legislation along the lines of this Bill would, at the very least, not have stated that it does not provide one with, but might have confirmed, some degree of entitlement.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.<br />I believe that this subsection should be deleted.  I do not want to offer the Minister the answer that I anticipate he will give me.  We need some statement of explicit entitlement in law.  I figure that this particular bold statement, that while one has an individual identifier number it does not give one an entitlement, is unnecessary and unfortunate in this instance.  I wish to press the amendment but I am anxious to hear the Minister's response.</p></speech>

It is purely and simply an identifier, nothing else, and it is critically important to be clear on that point.  The other issue that has been raised is for another day.  The purpose of this Health Identifiers Bill is to put in place a legislative framework for the individual health identifiers.  This is primarily a patient safety issue as I have already said.  Eligibility for health services is a separate issue and is provided for in other legislation.   Any requirement to consider entitlements or eligibility in advance of assigning an IHI could potentially delay assignment and, therefore, compromise patient safety.</p><p>  We must also bear in mind that the IHI is an identifier which will apply throughout the health service, public and private.  Further, an IHI can also be assigned to anyone receiving a health service, whether or not the person is ordinarily resident in the State.  The Irish health services regularly provide treatments, etc., to, for example, tourists on whom we would not want to confer rights to longer term care.</p> <p>Nevertheless, assignment of the identifier would be an important element in ensuring their safety as patients while in this jurisdiction receiving care.</p><p> I am afraid I cannot accept amendment No. 8 because the purpose of the Bill and the intended use of the individual health identifier throughout the health service is for one purpose and one purpose only, that is, patient safety and to identify the patient, not to confer rights or entitlements.</p></speech>

I seek to change the word &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;.  Section 5(4)(a) states: &quot;The Minister may put in place measures, or cause to be put in place measures, that the Minister considers appropriate to assist in enabling an individual&rsquo;s individual health identifier to be made known to him or her...&quot;.  I am unsure why the amendment as it appears in the amendment list has &quot;know&quot; and &quot;know&quot; rather than &quot;known&quot; and &quot;known&quot;.  I hope it was not my typographical error in submitting it, but my amendment should read &quot;known&quot; and &quot;known&quot;.<br />The key change is that we move from &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;.  I believe it should be done and that each individual should know his individual health identifier.  That is critical.  I hope that the change is self-evident and that the Minister will accept it because the knowledge of our respective numbers is crucial.  I can envisage situations where that knowledge would be critical in a raft of settings.  I urge the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 9 on that basis.</p></speech>

It removes from me the right to put in place provisions to inform people of their individual health identifier and makes it an obligation upon me that everyone would have to be informed.  This would have major cost implications and it might also compromise the privacy of the system.</p><p>  I have no issue with the principle of what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is suggesting in terms of the right of people to know their IHI.  That is an absolute given.  However, to put the onus on us to ensure that everyone knows their IHI - people may not wish to know, may not need to know or may not be interested in knowing - would put additional costs upon the State which I do not believe are warranted at this juncture, especially given that we are still struggling to continue our economic recovery.  Putting on additional expenses at this point would not appear to be wise.</p><p>  I understand fully where the Deputy is coming from and I have no issue with it in principle in any way.  It is an absolute right that people will have to know their IHI and they will be able to find it out easily if they wish to know.  However, to put an onus on the State to write or communicate to everyone along with all the associated privacy and security issues would be quite expensive and I do not believe it is warranted.</p><p>  Health care providers can make available to a patient his IHI should the patient want it.  Indeed, the optimum way to convey the IHI to a person is in the health care setting, where health care workers can verify the person's identity and take the opportunity to explain the uses and value of the IHI.  It is also important to note that the Bill explicitly provides in section 11 that no one will be denied a health service to which he or she is otherwise entitled simply because they do not know their IHI, do not have an IHI or have no wish to provide their IHI or identifying particulars.</p><p>  This is purely a register.  It does not confer any rights or take away any rights.  Let us be clear: there is no intention in any way to discourage or prevent interested persons from being advised of their IHI.  If there are difficulties then the Minister can invoke section 5(4)(a) and introduce measures to deal directly with the specifics of any problems to enable persons to obtain their IHIs.  The approach in the Bill is the most appropriate.  While I appreciate the Deputy's objective, I will not be accepting his amendment on this occasion.</p></speech>

How do we intend to disseminate the information in respect of the individual's identifier?  We will be holding it on a register.  Presumably, the general practitioner network will need to know although I am unsure about other areas like hospital access and other health care providers.  How do we undertake to disseminate the information?  The individual health identifier will not only apply to those who are medical card holders, for example.  What about citizens outside the medical card register that is readily to hand?  On what basis would the Minister proceed to allocate individual numbers?  How will the Minister feed it into the system, because the system must have our respective numbers if it is to serve the purpose that the Bill intends?</p><p>  I am at a loss in my own simple way to try to understand the out-working of this.  I had thought just as people have their medical card number on a little card or their personal public service number if they are social protection recipients that we would each have some personal advice of our respective numbers.  Given the information that has been shared with me, I am unable to understand at this point how we are going to get the optimum return from this legislation and its intent without the widest possible knowledge of the IHIs.  I am willing to accept and I fully understand the cost factor and the challenge of undertaking the dissemination of this information.  However, surely my proposal is the only way we can guarantee the most successful return from the entire exercise.</p></speech>

If a person does not have an IHI it can be organised there and then to give him a number.  It is not intended that people would have a card.  Anyone can get his IHI from the HSE or its successor if he so wishes.</p><p>  There is another issue around mailing material.  We all know that people are mobile now.  We could have situations whereby people have moved house.  If we had a mailing campaign then we would be addressing letters that could be opened by others now at a given address and the intended person may have moved on.</p> <p> In short, it is clear that each provider will have access to the register and will be able to organise an individual health indicator number.  A classic case of where this could arise is in the case of tourists.  We are very fortunate to have a thriving tourist industry in this country, but tourists sometimes get ill and need to be looked after.  The provider will give them an IHI.  It is not a massive job to organise that and it is provided for here.</p></speech>

However, unless the IHI system is operating on an international basis, their health history will not be accessible on our database.  I presume the information we are talking about here in regard to health histories is part of what is retained and is accessible.  If I present at a hospital emergency department, for example, will staff be able to access information regarding my personal health issues, allergies, current medications and so on?  I understood that was the key information and is separate from the first line of information to which the Minister referred and which I understand does not refer to the clinical aspect.  Surely the type of information I am talking about is at a further remove and can only be accessed by those with the relevant codes and approvals?</p><p>  If I have got the wrong end of the stick here, I hope the Minister will help me out.  We will not realise the full value of this system unless there is the widest possible range of data.  I accept the point about people moving and personal details, but that is a risk factor with nearly every type of information that is disseminated today, either by Government agencies or the private sector in respect of PINs and so on.  What other way is there to do it?  I genuinely wish the project well because it is a good idea, and I am happy to have clarification from the Minister if I have formed the wrong idea of what he is about here.  However, in so far as my understanding of the purpose and intent of the Bill is correct, I want to see this initiative being as successful as possible, in which case I am arguing that "may" should become "shall".</p></speech>

The IHI is simply a method of identification, nothing else.  Health service providers can access the IHI register to give a person his or her IHI.  The full value of the new system will be reached when we have e-health rolled out right across the system in a coherent and connected fashion, which is not the case at the moment.  I was horrified to learn that not only were there 11 different systems in place under the former health boards which could not talk to each other, but something like 1,700 different software packages were in use throughout the system at one point.</p></speech>

The point, however, is that it is not ultimately about the number of systems but the degree of connectivity between them and having a portal through which they can all interact.  This is not an issue unique to Ireland.  It is a problem I discussed with the Swedish Minister only a few days ago at an EU meeting.  A coherent e-health strategy is critical from the point of view of putting more coherence into the system and also in regard to patient safety, in terms of ensuring staff have the right patient in front of them with the right information.</p><p>  I have already referred to tourism, but it is a fact that people tend to revisit this country having had a good experience here.  We like to encourage that.  It will be very easy for such people to get their IHI by informing the health service staff they encounter that they have been here before, in which case the provider will be able to find their IHI.</p></speech>

Specified persons include health professionals, their employees and agents, health organisations, their employees and agents, and also other bodies.  The potential number of specified persons is, therefore, very large.  As the section stands, access under section 10 is to all of the information in the register, that is, the IHI and identifying particulars, with no provision to allow the Minister to control or restrict access by specified persons to a lesser amount of information.    <br />As I indicated on Second Stage, it seems advisable to include a provision allowing the Minister to restrict access, as not every specified person would necessarily need access to all of the information in the IHI register in respect of an individual.  While the PPSN, for example, should be a searchable element in establishing an individual's IHI, it should not be something that is universally available to any specified person accessing the register.   Accordingly, the purpose of amendment No. 10 is to allow for the making of regulations to limit access to the information in the IHI register.  Such regulations will require consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and a public interest dimension as per amendment No. 7. <br />Amendment No. 11, which is an amendment to section 11, arises from the same principle as the amendment to section 10.  Section 11 deals, among other matters, with the processing by the Minister and specified persons of the IHI and the related identifying particulars in the IHI register, and the disclosure by them of such information to another specified person for relevant purposes or to an authorised disclosee for secondary purposes.  It is proposed to allow the possibility, through regulations, of restricting the processing or further processing by specified persons of certain information in the IHI register and the disclosure by them of such information to other specified persons for a relevant purpose.  The notion of restricted disclosure is being additionally strengthened in respect of disclosure by specified persons to authorised disclosees by providing for the possibility that it may also extend to restricting the use of such information in regard to certain secondary purposes.  Regulations made pursuant to amendment No. 11 would involve, as per amendment No. 7, consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and having regard to the public interest.</p></speech>

The purpose of section 20 is to provide that a health service provider who has been issued with a provider identifier must associate that identifier with the record of a health service provided for an individual and also use it in any relevant communication such as, for example, a referral letter from a GP to a hospital.  In that respect, the section complements section 11 which requires the IHI to be similarly applied.  This allows us to circumvent the terrible problem which sometimes arises in the context of individuals being obliged to revisit files after five or six years and not being in a position to figure out which doctor wrote what because the signatures are illegible.  On foot of this section, the provider identifier will have to be supplied and it will, therefore, be easy to determine who wrote what note and who provided particular care.<br />A policy objective behind the Bill is to avoid unnecessary duplication.  Accordingly, it provides that a health service provider who is a health practitioner already required under other legislation to use the registration number given to him or her by his or her professional regulatory body can instead use that number, rather than the provider identifier, in the record made of the health service provided and related correspondence.  Such a scenario would arise, for example, under section 43(8) of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 which provides that:<blockquote>A registered medical practitioner shall, as soon as may be after the person has received the certificate [of registration] referred to in subsection (5), cause the registration number stated on that certificate to be included on all medical prescriptions and all other documentation and records, whether in paper or electronic format, relating to that practitioner&rsquo;s practice as a registered medical practitioner.</blockquote></p></speech>
