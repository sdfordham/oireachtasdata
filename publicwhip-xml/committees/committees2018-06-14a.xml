    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018061400002#C00200"><p>We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy.</p> <p>  We have restructured today&rsquo;s engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland on the National Treatment Purchase Fund to deal with a matter arising out of correspondence following our meeting with the Health Service Executive and the State Claims Agency.  We have asked representatives from the HSE and the State Claims Agency back to explain an apparent conflict in evidence and we will deal with this matter first.  Following that, we will have a short engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland to inform our examination of the National Treatment Purchase Fund financial statements in the afternoon.  We will take other business of the committee separately at an appropriate time during the meeting.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is matters relating to CervicalCheck and evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have invited representatives from the HSE and the State Claims Agency to provide clarification in respect of a contradiction in evidence given by the two bodies to the committee at our meeting of 17 May.  As Chairman of the committee, and I know I speak for all of the members, I have to say that if information given to us is inaccurate or misleading, we regard it as a most serious matter.  Witnesses do not give evidence just to the eight or ten people in the room but to the national Parliament on the public record while representing a State organisation.  It is even more serious in this case as it relates to one of the most significant health issues we have experienced in many years.  If we suspect that any witness has failed to provide accurate information to us, we will engage with him or her again until we are satisfied that we have obtained clear and correct information.</p> <p>  We are joined today from the HSE by Mr. John Connaghan, director general, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, national director of strategic transformation and planning, Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck, Mr. Paul Connors, national director of communications, and Mr. Damien McCallion, national director of the national screening service.  We are joined from the State Claims Agency by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director, Mr. Pat Kirwan, executive head of business development, Ms. Jenny Foley, solicitor and clinical claims manager, and Dr. Cathal O&rsquo;Keeffe, head of clinical risk.  We also have Ms Celeste O'Callaghan and Ms Mary Jackson from the Department of Health.  We did ask the State Claims Agency for its legal representatives to be present but we received correspondence - No. 1376 - from Mr. Breen explaining why they are not here today.  He might elaborate on this during the course of the meeting.  I understand Mr. Breen is fully informed and in a position to answer all questions that would have been directed to the agency's legal representatives in any event.</p> <p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be completely switched off or placed on aeroplane mode.</p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p> <p>  The committee was given clear views at the previous meeting but the matter of clarification has been mentioned.  If something on the record is not correct, we want the record corrected.  Clarification, expansion, further explanations and more information are not the issue.  If information on the public record is not exactly right, the record must be corrected.  If inaccurate information has been placed on the record, the committee will require an apology because this is the record of the national Parliament.  Talking around the issue or expanding on it will not deal with the inaccurate information on the public record.  I make this point clearly because witnesses often believe that if they expand on statements made at a previous meeting, it will explain the context.  However, if the record is not correct, it must be corrected and appropriate action must be taken by the relevant witnesses.</p> <p>  I will set out what happened regarding our previous meeting with representatives of the Health Service Executive.  The committee received a letter from the State Claims Agency after the meeting stating Mr. Gleeson's assertion did not accord with the facts.</p></speech>

What is really troubling before we even start, and I say this to all public bodies, is that when the witnesses left the room they may have been in doubt about whether what was said was accurate.  The HSE should have reverted to us with a statement setting out the exact position and clearing up any confusion that arose.</p><p>Representatives of the HSE would not even be here today if the State Claims Agency had not written to us.  If it had not written to us, we would not know we had not been given fair evidence with full candour.  If representatives of public bodies ever leave the committee room, go back to their offices and think that perhaps they did not explain a particular point, they should write to us and correct the record straight away rather than leaving us to pick it up from a third party.  I think the witnesses understand that general principle.  I say it to all representatives of public bodies who appear before the Committee of Pubic Accounts.  </p><p> At the meeting of 17 May, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked questions about who in the HSE, CervicalCheck and the State Claims Agency attended various meetings or spoke with people.  People watching proceedings will not remember that particular exchange.  We will ask the communications unit to play an extract of the meeting on screen so people will remember the precise issue we are talking about.  </p></speech>

The witnesses will understand that we left the room with a clear impression.  We want the record corrected with regard to this matter.  The public expects that when senior Department officials and officials from State agencies attend here there is a level of truthfulness and candour.  We are entitled to believe it.  We accept all the evidence we get in good faith.  It is a source of major concern to us when we are alerted by somebody else that the evidence given may not have been accurate.  That is why we have a duty, not only in this case but in cases involving all witnesses who come in here from week to week, to make sure evidence is accurate.  If it is not accurate, witnesses should come back to us as quickly as possible and correct the record.  That did not happen in this case.  That is why we are here today.  It adds to an issue involving delayed information and women not being informed when the national Parliament is not adequately informed.  It gives a very bad impression of how the HSE is dealing with the issue.  It is Mr. Connaghan's responsibility to take that forward.</p> <p>  At this stage, Mr. Connaghan wants to make a short statement, followed by Mr. Gleeson.  Deputy O'Brien will then be the first speaker for ten minutes.  We are doing ten-minute slots.  </p></speech>

Would that be okay?  It would save about ten minutes.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the committee today.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Damien McCallion, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, Mr. John Gleeson and Mr. Paul Connors.  I will begin by setting out some points regarding the issues of concern about the evidence given by the HSE to the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts held on 17 May and further concerns raised by the committee at its meeting of 31 May.  I reassure members of the committee that as director general I fully understand the obligation placed on me to provide any information requested, to act with integrity and to be accountable, open, honest and transparent in evidence provided to this or another committee of the Oireachtas.  My colleagues are also aware of these obligations and have and will fully comply with them.</p> <p>  Before I address the specific issue of the evidence given to the committee regarding the conference call with the State Claims Agency, I will briefly update the committee on the interim report on recommendations issued by Dr. Scally last Tuesday and to bring it up to speed on the actions we have taken since the last meeting of the committee, bearing in mind that members of this committee have previously raised issues on communication, transparency, management and governance.</p><p>On Dr. Scally&rsquo;s interim report, we welcome the report and the recommendations.  In the interests of transparency, it would be my intention to not only publish any recommendations on the HSE website but to also publish our progress tracker against each of the recommendations in the final report such that the public can observe and measure progress.<br/><br/>Since the commencement of the scoping exercise, the HSE has prioritised the provision of all relevant documents to Dr Scally in a manner that is both useful and timely.  As previously advised to the committee, we have a special team in place to do this work in a manner that is both useful and timely.  This remains an ongoing process.  The HSE had a productive engagement with Dr Scally and his team yesterday morning, Wednesday, 13 June, with regard to how required documentation has been provided up to this point and how the HSE can guarantee the future management of documents to the satisfaction of Dr Scally.  The HSE has provided to Dr Scally as many of the documents as possible that have been requested by him within the timescale required.  Documents pertaining to contracting of the laboratory services have been prepared for release but in some instances require legal clearance and in others the consent of other parties prior to their release.  This was discussed with Dr. Scally at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.  We have been working intensively with our legal teams to release the laboratory contracts without compromising the terms of those contracts.  We have made a breakthrough in the past number of hours on this matter.  Consequently, we hope to be in a position to release the contracts to Dr. Scally shortly.  <br/><br/>The HSE has provided the vast majority of documents to Dr. Scally&rsquo;s team in electronic format.  Due to certain technical issues, relating to software limitations in some locations, it has not been possible to provide some documents in a searchable format.  However, a methodology is being agreed with Dr. Scally to overcome this problem in the future, which is designed to further enhance and sharpen the focus of the document searches.  This involves more specific technological interventions.As director general of the HSE, I reiterate my intention to continue to fully co-operate with Dr. Scally in the most productive manner possible to ensure that he is properly assisted in his work.<br/><br/>Turning now to the actions we have taken thus far, we have strengthened the overall management of the programme with a national director, Mr. McCallion, reporting to me as director general.  Mr. McCallion&rsquo;s role is broad in scope and will not only cover the existing task of informing and supporting the women involved but will extend after the Scally review reports to ensure all recommendations are implemented fully.  We have engaged external support as part of a records support team to ensure we fulfil the requirement to meet both legal requests and access requests for clinical records.  I ask the committee to note that in the absence of a fully computerised electronic healthcare record, this entails a manual search for records dating back, in some cases, years and potentially over a number of sites.  We are committed to meeting the standard of 30 days on access requests. <br/><br/>The committee previously voiced concern on risk management and oversight in screening.  We are in the process of establishing a risk committee, which will be chaired independently by someone from outside the screening programme, enhanced with the appointment of a chief risk officer to support the work of that committee.  The CervicalCheck programme has a quality assurance committee, which has an independent chair.  <br/><br/>Since the establishment of the helpline, we have taken more than 24,000 calls with the vast majority of these now returned.  Four support centres have been established, with 50 staff engaged to provide that support at various stages.  I ask the committee to be aware that we continue to receive calls on a daily basis, although these are reducing significantly in number.  With regard to practical support for the 209 women, each of these has an individual named person who is based in each community healthcare organisation.  For those who want to access that support, it has so far covered the provision of medical cards, home support, physiotherapy, counselling, etc.  Our job is to provide immediate support to the women affected and to ensure that is delivered with empathy and consideration. <br/><br/>We are supporting the international review panel, which is being commissioned by the Department of Health.  We have provided matching data from the national cancer registry.  We are transitioning from the CervicalCheck audit process to the audit process being developed by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  This will require a significant team to be put in place within the HSE to support this process.  We understand the Department is concluding the contract for this work and the scope of work will include all women who were part of the CervicalCheck audit and those registered with the national cancer registry. <br/><br/>Turning to the substance of today&rsquo;s meeting, at a meeting of the committee on 10 May 2018, the State Claims Agency, SCA, confirmed that it was told by CervicalCheck that all the women had been communicated with<i>.  </i>The SCA, by letter dated 22 May 2018 to the committee, confirmed the basis for this initial evidence to be a teleconference held on 20 April 2018 in which the SCA legal team of four was provided with information by Mr. John Gleeson of CervicalCheck.  This information, as<i></i>carefully noted<i></i>by the SCA legal team, was &quot;that all women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed that they had been informed by their treating clinicians&quot;<i>.  </i>The committee will be aware from my letter of 30 May that I had asked the SCA and CervicalCheck to discuss why there were two apparently contradictory statements.  My letter of 30 May accepted that the advice on the teleconference of 20 April that, &quot;All women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed that they had been informed by their treating clinicians&quot;, is correct and accepted by the SCA and CervicalCheck.  In particular, Mr. Gleeson has advised me he does not dispute the note as recorded by the SCA on the legal file as it reflects his understanding of the position regarding communication with the women at that point in time - 20 April.  With the Chairman's agreement, I will ask John Gleeson to make a short statement. </p></speech>

There was no reference to a particular meeting or exchange.  As the transcript illustrates, Mr. Connors replied to the Deputy first before, as he can explain, under the impression that the person was not in the room.  I, therefore, replied, "No" - first, because I thought there must have been another meeting between the HSE and the SCA at which I was not present and, second, because I would not have made such an unqualified statement.  In subsequent explanation and questioning by Deputy O&rsquo;Brien when he said that the person was a CervicalCheck person, I felt that he must in fact be referring to me.  The recent exchanges I had had with the SCA, including telephone calls and teleconferences, concerned a specific court case.  I did not recall the specifics of every question and answer during those exchanges but I sought to clarify on two occasions during the PAC meeting what would have been the substance of what I could have said.  As the transcript shows, what I tried to say later was that I did not think anyone from CervicalCheck could have said that because it would never have been our understanding.  Communications would have issued to the treating clinicians in respect of all women with cytology reviews and we would have believed that the clinician would have communicated with the women as appropriate.</p> <p>  In the letter provided to the PAC subsequent to that on 22 May, which I had sight of after that, the statement "All women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed they had been informed by their treating clinicians" and reference to a legal note is, I believe, consistent with what I have said, with what I intended and with the understanding shared with the SCA of what was meant in our exchanges.  I certainly did not intend to cause any confusion or lack of clarity or directness.  If that was the case, I apologise for it.</p></speech>

The meeting that has been referred to earlier, to which Mr. Breen and Mr. Connors refer, took place in March 2017.  I was at it, as were a colleague of mine and a colleague of Mr. Breen's.

That was the narrative put forward at this committee.  That was the understanding of all members when we left.</p></speech>

The witness, on 20 April, said that he told the State Claims Agency that all women had been informed or it was his assumption that all women had been informed.  However, he knew on 20 April that was not the case because he gave evidence to this committee stating that he became aware that it was not the case when the Vicky Phelan case became public knowledge.  That is what Mr. Gleeson said.  Therefore, when he had the conversation with the State Claims Agency he knew that all women had not been informed.

It is on file - I am sure the letters are here in front of me - that the HSE highlighted that the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 had not yet commenced and this was proving an obstacle to open disclosure.  The witness had to know that the section on open disclosure has still not been commenced.  The HSE put it in writing that the failure to commence Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 relating to open disclosure was an obstacle to open disclosure.  Mr. Gleeson and all senior figures in the HSE must have known that open disclosure was not fully operational because the legislation to back it up and give people protection had not yet commenced at that point.  It still has not commenced.  That correspondence was sent months ago, in January or February this year, which means Mr. Gleeson must have known there was an issue with open disclosure.  Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was designed to facilitate open disclosure.  The HSE knew Part 4 had not been implemented, yet Mr. Gleeson is hanging onto the view that open disclosure was occurring.  What was the purpose of the legislation if Mr. Gleeson believes there was 100% open disclosure?  He could not have believed that.  While I accept that he was acting in good faith in making the assumption that the women affected had been informed, it was not a valid assumption to make based on the state of his knowledge of the issue of open disclosure.  Does the witness accept that?  I am trying to understand his assumption.  I find it hard to believe that he validly arrived at that assumption.</p></speech>

This is an historical issue, and there are many historical cases.  We were aware that some women had sadly passed away and that some letters - it is a continuous process - might have gone out yesterday and appointments were being set up to talk to the women.  I was not aware of the full extent of difficulties being expressed with the open disclosure policy, alluded to by the Chair.  I am sure they came to me in time, but at the time I was not aware at that time that Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was about to be enacted to remove one of the barriers to open disclosure.  I am sure I would have learned that.</p></speech>

We find ourselves arguing about words and whether a fair assumption was made.  There are women listening to this discussion which calls to mind the argument as to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  It is not helpful to the women involved, the HSE or public confidence in the HSE's approach to this matter when there may some obfuscation involved in dealing with a particular issue.  I do not believe the assumption made at the time was valid.  Had the witness said that an hour ago it would have been helpful.  I hope Mr. Connaghan, as the new director general, observes what is going on here and understands the public concern about how the HSE is handling this issue.</p></speech>

If there is something that a witness has provided in evidence which is unclear to the committee or where the witness subsequently realises that he or she has been talking at cross-purposes with a meeting that happened a year before, it is good practice that we are more proactive in terms of writing to the committee to explain matters.</p><p>It would be good practice to be more proactive in writing to the committee to explain things.

I wish to make a comment to the acting director general of the Health Service Executive.  One of the HSE's publications is entitled Building a high quality health service for a healthier Ireland.  It refers to the values of care, compassion, trust and learning.  I wonder if people watching today who have followed the CervicalCheck scandal feel that any of those boxes have been ticked.</p> <p>  Mr. Breen referred to legal correspondence that referred to an earlier meeting.

The Vicky Phelan case had been in the public arena.  There had been debates in the D&aacute;il and there were meetings in other committees as well as this one.  I say that in regard to timing and what Mr. Breen said at this committee.</p> <p>  I cannot figure out why Mr. Breen would have been so certain that all the women had been informed or would be informed by their clinicians.  I cannot figure out why he would give us that information in the context of the meetings that we were having.</p><p>It does not make any sense.  How can we trust any information we get from the HSE when this circle cannot be squared?</p></speech>

The HSE then instituted a procedure to check whether all women had been informed, discovered that many had not, and immediately set about ensuring those women were informed.  That happened from the end of April into May and we met on 17 May-----</p></speech>

Those numbers had been ascertained between the end of April and the meeting on 17 May.  Those women were diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer from 1 September 2008.  Our knowledge was that, sadly, some of them had passed away and others were in the process.  When Deputy Murphy refers to "all women"-----</p></speech>

At the meeting on 17 May, we were told that women would be facilitated in getting their records in the context of the experience of a person going to Limerick and not being able to get her records having been raised.  We are now being told that in the absence of fully computerised electronic healthcare records, the retrieval process entails a manual search for records going back many years in some cases and potentially over a number of sites and that, although the HSE is committed to meeting the 30-day target, that does not always happen.  We understand that records may go back for a significant period and that people may wish to access their full health records but the scope of this issue is relatively narrow.  People will not look for their records because they had a broken toe when they were aged five.  Specific records are being sought.  We were given an assurance at that meeting that there would be no obstacles to the retrieval of such records but it now appears that issues are arising because the HSE does not keep records in a certain way.  Is there an obstacle to women getting their records within the 30-day timeframe?  We are being made aware of issues in that regard.</p></speech>

At that meeting I committed to putting someone in charge of that process and bringing in all necessary resources.  A number of critical cases involved people who were terminally ill and we committed to prioritising those cases such that the information would be provided in order that court deadlines could be met.  The request for access to records may come directly from women or from their solicitor, which may be by means of a freedom of information, FOI, or data access request.  All those requests are currently being met.  I am aware of one case in which an extra day will be needed and that was agreed yesterday with the woman concerned.  We are currently providing access to records in accordance with the deadline.  An issue which initially caused some problems was the volume of legal correspondence received which meant that we could not concentrate on getting the records out but, rather, had to try to deal with that correspondence in terms of acknowledgements and so on.  We have now put extra resources in place such that legal letters are acknowledged in a timely manner.  With the exception of the case that arose yesterday to which I referred and which was clarified this morning with the lady involved, we are meeting the targets for access to records.  For access requests the current target is 30 days, while for legal requests, it is meeting the deadlines for pending court cases.</p> <p>  Several steps are needed to provide the records, including the hospital records regarding the woman's cancer treatment and so on, the screening records and the associated correspondence between the hospital and the screening system.  Although some of the records are automated, all of those elements must be gathered.  We are currently achieving the deadlines for access requests and we will continue to put in whatever resources we need to achieve that.  We have put a full team in place.  We have three full-time legal people and an administrative team to which we have appointed a manager.</p></speech>

Some correspondence might still be issued via letter and that must also be provided.  The search for records could extend to a woman's hospital, which may be her colposcopy clinic, her treating hospital - those may be different institutions - the CervicalCheck screening centre in Limerick and the national screening service offices in Dublin.  That is the process through which we work and we then link with the SCA regard to legal cases to ensure that all records are provided as requested.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson is telling this committee that he was making an assumption on the basis that clinicians would have informed women.  I am saying that is not tenable because, in 2016, Mr. Gleeson wrote the memo or was part of writing a memo that gave discretion to clinicians and if the woman had passed on, the next of kin would not be informed and it would simply be noted on her file.  Mr. Gleeson's position is absolutely inconsistent because he was part of a number of people who wrote that memo that developed a strategy that women would not be informed or, at least, that they would limit the number of women who would be informed.</p></speech>

It is the context of the guidelines the HSE would have to comply with with regard to full disclosure.  It says only in exceptional circumstances based on the clinical interest of a service user, it is likely that the service user will not benefit from open disclosure, and it goes on to give reasons.  What Mr. Gleeson had in the circular that was given to clinicians was that, as a general rule of thumb, the outcome should be communicated to women.</p></speech>

The words "as appropriate" are important in this context.  If we go back to the letter that we got from Mr. Connaghan, which clarifies, after the meeting that took place between the officials: "Mr Gleeson's understanding was consistent with the record of the call.  Mr Gleeson's understanding of the communication with the women was that at the time he assumed the women had been informed by their treating physicians."  In his opening statement, he says "we would have believed that the clinician would have communicated with the women as appropriate".  The words "as appropriate" do not appear in this and that is key.  Mr. Gleeson knew that not all of them would have been informed by their treating clinicians.  I want to put this to Mr. Breen.

I appreciate Mr. Connor's directness on that.  To be fair to my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, he is the one who pursued this matter.  What worries me is that we are left with this ram-jam of a story and we will have to make a decision on what we believe happened.  We must take the word of witnesses that there was no disagreement at the meeting between the State Claims Agency and HSE.  However, neither organisation should have intercepted something that would obviously come back before the Committee of Public Accounts once the letter had been written to the SCA.  Having been before the committee before the State Claims Agency wrote to the committee, surely Mr. Connaghan was aware that there was a problem with this evidence?  Soon after the meeting it became clear that the information given at the meeting was incorrect.  Given that this is glaringly obvious to everyone following proceedings and everyone present, why did Mr. Connaghan choose to do and say nothing?  The only reason the committee is addressing this issue again is that the State Claims Agency wrote to us about it.  Mr. Connaghan needs to reflect on that deeply.</p><p> In layman's language, this was a case of the HSE believing the committee had not noticed this and the HSE had, therefore, got away with it and would say nothing.  However, when Mr. Breen and his colleagues wrote to the committee, the HSE had to deal with the issue.  If ever a series of events symbolises my view of arse covering in the HSE, it is this.  We are being told a story and we have to take people's word for it.  The committee took their word last time and it has since transpired that there were inaccuracies.  That is fine.  We will take the word of the HSE again today and it may stand up.  The committee will have to make a judgment on that but it is not a court of law.  </p><p> However, the bigger issue is why the HSE did not deal with the issue once it became clear there was a problem.  In fairness to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, that became obvious when he raised the matter.  While I acknowledge Mr. Connaghan's statement that there is a lesson to be learned from this, it is not damn well good enough.  We represent the public and the whole country is following these meetings, as are HSE management and staff.  The impact of the performances of HSE witnesses at this committee and other committees has had a serious and negative impact on its staff.  The administrative work creeping up on the HSE is multiplying as a result of those performances.  HSE staff did not like what they saw, namely, multiple instances of arse covering.  As a result, many people in the organisation believe they must push everything up the line, rather than assume personal responsibility in case their managers land them in it.  I have outlined one such example and the events that transpired following a meeting of this committee.  While the problem that has arisen may have been accidental, the fact that it was not dealt is emblematic of the HSE.  If Mr. Connaghan cannot see what is glaringly obvious, I do not know where we are going.  He may respond if he wishes.</p></speech>

It was to satisfy my own curiosity as to why there were two contradictory statements.  It is entirely reasonable that I would ask for a version of events and for the truth on the matter.  That is why, in the letter of 30 May, the committee got that response.  It was entirely reasonable that the committee asked for some clarification. </p></speech>

I will do a quick fire round of questions because we all have limited time.</p> <p>  I have a habit of drifting through committee meetings and I attended a meeting of the finance committee when representatives of the State Claims Agency appeared before it.  I accept the agency's hands are tied in many cases by the legislative basis on which it operates, for example, tort law.  Considerable time has passed.  What proposals has the State Claims Agency put to the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Finance on how it can change the current position?  The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il he had instructed the State Claims Agency to use mediation in all of these cases.  We now know that if the laboratories do not disentangle themselves from the HSE, the agency will be locked into a certain position.  Will Mr. Breen set out in detail the engagement between the State Claims Agency and the Government?  I presume they have engaged in days and weeks of intensive negotiations and discussions involving legislative proposals and whatever else may be needed.  How many meetings have taken place?</p></speech>

If I may, I will explain some of the changes because the changes that we have brought about are very precise.  Traditionally, if we were dealing with a medical negligence case where there is a plaintiff and a defendant, and we are obviously always for the defendant, we would engage a series of expert reports, have the person examined and engage other experts in relation to quantum.  We are not doing any of that.  We are immediately, in our defences which we are required to put in, we are admitting breach of duty in relation to the non-disclosure point, and we are asking the plaintiffs in the cases if they would share their reports with us immediately so that we can get to mediation as quickly as we possibly can.  I need to explain this to the Deputy.  He is asking me what changes are there and I need to explain them to him.  By doing it in this particular way, we are short-circuiting these cases by an incredibly shortened time.</p></speech>

I first have a question for Mr. Gleeson.  I do not live far from his offices, although it is in a different county which beat Tipperary in hurling this year.  I also know some of the people who work with him and I have met and spoken to people who work with him and people who work in CervicalCheck.  There are some very good, impressive people working in that organisation.  There are, however, serious issues with CervicalCheck.</p> <p>  On the provision of information, we all know that approximately 4,000 documents were provided on a USB key or CD-ROM or in some electronically scanned document.  Yesterday, the Minister for Health said he had issues and used the word "pathetic".  I do not know if that is correct but that is the word he used.  Why has Dr. Scally not been given direct access to all the files which all the staff have?  Why is he not being given remote or direct access to all those files?  Did the HSE ever propose that he have such access and, if so, why has it not been provided?</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson or someone with him proposed to give Dr. Scally the same full access that the relevant HSE staff had.  However, that was shot down in preference for taking the electronic files, putting them on a device - be it a USB device or a CD - and giving that to Dr. Scally, which he has gone ballistic over and which the Minister has called "pathetic".  As a result of this, the Taoiseach had to stand up in the D&aacute;il yesterday and say that he was instructing the HSE to do otherwise.  Why did the HSE not give Dr. Scally full access from day one?  The Taoiseach and Minister for Health are on the same page as me about this.</p></speech>

In fact, it is not what was agreed in the D&aacute;il.  However, that is not the issue.  Dr. Scally was clear in that he was furious about the documentation.  Everyone present knows that.  We have now revealed that the people in Limerick just wanted to give him full access.  As usual, though, when it went up the food chain, a decision was taken somewhere in the HSE that it would have to edit that documentation in some way.  Why can we not give him full access?</p></speech>

The Minister for Health has had discussions with Dr. Scally since then and I have had communications with the Minister for Health.  There is a contradiction in this somewhere.

That is my understanding, but he can confirm that himself.</p> <p>  There is medical cover.  There are consultants working in Dublin to deal with those medical calls.</p> <p>  Regarding the 209, there is the potential for more.  We are notified on an ongoing basis of audits and cancers.  If audits conclude, we will immediately make full disclosures to women.  Once the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists commences the international panel, that will assume responsibility for all future audits.</p></speech>

Has the 209 figure increased and, if so, by how much?  Does the HSE expect it to increase even further?  Are there cases where women ring in but there is no doctor to ring them back?</p></speech>

I expect the figure to increase before the royal college's review concludes.  As we are informed of any change in interpretation from an audit, we will inform the women first.

People are being added to it at the moment as the audit progresses.  Of the 1,482 women who were part of the cervical cancer audit, 46 audits are still in progress and 12 are concluding.  Once those are concluded, the women will be contacted about those audits.  From that point forward and once the royal college process commences, any future audit will run through.  To be clear, there are 12 women in the current audits and 46 in the ongoing audits.  Those women will be contacted as the results are disclosed to them.  I anticipate that, as the royal college process commences, which will happen in the coming weeks, we will cease all audits on the basis that we do not want two audit processes to be running at the same time.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on medical cover, I am sorry, but I thought I had clarified that.  There are medical consultants available to any of the call centres.  We have medical consultants in Dublin to take those calls.  Those calls are listed, co-ordinated and allocated to medical consultants.  There is not necessarily a doctor in Limerick, but there is access from Limerick to medical consultant cover in Dublin.</p></speech>

It is one that his own staff are telling him and of which he was probably made aware in the past 24 hours when he visited Limerick yesterday and returned with Mr. Gleeson to prepare for today.  There should be a doctor there.  The staff in Limerick need a doctor who can deal with these cases.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  If there are complex cases remaining from the calls, it is our intention with the interim clinical director to ensure that they are allocated directly to hospitals.  To recap, the call centre model involves a call centre in Cork that effectively takes the first line of calls and provides advice to women.  That amounted to approximately 14,000 calls.  The second level was general nursing and the third was oncology or colposcopy nursing, for example, the team in Limerick, which has done phenomenal work in a short time.  The final level is the medical piece.  That is either dealt with directly by a consultant or referred to a hospital.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify this.  It has been a complex process.  I am not going to say it has been easy.  There have been more than 25,000 calls.  At the point when the help desk was established we had a backlog of several thousand.  Earlier, I described the model of four tiers of calls.  We have more than 50 staff in each area.</p></speech>

I was at the meeting in May.  Then, I was missing for the 17 May meeting.  I came back.  We were in Africa with the Committee of Public Accounts, so we were not missing in action.  Then, I saw Mr. Connaghan's response.  I am on record as saying that I was shocked at Mr. Connaghan's response on the inconsistency between the HSE and the State Claims Agency.  The agency wrote to us indicating that a scoping exercise was in being with a view to a commission of inquiry or whatever inquiry would be settled on.  Mr. Connaghan, as the new person, decided not to attend that meeting.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I believe it is entirely reasonable for me to ask both parties to come together to explain their versions of events and to explain the alternative version of events and why there was a difference.  At the end of the day, that difference did not exist because we agreed with the latter part of the letter of 22 May.</p></speech>

We are here to oversee governance and procedures.  We are not here to ask people whether their job is tenable.  That is not our role.  Our role is to see whether procedures are in place.  I am not reassured by Mr. Connaghan's approach on procedures.  The State Claims Agency has said certain matters were not recorded in the way suggested.  Mr. Connaghan saw fit to call the relevant people together.  Mr. Connaghan did not attend the meeting.  There are no minutes of the meeting.  That does not represent good governance or accountability for someone who is in charge, does it?</p></speech>

That is the problem - it had been given.  That will be looked at in future, presumably by the scoping inquiry.  Forgive me if I am wrong, but this looks like Mr. Connaghan decided to get the one story.  That added to the insult.</p> <p>  I will leave that for today.  I will leave it for the inquiry but I appeal to Mr. Connaghan to reflect on it.  Did Mr. Connaghan read all the briefing documents that were produced to us eventually by Mr. O'Brien?

They are signed by Simon Murtagh, acting head of the National Screening Service, on behalf of Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, national director.  The issues coming up relate to the results of the audit coming through with problematic findings and communications to women.

Deputy Connolly was not at the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that she referenced.  The transcript of that meeting and the previous meeting of the Joint Committee on Health addressed all those issues in full.  The purpose of the briefings requested and shared with the director general and the Department was to explain the matter to those people.  They would have received a verbal briefing in advance, at the same time as they received a written briefing, to the effect that the CervicalCheck programme was conducting the audit and that those responsible had come to the point where they wished to communicate the findings to women.</p></speech>

I have only ten minutes.  I have before me the transcript of the meeting that I missed.  I have read it in detail.  I was present and asked a question on the memorandums given to us at 3 p.m. that afternoon.  I was present for the questioning on the memorandums.  I could not possibly accept the language in the memorandums on the strategy being communicated.  Again, I am leaving it for the commission and the scoping exercise.  I have read them.  The officials are taking another position now.  The three documents I have before me show me that there was a strategy in place to contain the message.  I am asking Mr. Connaghan whether, when he read all those documents, he still thought it was appropriate to contain the message.</p></speech>

I do not have them in front of me but it did not immediately read to me that this was a containment strategy.  There was clearly a strategy to make the audit results available to women.  That is why all the treating clinicians had a letter asking them to pass on the results in question.  I did not immediately read that interpretation into it.  This is the subject of copious evidence given over seven hours at the previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

Anyway, I am leaving it.</p><p>I would say to Dr. O'Keeffe that I think the language was wrong.  I think it was totally unacceptable.  When a new person joined the HSE, the organisation should have reviewed the matter.  In my opinion, the action was not good governance.  </p><p> I have a few questions for Mr. Breen about the State Claims Agency.  I have attempted to find out how many cases are pending, in whatever form, such as a warning letter or proceedings settled.  How many cases are there in terms of the cervical smear programme?</p></speech>

I wish to raise two issues and one is for Mr. Connaghan.

Information was starting to be provided between 24 May, to Dr. Scally, up to 7 June to close out that information request.</p> <p>  I think where Dr. Scally's disappointment lies is the fact that the information provided to him was not totally in an immediately searchable format.  We are looking at the technical reasons to try and readjust that right now so that he can search all documents.  I mirror his disappointment but there is no question of full co-operation with the HSE.  All of the staff understand that.   </p></speech>

Why was it unclear on 11 June after so much pain and difficulties?</p></speech>

So obviously he looked at that and discovered some things that he did not like, in terms of the transmission of those documents.  We are working to sort that right now, okay.</p></speech>

Mr. Connaghan said he would like to consider Mr. Gleeson's offer of access.  How, in the name of God, did he not know about it before today?  This is the biggest health scandal in decades and Dr. Scally has come out and criticised the HSE about access.  Surely, it was fed up the line that the programme manager had given an open disclosure access policy, perhaps with limitations, yet Mr. Connaghan is only becoming aware of it today.</p></speech>

Something occurs to me and it is that I have only met Dr. Scally once and that was at the outset.  It is important to make sure I have oversight of where Dr. Scally's review is going, that we are supportive of it and that we can provide the required information.  I will probably need to set something up.  I will be doing so this afternoon in order to have regular contact with Dr. Scally to make sure we iron out any issue.  I thank Mr. Gleeson for making the suggestion.  It is something I need to consider.</p></speech>

Yesterday the Minister for Health called the witnesses "pathetic", but Mr. Connaghan was not even told that this had been offered.  He really needs to sit down and have a chat with people because it is embarrassing.  I cannot go any further.</p> <p>  I request clarification on one thing Mr. McCallion said.  We know that the number of women affected will increase.  He talked about a further 12 audits and 46 ongoing audits.  Will he clarify if that means that there are potentially a further 58 cases?</p></speech>

I am not accusing anybody of telling lies or giving misinformation or whatever nice version one wants to use about lying.  As we all heard, Professor Scally has a history of dealing with stuff like this in other organisations.  It does not make sense that it would be acceptable to somebody at his level to receive scanned documents on a disk or a USB stick.  Neither he nor anyone at his level would think it was practical to go through documents in that manner.  It is not believable and I find it incompetent that scanned documents would be given in a format that was not searchable, as Mr. Connaghan said.  It is a needle in a haystack job.  It is not the way to go about it.  That it took until 11 June to find out that this was the format in which he had been given the information does not add up.</p> <p>  Many of us on the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Health, including me, believe we are constantly met with resistance, avoidance of disclosure and every barricade that can be put in our way in our engagement with the HSE.  For the public looking in, I estimate the combined salaries of the witnesses present per year to be in the region of &euro;2.5 million, leaving the rest of us out of it.  I have said here before and at the Joint Committee on Health that we are dealing with a population the size of that of Manchester.  For normal people looking in, this is madness.  It is a dysfunctional system that is rotten to the core and not fit for purpose.  We have all of the witnesses, many of whom do great work, but committee members are like a court of law.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has to read transcripts and we then start dancing on the head of a pin with words such as "assurances" and "assumptions".  The last time we had the word "feelings" from Dr. O'Keeffe.  All of this language does not give us answers and, to my mind, it is a complete waste of time.  Somebody needs to take control.  I thought Mr. Connaghan was in control, but the fact that he has admitted that he has only met Dr. Scally once, which was at the outset, seems mad.  It seems reasonable on something of this magnitude that he would be meeting Dr. Scally on a weekly basis to be updated.  To have to sit here on a such beautiful day land listen to Mr. Gleeson talk about things he had "assumed" is disrespectful to us and the public.</p> <p>  I do not buy the notion that somebody thought that giving scanned, unsearchable documents was the way forward.  It seems to be a deliberate attempt to stop information from being received.  I do not buy either the notion of not having statutory authority because I have often inquired of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and it seems people with no medical qualifications have access to medical records.  The issue can be dealt with.  Many people go to doctor A for treatment and doctor B gets to see their files and there is no confidentiality issue.  It is just another barricade put in our way in trying to get the answers.</p><p>I just wonder what the point of all the witnesses is at this stage.  They are not able to answer us.  Who is to blame?  Is it the labs, the audit process, the system, politics or something else?  We are still here.  I do not know what is the point of this meeting.  It must be the tenth or 12th meeting with the witnesses I have attended and we are no further along.  There is no point to the witnesses being here because they are not giving us answers.  If this is - I am trying to think of a word that does not include bad language - the mess we are in, they clearly cannot manage things.</p><p> The public and the medical people are becoming more annoyed because we are now undoing all the good that was done through the screening process in this country over ten years.  We will probably reverse our 7% reduction in cervical cancer rates.  The whole negativity around this is bad for public health, which, as far as I am concerned, it is supposed to be the witnesses' job to protect.  I am a Government Deputy and I just think the whole lot of them should be sent packing and we should get new people to do this.  It is the middle of June.  This has been going on for weeks now and we are none the wiser.  We are looking at people who are paid with taxpayers' money and who are supposed to be accountable to us telling us "Well, maybe", "Oh, I assumed this" and "I felt this".  I just do not have any time for it because I do not buy it.  It reminds me of when I used to try to get away with things with my parents when I was a teenager and I tried to baffle them with my various versions of the story so they would not know where I was.  That is what the witnesses have managed to do today.  We do not know who is in charge, who is accountable or what qualifications people have.  I looked at the organisational structure of the HSE and it has changed in the past two days.  The HSE has been shifting the deck-chairs around on the Titanic as well.  It is just insulting.  The witnesses' continuous behaviour at these meetings is insulting to the elected Members of this House and to the public.  It is a waste of our time.</p></speech>

It was agreed that a scoping inquiry, as opposed to a commission of investigation, would be the best way to proceed - there is likely to be a commission of investigation afterwards - to identify the issues.  The inquiry was given until the end of June.  This was publicly known.  It would have been known to the witnesses that the end of June was the target date for completion of that work.  Was Mr. Connaghan consulted before the Cabinet met about whether or not there was a capacity issue with doing it within that timeline?  Was there any engagement in that regard?</p></speech>

That the documents had been digitally generated but then scanned and sent in a format that cannot be searched would certainly underscore the point that Vicky Phelan made that she believed it was stonewalling.

I am sure CervicalCheck will want to reassure people and it will want women to continue to engage with the screening process, as I would myself, and it will want to give every assurance to people that they can have confidence in the screening programme.  It seems to me that in order to give that confidence the very first thing that should have been provided and worked on was the labs and their reliability and if one lab was better than the other so that Dr. Scally could come to a judgment on that.  There was a breakthrough yesterday on the contractual obligations relating to that.</p></speech>

One of Dr. Scally's objectives is to provide assurance in respect of the laboratories, particularly in the context of the importance of the screening programmes.  The Deputy is right.  One woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer through screening every two days and that is the key point on which, hopefully, Dr. Scally will give assurance.</p> <p>  In terms of the laboratory performance-----</p></speech>

I was only trying to reflect the importance of the testing, which was the Deputy's point.</p> <p>  In terms of the performance of the laboratories, all of that information has been available and will be made available.  The committee had sought copies of the contracts as well so we had to go through a process to ensure that we did not in any way undermine some of the terms and indemnities contained in the contracts that could, in effect, impact on the State.  We have got an agreement with the laboratories to release those contracts, as Mr. Connaghan said, with some provisos.  We will be going through that with Dr. Scally and also writing to the Chair of the committee in terms of the release of those contracts.</p></speech>

Earlier, Mr. Connaghan stated, "This will require a significant team to be put in place within the HSE to support this process."  He went on to say something else and the word "understand" jumped out at me.  He said, "We understand the Department is concluding the contract for this work and the scope of work will include all women who were part of the CervicalCheck audit".  Is it the HSE or the Department of Health?  That jumps out at me as being odd.  If the HSE is running the programme I would have thought it would also be involved in the contractual obligation around the process.  What is going on in relation to that?</p></speech>

The HPV roll-out is a separate project.  I think what Mr. Connaghan is referring to in the opening statement is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' review, which is of the 3,100 women I mentioned earlier who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer.</p></speech>

While the Department is leading on that - it is independent, rightly so, of the HSE - we have been working very closely with it in terms of the numbers to ensure that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is clear on the total numbers and the size of the task it is taking on.  I think what was being referred to in the opening statement was the international expert panel, which is effectively being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the faculty of pathology in the UK.

Deputy Connolly referred to some of those matters such as concern in the HSE about screaming headlines and potentially undermining the screening programme.  It was well known in the HSE and there was talk about how it would communicate, but then it did not communicate and held back letters.  We know the body of memos that are there.  I think there were four of them.  The State Claims Agency takes responsibility for any court actions and it has to do an assessment of what is likely to happen.

There is a great deal of interaction between both, so there is an awful lot of learning that arises from the claims side that is fed back through our risk management side on closed claims analysis, for example, across the range of health services.  To put the particular meeting in context for the Deputy, it was very much a preliminary meeting with the screening service.  It was not something we had worries about.  A lot of claims occur in hospitals due to medical negligence so they were our priority.  This was a very introductory-type meeting.  Mr. Gleeson was at the meeting and he might speak about it as well.  It covered a range of things.</p></speech>

We now know information which we did not know previously, particularly in relation to women being informed.  It was assumed that women were being informed through their clinicians.  Unfortunately, we now know that was not the case.  That is what has caused a lot of controversy in this committee and a lot of trauma and hurt for the women themselves.  I presume lessons have been learned in that regard.  Is it the case that we are not relying on clinicians now?  Are we still relying on clinicians to inform women into the future?  Is the process changing?  Can someone explain what happens now?  At the meeting of 17 May, I made the point that because of the failure to put in place a check at the end point, we did not close the loop.  I asked Mr. Gleeson who was responsible for ensuring the loop was closed.  I was told it was not possible at the time to state who was responsible.  Mr. Gleeson said it may or may not have been his responsibility.  I asked him whether he would go away and reflect on whether it should have been his responsibility.  Somebody needs to be held accountable.  I am genuinely not looking for a head on a plate.  Somebody needs to put their hand up and say "I was the person responsible for ensuring the loop was closed, but it did not happen and I apologise for it".  Nobody has done that yet.  I think somebody should do it.  I want to give the people in the room an opportunity to take responsibility for the loop not being closed.  If they can take responsibility for it now, and if they want to comment on it, the floor is open to them.  I think it is important.  Much of the stuff that is out there at the moment relates to the fact that the women who have been affected by this issue feel that nobody is being held accountable and nobody is taking responsibility.  That, outside of everything else they are going through, is causing hurt to these women.  They see a lot of officials and politicians coming in and having a ding-dong back and forth without anybody putting up their hand and saying "I was responsible, I apologise, this will not happen again".  Do we now know who was responsible for closing that loop?  If that person is here, would he or she like to make a comment?</p></speech>

I am relatively new in the role of director general and in my understanding of the full scope of responsibilities and accountabilities in that role.  From my perspective and in my role, I need to be accountable and responsible for the performance of the system.  I understand the committee had a discussion at a past meeting about whether the previous director general was accountable and responsible for the actions of every single person inside the system.  The answer at that point was that it was going to be pretty hard to have such accountability and responsibility, given that people sometimes step out of the system.  The role of the director general and the board of the HSE, when it is established, is to make sure that a proper set of system controls and procedures is in place, that there is a safe system of working and that all of this is regularly monitored with good procedures.  I fully accept that my responsibility lies at that level.</p></speech>

I have always said that this is a systems failure.  Mr. Connaghan is now admitting that it was a systems failure.  If he is not admitting that, maybe I am reading into it incorrectly.</p></speech>

The person who previously held Mr. Connaghan's position said it was not a systems failure.  I appreciate the fact that Mr. Connaghan is now taking responsibility for that.  Given everything we now know about information and assumptions, does Mr. Breen have full confidence that all the information the State Claims Agency is getting on CervicalCheck is factual and correct and that no more assumptions are being made?</p></speech>

The information we are principally seeking now is in respect of the ongoing claims and ensuring that we have all of the relevant records and documentation we require.  We are getting those and getting them in a way that meets our needs.  We do not have any doubts about the quality of the information or the rapidity with which we are receiving it.</p></speech>

He was the person responsible for ensuring that loop was closed initially.  It was not closed, for whatever reason.  As already stated, at our previous meeting he was uncertain whether it was his responsibility.  If Mr. Gleeson would like to comment, he should feel to do so because I think it is important that women hear that someone is taking full responsibility.  I know Mr. Connaghan has done that from the HSE point of view.  If Mr. Gleeson has a comment, it would be important for CervicalCheck.</p></speech>

The failure was not to have any responsibility assigned.  That was the failing in the system.  It did not continue the loop.  Had I assumed or been assigned responsibility for it, then it could have been done.  I have already apologised for that link not being made.  I reiterate that apology now.  We have to learn from this process and make sure that final step is taken and if it is assigned to me I will be more than happy to ensure it happens.</p></speech>

It links directly with the hospitals.  I will take the 209 women as an example.  Disclosure was made in the case of 42 of those women but not in respect of the balance.  A central team linked directly with the hospitals ensures that the loop is closed in respect of the supports for those women.  We maintain a database that keeps an up-to-date picture of exactly where each of those cases stands at any point in order that the loop is closed.  The serious incident management team set up in respect of this has the directors of hospitals and all of the other relevant directors on it to make sure that all of those loops are closed.  We track all of the contacts made with each of the women.  That is not just in respect of informing them but also in trying to keep track of all the different requirements they have.</p></speech>

I sat on the health forum years ago and watched this debacle emerge when all the experts told us not to outsource.  Quest was mentioned in particular at the time.  I am not blaming the witnesses for that but I certainly put blame on the establishment of the time and the type of philosophy that existed.  We watched this happen and now it will cost an absolute fortune.  That may be a bad choice of words given the suffering of many women so I am not making it in that context but in the context of actual cost.  We had an excellent laboratory in Galway that was doing a brilliant job but it was all outsourced.  Here is a golden opportunity so is the HSE looking at insourcing the tests?</p></speech>

We need a clinical lead to be able to close out the process.  The Deputy asked what is the preference and I can answer from my perspective as director general.  No matter what is the service, I have always had the preference to attempt to do as much insourcing as possible.  However, that needs to measured in terms of resilience of the supply chain, value for money, quality etc.  There are some caveats.</p></speech>

There is not a week that goes by when the courts are sitting that there are newspaper articles or television coverage of victims of wrongdoing being forced to go through the process of having to defend and vindicate their rights.

Very often when we settle without an admission of liability it is because we have a very strong expert report which would say that an individual practitioner in the circumstances is not liable yet there is very often damage to the person and for good reason we settle without the case admission of liability.

In my experience, it is the setting of a date that prompts the settlement.  In terms of the 3% and the horrific cases we read about and the families involved in those cases, would it not be more appropriate for the State to deal with these matters more directly and with the admission of liability rather than expending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of euro on an annual business saving face for individuals?  It may be that there is a report stating that individuals did not do anything wrong in accordance with procedure and medical practice, but ultimately the State is still coughing up large sums of money to compensate patients.  Where in this equation, from a taxpayers' money perspective or a patient care perspective, is it worthy of the State to pursue individuals through the courts and then finally settle on the steps of the court without admitting liability, which is often what happens?  To me, it seems horrific to do this to people.  I understand these are complex cases but, putting it mildly, this practice has to stop.  There must be a process of mediation before cases get to the courts so that these families do not have to go through that experience, not to mention the public moneys being expended in that process.</p></speech>

The agency in no way wants to bring people to the steps of the courts or into the courts unless it is compelled to do so.  By way of example, the other day we were facing a case with a demand for &euro;3.9 million.  After a day in court, the case settled for &euro;75,000.  This is an inevitable situation in which we find ourselves at times.  Where settlement demands are so significant and beyond our professional estimate of what should be given we are compelled to go to court.  We do so because we have a duty to the taxpayer.  The 3% of cases that go to trial are cases where there would be a very fundamental liability point.  I will give another example.  Two weeks ago, we had a case which we requested be discontinued, based on our expert report prior to the trial.  We were willing to provide our expert report on why the case did not have merit yet the case progressed and was withdrawn after one day.  There are inevitable situations where this happens.</p> <p>  In cases of catastrophic injuries to infants, many are settled before court but they require to be ruled on by a court and, therefore, it appears that we are bringing a family into court but we are not.  We are required to do this under ordinary rules.</p></speech>

They tend to be much more complex, the reason being it is very difficult to say that one case has a value of &euro;30,000 and another has a value of &euro;50,000 yet the range of injuries might be relatively non-variable.  The issue is how they impact on the person, the age of the person, the sex of the person and so on.  There are many qualitative differences that lie in these issues.</p></speech>

I do not think he is correct because an electronic spreadsheet is easily searchable.  It is possible to convert documents to searchable format.  I do not buy the idea that there is some complexity involved in searching documents.  As far as I am concerned the issue here is that somebody made a decision that Dr. Scally was to be given scanned PDF documents rather than electronic hard copies.  In other words, rather than give Dr. Scally a desk, computer and password in the HSE to enable him to access the documents somebody made the decision to give him scanned documents, which he has made very clear is not appropriate.  I do not think Mr. Connaghan is correct in saying data searching is a complex process.  Perhaps, I misinterpreted him.  We all do it every day.  If we receive documents in PDF format we convert them.  I do not understand what the technical issue is and so perhaps Mr. Connaghan would elaborate.</p></speech>

On the laboratory data, Mr. McCallion said that drawing out historical data is a complex process.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked Mr. McCallion about the results from the laboratories for 2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016.  I have a photograph of the results on my phone which is dated 9 May.  I do not know on what date the committee received them but I got them on that date from the witnesses.  We were able to get them on 9 May, which is a month ago.  What is so complicated about getting the results for previous years?  Do the witnesses expect us to believe that there is not a similar data available for other years?  The data we have comprises four columns detailing the names of the laboratories, the form of screening that took place, the number of inappropriate smears, the number of negative results and various other percentages.  How is it that it was easy to get the results for that period when today we are being told it is complex to draw out historical data?  Are we back to technicalities with searching the spreadsheet or there is another reason?</p></speech>

Maybe there was nothing to see, but it seems a bit odd.  I turn to the QA matter.  This is back to the regulation and we are dealing with Brexit.  Every country or area has its QA people who come in to ensure the machine is working properly, that the guy checking is qualified and that the QP is right and all that.  However, would that QA process have involved any examination of the tables I have been speaking about to Mr. McCallion?  I see those as two separate things.  QA is about machinery and skilled operators but it seems to be conflated here today.  QA is a question of whether the laboratory is working, ensuring there are no rats in the corner, that the temperature is right and that people sign in so the right people are in the room and nothing is compromised.  Am I right in saying that?</p></speech>

The body tests the laboratory for that whether it is blood testing or whatever.  Second, we have published quality assurance guidelines on our website.  If one works within the programme as a laboratory, these are what must be met.  Having been awarded a contract, one will have to be accredited and meet these standards.  Third, we do quality monitoring against those quality standards.  The national certification body will do its annual audits for the accreditation and we will do ongoing monitoring against the standards set in our QA guidelines.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach made a commitment - and I am paraphrasing - that the objective was for the women not to have to take legal cases but that the State would take the cases.  As such, the women would not have to do it directly themselves.  What engagement would there have been before that commitment was made?  Is that possible when a statement of claim has already issued and proceedings have already commenced?  Is there anything new that has come in to mediate following that statement?</p></speech>

In other words, he or she will want to put his or her case before the courts in terms of the legal documents required such as a personal injuries summons and so on for the purposes of laying out what the claim is about and where there have been failures by the defendant.</p><p>In these particular cases the women are anxious to do this to get their proceedings out in any event because they want to make sure they are within the Statute of Limitations.  That is an important issue for them.  They will also rely on an expert report and will want to paraphrase some of its content in their pleadings.  In the hopefully unlikely situation where mediation fails, many of the women will want to fall back on the court.  In any event the women, some of whom are gravely ill, would want the court to lay out set timelines.  That is a choice for the women to go to court to set these matters out for their protection.</p><p> The process that we are engaged in respect of the mediation effectively runs parallel to that process.  The judge keeps an eye on the case on a case management basis to make sure the parties are doing what they should do because the women are gravely ill.  At our end, we are going as fast as we can to mediation, which is exactly what the Taoiseach had said.</p></speech>

This is why they are going back to court, understandably.  It is to ask the court to be a guardian of the process to make sure that things are happening.  That is why, unfortunately, we see these applications.  We would prefer not to see them.  Where we want to get to, in line with what the Taoiseach has said, is that these women will be going to mediation and not having to go to court.</p></speech>

The Department of Health officials were asked why the scoping inquiry is taking longer than expected.  They need not give an answer now but I want detailed notes from the Department on the work that went into preparing the timescale, not the terms of reference.  The Department came up with a timescale and the Minister announced it would be in place by the end of June.  We want to know how that timescale was arrived at, what consideration went into the work required and why somebody felt it that could be completed in that time, and whether it encompassed adequately what was requested in the terms of reference.  I always knew it was an impossible timetable based on what was being asked.  I would like to see what notes the Department had on it and whether it was a realistic timetable to begin with.</p> <p>  At the end of all this, does Mr. Connaghan believe the clinicians should have communicated with the women as appropriate?

If we can have this level of debate about a word, as to who should have done what or who believed what, and it has taken two hours to get through this in public, I would hope in private that the witnesses would move much more quickly in trying get to the bottom of issues like this.  I would be fearful that if the witnesses were not in the public eye, a debate like that would go on interminably.  That is a worry.</p></speech>

However, we should have fail-safes behind that.  We all realise that other things wrap around the system to make sure we have a feedback loop and we close that loop.  It is not just clinicians.  We need to have wider things around there to make sure the system itself does not fail.</p></speech>

The first item to deal with is the minutes of the meeting of 31 May.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  There will be no matters arising that will not come up in the rest of our correspondence so I will move on to correspondence.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  The first are Nos. 1378 (i) and 1378 (ii), opening statement and briefing material from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  Nos. 1379 (i) and 1379 (ii) are an opening statement and briefing documents from the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  Next is No. 1381, the opening statement from the HSE for this morning's meeting, and No. 1383, the opening statement from Mr. John Gleeson  This correspondence, discussed earlier, is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Correspondence Nos. 1339B (i) to 1339B (iv), inclusive, 1340B (i) to 1340B (iv), inclusive, and 1341B (i) to 1341B (xxv), inclusive, were held over from the previous meeting.  They are from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, dated 25 May and 28 May 2018 and provide information requested in respect of our meeting on CervicalCheck.  There is a considerable volume of material.  We met HSE officials this morning regarding this particular issue but we also have scheduled a meeting with the HSE for 5 July in the normal course of events to deal with its annual financial statement.  We will note these items for the moment.  They include quality assurance guidelines and the audit methodology paper that preceded the CervicalCheck audit in 2010.  I will hold these documents for a minute and we will come back to them.  There is a question as to whether they can be published.</p> <p>  No. 1353B  is correspondence from Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach, regarding the process followed in respect of information being brought to the Government relating to cases against the State.  He also deals with queries we had on the strategic communications unit and the &euro;700,000 spent on Project Ireland 2040 and includes a note on the training provided to staff on protected disclosures.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  People are free to use that documentation.</p></speech>

We will write back and ask for an update on the final figures when all invoices have been processed.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for teasing out that issue.</p><p>The next item is No. 1357B (i) to (iv) from the office of the chief administrative officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 30 May providing information on the legal advice to the former Garda Commissioner, a note on the Garda training college risk register and an update on the implementation of the recommendations in the internal audit report on the training college.  We will note and publish all of that.</p><p>The next item is No. 1358B from Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute;, dated 30 May providing a lot of follow-up information requested by this committee, including details on the relationship between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and RT&Eacute; in the context of oversight; an analysis of the 81 contractors paid as limited companies; a note on costs associated with legal contracts; and responses to the other specific questions we put.  We will note and publish these documents which provide all of the answers required in a clear manner.</p><p>The next item is No. 1364B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 1 June 2018, providing information regarding guidelines on expenditure on hospitality by public bodies. That arose from our discussion on third level institutions in Cork<b>.  </b>We will note and publish that correspondence.  The next item, No. 1365B is also from Mr. Robert Watt, dated 1 June 2018, providing follow-up information requested by the committee on the European structural reform support programme, including information on the scope and expected outcomes of the project.  The correspondence also includes notes on the sequencing of moving public service bodies to the finance shared service and on the financial reporting standards of public bodies.  We will note and publish all of that.</p><p><b></b>The next item is No. 1366B from Mr. Barry O'Connor, president of Cork Institute of Technology, dated 7 June 2018 providing follow-up information requested by the committee including a letter issued from the institute to the Higher Education Authority dated 22 May 2018 and a note on the pension paid by the student services company, which includes details of those eligible to benefit from the pension scheme and whether anyone in the institute or on the board is involved in the company.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p><p>The next item is No. 1367B from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president of University College Cork, dated 8 June 2018 providing follow-up information requested by the committee on Cork University Foundation, Athena Swan, Infini-LED, IMI pay scales, the IMI aspiring leaders programme and a note on key management personnel.  We will note and publish that information and members are free to use it as they see fit.  </p><p>The next item is No. 1376B from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency dated 12 June, relating to his attendance at today's meeting.  We dealt with this earlier, so will note and publish it now.  It is only a formality.</p><p>The next items of correspondence are from or related to private individuals.  Item No. 1312C is from Deputy Catherine Murphy dated 18 May 2018 regarding the Road Safety Authority, RSA ,which was held over.  We will hold that over again for now.  Item No. 1347C is from Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Reardon at the office of the Garda Commissioner, dated 28 May 2018, providing a response to the committee regarding a report on the operation of GoSafe cameras.  It also relates to the issue of road safety issue and we will hold it over again for now.  </p><p>No. 1351C is correspondence from an individual dated 29 May 2018 regarding the provision of training related to bereavement in the HSE.  The allocation of training resources is a matter for each public body.  I do not think that this committee can provide advice on how to access funding for the training required other than to contact the training unit in the HSE and I propose that we write to the individual accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item is No. 1352C (i) to (iii) from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 29 May 2018, provides information requested by the committee on alleged PRSI misclassification of employees.  The correspondence deals with employed versus self-employed status, the PRSI and taxation systems and the appeals structure.  We discussed this previously.  We have also received a reply on this matter from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I propose that we send a copy of both items to the individual concerned.  We will keep this issue before us.  The information provided here is useful to members.  We will publish it on our website for the benefit of the public who may have an interest in that topic.</p><p>No. 1354C is correspondence received from Mr. Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 30 May 2018, confirming his attendance at today&rsquo;s meeting, which we will note an publish.  Nos. 1342C, 1355C (i) to (vi) and 1362C dated 24 May, 30 May 2018 and 2 June 2018, respectively, were received from an individual on the issue of wards of court.  We will hold that over.  The correspondent has been in touch with me and a number of other committee members.  We will meet one or two of the people who have asked for a meeting and return to the issue later.  We will not deal with this matter today.</p><p>No. 1356C (i) to (iii) is from an individual, dated 30 May 2018, enclosing copies of letters regarding the Irish Horse Welfare Trust in Wicklow sent to Deputy Andrew Doyle and the animal health and welfare division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I propose we note the correspondence.  No. 1359C (i) to (iii) is correspondence from an individual, dated 31 May 2018, relating to an FOI request to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The committee is being copied on the correspondence which relates to road contracts and the disposal of waste.  We will note that.  We are not being asked to deal with anything as such but are being copied in on correspondence. </p><p>No. 1361C (i) to (ii) is correspondence from an individual, dated 4 June 2018, regarding evidence provided by officials of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment related to RT&Eacute; at the meeting of this committee on 3 May 2018.  The individual states that information given to the committee regarding a request by RT&Eacute; to the Broadcasting Authority for RT&Eacute; 2+1 to be included on the Sky platform was not correct.  The individual also sent a copy of this correspondence to Ms Cronin of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Ms Cronin has written directly to the committee, as per item No. 1374C, dated 11 June, on the matter.  Ms Cronin explains the process followed and apologises for the lack of clarity which may have risen.  I am not satisfied with that correspondence and have a proposal to make in that regard.  I raised an issue at the meeting in question.  RT&Eacute; representatives were talking about the commercial situation and I asked why RT&Eacute; 2+1 was not on the Sky platform.  The witness from the Department gave the impression that a request had been received but would have to go to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, first.  I asked what stage the application was at and was told that it was with the BAI.  An individual who was watching proceedings carefully felt that what was said was not true and submitted an FOI request to the BAI which confirmed that it had received no such application.  The letter from the Department does not correct the record.  Evidence was given in public by a very senior assistant secretary of a Department that was not accurate.  We had a similar issue this morning and brought the people involved before us.  While I do not propose that we go to that stage on this issue, we would not have known about it were it not for a vigilant member of the public contacting us to tell us what was said was incorrect.  That has been proven to be the case.  In the meantime, the assistant secretary has written to the committee to explain the background and context but has not corrected the record.  </p></speech>

We are going to write to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to confirm its understanding of the situation, because it was referred to by the Department, which I do not think was correct.  We will also write to Dee Forbes of RT&Eacute; because all the senior people from RT&Eacute; were here and they had to know that there was no request to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland because it had not even made a request to the Minister to have RT&Eacute; 2+1 put onto the Sky platform.  I put in a parliamentary question the other day and received a written answer on Tuesday night.  The Minister said, however, that to date he has not received any formal proposal from RT&Eacute; requesting permission to transmit an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  In the D&aacute;il on Wednesday night, the Minister said no such proposal had been lodged.  Both RT&Eacute; and the Department allowed the discussion to take place as to where the process was.  I gather that informal discussions may have taken place but a formal proposal was never made so I am asking RT&Eacute; to clarify its position.  Specifically, I want to ask it if there is such a thing as an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel, because somebody has told me it does not even exist yet, never mind being on the Sky platform.  We want the record to be corrected and we do not want there to be a lot of beating around the bush, referring to context and background, etc.  What was said on the record was not accurate and it is to be corrected and apologised for.  We will accept it in good faith if we get straight answers.  I take it that is agreed, as I have gone through the stuff and members will see I have been on the case.</p></speech>

I suggest bringing in the three Secretaries General but, in the first instance, we could write to them to ask them what they did with the cash.</p></speech>

My understanding, and that of the public, would be that it was sold for &euro;400 million and that was to be ring-fenced specifically for the housing crisis.  If it is still in Ervia and has not made its way directly to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, what is going on?  It is smoke and mirrors.</p></speech>

We all know why we are inviting it  in.  Some people will ask why we are bringing it in so I will explain, for the record.  There is income from the Passport Office, in the order of &euro;50 million, in the Appropriation Accounts which we are examining.  It is very much part and parcel of the funding of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Before the Secretary General comes in, we want to deal with the following items with the head of the Passport Office.  We want it to give us the different types of application methods.  We know about the online system but we want to know how many went through this route last year and until the end of May this year.  I do not want the average processing time - I want it broken down by days.</p></speech>

An Post parcel express renewal applications has a target of 15 working days but this is different from first-time applications and it is the latter where difficulties are being experienced.  There is a target of 20 working days in that case and it said in a reply to a parliamentary question last week that it was 35 days in some cases but some take seven or eight weeks.  I do not want an average but how many are dealt with within ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 days.  I will ask for information on applications from Northern Ireland and Great Britain because it says they are adding to the figures.  It says applications are up by 20% but 20% of what?  We will also ask for a note on the number of applications received in the various foreign missions, the number of Great Britain renewals and first-time applications.  We want figures well in advance so that we can digest them.</p></speech>

There are three topics: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Vote; international co-operation and the Ireland bilateral aid Vote; and the Passport Office.  We will ask the Passport Office how it is handling the &euro;50 million in public money it gets annually and how efficient it is.  We will all hear that staff are run off their feet but there is something seriously wrong with the management there.  In 2016, income was &euro;12.3 million ahead of expectations due to a significant increase in passports but we hear that every year.  It should know that summer comes around every year.</p><p>We will ask for an explanation on that.  Representatives of the Passport Office will be here next week.  </p><p> On 28 June we will have representatives of the Tax Appeals Commission and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in to discuss the write-off of taxation debt.  On 5 July, we will have the HSE in on its most recent financial statement which will be available at that time.  On 12 July we will have a report on the National Treasury Management Agency's financial statements which will include the State Claims Agency regarding the topics we discussed earlier.  </p><p> Perhaps all members received the letter I have.  We discussed the issue of the funding baseline for various local authorities and I received a letter, dated 5 June, from the Department saying a consultation process is commencing.  Members can comment on the process until 3 July.  If they do not have that letter I will ask the secretariat to circulate my copy because several members expressed an interest in that topic.  If they have something to say, that is the formal process by which to say it.  </p></speech>

That is definite.  We said we would consider doing another periodic report from the end of January up to April.  The secretariat is working on summarising the meetings that have been held.  It is not a draft report but the secretariat putting all the information together as a discussion document.  It will be circulated early next week and we will discuss it, perhaps, next Thursday for an hour or two.  For those who are interested in leaking it and for those who are interested in receiving the leak, it is not a report of the committee.  It is not a draft report; it is just a summary.  It is our starting point.  It helps crystallise and refresh our memories about what was said and the evidence we received at all our meetings since January, which will ultimately lead to a periodic report.  It is a first step in assembling information.  There will be nothing in it that has not been said in public session or sent to us by way of correspondence.  We want to get his discussion document launched before the break.</p></speech>

We will examine the 2016 financial statements of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and matters related to the fair deal scheme.  To assist us in our examination, we have invited representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland to discuss related matters with us in a short session before we deal with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p><p>I remind members and those in the Public Gallery that Nursing Homes Ireland is not a public body and its representatives are here voluntarily.  We are joined today by Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive, Mr. Maurice Pratt, chairperson, Ms Vicky McDwyer, director and Ms Sinead Morrissey, practice development facilitator.  Behind them are Mr. Michael McGlynn and Ms Fiona Kenny.  They are all welcome to today's meeting.  I apologise for the late start.  We had indicated that we would meet this morning.  We had representatives of the HSE and the State Claims Agency in and it went on much longer than we had predicted.  I thank the witnesses for waiting for us.  As a result we are tight for time and, therefore, I ask the witnesses to be as concise as possible with their opening statements.  They do not have to read it all.  The key points will be sufficient.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones or to put them on airplane mode.  Putting phones on silent is not enough because it will interfere with the recording system.  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times.  </p><p>I ask Mr. Tadhg Daly for a synopsis of his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.972" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018061400002#MM02900"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to appear.  The committee has received my opening statement and the associated appendices, so I do not propose to read it in its entirety in the interest of time.<br/><br/>As an organisation, Nursing Homes Ireland has previously provided this committee with evidence of gross inequity that has been applied by the State in the utilisation of the fair deal scheme budget.  We have had previous correspondence with the committee.  We also made a submission in March 2017.  The budget amounts to almost &euro;1 billion of health spending per annum.  The way the State spends that budget effectively means that HSE nursing homes are being paid fees that are, on average, 60% higher than those payable in respect of residents in the private and voluntary sector.  In some instances, the fees in respect of residents in HSE nursing homes are four times those provided for residents in the private and voluntary sector.  That is outlined in detail in appendix 1.  In excess of 70% of private and voluntary nursing homes are small family-run, owner-operated business with fewer than 60 beds.  Independent analysis provided to the Department of Health described the scheme as operating in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner, lacking rationale, consistency and fairness, only applying to the private sector and in the long run being unsustainable.</p><p>The NTPF is abusing its dominance as a monopoly purchaser, threatening the viability of the private and voluntary nursing home sector.  Last week, HIQA, the independent regulator, informed of the voluntary closure of five nursing homes during 2017 due to financial concerns.  Its report states: &quot;There are examples of certain smaller nursing homes &ndash; which provide a more homely environment &ndash; closing voluntarily due to concerns over the financial viability of running such services.&quot;<br/><br/>Private and voluntary nursing homes provide care in a home from home to more than 23,000 residents throughout the country.  Nursing homes are an essential part of our health service, providing care in the community in line with Government and cross-party support, as presented in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Four in ten applications for the fair deal scheme are from persons in acute hospitals.  Each year, almost 9,000 people, which is an average of 800 per month, avail of transitional care in private and voluntary nursing homes.  Without our sector, acute hospitals would grind to a halt.<br/><br/>HIQA's report last week stated, &quot;nursing home providers are committed to excellence and striving continuously to improve the quality of their services&quot;.  Furthermore, the regulator stated, &quot;inspectors met and spoke with many people who use services and found that they were well looked after by competent and caring staff&quot;.<br/><br/>Our members are tasked with providing care under the fair deal scheme for fees that are, on average, 60% less than those payable to HSE counterparts.  It is a fact that one third of the fair deal budget is allocated to State nursing homes that provide 20% of capacity.  The fees in respect of HSE nursing homes are not subject to independent scrutiny.  There is no negotiation process, no scrutiny of expenditure and no transparency, and there is long delayed and infrequent publication of those fees.<br/><br/>Another anomaly I bring to the attention of the committee is the myriad costs, including but not limited to capital costs and commercial rates, that are not included in the publicly published fees.  Appendix 2 contains the statutory instrument, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the commencement of the scheme.  The HSE, as administrator of the scheme, in effect pays the nursing homes under its control whatever fee it deems appropriate.<br/><br/>The most recent publication of HSE fees in February this year revealed the disparity in fees between HSE and private nursing homes has increased from 53% to 60%.  Over the 16 month period from October 2016 to February 2018, the fees in the HSE or State sector increased by an average of 11%.  Over the corresponding period, the increase in private and voluntary nursing homes was on average 3.9%.  Analysis of the most recent data informs the extent of this disparity.  Appendix 1 outlines the examples of County Westmeath, where the fee differential is 163%, County Laois where it is 122% and County Longford where it is 115%.<br/><br/>There has been some admission by the State that the cost of care in public nursing homes requires deeper analysis.  The review of the fair deal scheme, published in July 2015 and commissioned by the Department of Health, recommended a value for money review be undertaken by the Department with regard to public nursing home costs.  The review recommended actions and timelines to address any cost distorting factors that cannot be attributed to inherent differences between the public and the private sectors.  That was in 2015, more than three years ago.  Speaking to the committee in March last year, representatives of the HSE committed to the review being undertaken in 2017.  It remains outstanding.  In April 2018, the Minister for Health informed the D&aacute;il of the value for money analysis and stated the Department would work on the analysis throughout 2018.  We highlight that accountability and transparency remain outstanding with the continued delay of the value for money review.<br/><br/>The gross inequity in the funding of nursing home care is threatening the viability of the private sector and I mentioned the five nursing homes that closed last year.  The Department of Health's DKM Economic Consultants report, published in 2015, stated the fair deal pricing model &quot;operates in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner, lacks rationale, consistency and fairness, only applies to the private sector, and in the long run is unsustainable&quot;.  This is the pricing model set by the NTPF, whose representatives will appear before the committee after this session.  Of stark concern, the report warns: &quot;It is untenable that the State quality regulator can assess differentiated dependency levels and in doing so impose costs on nursing homes, while the State price regulator (NTPF) claims it is unable to reflect the same factor in its pricing decisions&quot;.<br/><br/>When the fair deal scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The review was published six years later, in 2015.  It pointed to the NTPF in its methodology used historical prices and, on many occasions, geographical location to set fees.  It stated there was a requirement for a review of the system to be undertaken within an 18 month period.  Thirty-three months on from this recommendation, and nine years after the introduction of the fair deal scheme, this pricing review of the scheme remains outstanding.  This is evidence of prevarication by the NTPF, inexcusable delays and a lack of transparency from what is, in essence, a public body.<br/><br/>To say our members are frustrated would be an understatement.  We reiterate our call for the publication by the NTPF and the Department of Health of the pricing review.  In Appendix 5 of our submission we have outlined what we argue are some pertinent questions the committee may consider appropriate for the NTPF in the afternoon session.  Our members are under sustained pressure to sustain services.  It is unsustainable and untenable that the State tasks private and voluntary nursing homes with providing this specialist care for such low fees, which are, on average, 60% below those applied by their HSE counterparts.  The inequity in the fair deal scheme is compounded by the fact there is no independent appeals process in the NTPF.  This effectively means the NTPF, acting on behalf of the State, can adopt a take it or leave it approach with regard to fees to provide care regardless of the consequences.<br/><br/>The fair deal scheme is explicit and definitive in defining the goods and services covered.  It explicitly excludes a range of services, therapies, specialised wheelchairs, transport and social activities that are essential to support the health, well-being and day-to-day living of nursing home residents.  In Appendix 3 of our submission we have included the extract from the NTPF deed of agreement which our members are required to sign to be party to the scheme.  Nursing homes are obliged to provide certain services that are explicitly outside the definition of long-term residential care services.  Accordingly, it is appropriate for nursing homes to charge for services provided that are outside the definition.  All charges for services excluded under the fair deal scheme are detailed in the contract for care and agreed with the individual resident on admission to the nursing home, as required by regulations.  The regulatory requirements stipulate registered providers must ensure that contracts of care are clear, unambiguous and contain full details of the services to be provided and any charges.  Our guiding principles as an organisation commit our members to clarity, openness and transparency with regard to all fees and charges.<br/><br/>It is also a fact that there is discriminatory or limited access to medical card services for residents in private and voluntary nursing homes.  When people cross the threshold of a private nursing home the services they would ordinarily hold on to in their community are no longer available.  This is discrimination of older people on the basis of where they reside, which is, in essence, their home.<br/><br/>The NTPF, as a monopoly purchaser, adopts a take it or leave it approach to negotiations.  The Department of Health review informed that pricing is set on historical and geographical determinants and, as I stated, there is no independent appeals process.  We acknowledge and respect the role fulfilled by the HSE in nursing home care and the dedicated staff in the public service.  However, very serious questions arise surrounding transparency, accountability and fair allocation of funds for the provision of care in HSE nursing homes.<br/><br/>That the Government committed to a review of the system for pricing is an acknowledgement that the current pricing system is not fit for purpose.  Appendix 4 of our submission sets out the terms of reference for the pricing review.  The committee will note that according to one of the terms of reference, the deadline for completion was 1 June 2017, which is more than one year ago.<br/><br/>The minutes of the meeting of the working group to oversee the recommendations confirm that Deloitte and Prospectus provided a draft pricing report to the Department in June 2017.  The minutes further confirm that the NTPF requested a revised draft to be produced, and confirm that the revised draft has been received by the NTPF and is being considered by it.  This draft report has not been published.  We are concerned about the delay in publishing the report.<br/><br/>The harsh reality is that the State wants to fund care for residents in the private and voluntary nursing home sector for fees that are significantly less than what it costs the State to provide such care.  Critically, policymakers need to ensure the system strikes a balance between value for money and acknowledging the costs and ensuring the sustainability of the private and voluntary sector.  While the private and voluntary sector is characterised by committed and resilient providers and staff, it is undoubtedly the case that failure to acknowledge the true cost of care threatens the sustainability of current provision.  Transparency must be applied to HSE expenditure.  We welcome the committee's examination of NTPF and wish it well with its work.</p></speech>

In effect, it sets its own fees irrespective of anything else.  Based on my statement, I argue that, given that a number of nursing homes closed last year and that the regulator has highlighted the fact that they have closed due to financial and viability concerns, the fee in the private sector is lowballed, which has serious implications for the sustainability and viability of the sector and for the continued growth required in the sector given the ageing population.  Quality will also be an issue.</p></speech>

They are quite vague and open to interpretation.  We have argued that there is a requirement for a model that recognises the true cost of care and the inputs that are required, recognising capital costs, the return on investment and all those elements.</p></speech>

At this stage, it is all maximum dependency because the fair deal scheme has a care needs assessment such that only those who are regarded as maximum dependency are accepted.  The average age is now almost 83.  The patients are older now and more dependent.  There are varying factors but it is a matter for each individual member to negotiate the fee that is pertinent to its operation.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund examines all accounts and records.  It has full visibility of the nursing homes' individual costs.</p></speech>

If I were a nursing home owner, I would have to determine the detailed criteria used by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, as a State purchaser, rather than just refer to historical fees that were set, as referred to in the fair deal review, or, indeed, county averages.  The former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, is on the record of the House as outlining that the idea of a county average bears no relevance either to the cost of providing such a service or the standard of care.</p></speech>

If one is in a public nursing home, for example, there might not be charges for social activities and social programmes so it raises the question as to where the budget comes from.  If one is in the private sector, however, one will have to pay for those services, despite the fact that there is one statutory scheme with the same rules for everybody.

The contribution would come from that or it may come from families who would contribute.  It would be with the agreement of the resident.  It would be outlined in the contract for care, as required by the regulations.  It is clear and transparent.

Based on feedback from our members, we argue that it is done on a take it or leave it basis.  I am sure that members of this committee and other Deputies will have received representations on this model.  Existing nursing homes have a deed of agreement that runs for a defined period, perhaps one, two or three years, at which point it comes up for renegotiation.  In the case of a new nursing home, it would have to contact the NTPF and enter negotiations.  It highlights what we see as a lack of sophistication in the model.  Sometimes it is based on the average county rate, irrespective of the service provided.</p></speech>

The private and voluntary sector is clearly providing that.  Our concern relates to the residents.  If we keep putting pressure on fees, it will have an impact on the viability and sustainability of services, and on standards.  As I noted in my opening statement, the State knows what it costs to provide 24-7 residential care, because it pays that in its own facilities, but then it tries to pay up to 60% less in the private and voluntary sector.  There is a benchmark, which is what the State is paying its own facilities.</p></speech>

According to HIQA reports, the standard of building and physical environment in the private sector is better than many in the State sector.  Dependency levels is a line thrown out from time to time but in effect there is a care and needs assessment.  All those who are assessed as requiring residential care are assessed by the HSE.  The Dementia Services Information and Development Centre highlighted that the HSE was much more restrictive in its admission policy regarding residents who are not independently mobile.</p></speech>

Sometimes older buildings are more costly because they are not purpose-built.  It might require additional staff to move people around and so on, and there can be historical costs such as pensions.  Has Nursing Homes Ireland conducted an analysis or does it have the documentation to demonstrate that it is a like for like cost?</p></speech>

The value for money review is being undertaken because the State is concerned that HSE costs are spiralling out of control.  In a 16-month period, between October 2016 and February 2018, there was an 11% increase.  I have provided the members with the figures.  They can see that it would be an understatement to say that the differential is significant.  That is why the value for money review is important to get a handle on what the costs are and to verify their legitimacy.</p></speech>

The fact that is provided for in the terms of reference is an acknowledgement that there is a lack of transparency in the current model.  The other two terms we would highlight are  No. 6, which highlights that particular consideration should be given to an independent appeals mechanism, which is currently absent, and No. 7, which referred to the appropriateness or otherwise of a system where it can be proofed against inflation in relevant areas of cost for a number of years.</p></speech>

In that case, there should be an independent appeal, having exhausted internal mechanisms.  We do not suggest that everybody should go to independent appeal at the first hurdle.  Rather, there would be an internal process and, all things being equal, when negotiations break down, it would go to external appeal.</p></speech>

That is the point I was making in my opening statement.  Under the regulations, nursing homes are obliged to provide a range of activities and services for residents to ensure their quality of life.  However, these matters are expressly excluded under the fair deal scheme.  That is the disconnect.  On the one hand, an arm of the State has sets standards, with which we agree and support, for the provision of a range of facilities and services, while, on the other, a different arm of the State has not included these matters in the fair deal scheme.  That is where the element of charges arises.</p></speech>

Nursing homes are providing people with individualised care plans that meet their particular needs.  The Deputy's will and preferences might differ from mine, for example.</p></speech>

The nursing home sector is important.  As Mr. Daly stated, hospitals would effectively grind to a halt if the sector did not operate efficiently.  When one considers that 30,000 people call one of the 458 private or voluntary facilities or the 122 public facilities home, it crystalises how important the sector is.</p> <p>  That 79% of facilities are private makes the points the witnesses have articulated for us all the more important in how we tease out the funding mechanisms.  In the HSE's 2016 accounts some &euro;900 million was allocated for nursing home support schemes.  From a public expenditure point of view, the Comptroller and Auditor General would be interested in examining how that nearly &euro;1 billion was spent and, if there were significant disparities in the funding models, determining how to go about addressing them.  The facts outlined by the witnesses speak for themselves and show the major disparities.  Under the fair deal scheme, a private provider has an average spend of &euro;35,000 versus an average spend of &euro;71,000 in the public sphere.</p> <p>  Deputy Marc MacSharry touched on the issue of geography.  The methodology is similar to that used to fund local authorities.  It is difficult to work out from the graph on screen.  The Deputy used the example of Dublin versus Sligo and cited land costs.  In my county of Meath there is an average weekly cost of &euro;1,600 in the public sector versus &euro;2,200 in the adjoining county of Westmeath, which is difficult to understand.</p> <p>  Mr. Daly touched on the type of care provided.  According to his opening statement, many people with dementia were refused admission to HSE-operated facilities because they were "not independently mobile".  If those with the most pressing and complex needs find themselves in private nursing homes and public homes are being funded to the tune of twice what private providers are receiving, how does it impact on the quality of care provision by and the resources available to private providers?  I am interested in hearing his views on how such homes are even surviving.</p></speech>

In essence, it is why we are before the committee.  Recently, we engaged with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and met some of his officials who were undertaking an examination of the scheme.  The Deputy referenced my opening statement.  It was not us saying it-----</p></speech>

It also states, curiously, that HSE facilities which receive the highest payments because they are said to be accommodating those with the highest needs are more restrictive.  We see this on an ongoing basis.  Likewise, the review of the fair deal scheme's pricing methodology referred to this approach lacking logic, being ad hoc and only applying to the private sector.  When it was introduced in 2009, the aim of the fair deal scheme was to ensure equity and fairness for all residents and providers.  Instead, the disparity with what the HSE pays for its own facilities has grown since.  It is putting significant pressure on our sustainability.  This has been verified independently by HIQA which has outlined that five nursing homes closed voluntarily in 2017.</p></speech>

It would not be in anyone's interests, particularly given that we have an ageing population, but it is the reality and what I am hearing every day from our members who are literally living hand to mouth in trying to keep their businesses afloat.  More than 70% are small family-run businesses.  I argue that many providers are probably not remunerating themselves appropriately for their work.  Family members may be helping out in many cases.  That is the reality on the ground for a 24/7 business.</p> <p>  On quality, HIQA's previous report pointed out that providers were striving continuously to improve their services.  However, if we continue to exert downward pressure on fees, it will have a serious impact on the sustainability of services and quality.</p></speech>

He outlined how it is explicit in what it provides, namely, basic care, bed and board, bedding and laundry but it does not include such basic things as newspapers, hairdressing, activities and transport.  This is an issue I raised with the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall when he was before the Committee on Public Petitions two weeks ago.  He was talking about dealing with complaints from nursing homes and he touched on this specific issue because he said it was leading to the impoverishment of our elderly.  He said that he saw situations where grandchildren were coming into nursing homes with more money in their pockets than the grandparents they were visiting and that was leading to an eroding of the autonomy of these people.  He was looking at a case where they had maybe &euro;7 per week to live on.  I raised this with the Taoiseach on Tuesday and again he was kicking to touch saying that Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, was looking at it and so on.  I ask Mr. Daly to comment on that in terms of the contract for care and what needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

When the scheme was launched in 2009, as an organisation we sought leave for judicial review of the scheme on the basis of the definition of long-term residential care services.  We were very concerned at the narrow definition of long-term residential care services and the fact that it explicitly excluded many of the services that would be regarded as being included in such a scheme.  We concur with the Ombudsman's concern around the fact that on the one hand a resident pays 80% of his or her income and then on the other hand he or she is told that it does not cover everything because the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, under section 40 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, has defined a long-term residential care service.  That is why we have included that in appendix three to show the committee exactly what is included and excluded.</p></speech>

If there is a situation where the Ombudsman is coming into a committee and saying that it is leading to the impoverishment of our elderly people and that their grandchildren have more money in their pockets than they do, it is not a case that they are living.  They are just seeing out their time; it is like a jail sentence.  I agree that it has to be addressed.</p> <p>  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for his view on the huge amount of public money that is being put into this sector and how we can look at a situation where care is being provided on the private side and is complying with Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards at an average spend of &euro;35,000 and yet double the amount of money is being spent in the public side.

I will start with the pricing review.  Mr. Daly said it has been overdue for two or three years.  Who is holding up the pricing review and who is involved?  What role do the NTPF, the HSE, the Minister and the Department of Health play?  Among all four of those, who decides on what will happen in the future?  Why is it being held up?  What does Mr. Daly think the reason is that the review is not taking place sooner rather than later?</p></speech>

As I understand it, the minutes that have been released under freedom of information confirm that Deloitte and Prospectus submitted their piece on time.  In essence that is a question for the NTPF which will be in this afternoon because we are concerned at the delay and prevarication around publishing that review.</p></speech>

The Health Act 2007 and subsequently the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 are set by the Department of Health and the Minister and ratified by the Oireachtas, so that is that element of it.  The HSE is the administrator of the scheme so it administers the budget on an annual basis and the NTPF has a role which is confined to negotiating with the private sector.</p></speech>

They are only caring for 20% of residents.  That means that 80% are in voluntary and private nursing homes.  That is very unfair and the figures Mr. Daly is throwing out do not sound right to me.  One third of all the money that is being spent is going towards 20% of the care.  That means two thirds is going to 80% of the care.  Straight away there is something wrong and there are questions marks over that.  In my own county of Kilkenny, there is one nursing home and eight voluntary and private homes.  I get representation on a continuous basis from the private nursing homes in my area, which is natural being a local politician.  The voluntary sector has to fundraise.  I know that because there are one or two of them very near to me.  I give towards the fundraising as well because it is just to keep the doors open.  This sounds very wrong.  One nursing home in Kilkenny costs &euro;1,596 per week while in the voluntary and private sectors, it costs &euro;901 per week.  That is almost &euro;600 of a difference, or 77%, according to the chart in front of us.  That is massive money.  I want to keep all the services open because they are all needed but that shows there is an awful anomaly between the public, private and voluntary spheres.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.1101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018061400002#RR02700"><p>Absolutely and that was the point of producing such a table so that the members of the Committee of Public Accounts could try to get to the bottom of this anomaly and inequity, through the value for money review and through their dealings with public bodies such as the HSE, the NTPF and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

I know that private nursing homes are under pressure.  When I am out canvassing, I go into them and I am told they are trying to keep the doors open and provide a service but it is getting harder.  It tells its own story.</p> <p>  How does Mr. Daly think the fair deal scheme is working?  It was a good idea when it was introduced by the then Minister for Health, Mary Harney, and everyone was delighted with it.  How does he think it is working now from his perspective and the perspective of private nursing home providers?</p></speech>

From the residents' point of view the fair deal scheme is a good one as there is certainty around the availability of nursing home care and it means that people know in advance how much they have to contribute themselves based on their income and their assets.</p><p>From the point of view of operators and representative bodies, the pricing element is deeply flawed.  The pricing review committed to dealing with and addressing that, but the delay in that regard is having a negative and very severe impact.  As Deputy Aylward stated, it is becoming more difficult for people to keep the doors open because of the cost of operating, the dependency level of older people, the cost and complexity of care, the cost of regulation and commercial rates.  Costs are only going one way while our members are trying to maintain value for money, to use Deputy Connolly's phrase.  There comes a tipping point, however, at which operators will no longer be able to sustain viable services.</p></speech>

Last year, we raised with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and other farmer representative bodies the issue of discrepancies which mitigate against agriculture and probably private business as well.  I refer to the cap of three years or 7.5% on individuals which does not apply to members of the farming community.  I would like to ascertain where Mr. Daly stands on that issue as a private supplier before I raise it with the next grouping to come before the committee.</p></speech>

We have engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and understand that an amendment to remove that provision, which the farming community regard as unfair, is with the Office of the Attorney General.  That is a matter for Deputies and policymakers.  I suggest that the definition of long-term residential care services, as mentioned by Deputy Cassells, should also be considered when amendments are being made to the scheme.</p></speech>

He mentioned medical cards.  Is he of the view that people lose their medical cards when they go into private nursing homes?  I did not understand the point he made in his statement in that regard.  If a person is entitled to a medical card and goes into a private nursing home, he or she does not lose the entitlement to that medical card.  What point was Mr. Daly making in regard to medical cards?</p></speech>

For example, the provision of occupational therapy or physiotherapy to a person in the community is given a higher priority.  In regard to persons in a nursing home, we have letters on file from the HSE stating that it does not provide services-----</p></speech>

Our longer opening statement references a report published several years ago by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the provision of such services.

To be fair, the HSE undertook a quality and patient safety audit a number of years ago which also highlighted that in some respects there was a postcode lottery.  It is back to funding.

The issue is more about access to allied health services.  I can revert to the committee and provide it with information and documentation in regard to physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and specialised wheelchairs, for example, to which a person would ordinarily be entitled but which are more difficult to procure when the person is in residential care.</p></speech>

Old-age pensioners pay approximately 80% of their pension towards contracts for care.  One may read in newspapers of issues regarding the 20% remaining being taken for extra services such as hairdressing.  I am not making any accusations but there are question marks in regard to how that money is being used.  The patients are old and some are senile.  Who takes care of how that 20% is spent and what money is left over?  Patients depend on someone within the system to look after that 20% of their money and to ensure that the services for which they are paying are being provided.  I received a phone call from a journalist prior to the witnesses' appearance before the committee in regard to the misappropriation of moneys in some institutions such as those represented by Mr. Daly.  I do not mean for my use of "misappropriation" to be taken up wrongly.  I ask Mr. Daly to comment on obtaining value for money for the 20% that is left and how the money and the extras are dealt with.</p></speech>

It is their money and they choose how to spend it.  If they reside in a nursing home, a contract is agreed with the resident or their representative which sets out the fees based on the individualised care plan about which I spoke earlier, in terms of their will and preferences and requirements.  It is all transparent and up front, but it is ultimately a feature of the scheme because the scheme excludes those services.</p></speech>

If there are moneys left over for savings, such as in the case of a person who wishes to save &euro;20 per week, possibly towards burial costs, who oversees that and ensures it is being done and carried out properly and in accordance with the wishes of the patient, in particular those who do not have family members?  If a resident has family members, the situation is different because the family members will visit the nursing home regularly and ensure the money is being spent correctly.  If a resident has no family members, however, it is up to the nursing home to ensure that.  I am seeking a general opinion on that issue.</p></speech>

We are concerned about what we see as a take it or leave it approach.  We are also concerned about the prevarication in publishing what, in essence, are terms of reference set by the Minister for Health and his Department.  The delay in publishing the review is a source of serious concern.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily about profit <i>per se</i>, but people make a profit.  I do not think it is a dirty word, but it is important that the service being provided be sustainable.  In the Deputy's own words, 80% of the service is being provided by the private sector.  It is a key feature of the regulatory environment.  In essence, all of our members provide a home from home for 50 or 60 people.  We want to ensure the sustainability of that service.</p></speech>

I looked at the Health Service Executive arguments, which claimed there was a high level of dependency for various reasons in the public nursing homes which was one of many reasons that led to higher prices.  Another was that its public nursing homes function in a different way.  For example, the public nursing home in Carraroe has other functions.  It runs a day centre in Carraroe and has many other functions in the community which a private for-profit nursing home would not have.  That was another issue raised by the HSE among other issues that lead to higher costs.</p></speech>

There is one scheme which is a statutory scheme set out by the Oireachtas which is supposed to provide equity for the residents and for the providers of care.  However, in effect, there is a much higher remuneration or fee payment to the public nursing homes than in the private and voluntary nursing homes.</p></speech>

I made the point in my opening statement that from October 2016 to February 2018 the cost of care in the public system had increased by 11%, cognisant of increased salaries, increased wages and increased costs of operations, whereas the corresponding increase provided by the NTPF on average was 3.9% in the private sector.</p></speech>

The word "boycott" was used in every publication.  Three or four newspapers published the article.  Mr. Daly was at the meeting.  He was asked a question earlier by Teachta Connolly.  He said he did not use the word "boycott".  However, he was not asked whether he used it.  He was asked whether the word "boycott" was used at the meeting.

However, he cannot come in and try to pull the wool over people's eyes.  If he wants to not answer questions, that is entirely his prerogative.  However, in not answering questions and not being upfront, in my view, it causes concern for me.  He knows perfectly well he was not asked whether he used the word "boycott" personally.  He was asked whether somebody at the meeting used the word "boycott".</p></speech>

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission would be investigating whether something actually happened.  What is in the public domain that we know about from the leaked documents was that it did not happen because there was strong legal advice at the meeting that the organisation needed to stop there.  One of the lines in it was that the discussion could give rise to a dawn raid by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and its members.  Obviously the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was not able find any adverse findings against Nursing Homes Ireland because it did not happen, but that does not mean there was not discussion on it.  I have gone through all the articles in all the media coverage.  There is no doubt that the legal opinion given at the meeting was that there was serious concern about being in breach of competition rules because of some of the language that was being used and the direction in which the meeting was going.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

The matter is only closed when everybody says it is closed.  It might be closed for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, but it was not closed for the Committee of Public Accounts which dealt with this in the past.  We have said we might come back to it.  Therefore from our perspective it is not closed because Mr. Daly is not answering the questions today.  He is perfectly entitled not to answer them, but he is not answering them.  Therefore we do not know to this day whether the word "boycott" was used, other than what we see in the public domain in the media, where the leaked documents indicate it was.</p><p>Mr. Daly is saying that he did not say it, but he cannot say whether he heard it.

This was a meeting that was discussing pricing.  The word "boycott" was used, or at least that is what we were told.  I refer to Mr. Paul Rochford.  The media reports that the threat of not taking in new admissions from the acute hospitals is a potentially very powerful lobbying tool, that as a lobbying group the biggest threat Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, and its members have is ceasing admissions and new beds.  The word "boycott" was used and the word "lobbying" was used several times.  Legal figures advised against going down this route and that it could give rise to a dawn raid by the CCPC.  Given that he was chair of HIQA, for Mr. McEnery to be at a meeting where the discussion was going that way was problematic for Mr. Daly.</p> <p>  I will finish on this, because I will not get any response from Mr. Daly.  Mr. Daly has raised more concerns for the Committee of Public Accounts today than he has dealt with questions.  I note instances where a witness appears before the committee, even in a voluntary capacity, and they do not answer questions.  There is a very real public interest in this issue.  The content of this meeting has been reported in the media several times, and Mr. Daly had an opportunity today to clear up some issues.  He could have said that the word "boycott" was not used, if indeed it was not.  That would have cleared that up.  However, he is not in a position to do so, which I think speaks volumes.  I think we will have to come back to it at some point.</p></speech>

As part of this meeting, we will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund on its 2016 financial statements and matters related to the fair deal scheme.  Earlier we heard from Nursing Homes Ireland, and the matters it raised may form part of our discussion.  We are joined from the National Treatment Purchase Fund by Mr. John Horan, chairman, Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive, Mr. Se&aacute;n Flood, finance director, and Ms Liz Lottering, audit, quality and research director.  From the HSE we are joined by Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, assistant national director for older people and palliative care, and Ms Deborah Jacob from the finance division.  They are all very welcome to today's meeting.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect witnesses to answer clearly and with candour questions put to them by the committee, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>Deputy Connolly has indicated as the lead speaker.  Then we will proceed with the other slots.</p><p>I apologise in advance that I have a commitment and I must leave in a moment.  Mr. Horan will make the opening statement.  He might summarise it as best he can because of the late hour.  Before he does so, I will ask him two questions, on which he can come back in writing to the committee.  I am not going to take up the committee's time.  I refer first to the waiting list initiative, which is detailed on page 16 of the NTPF's accounts.  The NTPF has done a lot of work on orthopaedics, ear, nose and throat, ENT, general surgery, and the waiting list initiative.  I ask the witnesses to come back and tell us how much of this was done in private hospitals.  I understand that in the past some of it could be done in public hospitals.  I ask the witnesses to give us the breakdown of this, the details of the waiting lists for these people and, to the extent that the witnesses can, because I know an average is only an average, the average cost of the treatments under orthopaedics, whether a hip, a knee or anything else, and the average cost for ENT and ophthalmic procedures on cataracts.  We all know awfully old people who come to our clinics and who have no quality of life.  I am sure the procedure only costs a grand or two.  I do not know the figures.  The witnesses need not provide the figures now, but I ask them to give us a full breakdown of how that money is spent.  There is a crying demand from people who have been on waiting lists for a long time for some detailed information on this.  The witnesses can get us the full breakdown in their own time and as soon as practical.  We would appreciate that.  If we have any further requests for information after we receive that reply, we can come back to the witnesses in writing at that stage.</p><p>Mr. Fitzgerald, who is the assistant national director for older people and palliative care, might send me, as Chairman, or the secretariat a detailed report on where we are in respect of Abbeyleix District Hospital.  He has been in contact with the people there.  A decision was announced years ago to close the hospital.  This has not happened, it is still there, and I hope the facility can be kept in public use long into the future.  All I am asking Mr. Fitzgerald is to send a detailed note by way of up-do-date information to me.</p><p>I am looking for Deputy Aylward, who was due to take over from me.  Will Deputy MacSharry take over for just two minutes until Deputy Aylward comes back?  I have to leave now.</p></speech>

The National Treatment Purchase Fund, often referred to as the NTPF, was established in April 2004.  The NTPF board is an independent body operating under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The board's financial statements before the committee in this session relate to the financial year 2016.  The audit of the board's 2017 financial statements is scheduled to commence in July of this year.</p> <p>  The role and focus of the NTPF has evolved over time, reflecting changes in policy and available funding.  The original remit of the NTPF required it to make arrangements for the provision of hospital treatment, either within or outside the State, for patients on long-term waiting lists and to collect and validate information about patients waiting for public hospital treatment.</p> <p>  In 2009, the NTPF acquired responsibility for negotiating and agreeing payment rates with private and voluntary nursing homes for the provision of residential home care for older people being supported under the fair deal scheme.  Responsibility for the administration of the fair deal scheme rests with the HSE.</p> <p>  In 2012, the NTPF moved away substantially from the direct commissioning of patient treatment and put more focus on data and analytics, pricing, and audit and quality assurance.  The board reduced its staffing levels to reflect its changing role and the reduction in annual budgets.  In 2015 and 2016, the NTPF provided administrative support to the HSE by disbursing payments to private hospitals providing patient treatment for the longest-waiting public patients.</p> <p>  In 2016, the NTPF received funding of almost &euro;29 million to pay for patient care and &euro;5.1 million for its other activities.  The NTPF reported an operating deficit of around &euro;320,000 for the year.</p> <p>  The graph now being shown to members profiles the changes in the National Treatment Purchase Fund's spend over the years 2012 to 2016.  Patient care expenditure accounted for around 89% of the NTPF's expenditure in 2016.  The balance, 11%, related to administration expenses.</p> <p>  The primary focus of the patient care expenditure in 2016 related to the provision of treatment in orthopaedic cases, at around 43%; ear, nose and throat cases, 14%; and general surgery cases, 12%.  The balance, 31%, covered a range of treatments.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the NTPF's financial statements for 2016.  The report draws attention, however, to the NTPF's accounting treatment of staff pension benefits.  The legislation establishing the NTPF gives the Minister for Health the authority to set the accounting framework for the board.  In doing so, the Minister directed that pension benefits should be accounted for as they are paid, rather than as liabilities accrue, which is what generally accepted accounting practice requires.  As I have explained previously to the committee, this accounting treatment for pensions is common to a number of health bodies.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce to the committee my colleagues: Mr. Liam Sloyan, who took up the position of chief executive of the organisation on 4 May 2017, Ms Liz Lottering, who is our director of audit, quality and research, and Mr. Se&aacute;n Flood, who has recently been appointed as the organisation's director of finance.  As I have said, Mr. Liam Sloyan was only appointed to the position of chief executive in the course of 2017.  Similarly, the director of finance has only recently taken up his position.  Therefore, neither of them was in office during the accounting year 2016, but between all of us, we will be pleased to deal with any queries committee members may have about the financial statements for that year.</p> <p>  We have provided committee members with some background material.  Rather than go through this in detail, I propose, by way of this opening statement, to deal briefly with some aspects of the matters.  In the interests of good timekeeping and given the late hour, I propose not to cover all the material supplied to the committee in the written version of this opening statement, the Acting Chairman might be glad to hear.</p></speech>

While not wishing to delve too much into the history of the organisation it is worth noting that in its first decade as an independent agency, the NTPF succeeded in reducing inpatient waiting times for public patients from their original levels of two to five years - depending on the category - down to an average waiting time of 2.5 months.  This was achieved through the direct commissioning of patient-level treatment for public patients by the NTPF - mostly in private hospitals.</p> <p>  In 2012 the Government assigned additional responsibilities to the NTPF and effectively signalled the end of the organisation&rsquo;s direct patient treatment commissioning role.  It also reflected a major resulting change in the operational framework of the NTPF, as this commissioning work had represented a significant part of the activity of the NTPF since its inception, as we have seen in the presentation by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The result was that the organisation re-focused its efforts on areas such as data and analytics, audit and quality assurance and its role in respect of the nursing home support scheme, which was referred to earlier.  Through these, the organisation continued to provide valuable support services to the broader healthcare system at a time when it was undergoing significant change and reform.</p> <p>  In 2014 a new NTPF board was appointed, one of the first selected under the Public Appointments Service process.  This board has a wide range of skills covering areas such as medical, legal, accounting, IT, procurement, personnel and general management.  While continuing to oversee the ongoing operations of the organisation, at that time this board applied itself particularly to the task of preparing the organisation through the development of a detailed strategy and action plan, all aimed at supporting performance improvement for the faster treatment of patients.  The outcome of this work meant that the NTPF was well placed to support the commitments contained in A Programme for a Partnership Government of 2016 in the specific funding allocated to the organisation to reduce waiting lists in 2017 and 2018.</p> <p>  On foot of the decision of the then Minister for Health in 2016 to re-establish the individual patient-level commissioning role of the NTPF and, importantly, with the allocation of the enabling funding, the organisation is particularly well placed now to make an increased positive and valuable contribution again towards shorter waiting times for patients.  I say this with confidence based on the organisation's proven track record of having done so in the past.  It is also based on what has been achieved more recently - in the past 12 months.  The outline of the organisation's objectives is contained in my written statement, which has been provided to the committee.</p> <p>  In order to deliver on the requirements placed on the organisation under the programme for Government 2016 the NTPF budget was increased to &euro;20 million last year, with a further &euro;55 million committed for the current year.  I am pleased to report that we have successfully resumed commissioning of patient treatment and that detailed arrangements are in place with private hospitals for this work.  An in-sourcing initiative was also undertaken to treat patients in public hospitals for specific procedures and treatments.  Through this process - and using &euro;5 million of the &euro;15 million allocated to us for patient treatment work in 2017 - day-case patients were brought into the system and more were then placed on treatment pathways in private hospitals.  A further tranche of funding was then committed to an in-sourcing initiative under which up to &euro;5 million was provided for treating patients in public hospitals.  In the second half of 2017 a third phase of spending was decided upon based on our experience with the first two private and public elements.</p> <p>  A specific target was that the active inpatient and day-case waiting list numbers would be less than 9,153.  At the end of October the number was down to 7,282.  We aimed to remove 7,000 patients from this list through acceptance of offers of treatment funded by the NTPF and a total of 8,192 people were removed from the list.  It was proposed that 700 of the longest-waiting patients would be treated from the gastrointestinal scope waiting list and as a result of our initiative, 1,382 patients were removed.  These are just figures but in human terms each one of these patients, and their families, have had their pain and suffering dealt with at an earlier date and have been enabled to get on with their lives.</p> <p>  Importantly, from the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, the NTPF can identify each patient and the precise treatment that he or she received.  We can assure this committee that value for money was achieved and that despite the funding allocation being small in the context of the overall spend on health, a real impact was made.  Our decisions on the specific uses for the current year's funding allocation of &euro;50 million for patient treatment were informed by our experiences with last year's approach.  By the end of this year, the organisation will have arranged treatment for a further 20,000 inpatient and day-case patients.  NTPF-funded treatment is being provided in private hospitals or in public hospitals where there is available capacity.  The focus will be on those waiting longest, for around 50 different procedures.</p> <p>  To date, in 2018, the NTPF has made arrangements for almost 9,000 inpatient and day-case patients and this has contributed to the number on the inpatient and day-case waiting list, reducing by a further 3,000 in the first five months of 2018, despite the challenges posed earlier in the year by Storm Emma.  The number on this waiting list is currently 7,500 lower than at its peak ten months ago, a reduction of 9% on the list.</p> <p>  Earlier, I mentioned the nursing home support scheme - the fair deal scheme - which was established in 2009.  The NTPF was given a specific key role on the pricing of long-term residential care.  Given the significant sums of public moneys, of the order of &euro;1 billion, being allocated to this scheme, this matter will be of particular interest to the members of this committee.  While the NTPF&rsquo;s role is very precisely defined and quite limited, through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act the organisation was given a vitally important task for the users of the system and for national finances.  Specifically, the NTPF is mandated by statute to negotiate with nursing home proprietors for the purposes of reaching an agreement as to the maximum amount that will be charged for the provision of specified long-term residential care services.  I am happy to be able to record that the NTPF has delivered consistently on this mandate over the past eight years.  The organisation has done this by setting up the system of agreeing prices, which had not existed previously, by successfully negotiating and agreeing prices with approximately 430 nursing homes and by renegotiating and updating these prices on a fully negotiated basis with each nursing home over the years of the operation of the scheme.  By the end of April 2018, more than 430 nursing homes had pricing contracts with the NTPF and the average price of long-term residential care paid to these nursing homes amounted to &euro;955 per resident per week.</p> <p>  Another key figure is that these nursing homes are providing care to 17,500 fair deal residents.  On behalf of the organisation, I assure members of this committee that the NTPF will continue its work to ensure that value is achieved for the taxpayer and that the substantial funds being made available to the fair deal scheme are maximised for the benefit of those assessed as being in need of long-term residential care.</p> <p>  The review of the nursing home support scheme has been discussed with the other group.  Any proposals to amend a successful system benefitting the 17,500 residents and involving State expenditure of close to &euro;900 million should be very carefully scrutinised and considered.  The NTPF is currently working in the first instance with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform in a review to ensure that viable and effective systems continue to be provided for both providers and users of long-term residential care nationwide.  I assure the committee that the NTPF has undertaken this task with all the due diligence that would be expected of us.  Our overriding concern throughout the process has been to provide the best possible inputs to the steering group, which includes the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This group will, in turn, bring its proposals to a broader working group that will include officials from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  When the review was initiated by the Department of Health, it was recognised by it that the NTPF would require professional and independent costing and other technical and relevant expertise to inform our review of pricing.  We have been working with Deloitte on this and it has consulted a wide range of stakeholders and interested parties.  Their work is close to completion and these matters will be considered by the steering group in the near future.</p> <p>  The remainder of my written statement contains information on the NTPF annual accounts, which are a matter of record and I am sure we can get into in more detail on those later.  As the chairman of the NTPF board, I wish to reassure members that our objective is to ensure the National Treatment Purchase Fund continues to be well directed and managed in accordance with all appropriate governance requirements.  We have a cohort of skilled board members, a committed executive team and employees giving us a base of significant experience and skills.  Our aim is to ensure that all of the functions allocated to us by Government are carried out effectively and efficiently and that we will continue to be in a position to demonstrate that all funding voted to the organisation is being spent as intended to reduce waiting times for patients in the public healthcare system.  I thank the Acting Chairman and members of the committee.  The members of the executive and I will gladly take any questions members may have. </p></speech>

People who have a requirement for long-stay care are assessed through the needs assessment process.  Although they would have long-stay care needs, there are different levels of dependency.

This was borne out and mentioned specifically in the review of fair deal back in 2015.  That was the assessment at that stage.  Dependency is a huge gamut, really, and it will have a variety of things with different personal needs and requirements.  I think there would be different issues there for people with dementia at different levels and indeed for people with different levels of physical need.  My comment from a HSE perspective is that we would still contend that in general the HSE will be able to provide the care for people at higher levels of dependency for a very simple fact that the model of staffing the HSE has is significantly higher in nursing than would be the case in the private nursing homes.</p></speech>

I feel that over the years private nursing home capacity increased significantly while public capacity significantly fell.  Again with good reason because with the introduction of the residential standards in 2009 and even before then, many of the buildings and residences themselves in public nursing homes were of poor quality and had high levels of occupancy, particularly in bedrooms.  We had to reduce our bed stock.</p></speech>

I saw St. Francis's home.  The Chairman is gone but he has fought a battle for Abbeyleix at the same time.  In the week it was close, the HSE made an announcement that there were not enough public beds, which was particularly difficult to accept at the time.</p> <p>  What is the proper balance?  What is the policy that the HSE has been given by the Government?</p></speech>

Our view is and any discussions I have had indicate that it relates to perhaps having no less than 20% if at all possible.  From a HSE perspective, we would say that holding a percentage of that level and nature would be important because the HSE is also obliged that in the event of a nursing home failing, closing or something catastrophic happening in terms of the residents, the HSE has to step in to provide services.</p></speech>

The National Treatment Purchase Fund was set up as a temporary measure but has become an institution and is still in place.  That is not a reflection on the witnesses.  It was set up by Government to reduce waiting lists.  I note Galway is distinguished by being one of the worst in the region, with massive waiting lists for inpatients and outpatients.</p> <p>  The opening statement mentioned procuring public beds in public hospitals under the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the mind boggles at this.  Its role is now to pay for public beds in a private manner in a public hospital.  The witnesses will see my cynicism here.  Two operating theatres closed in Merlin Park, which was nothing to do with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, but in the course of a solution a number of beds closed in St. Finbar's ward, a brand new state-of-the-art orthopaedic ward in Galway.  Are the witnesses aware that beds and wards are closed in public hospitals?  Are they aware that, in a centre of excellence in a brand new ward, beds were empty, though not the whole ward?</p></speech>

The Deputy said it was a temporary measure.  We did a lot of good work in the first decade but our mandate changed quite significantly in 2012 and we adjusted to the new circumstances to provide a strong measure of support to the health service, which was being reformed.</p> <p>  I smile to myself a little at the question on public money in public hospitals.  An ideological criticism has been made of us that we are giving public money to the private sector, that is, private hospitals and private nursing homes, so we decided to test the system last year to see if we could get value for money within the public hospital system.  There may be a blockage in some areas while there is capacity elsewhere and we try very hard to utilise that capacity.</p></speech>

I am getting to a point here, if I could, Deputy.  The bed numbers are growing, the number of nursing homes has bee fairly static over the past three or four years.  It has hardly changed.  The average contract term has gone up from 19 months, about three years ago, and it is now coming in at 30 months.  Private nursing homes are voluntarily sitting down to individually negotiate deals with the NTPF for the prices that will be paid under the fair deal scheme - taxpayers' money.  So, more beds are being committed and the term that the people are willing to commit to is being extended.  The whole thing adds up to a very large sum for the State's Exchequer so I would be very reluctant to say: "Let's have a new system."</p></speech>

They are the costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and providing evidence of value for money; the price that was previously charged before the fair deal scheme ever got set up; the local market price - there was talk about the inter-county rates and so on and that may be an area that is worth looking at; and, finally, the budgetary constraints and the obligation that is on the State and on us, on the citizens' behalf, to use those resources in the most beneficial and effective manner in order to provide and improve the services our elderly residents require.

I must ask about this matter because that is part of my role.  Therefore, I am interested in hearing an explanation from the experts present.  How can someone be charged &euro;950 a week versus &euro;1,400 a week?  The position of the HSE is that it has a lot more high-dependency demands than the private sector.  Is there any reason that the price cannot be &euro;950 on the public side as well?  I am sure that there is a level of dependency in private nursing homes.</p></speech>

That is the bit where Deloitte and Prospectus will provide the NTPF with an input to assist us in deciding what proposals we should put to the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will bring proposals to the tripartite steering group involving the NTPF and the two aforementioned Departments on the pricing mechanism element.  We are not looking at the total budget or anything like that.  I expect that we will be bringing proposals forward in a matter of weeks.</p></speech>

The nursing homes who participate in it and the residents who have signed up for it have done so willingly.  It has brought a degree of certainty to an area that was causing a lot of concern for elderly people and their families.  It has given them a degree of security that they did not have previously.  It has been a great success from that perspective.</p></speech>

I do not know how patients manage it.  I certainly could not manage if I was told at six in the morning that I could only use the loo three times a day.

I understand that recently there were some issues with regard to a new incontinence contract arrangement that was rolled out by my colleagues in primary care and which had some negative effects around the countryside with regard to supply, etc.  I have not heard of specific instances of charging for additional continence wear.  My remit very much covers older persons services and the nursing homes support scheme itself.  This service is separate from the scheme but I can come back to the Deputy in this regard having consulted my colleagues in disability services.</p></speech>

I am not aware of three pads per day.  Continence wear is provided to people with medical cards where there is a requirement for it.  I presume that in any of those contractual arrangements, when we went to procurement, we had professional people around the table indicating requirements.  If it is three, it is three; I will argue with Nursing Homes Ireland on that.  I will come back to the committee as it is not my field.</p></speech>

I want to ask a few quick questions.  I want to ask the witnesses the same question I put to Nursing Homes Ireland.  The Deloitte price review is being held up and Mr. Daly referred to it as "foot dragging".  Can the witnesses comment on the foot dragging?  Are the private nursing home providers and voluntary associations being included in the review?  Are they being asked for their opinions?  Are they all being included in this Deloitte report and will there be opinions sought from them on what we call a fair deal?</p></speech>

I will run through it quickly.  The stakeholders that were consulted under this review include the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform; HSE services for older people; HSE disability services; HSE estates; HIQA; Age Action Ireland; the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; the Office of the Ombudsman; Nursing Homes Ireland; a number of individual nursing homes; Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank investors; the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund; our own solicitors, Philip Lee; and a consultant geriatrician.  We are being exhaustive and thorough.</p> <p>  There was mention of the review that was carried out on the fair deal scheme.  It states: "In considering the financing of the scheme, the review concluded that the National Treatment Purchase Fund has done an effective job in introducing and managing a pricing system for long-term residential care facilities."  We have done a good job and got a system up and running.  It is working well.  It might be possible to improve on it and we are going through a precise and thorough process to ensure that if we change the system, we come up with something that will work and that will improve the system for everyone involved.</p></speech>

Is that a good move?  If a private nursing home signs up this month, it is doing so for 30 months.  If the review takes place and more money is made available, is that provided automatically under the contract?</p></speech>

There are variations between those durations.  The longer one provides a strong degree of certainty for the nursing home operator, the resident and the Exchequer.  There a fixed view as to what is going to happen in a year or two years.  I am sure members talk much more than I do about multiannual budgeting.  That provides a degree of stability and certainty that would not exist otherwise.  It is an indicator of confidence in the scheme by the operators.</p></speech>

A person based in his or her private home gets a service from GPs as well as all the other services.  However, let us suppose a person goes into a private nursing home.  Seemingly, from the evidence given earlier, that person loses all of that.  Does the deputation have any comment on that?  Should it be part of the arrangement when the organisation is making a deal with a private nursing home that these services should be included in the cost?</p></speech>

It seems to me to be discriminatory.  People in their own homes can get these services.

Certainly, that is not our position.  I was in the Gallery and heard that stated several times.  I would be most concerned if that was happening.</p> <p>  I wish to point out that when a person is in residential care, whether the set-up is public, private or voluntary, the person is being provided with 24-hour care and with a level of service.  These people are no longer able to stay in their own homes.  Let us suppose a person receives primary care services through the medical card or whatever and is provided with therapies and so on.  Those services are available at a certain level.  The service is a scarce resource.  The service provider will be concentrating on those people who are residing alone, perhaps.  Such interventions might keep people at home for longer.  The fact that a person is in long-stay care, regardless of the centre and whether it is public, private or voluntary, means that person is less of a risk because of the 24-hour care and service provision.</p></speech>

If a person has a problem, he or she still needs to get the treatment or care.  I think those responsible should review it.  I am asking whether your organisation can review it.</p></speech>

There should be no discrimination for a person because that person is in residential care, especially if the person has a need for a service.  The fact that a person is in residential care should not mean he or she should not get the services.  That is what I am saying.  I agree with that.  I am simply saying that if an occupational therapist has a long waiting list, in fairness, the people he or she is more likely to look after are those who are at home.  It would be a natural thing for the service provider to do that.  That would be a clinical call.  Let us suppose a person is in a residential care setting and needs a service.  Is there sufficient capacity to provide that service for everyone?  That is another question.  There may not be.</p></speech>

Indeed, this is our third attendance before the committee this year, with our most recent meeting being just over two months ago.  I understand this morning the committee will wish to discuss progress in respect of the tracker mortgage issue and the proposed sale of non-performing loans, and we look forward to answering those questions in a few moments.  Perhaps I may begin by updating the committee on developments on these matters since we last met.</p> <p>  In January we gave the committee a detailed report on the progress we had made in respect of the tracker mortgage issue.  At that time, we explained we had completed our review of mortgage accounts and we had identified 1,979 accounts that we deemed impacted and stated that all account holders had been offered redress and compensation.  By the end of May, 96% of impacted customers had received their redress and compensation payments; a small number of account holders have instructed us not to make payments pending decisions they wish to make.  That remains the position.  However, as we have always pointed out, it is not for us to declare this exercise to be concluded.  Ultimately, the Central Bank of Ireland has oversight of this redress programme in each of the participating banks.  Its review of our work is ongoing and we continue to engage with it.</p> <p>  At our meeting in March we gave considerable detail about the progress we had made in dealing with arrears management and non-performing loans, NPLs, at the bank since the financial crisis.  We outlined how we had reached out to the owners of 35,000 properties, how we had helped the owners of almost 14,000 properties to return their loans to performing status and how we had dramatically slowed the flow of new arrears cases.  In addition, we outlined the tension between long-term arrears management, as mandated by the troika in 2012, and non-performing loans management, as mandated by the European Central Bank in 2017.  At our meeting in March, the committee was particularly anxious about the inclusion of long-term treatments, known as split mortgages, in the proposed Project Glas loan sale.  This was as a result of their continued classification by the regulator as non-performing, and this is a real example of the tension described earlier.  However, in May we announced our decision to remove these split mortgages from the Project Glas sale and we continue to review how we might approach these loans in a way that will meet the objectives of our regulators in respect of non-performing loans.  Let all of us be in no doubt that split mortgages are classified as NPLs that need to be managed carefully.</p> <p>  A second issue discussed with the committee in May related to the steps being taken to return properties to market which had been surrendered to the bank.  I am happy to confirm that so far this year, we have reached "sale agreed" in respect of 539 of these properties.</p><p>We have also been in discussion with the Housing Agency on the use of properties in our possession and we have offered it 400 such properties.  We have also identified approximately 500 borrowers whom, we believe, may meet the necessary criteria to allow them to avail of mortgage-to-rent and we are in contact with them to see if we can progress the matter.</p><p> In the weeks since we last met there have been a number of important interventions on the issue of NPLs by the Central Bank of Ireland.  It has now been made clear that banks need to move quickly to deal with the high percentage of NPLs on their balance sheets if we are to protect the banking system and the wider community from any downturn in the economy, and that the sale of NPLs to third party funds neither dilutes nor weakens the extensive protections that mortgage account holders have when it comes to their loans and their homes.  I trust that these interventions will have reassured the members of the committee and the public on this issue.</p><p> I am happy to report that Permanent TSB is continuing to make progress on its recovery from the crisis.  Our business and financial performance is trending positively, our lending volumes are up strongly year-on-year, and our customer deposits remain stable.  We are on the way to fixing the bank which will be of enormous benefit to taxpayers, customers and thousands of PTSB staff.</p><p> That brings me to the end of my opening remarks and we look forward to answering members' questions.</p></speech>

The issue is the rate from which that discount is made and the rate to which they reverted following the period of the discount.  Is that issue concluded from the bank's point of view?  Those customers had a legitimate expectation of remaining on a tracker rate, but after the period on the discounted tracker rate they were offered the ECB rate plus, in one case, 2.25% or a standard variable rate, whichever was cheaper.</p></speech>

I highlighted that the bank only allows customers to sign up to this rate once.  Even as their loan-to-value ratio improves over time with reductions in their mortgage and increases in the value of their home, they are locked into the MVR they signed up to.  Many customers justifiably feel that is unfair.  I have received correspondence from a number of them who feel strongly that as existing customers they are not being rewarded for their loyalty to, and support of, the bank.  They feel it is unfair they are locked into a LTV band for the remainder of the duration of their mortgage which could be another 15 or 20 years.  In September, Mr. Masding said that that issue would remain under consideration and that the bank would continue to examine it, which is why I am raising it.  What is the current position?</p></speech>

First, we underwrite a mortgage at a point in time based on the risk.  Second, we accept that switching is part of the mortgage market.  Third, a functioning mortgage market also has to have a retention element.  Switching is switching.  In terms of retention, I committed to looking at the fixed rates for existing customers which is a key part of our retention toolkit.  That suite of products is under review.  If I could just leave it there, that would be great.</p></speech>

For the foreseeable future, I have no intention of changing how we do MVRs over time.  Switching and retention is part of our job.  My comment on retention focuses on fixed rates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.1711" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018061400002#D02800"><p>I understand that the bank underwrites at a point in time.  However, the risk of those particular mortgages reduces over time as they move down the LTV band.  The value of the home goes up and the mortgage is reducing, and, therefore, the risk to the bank falls and its security improves.</p></speech>

That is why banks underwrite at a point in time.  For us to be a vibrant and competitive force in Irish retail banking, we need to ensure we participate in the switching market and that we have the right retention strategy.</p><p>The focus of our retention strategy is on fixed rates.  As I have said, we need to work harder in that domain and we will do.</p></speech>

However, his answer on the managed variable rate, MVR, issue is not good enough.  The fact of the matter is that those customers are being unfairly locked into a particular LTV band even though their actual band has improved over time.  This is unfair to customers who are willing to go the expense of getting an up-to-date valuation and submitting it to the bank.  We have people who took out mortgages of &euro;200,000 when the houses they bought might have been worth &euro;250,000.  Now, those houses could be worth &euro;300,000 and their mortgages could be down to &euro;100,000.  However, the bank is not allowing them to revise the LTV band.  Such a revision can make a significant difference.  This is unfair on those customers.  From what Mr. Masding said, the bank has no plans to do anything about that issue.</p></speech>

I hope it will lead to a decision and action.  It is discriminatory.  The best fixed rate the bank will offer its existing customers is 4.2%, whereas a new customer can potentially get a rate as low as 3.2%.  If a new customer has a low LTV and signs up to a three-year new business rate, it will be as low as 2.95%.  The bank is taking advantage of customers who are trapped and benefiting from their inertia.  I have consistently made that point to Mr. Masding.  It is a fundamental problem with the bank's business model.  It might be that the bank cannot afford to treat those customers fairly.  If that is the case, then there is an even bigger problem.  If one goes back to question 9 on page 5, which Mr. Masding answered, it is an issue I raised before.  The bank has 57,000 customers on a standard variable rate, SVR, of 4.5%.  What is the blended cost of funds for the bank currently?</p></speech>

The Deputy is making three points.  First, I have assured the Deputy this morning that the fixed rate for existing customers is under review.  Second, as we have said in our more recent visits to the committee, our SVR is not a live rate <i>per se</i>in terms of new business.  We give all our customers access to MVR.  As per every public forum, I encourage customers who have SVRs to engage with us and take advantage of the MVR offer.<br/><br/>In terms of the blended costs of funds, the chief financial officer will answer that question specifically.  I refer the Deputy to page 12, question 35, which relates to the cost of mortgage rates to consumers.  The chief financial officer will give the committee a blended cost of funds and <i>prima facie</i>that will be a low number.  However, we do not price a mortgage just off the cost of funds as we have debated before.  Unfortunately, on average, the regulatory costs, the credit risk costs, the liquidity costs, and, in particular, the capital costs in Ireland are higher.  In terms of capital cost and the risk-weighted assets, RWA, the intensity we put against mortgages is much higher than it is in other European countries.  It is all of those blended inputs which create the price of the mortgage, not just the cost of funds.</p></speech>

Normally, the number of accounts would be greater.  Is it that in the case of a joint mortgage the bank counts two customers?</p></speech>

We need to bring this to people's attention because a significant number of mortgage holders are paying more than they need to.  I would argue that they should be paying an awful lot less than they are at 4.5%.  Even without switching bank, they can get an immediate reduction in their mortgage.  Is the bank still paying for valuations for people who are moving to the MVR for the first time?</p></speech>

That is a fixed mortgage rate into which these customers would have entered some years ago.  The rate is from a point in time but it would be nearly criminal at this stage.

Those paying that kind of rate - it is a crazy rate - signed up to it at a particular point in time and the terms and conditions were clear.

There is a calculation that one can break out of a fixed rate.  As the Deputy said, the rate was agreed at a point in time.  It comes back to our obligation in terms of being competitive that the existing customer fixed rates are competitive.  They are under review as we speak.</p></speech>

Is the bank looking at a securitisation option?  From reading his commentary at the time when he made an announcement on 16 May on this, it looks to me that it will likely be a securitisation option.  Can this be executed?  In that scenario, at what form of securitisation is the bank looking?  Is it looking at a scenario where the bank remains in control of those loans?  Will the bank remain the legal owner or the beneficial owner?  Will it continue to be the contact point?  Will the bank be the one making the decisions in respect of these loans?</p><p>I welcome the removal of those loans from Project Glas.

The question arose then as to how AIB was able to represent that its split mortgages were not non-performing.  They were classified as performing whereas ours ended up being non-performing.  It is true to say that banks have structured their split mortgages in different ways.  One of Deputy Pearse Doherty's colleagues in the European Parliament received a detailed response from Ms Dani&egrave;le Nouy in April.  That was a clarification of the interpretation of the regulations and that confirmed the position that Mr. Masding has outlined.  Our split mortgages today are classified as non-performing.  It is also clear that when we structured our split mortgage in 2012 and 2013, we could not possibly have anticipated how the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, would clarify the regulations a number of years later.</p> <p>  There is a distinction between the economics of the split mortgage for us and the economics of the split mortgage for AIB.  Split mortgages make up about one sixth of our forbearance treatments.  In AIB, they make up about 6% of its overall forbearance treatments.  It is a much more prevalent treatment for us.  The key distinction is that the level of the warehouse we offered is much higher than it is in AIB.  As we understand it, the size of the warehouse in AIB is typically less than 20%.  We have been, as we described, more generous on the level of warehouses we have been willing to offer.  We have gone as high as 80%.  Almost all of our splits are between 20% and 80%.  That is critical to how non-performing loans are judged because there is a 20% threshold within the regulations on how defaulted loans are classified as NPLs.  There are distinctions and they are very important.  We needed the SSM to clarify the regulations, in the way it did, to us and to the Deputy's colleague in the European Parliament in April to be clear on that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.1748" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018061400002#F01500"><p>There were 4,600 split mortgages in the Project Glas portfolio.  My concern is that Permanent TSB - with all of the expertise it has, all of the money it spends on its advisers and legal fees and all of the salaries enjoyed at board level - has obviously considered this issue and decided to plough ahead with the sale of 4,600 split mortgage performing loans.  As Mr. Groarke rightly said, we did get a response from the ECB.  That was because we recognised that something was wrong.  We are not involved in banking but we are people who hold financial institutions to account in this committee.  AIB could do it and Bank of Ireland could do it, so why could Permanent TSB not do it?  Ms Nouy confirmed to Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP, that - in contrast to what was said by Mr. Masding and Mr. Groarke - a senior loan resulting from a split mortgage restructure can return to being classified as performing.  She also confirmed that it can be considered a sustainable long-term method of restructuring retail mortgages, provided that the restructuring complies with all the conditions established under European laws.</p> <p>  The point I made to Mr. Groarke at the last meeting was that Permanent TSB structured its split mortgages in such a way that they are now classified as non-performing.  What Permanent TSB needed to do, however, and what it still needs to do, is to restructure them and bring them into line with what AIB and Bank of Ireland have done instead of selling them to vulture funds.  I welcome the fact that since that last meeting, Permanent TSB has decided not to include those 4,600 loans in Project Glas.  To me, however, that does not get to the core of it.  It is a welcome development because Permanent TSB's decision had caused much stress to those 4,600 mortgage holders and their families.  I just see incompetence here.  I do not mean that personally but that is what I see.  Permanent TSB was marching ahead in this direction until we challenged it at the last meeting.  It figured out then that there was a different way and that it was not necessary to do what it was going to do.   </p></speech>

We went into this in great detail in the last meeting.  Although our representations to the SSM are public, we have been making similar representations to the SSM since January 2017.  We only got an answer in April this year, at the same time as Deputy Pearse Doherty's colleague in the European Parliament.  We did not take this lightly.  There was no other choice until that point and until these capital market options emerged.  They were classified as NPLs.  The only way at that time for us to deal with one sixth of our NPLs, which is what split mortgages represent, was to sell them.  It is only since then that clarification has come from the regulator and the capital markets options have emerged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.1750" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018061400002#F01700"><p>With respect, the clarification came after the last meeting.  I told the witnesses at that meeting exactly what the ECB has confirmed.  I ask Mr. Groarke to talk to people in the industry, to legal advisers providing advice to banks and to other bankers.  I am sure there are conversations at different events.  The witnesses will recognise that what happened was that Permanent TSB constructed a split mortgage in a way that fell foul of the laws that exist today.  The split mortgages of Permanent TSB's competitors, however, did not fall foul of the laws.  Some of the issues that the witnesses identified on the proportion of warehousing are a part of that but only a part.  </p> <p>  I did not need the ECB to tell me that.  The problem was that Permanent TSB was marching ahead and selling all these loans to the vulture funds.  Permanent TSB has a duty of care to people who pay their mortgages every single month.  These 4,600 did that.  Permanent TSB completely abdicated that duty of care.  It was a bit too tricky or difficult for Permanent TSB, so it announced, in the absence of any clarification from the ECB, that it was selling the whole lot.</p><p>That is wrong on all levels.  Permanent TSB has now done the right thing in pulling them from Project Glas, but that decision, taken at board level by the bank, was wrong.  The board did not have the information.  If the bank needed clarification, it should have waited for that and it should have taken the right decision, which it is now doing.  I want to tease out exactly what that decision is.  Can Mr. Masding acknowledge that the decision taken by his board at that time to announce the sale of those 4,600 split mortgages, which are performing was wrong and that he should have waited until he had full clarity from the ECB on its definition of the bank's split mortgages? </p></speech>

I sat here before the Deputy at the last visit.  I explained to him in detail the relationship with the ECB in terms of Permanent TSB having one of the highest NPL ratios in Europe.  I explained to him that we are under advisement to reduce that ratio to the European average, which is 5%.  I explained the composition of our NPLs to him at the time, I explained that our splits were NPLs and I explained that based on the information we had at the moment, we had no other choice but to continue.  I sit before him now to explain that between our last appearance and today we received new information which meant that we could look at alternative options.  To answer the Deputy's question, I absolutely do not acknowledge that.</p></speech>

What he explained to me last time was this: Permanent TSB's split mortgages could not be defined as performing unless they returned to the original contract.  That is wrong, because now he has confirmation that split mortgages can be defined as performing loans.  I put the practice of AIB and Bank of Ireland to him and he said he did not have a clue how they could do it.  Mr. Masding also told us at that time that he was waiting for clarification, and that he had received no response to the numerous submissions that had been made to the ECB.  However, Permanent TSB decided as a board, and Mr Masding decided as the chief of that board, to sell these loans regardless.</p></speech>

That is what the ECB has now engaged with Permanent TSB to do.  At the last meeting, I put this to Mr. Masding.  However, he took the easy road.  I do not expect him to acknowledge it, because that is his form.</p> <p>  Mr. Masding replied to Deputy McGrath about the structure of these 4,600 loans, or proposals that are under consideration in respect of the securitisation of these loans.  When does he expect that the bank will make a decision on the future of these performing split mortgages?</p></speech>

I am a guest in Ireland.  I came here under advisement to try to help and to try to fix Permanent TSB.  If I have obfuscated, I apologise to the Deputy as an individual.  Those are not my values.

To be clear, I do not believe that Mr. Masding obfuscated.  He answered the question.  He defended the bank, his decision and the board's decision.  That is what I mean when I say that I believe that is his form.  It is not that he did not answer the question.  The expected response from him is what I got, which was not acknowledging that the decision was wrong.</p> <p>  I refer to the question that I have posed repeatedly to Mr. Masding and to his colleagues who hold senior positions within the banks on how all of this happened.  Has he figured out who was responsible within the bank?  I refer to the sum of &euro;58 million, more than &euro;40 million of which was taken wrongly from customers' accounts.</p></speech>

When we all got together in 2012, it would be fair to say that the bank had real issues and needed fixing.  I refer to operational fixes, strategic fixes and finance fixes.  It is a turnaround story.  If the Deputy's definition of "mismanagement" is having areas which need fixing, then I suppose one could use that.  We were asked to fix an institution which the vast majority of commentators felt was a zombie bank and had no chance of surviving.  The bank had serious issues, which we have tried to fix.</p></speech>

Given that we are in enforcement, I am very wary of making any statements which conflict with that review.  If I made that comment about Springboard, then it would be true.  Of course, Springboard is just a small area.  My interpretation of the question the Deputy asked was to refer to Permanent TSB because that is where I naturally default to.  We are still having enforcement conversations with that bank.  I do not believe that, in a legal sense, I have perjured myself in any way, shape or form.

He will not tell us things that he will tell civil servants behind closed doors.  He tries to close down any conversation on this issue.

It is known as an enforcement action.  In terms of the culture of Permanent TSB, we are working to create a vibrant and profitable bank, and that culture needs to be based on the correct outcomes for customers.  Everything we are debating this morning relates to what might be termed as legacy issues.  They cannot be allowed to happen in the future.  We are working hard, in terms of people, processes, and structures to make sure that we build the type of institution that defaults towards the correct outcomes for customers.</p></speech>

The enforcement procedures implemented by the Central Bank are very stringent.  There is a high bar in terms of the type of procedures used and the evidence adduced.  The bank can also hold individuals to account, like any company can.  Mr. Masding is relying on the fact that the Central Bank did not hold individuals to account in terms of its thresholds.  As a result, he has decided that his bank will do nothing.</p></speech>

We went through an enforcement action.  Is there anything he can say from the perspective of a chief risk officer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.1799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Groarke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018061400002#H02300"><p>There are two dimensions at play.  I was not at that meeting at the Department of Finance, but my understanding is that the context of that discussion was the examination of whether there was any conspiracy at an industry level - or indeed ill-intent - or to discover whether there were operational issues where things had gone wrong in the operations of the bank.  As I understand it, no evidence was found of a conspiracy at industry level.  At bank level, no evidence of ill-intent was found.  In that context, the conversation turned to operational issues.  It is very clear that the bank did not have the correct standards, processes or governance in place, and much of that has had to be put in place since 2012 when the new management team was installed.  It would be a very high bar indeed to assume that any individual would have recognised, in the period from 2006 to 2010, that those governance standards which are now commonplace should have been in place.  They clearly were not in place in Permanent TSB.  Neither were they in place in peer banking institutions.  There would have been no benchmark for an individual to say that those governance standards should have been imposed because there was not sufficient realisation across the entire industry that these standards needed to be in place.  That is why this is being treated as a systems and operational error as opposed to being a matter of individuals seeking to overcharge customers.</p></speech>

It denied my relative a tracker rate when it was in black and white in the conditions that the bank was to revert to a tracker rate.  The answer coming back on the phone - coming from management down - was that my relative was not entitled to a tracker mortgage.  I was there and I saw the tears.  I witnessed the devastation that caused to the family, because I know them.  This is not about communication.</p><p>They challenged the bank and told the bank it was wrong.  They referred to their contracts, where it is stated clearly, and still it went on for years.  In this case, it went on for years and the damage was done over and over again to their personal finances and wider social life.  It has also had an impact on their health.  The bank will do what it does.  It talks about systems errors and all the rest.  The banks will close ranks.  That is what is happening.  It is my view; Mr. Groarke has a different view to which he is entitled.</p><p> Finally, why is the bank still sending out extend-and-pretend letters to customers saying it does not know if individuals are impacted?  Why is that still happening?  These letters are still going out to customers on a monthly basis.</p></speech>

At this point we have determined the customers we believe are impacted, which is a total of 1,979 customers.

At this point, at one remove from the correspondence the Deputy or his constituents have, I am not able to comment.</p></speech>

By our own estimation, we have kept 30,000 people in their homes.  We allowed customers to take their tracker mortgages with them on a portability basis.  We gave customers with an SVR access to an MVR.  We hope we are contributing to the real economy with our 40% mortgage market share.  We hope we are getting a new set of young bankers and instilling in them the right values and behaviours for a banking system, which is important in Ireland.

We believe this is potentially an additional useful mechanism to the two appeals panels.  In response to the Senator's question, there tends to be diverse circumstances, including personal circumstances, some of which would be non-financial, that would come out in the course of the appeals process mechanism or the FSO process, such that I could not say there was a trend in the cases mentioned.</p></speech>

It probably would not be constructive to list all of the rights because as I said in light of the regulation and legislation that exists in Ireland in this regard it would be an extensive list.  We will look at including references to those protections in the letter.  As pointed out by the Central Bank, it is clear through the media and from comments made by members that the rights travel with the loan.  The credit servicing firm which an acquirer would use would have to comply with the regulations with which we comply.</p></speech>

We will see where that figure gets to.  That suggests that our sense is correct.  In fact, we perhaps were more optimistic about the number it may be interested in so we will see how that concludes.

Approximately 800 or 900 properties are being actively progressed through that process and once we are sure they can be sold and that we are not wasting anyone's time, they will be made available again to the agency and to the public.

I want to pursue a point made by Mr. Masding.  He made reference to the non-performing loan ratio of 26%.  What ratio are the European Central Bank, ECB, and the European authorities looking for?  In terms of the value of loans and the physical number of loans, by how much will Permanent TSB be required to reduce the balance sheet to get to that figure?  What is the plan around that area?

First, Project Glas and the other areas are those accounts which are in long-term arrears.  Many people are not engaging.  Many are in long-term and large-scale arrears.  That is why we moved towards that portfolio.</p> <p>  The second point is that the NPL ratio has a numerator and a denominator.  It is also incumbent on us to grow our business in order that we can have some denominator benefit.  The Senator asked why it matters.  It matters for a number of reasons.  First, it matters because our capital ratios are kept high and that flows through to the price of new mortgages so the broader economy pays, if I could be crude.  Second, the level of management required to manage the regulator, when one has an NPL ratio of 26%, is significant.  I am probably being loose in my English as by "management", I mean-----</p></speech>

I will talk about the number of people involved rather than the money.  In retail mortgages, we did just under 5,000 mortgages.

I wish to refer to Permanent TSB customers who have raised questions about their tracker mortgages back in the early 2000s when the issue started.  The bank at that time, because it was early days, did not have processes in place.  Therefore, when customers asked for correspondence, records of telephone calls and so on the bank told them it did not have a record of such matters.  The bank persisted with its position, as did the customers with their positions.  Finally, the matter petered out because of the amount of time that had elapsed and then, lo and behold, the tracker mortgage issue moved centre stage, in particular over the past two years.  Have such customers an option, with the bank, to ask for their cases to be considered again?</p><p>Considering the nature of the queries and how they were dealt with, given that it was early days and that the cases went through the process of the ombudsman and so on, which finished at some time in 2012, would PTSB reflect in any way on the circumstances of customers like that if their cases were put to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2016" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Groarke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018061400002#O00200"><p>There are probably three comments I would make.  First, we have gone back over more than 300,000 mortgages that were underwritten or in existence in the period from 2004 until now.  As we described, we had a comprehensive programme considering all the scenarios in which a customer could have moved away from a tracker mortgage or moved to a higher-margin tracker.  That is how we have concluded on the 1,979 customers whose cases are now subject to Central Bank assurance.  We believe we have done a robust job but we need to complete the process with the Central Bank.</p> <p>  Second, if a customer raises a new complaint with us, even if it is one we have dealt with before, it will go through our complaints process in the normal way and we will try to deal with it, including where it is renewed, as the Chairman described.</p> <p>  Third, if whatever is done on foot of the complaint is still not to the satisfaction of the customer, there is then the route of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  We have described that 28 customers are engaged in that process.  We have been able to resolve 13 of those cases through the dispute resolution mechanism, which the ombudsman recommends.</p> <p>  Those three avenues are available.  The complaints process with the bank and potentially the FSPO process are avenues to resolve cases.</p></speech>

On the basis of the information I have seen, there are no records of telephone calls or records of letters being sent.  There are comments such the bank being unable to trace calls based on details given and comments to the effect that, as the letters were automated, copies were not kept.  Now that the bank has had this experience, and in light of what is happening today, would it re-examine cases such as those to which I refer, pertaining to tracker offers in November 2006?</p></speech>

If the facts have not changed and we have not been able to identify any new information as part of the review we have done, the conclusion we come to would be the same.  That said, in an interaction between the committee and the Central Bank, the committee posed a question to the latter on the circumstances in which the FSPO would re-examine a case.  The answer was that if new circumstances that were not known to the FSPO previously became known, the ombudsman would re-examine the case.</p></speech>

I am referring to the new circumstances, how the bank now deals with all the tracker issues and the forensic way it examines them now, which may not have been the case in 2006 or before.  Forgetting about the FSPO, if someone still felt he or she had been treated incorrectly by the bank, would the bank re-examine the case in light of what has happened over the past few years?</p></speech>

At the AGM claims were made that customers were overcharged on variable rate mortgages, yet the mortgages were possibly going to be sold.  There was a question mark over the interest rate.  It is stated that substantive evidence now available shows that most banking institutions have overcharged on all mortgage accounts over the years, on variable and fixed rates.  PTSB is obviously included in that.  My understanding is that Mr. Brendan Kerin, head of retail banking for PTSB, met a particular group to discuss this and it was brought to the attention of the chairman of PTSB, Mr. Robert Elliott, at the AGM.  It featured in the media.  It has to do with IBIG, which offered the service, free to the bank, of forensically examining 20,000 mortgages that were being transferred.  The accusation was made, the meetings I referred to were held and the matter was discussed.  I would like to know the bank's response.</p></speech>

The first is where a customer comes to us with a previous mortgage, typically for a buy-to-let property, is unable to meet the repayments and goes through the SFS process.  We offer what we call a long-term interest-only arrangement as a forbearance treatment.  We have buy-to-let customers who are on interest-only arrangements in the Project Glas sale portfolio but they have come through a process where they are demonstrably non-performing because they are not meeting the original terms.</p> <p>  There is another group whose loans would have originally been underwritten on an interest-only basis, typically in the period, 2004-09, as described by Senator O'Donnell.  As long as they meet the terms of the interest-only contract, their loans continue to be classified as performing.</p></speech>

If one thinks about customers who lost their home as a result of errors of the bank in respect of the tracker issue, the average redress is &euro;44,000 and the average compensation is &euro;91,000.  However, the compensation for home loans has gone as high as &euro;146,000 with a write-off of &euro;95,000, and in buy-to-let mortgages of &euro;358,000 with a write off of &euro;350,000.  That is not because we judge one customer to be more deserving than another but because the circumstances are different.  The way the compensation is built up in the case of home loan, where someone lost the home in which they lived, there is a starting point of &euro;50,000, in the case of a buy-to-let, it is &euro;25,000, and then we take other circumstances into account.  The shortfall on the mortgage is written off and that amount will vary among different customers, depending on where they are in the mortgage, and we also pay the customer the equity gain that they missed out on because the property would typically have appreciated in price since the point of loss of ownership.  Those factors go towards different results but it is not because we judge some people to be more deserving than others because the specifics are different.</p> <p>  We find that most customers are satisfied with the redress we have offered.  There are other customers who go to an appeals process.  In the case of loss of ownership customers, who appeal to the independent review panel, the average additional compensation is &euro;40,000, and for loss of ownership cases, the average additional compensation is about &euro;96,000.  That is not a particular judgment on whether one person is more deserving than another, but rather the specific circumstances that come to light.  Typically, in the appeals process, we are able to take into account circumstances that we could not see as a bank.  Typically, they are non-financial factors around people's individual circumstances.</p></speech>

The appeals processe is one mechanism for finding additional compensation, if it is warranted.  We also see the dispute resolution mechanism of the Financial Services Ombudsman as being very good.  I mentioned that we have had 13 cases that were resolved there.  There are also cases where we have met advisers directly.  We are looking to ensure that we start with what we regard as a reasonable and often substantial payment of redress and compensation but these mechanisms allow the potential whereby circumstances that we were not aware of or cannot allow for initially can be taken into account.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2073" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jonny Byrne" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2018061400002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and for the opportunity to appear.  I will speak briefly on the statement I submitted to the committee and will be happy to take questions on the subject.</p> <p>  The statement is in response to the areas identified by the joint committee's 2018 work plan.  It focuses primarily on three specific areas: Brexit; the current issues impacting on Northern Ireland; and the importance of language.  Collectively, they provide an insight into key risks, which have the potential to threaten the future stability of Northern Ireland and the peace and political process. </p> <p>  There is a prevailing sense of ambiguity across and within communities around Brexit, coupled with an apparent neglect of any actual or felt impact it will have in socio-economic terms.  Unlike other regions, which have focused predominantly on trade, employment and the economy in general, the dominant narratives in Northern Ireland tend to focus on hard and soft borders, backstops, potential for violence and disorder across the Border counties, increased recruitment for armed organisations, and the requirement for more police officers.  In sum, these issues serve to further perpetuate divisions along tribal lines.  Brexit remains an elusive concept and, as such, many can only dimly imagine its relevance and impact on their daily lives.  To that end, there is a lack of direct engagement with the debate at the kitchen table.  This was particularly evident in the months preceding the referendum.  Consequently, it may be argued that people have only limited attachment to the wider debate and they do not feel involved or have ownership of any decision-making processes, which has a detrimental effect on any outcomes.</p> <p>  Brexit has also raised the issue of a Border poll and led, in some cases, to the enormity and multitude of challenges of a wider European discussion being framed as a single issue, namely the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  Accordingly, recent published research for the BBC in June noted that 45% of those surveyed would vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK, while 42% supported Northern Ireland leaving the UK and joining a united Ireland, whereas another survey conducted by Queen's University Belfast in May, 2018 concluded that 50% of people would support the idea of remaining part of the UK, with only 21% saying they would vote for Irish unity.  To some extent, this demonstrates the uncertainty that Brexit has generated.  It is clear, however, that in a divided society, people are defined by these positions and are influenced on the basis of their political and community allegiance.  Consequently, this reduces the opportunity for a wide, mature and evidence-based debate, beyond the constitutional issue, on the implications of Brexit. </p> <p>  I have listed six current issues and challenges, aside from Brexit, of these.  On the political vacuum, it is well documented that the absence of a functioning government has the potential to create a void, which has historically been filled by extreme or radical elements.  There has been some debate about how the absence of the Executive could create the conditions for a resurgence of armed violence, but as yet there is no evidence of this occurring.  Rather, there is a general sense of apathy and disengagement from the political arena and many are concerned and frustrated at the lack of policy implementation on key issues such as healthcare and education.  People appear to have become conditioned to the political paralysis that exists. </p> <p>  On violence, it is evident that within certain communities and geographical areas, a culture of violence prevails.  Political violence has become part of the historic narrative of community identity and, by extension, of belonging and membership in a community.</p><p>While the level of political violence has significantly reduced in recent years, the peace and political process has yet to eliminate the following: the tradition of celebrating and justifying the use of violence; the physical memorialisation and valorisation of violent struggle; the continued presence of paramilitarism; and segregation and division along sectarian lines.</p><p> As for legacy, the current consultation process on addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland's past should be viewed as an important milestone in the endeavour to deal with the past.  However, the debate has been dominated in some part by the information retrieval versus the investigations elements.  While the debate will afford the opportunity for many to have their views acknowledged, there is a risk that others will feel alienated and marginalised, which, in turn, will create further polarisation among the main political parties and their constituents, making it more challenging for devolution to return.</p><p> Regarding identity and tradition, in a society where the emphasis is on the promotion of shared values, the fact remains that there is no agreement on how to commemorate, remember or express and celebrate different cultures and identities.  The issue of bonfires and memorials within respective loyalist and republican communities are testament to this.  For one section of society they are nothing more than sectarian, triumphalistic symbols while, for others, they represent the traditional method of celebrating important historical and community events, and they are part of identity.  It is worth noting that parades are attracting less public and media attention, which has been attributed to local dialogue and engagement processes.</p><p> With regard to policing, the Northern Ireland Policing Board has not been formally constituted since March 2017, and this has a number of implications.  First, the principles of democratic accountability are undermined, as there is no appropriate mechanism to hold the PSNI accountable for its performance.  Second, where performance is inadequate, the board cannot work in partnership to support the PSNI, and where the PSNI delivers an excellent service the board cannot advocate on its behalf.  Third, the absence of a board has meant there has been no development, consultation or implementation of a Northern Ireland policing plan.  Fourth, the board has neither been able to fully participate in discussions about the establishment of bodies to deal with the legacy of the past, nor been able to engage with the PSNI on issues pertaining to resources emanating from Brexit.  Finally, there has not been a public meeting of the board since December 2016, which has meant the public has been unable to ask questions of the police.</p><p> One other area of concern regarding policing relates to the number of individuals from a Catholic background who apply to join the PSNI.  The previous recruitment campaign concluded with 30% of all applicants coming from a Catholic background, with just over 20% making it through to the merit pool.  Subsequent research by Deloitte identified a number of barriers affecting police officer recruitment, and the PSNI put in place a series of measures.  However, much of the evidence suggests that policing more generally has not yet been embedded within the broader nationalist-republican community and requires systemic change at the local level if this is not to become a critical incident, as composition is of significance importance for the PSNI because it directly affects confidence and legitimacy in the organisation.</p><p> On paramilitarism, the Fresh Start Agreement of November 2015 sets out the Executive's commitment to tackling paramilitary activity.  This was followed by the Fresh Start Panel report and the executive action plan.  In sum, the focus has centred on disbanding paramilitaries but we have consensus of clarity about on what constitutes paramilitarism in terms of behaviours in a post-conflict era, or who should be targeted for transformative work or engagement.</p><p> In 2018, language remains highly politicised at all levels.  Consequently, the use of certain terminology has the potential to cause friction, offend and ignite community tensions.  Quite simply, we remain wedded to terminology that is in many ways reflective of a conflict torn society rather than one with a peace accord that is celebrated for its capacity to end violence and consolidate peace.  To that end, the following terms continue to dominate public discourse, albeit in a manner which is paradoxical and contradictory: conflict, paramilitarism, dissident, punishment assaults and attacks, terrorism, security situation, organised crime, extremism, radicalisation, loyalism, republicanism, paramilitary, culture and identity.  In addition, language about the past and violence in general tends to be divisive.  In sum, the post conflict era has been influenced and shaped by language and terminology which retains the structure of our troubled past, rather than for the transformed society envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p> Over the past two decades, Northern Ireland has witnessed significant social, economic and political improvements as a direct result of the Agreement.  For many, however, there is a tendency to define this period as an "imperfect peace."  In many respects, this negative peace may be characterised as the inability to find solutions to deeply embedded divisions such as those pertaining to culture, identity and memorialisation, as there is a tendency to manage rather than resolve.  We are also inclined to measure success by the absence of negativity, whereby a difficult event, such as a parade, a bonfire or a commemoration, concludes without violence or causing apparent offence.  In many respects, Northern Ireland is a place where difference is largely tolerated, rather than being respected, acknowledged and celebrated.</p></speech>

It is great to see him again.  We have met on many occasions on the various circuits.</p><p>He raised three specific areas, namely, Brexit, the current issues impacting on Northern Ireland and the importance of language.  We are talking about hard and soft borders, etc.  The polls regarding a united Ireland differ widely.  Some reflect the impact of Brexit and others do not.  We live in interesting times and the Taoiseach's visit to Belfast last weekend captured something that maybe the political establishment is missing.  Given the welcome he received during his visit to the Orange Order in east Belfast and his visit to west Belfast to the opening of the f&eacute;ile, we are in uncharted territory.</p><p>Today, in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Mr. Dan O'Brien wrote an interesting article about an agreed Ireland or united Ireland.  For the past two or three years I have been saying that the Republic of Ireland should consider joining the Commonwealth.  It would send a signal regarding we are prepared to do if we want an agreed Ireland.  How would Dr. Byrne view that?  There would be many issues in the mix.  Many of the political and administrative institutions North and South would have to change.  Flags and anthems would have to be discussed, but we live in interesting times, especially with Brexit.  It is probably unfair of me to look for Dr. Byrne's views on this because it is something that has come up in the past few weeks.  Has he any view on what is the right approach?</p></speech>

Like most members, I represent a constituency which is culturally diverse.  More than 50% of Dublin Central comprises new communities and there is work going on to celebrate and welcome that difference.  I was struck by his reference to tolerance as opposed to celebration and after 20 years people in the North were coming close to celebrating difference but then recent events caused a deterioration.</p> <p>  His comments on the PSNI were interesting.  A group of us who visit Maghaberry Prison quite often and it is obvious that whatever the progress made with the PSNI, there is none regarding the prison officers being of a culturally and religiously diverse background.  There does not seem to be any urgency to address that matter.  I would like Dr. Byrne's opinion on that.</p> <p>  Other groups have appeared before the committee to discuss the legacy issue.  At the most recent meeting, interesting questions were raised about those particular groups which merely want the truth and to know what happened as opposed to an investigation.</p> <p>  Britain is a mess given what is happening in both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party.  How will that impact on Northern Ireland?</p> <p>   At our most recent meeting, I pointed out that the EU and Mr. Michel Barnier are pro-Ireland and looking after Irish interests and I expressed a fear that Ireland might get lost at the end of it.  The witnesses made the point that they had that feeling earlier on but that, increasingly, they are seeing a harder stance from the EU in support of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the issues there.  Does Dr. Byrne agree with that assessment?</p></speech>

It was also interesting in terms of how it was branded and how it was received by social media and those on the street.</p><p> There are direct comparisons between that and our own institutions, our own political context and where we are in reaching out.  If I am reading the question right, the challenge is that partners in the North and the South are needed for that and we have not even got our own house in order.  That is way down the line.  The North is a bit like purgatory with what is going on at the moment.  It is completely in limbo.  I cannot even begin to imagine what that process would look like when there is such a challenge in even getting our own structures in place.  Maybe that does not answer the question fully, but there is so much work to be done in Northern Ireland at the minute.  I cannot see beyond that to five, ten, 15, 20 or 25 years down the road.  </p></speech>

The British system was raised.  Very briefly, when the Westminster elections were taking place last year, RT&Eacute; asked me what I thought would happen after the exit poll.  I said that the Conservative Party would be mad to go into partnership with the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP.  RT&Eacute; has not asked me back on ever since.  Speaking personally for our own situation, I think there is a direct relationship there.  Every decision and every statement has to be read in light of other parties' position and the implications it has for Northern Ireland.  I think that will just keep going.  The current relationship in the Government will continue post-Brexit, because I think they are too scared of the unknown, that is, what would happen if they brought it down.  In my own personal opinion that Government will be in place after Brexit, because the unknowns concerning what would happen represent too much of a risk for those involved.  There is a knock-on effect on Northern Ireland and the paralysis that exists there.  People start second-guessing policy conversations and decisions, and the implications of the actions of others for them, potentially or otherwise.  </p> <p>  I cannot really comment on the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  I would be more comfortable talking about policing in general.  I note that prisons did not have a process like the Patten commission.  They did not have everything that went along with the architecture of policing.  I think that was a flaw, on reflection.  That is something that should have been addressed.  That applies to prison wings, segregated status and what we have there now.  The culture is something that needs to be addressed.  Prior to the collapse of Stormont, that was ongoing within the justice Department, and I think it needs to be revisited. </p></speech>

The issue of violence is interesting.  Dr. Byrne's submission states:</p><blockquote>While the level of political violence has significantly reduced in recent years, the peace and political process has yet to eliminate the following;<br /><br />The tradition of celebrating and justifying the use of violence</blockquote> <p>I was on the Government's All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations for the decade of centenaries.  While we were reflecting on the past, some would argue that we were celebrating violence.  At the same time, the committee was looking at what we were trying to achieve rather than how we were trying to achieve it.  I see that on both sides, especially around the 12 July and the justifications for the bonfires.  It would be striking if some of the comments written on placards, flags and emblems put on the bonfires were made anywhere else in the world.  In some cases last year an effigy of Martin McGuinness was put on bonfires.  It is a troubling situation, but I am not too sure how to rectify it.  The issues of policing and, as has been pointed out, prisons are of concern as well.</p><p>The committee did some work on the idea of a united Ireland.  We looked at the issue of polling, which is coming up in a court case in Belfast concerning how the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would determine whether the majority of people in Northern Ireland are in favour of a united Ireland.  The argument concerned polling.  However, polling is wildly inaccurate, as we can see.  I have looked at the background of those polls, and they are valid polls.  They have samples of more than 500.</p></speech>

Anything less than that is not valid, and above that it does not matter a huge amount.  What is wrong with polling in Northern Ireland?</p> <p>  The final point Dr. Byrne made was on the issue of tolerance and respect.  From what I can see, and Dr. Byrne would know it better, there are two traditions that are by and large living in two different worlds within the same space.  They are housed in different areas, they predominantly live in different housing, play different sports, have different education systems and never interact with each other.  It has gotten worse rather than better in some instances.  I cannot see how that is going to change, given the political dynamics.  However, I had some thoughts.  I cannot see the solutions.  Rather than tolerating, how do we get people to actually respect and acknowledge the other side?</p></speech>

They have taken an acute interest in this committee, and I find their research and commentary to be particularly good at helping us to shape issues.  In that respect, I want to pay tribute to Dr. Byrne himself.</p><p>I will start by saying that I am a nationalist and a republican, and I would like to see a united Ireland.  However, as I have said so many times, I hold the view that it is not about unity of land, it is about unity of people and purpose.  Sometimes I feel, particularly around Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement, that the issue of having a Border poll at some stage is more about creating polarisation than the result of the poll.</p><p>Concerning Senator Daly's last words, the words I have written down are &quot;How do you get respect for one's tradition and view of the world?&quot;.  Dr. Byrne's statement referred to the poll in that context: </p><blockquote>What is clear, however, is that in a divided society, people are defined by these positions and are influenced on the basis of their political/community allegiances. Consequently, this reduces the opportunity for any wider mature and evidence-based debate (beyond the constitutional issue) on the implications of Brexit across all of society.</blockquote> <p>Can Dr. Byrne elaborate on that?  To what degree does he envisage a Border poll arising, with regard to both unionist and nationalist tradition? </p></speech>

There have been three survey results in the past eight weeks on this issue.  That survey was different from the previous two surveys in which 55% said that they would remain part of the UK, with 22% choosing a united Ireland.  That amounts to three respectable surveys in six weeks.  If we do not have the architecture of a society built on the right values, issues such as a Border poll will by default come back down to the lowest common denominator, which would be based on principles of fear, triumphalism or "me versus you".</p><p>This may seem particularly negative but it is not all negative.  I have been asked to pick the potential points of friction.  A Border poll would be divisive because a lot of the time in the conversation logic goes out of the window and it becomes very defensive.  It comes down to myths and stereotypes, and untruths come into the conversation.  An evidence base goes out the window with regard to what will be the economic implications.  The most recent life and times survey stated 60% of people agree there should be closer alliance with the Republic of Ireland politically and economically.  There is a narrative on politics, economics, health and education, and on a different conversation.  I have yet to find it in popular conversation, as it becomes a default position on sovereignty and nationality.  If the architecture is not right within the country itself then anything else is seen as a threat.</p></speech>

Some of what he has said is quite thought-provoking.  I take on board some of the commentary on the Taoiseach's visit to the North, and the number of times the Taoiseach has been in the North, the quality of his visits and the events he has attended, although I would prefer if he had gone to Drumaness rather than Mayobridge but we will leave that there.  There is no doubt this is positive, especially in the wider nationalist and republican community in the North, and they deeply appreciate the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and an Irish Government which is very much interested in the citizens of the North and the issues that pertain.  Conversely we have a British Prime Minister and a British Government that has signed out of the North over a long number of years.  I contest that since 2010 it has had a thoroughly regressive partnership with the DUP, which has been detrimental to politics in the North.  We look at the calibre of the meeting the Taoiseach had with the Orange Order and F&eacute;ile an Phobail on Friday, but the best of the people in the North get out of Theresa May is a visit to a cow shed in Bangor.  Damage is being done.</p> <p>  We have also had to suffer the results of the number of really poor Secretaries of State, who are simply floundering when it comes to a number of issues.  To take one example, the vast majority of people in the North, including political parties, want the Secretary of State to take action now to reduce MLA pay.  The Secretary of State will not do it because the DUP is telling her not to.  A cosy relationship at Westminster is holding it back.  This is probably commentary and I am not asking Dr. Byrne for a response.  It is a converse relationship.</p> <p>  I do not get some of the commentary on the unity referendum, the tribal nature of it and how it will be polarising.  That is politics.  Politics is tribal and polarising, but it does not have to be toxically so.  If we look at Scotland, anybody who opposed the independence referendum in Scotland said it would divide the country and would be toxic, but it was not.  It was the complete opposite.  Village halls were full of people discussing what it would be like.  We should be careful with our commentary in this regard.  At the end of the day, the Good Friday Agreement facilitates the holding of a unity referendum.  I am certainly not calling for it to be held tomorrow, but as the Taoiseach and others have said, we have entered into an arena where people are asking these questions.  I contest that people are sitting at home at their dinner table at night talking about Brexit.  There is a great sense of the unknown about what is coming.  To what extent can we get engaged now on the protection of rights when it comes to Brexit, in particular some of the rights laid out in the Good Friday Agreement such as those on citizenship, electoral rights and representation rights?  As an Irish passport holder and EU citizen in the North, how do I ensure I will still get to vote in the next European elections?  If I want to stand as a candidate in the next European elections how do I ensure I can?  I have the same rights as somebody in Germany or France may have.  These issues are starting to come to the fore for people in the North.  I thank Dr. Byrne for his paper, which I thought was very inspiring.</p></speech>

Listening to the conversation and where it has inevitably gone is indicative of where society, North and South, is at.  We are gravitating towards the issue of unity and reunification because of the very obvious political dynamics at play all around us.  Mr. Hazzard said far more eloquently much of what I would hope to have said.  I do not know if Dr. Byrne would agree, but I find this recoil from the debate on reunification is primarily at a political level.  I live in and have the privilege of representing one of the most contentious, notorious - or whatever clich&eacute; one wants to attach to it - interfaces in the North of Ireland.  Touch wood that I am not tempting fate, but I do not see any evidence off the back of all of the recent polls, or in the statements going back and forward, of any reversal in the trenches or people being at each other's throats.  All of the work done through the flag protest, which was one of the most difficult territories we found ourselves in, has been sustained and is ongoing.  Loyalists will attend F&eacute;ile an Phobail here in a couple of weeks and have debates with their republican counterparts, in the way they have over the past 20 or more years of the peace process.  In my experience at a civic, community and, increasingly, business and economic level, people are starting to think about unity in a way they never have before.  It is an abdication of our responsibilities and commitment to the Good Friday Agreement if we try to discourage people from doing so.  We should be facilitating this type of national dialogue.  We should be emboldening and empowering it.</p> <p>  Within this specific question of reunification, where does Dr. Byrne see the role of academia?  Does he agree academics have not been as involved domestically, whether through research or whatever, in comparison with some of their international counterparts who are looking at this?  What value does Dr. Byrne put on this?  It is crucial that we have the world of academia arguing for and against to provide us with the necessary detail and information we will need.</p></speech>

The Conservative Party has no psychological or emotional attachment to the Good Friday Agreement, to be pretty blunt, because it was not part of its development, post-Major, or of getting it to the point we are now.  This has an implication in terms of how it sees Northern Ireland moving forward.  I am very concerned about the lack of decisions.  I have highlighted the policing board which, to me, is one of the biggest critical incidents facing Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  We are running out of a lot of successes of the peace process and policing is one of its headline successes.  Many sacrifices were made by communities, the organisation itself and elected representatives to get us to a place where it is a largely representative and legitimate organisation associated with keeping people safe.  However, we have not had a public meeting since December 2016, which is a disgrace with regard to where we are moving.  I do not know what the logic is for not changing the legislation to put in place elected representatives and independent members, but we need to do something on policing because it is not sustainable.  Issues relating to new officers, Brexit, crime and resources are all stacking up and we are not dealing with them.  This is directly related to the Secretary of State.  This is the big critical incident I see.</p> <p>  The issue of pay was also raised, and there are many other issues with regard to historic inquiries.  There are far better academics on Brexit and rights, such as Dr. Katy Hayward, and they are better placed to answer questions on this.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is entirely right that, at times, academics have been a wee bit behind in the subject area.  We have seen it on Brexit, where much of the evidence on its implications was lost in the narrative.</p><p>In the world we live in now, where people on Twitter and other social media try to convey their messages in 150 characters, evidence-based decision-making has gone out the window.  I think academia has a role to play in counteracting that.  The key is not to pitch it at a level that is too abstract for people to engage with.  Academics have to be able to pitch at multiple levels, for example, through Twitter, Facebook, social media, blogs, newspaper articles and academic articles.  They need to be able to articulate the same message at multiple levels so that everybody has access to information.  We sometimes have a tendency to speak at a certain level.  We need to be able to articulate.  Universities are in a unique position, especially in Northern Ireland, because their gravitas and neutrality means they are able to approach some of this stuff without an agenda.</p></speech>

I agree that we need to communicate and research these matters appropriately.  It is important that our communications are not confined to tweets.  We can see at bigger geopolitical levels just how damaging that can be.  I will not say too much because I am conscious of our audience in the Gallery.  Having said that, we need to be careful with the old adage of "fake news".  When people say that a unity poll or reunification would be divisive, it strikes me that partition has proven to be divisive for the best part of 100 years.  In saying we need to move beyond such notions when we are having this argument, I do not mean to dismiss people's real concerns, which should be taken on board and respected.  The State and the Government in the South need to move to the next point.  Quite rightly, Senator Mark Daly will be in here forever telling us about the State's constitutional and political obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not know what Dr. Byrne's view would be on the suggestion that an Oireachtas committee should be established to look at the intercommunity, political, social, economic and other implications of reunification.  Unfortunately, some element of recoil has hindered that from happening.  I think the central reason we are here is to advocate platforms and articulate political viewpoints.  I believe the suggestion I have mentioned would furnish us with the opportunity to engage with all the sectors, including academia, which I stress will have a central role as we move forward.</p></speech>

I will keep it very short.  Earlier this year, the T&aacute;naiste spoke at a celebration of the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement at St. Mary's College in west Belfast.  I would like to hear what Dr. Byrne thinks about something that was said during the subsequent panel discussion, which covered the implications of Brexit.  Both sides of the debate referred to the reality of the benefits of a united Ireland because of Brexit.  There was a bit of discussion about that.  A very interesting unionist businessman said that nobody had come to talk to him about these matters.  He said that in light of the obvious impact that Brexit will have on his business, he was open to discussing the issues involved, but he had not been contacted by anyone to facilitate such a debate.  I would like to ask a general question in that context.  I hope it is okay.  I hope Dr. Byrne understands where I am coming from.  Would it be possible to start getting such discussions up and running?  Maybe they are taking place, but I am not aware of them because I am down here.  Have discussions started with the unionist community about the impact of Brexit on their lives and their communities?  What would they like?  What are the benefits for them?  Are they open to discussing a united Ireland?  Would it benefit them?  What would be the benefits for them, economically and otherwise?  When we were in the Shankill Road, we heard about problems of basic human rights such as the lack of good housing and mental health issues.  I would like to hear Dr. Byrne's thoughts on whether the unionist community would be open to having discussions on these matters.</p></speech>

Brexit is still an abstract concept.  There is so much fluff around what will or will not happen.  There is a lot of fear-mongering.  As I have said previously, in some quarters this issue gets hijacked and it becomes a debate about sovereignty.  As significant numbers of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, as opposed to leave, the debate is slightly skewed towards those who wanted to remain.  Naturally, there will be a negative discourse with regard to the implications of Brexit.  I know that people like Dr. Katy Hayward have been doing a great deal of work on the implications of Brexit for various industries.  In simple terms, I think there are people open to that.  We need spaces in which that can take place.  That is the challenge.  Leadership is required within unionism to facilitate that.  There are times when a conversation cannot be imposed on people.  It needs to be led by those with whom they associate.  It is better to present it in that way than to say, as a<i>fait accompli</i>, &quot;we are leaving and that is it&quot;.  I do not know enough about it, but I suggest that this needs to be facilitated and hosted by leadership within unionism.</p></speech>

People voted in favour of leaving the EU for various reasons.  Since the decision was made, a great deal has emerged about the potentially disastrous effects it will have.

The best way I can describe it is that politics in Northern Ireland always seems to get taken to the cliff, but never goes over it.  We are told that if the Executive shuts down, no money will be left for the budget.  We always get taken to a certain point, but then we manage to keep the show on the road and keep moving.  The same point applies to Brexit.  It keeps going without much change, if that makes sense.  My personal position, having observed the situation in Northern Ireland since 2005, is that we always seem to be told that something is bad, and that we need an agreement on this or a signature on that.  It is suggested that if we do not have a Government or First Minister in place by a certain date, the world will come in around us, but that does not happen.  People's lives carry on and the world keeps spinning.  We are very good at that.</p></speech>

We met the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain to discuss the extension of voting rights to Irish emigrants.  The huge level of goodwill towards the island of Ireland in Westminster is to be welcomed.  I would like to ask the witnesses about a speech that was made at Queen's University Belfast by the former leader of the DUP and former First Minister, Peter Robinson.  Was he showing leadership when he said it would be helpful to hold generational Border polls as a way of stabilising politics in Northern Ireland?  Do the witnesses agree with me that his remarks represent a serious change in direction?</p></speech>

Peter Robinson said two interesting things.  He recognised that change would require 50%+1 in a Border poll.  That is exactly what is provided for in law.  What Mr. Robinson is flagging up, which to be fair to him is relevant and is relevant to today's discussion, is that we need to talk about this.  It will be 50%+1, or whatever the result might be, so we need to talk about the process.  That goes back to my earlier point that we should not be afraid of this conversation.  Here we have Peter Robinson, former leader of the DUP, saying we should talk about this.  It shows strong leadership to say to the unionist community that this is happening and that we should talk about it and the process.  Mr. Robinson is to be commended on that.  Much of the discussion since his speech has been on the generational issue but the focus of his speech, which people picked up on keenly, was the idea of talking about the process.</p></speech>

Brexit has stirred up this debate in which it is suggested that a united Ireland would be better than a Brexit Britain given that the sum of what the Brexiteers want would be a disaster for all the people of Ireland, regardless of tradition.  That goes back to the point Dr. Byrne made about the way in which society is structured and the political system fractured at the moment, meaning that no preparation or groundwork is being done.  There will be a referendum at some stage.  That is just logical.  David McWilliams has been talking and writing about this for two years.  He has written about the economics of Brexit, but also the reality of a referendum.  There has been no preparation done in the North and I cannot see how it could be done until Stormont comes back.  Someone like Peter Robinson needs to lead that discussion and point out that this is the reality of the world we signed up to in the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  The agreement allows for change on the basis of a 50%+1 outcome in a Border poll.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, appeared before the committee after the Taoiseach stated that an outcome of 50%+1 would not be sufficient in a Border poll.  In an ideal world it would be great to achieve an outcome of 100%, but the Good Friday Agreement makes clear there is no difference between 50%+1 and 100%.  The reason Northern Ireland is in the UK is that the majority of people want it to be in the UK, regardless of whether that majority is 50%+1, and the reverse should be true for a united Ireland.  One of the recommendations we made was to have a second New Ireland Forum at which all the issues of health, education and whether Stormont would remain after a referendum would be discussed.  There is a lack of preparation, North and South.  There is another court case coming up on 3 July in which the Irish Government is being asked to produce its policies-----</p></speech>

There are two cases, both of which are being taken by a unionist, Mr. Raymond McCord, whom Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile will know well.  The judgment on the case in the UK High Court in which the Secretary of State is being asked how it would be determined that the majority of people are in favour of a Border poll is due on 26 June.  It will decide whether the Secretary of State will be forced to announce a policy on holding a Border poll.  Will the decision be based on opinion polls?  As Dr. Byrne pointed out, three opinion polls have shown entirely different results.  The key factor in the case before the UK High Court was that the Secretary of State alone decides who votes in any referendum.  We should bear in mind that if those aged 16 years and older are eligible to vote in a Border poll, the outcome will be different from a poll in which only those aged 18 and older are eligible.  The result would also be affected if voting was restricted to British passport holders or UK residents or if it was open to EU citizens.  Even on that issue, eligibility is not clear.  In the run-up to a referendum, that issue would be open to challenge in any court and would be a disaster.  There would be doubt and a lack of clarity.  Information has not been provided, even on these most basic issues.  My fear is that everyone will revert to their corners.</p></speech>

There is a lack of debate.  Sometimes I think people have only woken up to what the Good Friday Agreement said and to what people signed up to.  It is about a combination of factors.  We are kind of advice-centric in terms of Belfast or communities, but if one looks at a combination of factors, from flag protests onwards, there is a narrative and perception that people did not realise the implications of what the Good Friday Agreement actually set out.  That has had an effect.  If we do not have evidence-based policymaking and healthy debate around a united Ireland, a Border poll or what the questions will be, it will inevitably come back down to basics.</p></speech>

With regard to the current debate, those who are in favour of bonfires argue that they are part of their cultural identity, who they are, their tradition and so on.  In the South, many communities are trying to eliminate bonfires, particularly around Hallowe'en and in working-class areas.  They are concerned about the impact they have on criminality and so on and the danger they pose to children.  People just do not want them.  In many areas in the North it seems people just do not want bonfires either because of all that surrounds them.  There is an idea that if people self-regulate on the issue of  bonfires, they will be able to sort out the matter themselves.  Senator Daly spoke about the placing of an effigy of the late Martin McGuinness's on a bonfire last year, but it was not just an effigy.  It was supposed to be Martin McGuinness in a coffin.  That was insulting.  There were also religious statues, images of political opponents, flags and so on.  The criminality that surrounds bonfires is also an issue.  People are afraid to speak out.  This issue is facing us as we move into July and I do not see it being resolved at the moment.  While people have spoken of having more managed bonfires, the number of bonfires does not seem to be reducing.  In fact, there are probably more of them.  There is a body of work to be done on that.  What would Dr. Byrne suggest in that regard?  Does he have any ideas on how to resolve that issue?</p> <p>  With regard to policing, Dr. Byrne stated that much of the evidence suggests that "policing more generally has not yet been embedded within the broader nationalist-republican community and requires systemic change at the local level if this is not to become a critical incident, as composition is of significant importance for the PSNI".  Again, when one talks to people from loyalist communities, one does not find a great deal of support for the PSNI either.  I refer not only to loyalists but people living in loyalist communities.  The reason for the lack of support is a lack of delivery, particularly around criminality and drugs.  That seems to be the message coming across not only from nationalists, but also from unionist areas.  That is where the PSNI needs to step up.  It will argue it does not have sufficient resources and so on.  There are regular meetings between political representatives and the Chief Constable but there is still the democratic deficit which Dr. Byrne mentioned.  People invested heavily in a new beginning for policing and it has not delivered for communities.  People will say that other things have not happened - we have not seen the peace dividend and so on - but the people see this as very much part of the peace dividend and policing is not delivering to that community.  Does Dr. Byrne have any views or academic insight?</p></speech>

The fact that we are stuck at a figure of 30% is because those who are retiring are not of a Catholic background.</p><p>This is something I am particularly interested and passionate about.  I believe that we collectively need to do more as a society.  The police can only do so much, and when they do not do it they need to be criticised.  As I was coming down in the train I was trying to think, from the workload we have been involved in over the last five years, what are the issues that impinge on it.  I come from a nationalist background in south Down and policing is still a taboo topic with some of my friends.  I have been trying to work out in my head what the issues were around the work we are doing and I have touched on about seven.  The legacy of the conflict and policing is still an issue.  There is a historical view of policing in some quarters.  It is not embedded within nationalist and republican communities in that it might be seen as a normal occupation that one would apply oneself to.  Armed groups target Catholic officers, specifically.  There is a lack of knowledge about policing in Catholic, nationalist communities, in terms of, historically, what policing is about and what is its role and function.  Within the Catholic, nationalist, republican community, if one joins the police, one has to give up more of one's networks and friends.  One has to move away, particularly from one's area and particularly if one is embedded within a particular community.  There is a general malaise around personal safety.  All of those issues cannot be resolved by the police alone.  Collectively, we all need to be part of trying to move that forward.</p><p> I do not have the answers to what that looks like, but too much work and effort was put into getting policing to where it is now for it to fall apart.  We do not have a policing board and we have an issue potentially around recruits that is not being addressed.  It is not even being examined.  We were too quick in 2011 to stop the 50:50 policy.  I understand why it was stopped after we hit 30% and I believe it was important.  We did not have a consultation or a conversation.  Essentially, it just stopped.  That is something that we need to be very careful about.</p><p> The number of bonfires is decreasing.  Social media has played a big part in this; it would take three or four particularly high-profile bonfires where there was a lot of negativity and issues potentially around sectarianism and for there to become an accepted norm of what bonfires are about on 11 July.  Yes, there are bonfires across Northern Ireland where there is negativity and issues around sectarianism and potential hate crime.  There are a significant number of bonfires, however, where nothing happens, where there are communities of families and young people, entertainment and festival-type events.  In the conversation around that and with Belfast City Council there are going to be ten bonfire beacons this year.  There is a move to try to transform that commemorative event on 11 July, and it is slowly changing.  This is about trying to make a 300 year old tradition fit for purpose in 2018.  That is difficult.  Trying to make any cultural event - the committee discussed centenary commemorations - fit for purpose in 2018 can be uncomfortable.  I am not advocating or supporting it but, looking at the bigger picture, there is movement, transformation and some form of  self-regulation across sites.  Belfast is where these will mostly be taking place but there will be possibly 300 bonfires across Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

The committee is not seen as an abstract one, which is the first point I would make.</p> <p>  Any of my conversations about this in any of the communities that I engage with have revolved positively around the reception they have received and the opportunity they have had to contribute.  If we go back to basics - more so now because of Brexit - it is about how we shine a light on the Good Friday Agreement, about which many people have either forgotten or just woken up to.  It is one or the other.  This committee has an opportunity to try to get free of all of the legislative issues and get down to what we actually signed up to in addition to the responsibilities of the British Government and the Irish Government towards that.  If weight can be placed on that, that is really important.  In the absence of anything functioning in Northern Ireland, we need all of the help we can get.</p></speech>

The group is a forum that was established to deal with the industrial relations issues that arise from reform of the water sector.  At this meeting the unions were formally advised that the board of Ervia, which is the parent company of Irish Water, had decided it wished to take full control of the delivery of the public water service and to end the service level agreements, which are currently in place, in 2021, four years before they are due to expire.  Mr. Grant also informed the unions that the board of Ervia had advised the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government of its decision.  He requested at that meeting that the unions enter into a negotiation to create a national framework that would provide for the implementation of the Irish Water proposal.</p> <p>  Following the Irish Water announcement, the unions sought and held meetings with the Minister, Irish Water and local authority management.  The purpose of these meetings was to gauge the level of support for the Irish Water proposal among the other stakeholders in the sector.  We also used these meetings to outline our initial concerns about the proposal.</p> <p>  On 15 January 2018, we received correspondence from the Minister, in which he sought to address some of the issues we had raised with him at a meeting.  He also requested that we engage in a process of meaningful dialogue with the other stakeholders in the sector.  He reiterated that the current arrangements, that is, the service level agreements, for the delivery of public water services would remain in place until an alternative arrangement was agreed.  A copy of his correspondence to us is attached as appendix 1 to this statement circulated to members.  I do not intend to go through the appendix, but it is there for members' information.  On 8 February 2018, we replied to the Minister's letter.  A copy of our reply is also attached as an appendix.  Again, I will not go into the detail of it but I wish to draw the committee's attention to some of the main points that were made in the letter.</p> <p>  First, we noted the assurance that there would be no unilateral change to the arrangements for the delivery of public water services.  On this basis, we were willing to participate in a process of active dialogue with other stakeholders in the sector.  We were agreeable, as the Minister requested, to having a discussion on what was being placed before us.  However, we insisted that the process of dialogue, if it was to be meaningful, could not have a predetermined outcome.  What we mean by this is that the discussion could not simply be about the implementation of the Irish Water proposal.  The reason for this is that the Irish Water proposal had emerged without any explanation as to what problem it was seeking to resolve.  In an earlier presentation to this committee, Irish Water contended that its proposal would allow it to address structural inefficiencies in the current delivery model that would result in &euro;70 million in savings a year.  The structural inefficiencies have never been raised with the unions in any forum, including the Irish Water consultative group, and, therefore, Irish Water is proposing something that seeks to solve a problem we have never been told about.</p> <p>  The unions favour the continuation of the delivery of the public water service through local authorities.  The unions are open to considering any proposal, as we always do, to streamline or improve the efficiency of the current system.  Since the service level agreements have been in place, there has been a significant reduction in the number of people employed in the water services, and significant efficiencies have been agreed.  The unions are prepared to consider other delivery options.  However, our attitude to any other model will be guided by the extent to which it is rooted in the public sector, employs public servants, uses direct labour to discharge its functions and is accountable to the democratic structures of the State.  Ervia in the past has had, and continues to have, a model of operating whereby most of the work on the network and so on is done by contractors and is outsourced.  It is not a direct labour model.  We have concerns about this.</p> <p>  It is important to say at this point, so the committee is under no illusion, that we are opposed to the Irish Water proposal to establish a single water utility under the control of Ervia in the way proposed.  We have formed the view that the Irish Water proposals are incapable of being implemented, not least because they envisage the forced transfer of union members represented here out of the employment of local authorities and into employment outside the public sector.</p> <p>  We went on in the letter to address the question of the potential privatisation of the water sector in the future.  We believe there is broad public support for the holding of a constitutional referendum to prevent the future privatisation of the water system and we note that the Minister has confirmed that he is willing to facilitate the holding of a referendum.  We understand that a Bill to give effect to the holding of a referendum is currently under consideration.  We urge all political parties and groupings in the Oireachtas to co-operate with the passage of this Bill in order that a referendum can be held as soon as possible.  Any proposal to create a single water utility, as envisaged by Ervia, must have regard to the need for a long-term and sustainable system of local government.  In recent years, local authorities have relinquished responsibility for the delivery of important public services, and this has not been to the benefit of citizens who rely on these services.  The bin service in Dublin is an example of the deterioration of a service when it has left the local authority sphere.  We place a high value on an effective system of local government and the delivery of important public services by local authorities.</p> <p>  On 17 May 2018, the Minister wrote to Ms Oonagh Buckley, the director general of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, requesting the commission to engage with the parties to identify the issues that arise in the context of the Irish Water proposal and to prepare a report for his consideration.  This letter is attached at appendix 3 of this submission.  We understand that a plenary meeting will take place on Thursday, 5 July 2018.  The unions will attend this meeting and engage in the process.</p> <p>  These are the developments that have taken place and this has been the extent of our involvement since the Irish Water proposal.  In this short submission we have tried to outline how, as it currently stands, we view the Irish Water and Ervia proposal.  My colleagues represent different unions and categories in the sector and they will be happy to address any questions members of the committee might have.</p></speech>

It is important that the Oireachtas committee is having this debate, both in the session we had with Irish Water and the Department previously and this session with the unions.  It is important we make it clear that it is not the business of this committee to get involved in the industrial relations issues and the negotiations that will take place between the unions, and Irish Water and the Government.  We are, therefore, coming to this from the point of view of public policy and the impact this proposal may have on a vital public service, the employees in the service and the users of the service.</p> <p>  I will not give a view on the proposal.  I am more interested to hear Mr. Berney's responses to a series of questions and perhaps to tease out some of what he said in his opening statement.</p> <p>  The Irish Water proposal is to reduce the number of full-time equivalents working in water services by approximately 1,000 between now and 2021 and to bring that forward.</p><p>At a time of increased investment in upgrading the water system through the increased capital programme for Irish Water, significant strains on the system, whether in Skerries in north County Dublin recently or Louth or elsewhere, we would expect more staff to be recruited to the sector.  What would be the impact of taking 1,400 full-time equivalents out of the direct delivery of service?  What would be the operational impact on current levels of service delivery and future plans for capital improvement and upgrade?  </p><p> Irish Water claims that the savings to the State from that course of action will be &euro;70 million annually.  There was some confusion in the committee on the last occasion when we asked whether that represented a net or gross saving.  When we asked the question of the Department, it said that it represented net savings.  We asked what happens, for example, in local authorities if there are redeployments, rather than voluntary redundancies, and which body bears the cost of that.  We wondered whether it would be financed from existing local authority resources or from another source.  The Department then got itself into a kerfuffle and said that it would be a matter for negotiation.  The amount that would be saved is unclear.  Has Mr. Berney any further information which he can share with us about that?  </p><p> One of the main concerns is that if there is a transfer of staff from the direct employment by the water providers, a consequent increase in the use of private contractors could follow.  Irish Water has clearly indicated that its preference is for directly employed staff for service delivery but that contractors should be used for capital upgrade and improvement work.  Is that a concern for the union?  What is its view on that matter?  </p><p> I have an ongoing concern that as the company is restructured, areas of expenditure that traditionally would have been operational expenditure, particularly minor works, repair works and upgrade works, are being shifted across to the capital expenditure side, which is being used to show savings, which are not necessarily savings at all on the operational end.  Can any witness respond to that or give his or her view?  </p><p> Does this proposal have implications for career progression for staff?  Does it affect the need for more apprenticeships?  How do we ensure that people going into water services will have a clear career progression path?  </p><p> I share Mr. Berney's view on local authorities.  Part of the difficulty in recent years is that more services have been taken away from local authorities, including bin collection and housing delivery.  What would be the impact on the functioning of local authorities if these staff and this core activity were taken from them?  </p><p> What will be the impact on the public?  We have been told that this proposal will increase efficiency.  It is concerned with removing duplication and increasing productivity.  Those arguments were used when student grants were taken away from local authorities and when medical cards were taken away from local health centres.  In both of those instances, the opposite of what was intended occurred.  There was a long period at the beginning when there was increased confusion, lack of capacity and an inability to deliver the same direct service face to face, but there have also been ongoing problems caused by the increased distance from the public.  If one was to take those functions away from the local authorities there might be consequences.  In some rural local authorities people know their water services workers.  They are part of the local communities and are embedded in the life of those communities.  What would be the impact in that instance?</p><p> On the flip side, is it Mr. Berney's view that this could provide an opportunity to radically transform the delivery of water services and the structure of the water utility to create a fully non-commercial semi-State entity?  Should the committee explore and raise this with the Minister and others?  Would there be benefits to that approach?</p><p> Almost everyone on the committee shares the belief that there is a need for a referendum.  There is a certain frustration, because even though the Oireachtas agreed on Second Stage, without any opposition, in October 2016, to proceed, there has been a long delay.  Perhaps Mr. Berney could elaborate on that.  Why would a referendum on water be so important for the unions, their members and their users and services?  What would that constitutional protection mean in real terms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#D00200"><p>That was an extensive list of questions.  I do not want to be evasive, but we have been asked to comment on the reasoning Irish Water presented for this.  It has never presented its reasons to us at all.  We have had no discussion with the company about the rationale for the proposal it has made.  It is difficult for us to respond to the questions because we have not had direct dialogue with Irish Water.  The Irish Water consultative group comes together every couple of months and discusses issues in the sector.  The question of a structural change of this nature, including the transfer of staff to Irish Water, was never discussed with us.  Discussions were held about a programme called the water industry operating framework, WIOF, where issues such as cross-local authority working and other changes were proposed.  Again, the detail of that was never given to us in the industrial relations forum.  It is difficult for us to comment, aside from purely speculating on what the benefits would be or on the rationale for the Irish Water proposal.  To do so, without an informed view, would probably be quite dangerous.</p> <p>  The question of career progression and apprenticeships is something that we would have to discuss in detail should the Irish Water proposal proceed.  However, until such time as we understand the reason for the Irish Water proposal and what it is seeking to address, it is difficult to engage with it.  If we were to ask this committee to do anything for us, it would be to encourage Irish Water and the Department to explain to us what the difficulty is with the current system and whether the problems could be addressed within the current framework.  </p> <p>  We are concerned about local authorities and the scale of the impact this proposal would have.  Local authorities are important institutions within the structure of the State, which citizens rely.  It is an open secret that some of the larger local authorities would exit water services tomorrow if they had the opportunity, and because of their scale, an existential issue does not arising for them.  However, for some local authorities they would be faced with such a crisis, and it is deeply worrying.  Proper consideration has not been given to that.  Alongside any restructuring of the water services sector, it is important that what happens to the local authorities is considered as well.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether there is an upside to the proposal.  The unions in the sector have complained bitterly for years, without anyone taking any heed, about the lack of investment in the sector.  Arising from the creation of Irish Water, there has been a focus on the need for continued capital investment.  If structural reform resulted in ring-fenced, guaranteed capital funding to address the infrastructural deficits in the system and to ensure a proper, modern, functioning water system, we should seize that opportunity.  We would be supportive of such reform.  </p> <p>  On the question of the referendum, we are sceptical about the intention behind the setting up of Irish Water in the first place.   My colleagues will talk about it in more detail but believe it was not established to improve the sector but rather to create a vehicle for its future privatisation.  It appeared to the whole world as if that was being done.  We need to make sure that does not happen.  We have become convinced that the best way of doing that is by holding a referendum which would ask the people if they want to prevent Irish Water from being privatised or if they want the water sector to be privatised in the future.</p><p>We believe that is the safest way of doing it.  People tell us it is an imperfect model and we should not insert such provisions in the Constitution, but I have not heard any better way of doing it.  We support the proposal for a referendum.  We are as frustrated as others about the delay in holding a referendum.</p><p> When we met the Minister he told he was not opposed to a referendum but wanted to facilitate the referendum on the removal of the eighth amendment in the first instance and to concentrate on that.  To some extent, that was a legitimate response.  That is the best I can do to answer the Deputy's questions.  The lack of detail we have arises from the fact that a presentation on the nature of the proposal has not been made to us.</p></speech>

I have some supplementary questions.  Leaving aside what Irish Water has or has not proposed, knowing the water services sector as Mr. Berney does, what does he think will be the impact of removing 1,000 full-time equivalent staff by 2021?  Do the unions have a view on the future reconfiguration of the utility and Irish Water moving towards becoming a non-commercial semi-State company?  Would that be a positive development and, if so, why?</p></speech>

Some of the work needed to reform and improve the sector is core to local authority staff and cannot be done by contractors.  We struggle with understanding the issue because we have never had an explanation as to the nature of the proposal.</p></speech>

There is a single utility in place, namely, Irish Water.  It has responsibility for the delivery of the water system and does so through a contracting arrangement it has with local authorities.  We can see the basis for a discussion on the development of an improved single utility which would be firmly located in the public sector and have public sector staff who would be insourced.  If we are to have that discussion in a meaningful way, we need to understand what problems exist in the system in order that we can bring our members with us.  They have been told to move from one place to another without any explanation.</p></speech>

A major weather event, Storm Emma, resulted in water shortages, rationing and other problems over a number of weeks.  The response in Dublin involved Irish Water and the four local authorities deciding on how to address the issue as a matter of urgency to try to ensure it does not happen again.  A number of measures had to be taken to rebuild water capacity.  As the committee knows, Dublin uses 100% of the water it produces.  There are issues with broken and lead pipes.  In recent weeks, we sat down with the four local authorities, in conjunction with Irish Water, to decide to fix the water problem in Dublin.  This has involved putting in place a plan to fix a range of issues, rebuild capacity and ensure there is resilience in the system because that is absent at the moment.</p> <p>  On what a future setup would look like, what is happening in Dublin provides a very good example of what a publicly provided utility could look like.  We have demonstrated that the model could work and be replicated in Munster, Leinster, Connaught, the northern counties and so on.  Instead of spending a number of years debating what a single utility looks like, we have shown what a publicly provided single utility would look like in future.  In a couple of years' time there will be substantial progress in Dublin where, it is hoped, most, if not all, of the serious infrastructural issues will have been dealt with.  We ask the committee to examine the model being implemented in Dublin as a way of addressing the issue.  It may be the best way of addressing the issues that have to be dealt with throughout the country.  </p> <p>  Reference was made to apprenticeships and traineeships.  I remind the committee that under the public service agreement there are commitments on apprenticeships.  We have advocated for local authorities to renew their involvement in the uptake of apprenticeships and we are actively pursuing that.  We have asked Irish Water to do the same.  If it is working with communities, it needs to assist them in that regard.  We advocate that the company allocate money from its budget to deliver in that area.</p> <p>  I echo Mr. Berney's question.  Transferring jobs from local authorities and making people contractors would be detrimental for communities because good, steady community based jobs would be taken from some areas and moved to other jurisdictions.  People would no longer have certainty of a job in their community while rearing their children.  They would be rearing children just to export them.  Losing these jobs would be extremely damaging.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Nolan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#E00700"><p>I will elaborate on what some of the points made by my colleagues, specifically on corporate status and the future direction of the utility.  It is important to consider from where this proposal came.  It did not come from the Government, Oireachtas or Irish Water; it came from Ervia.  There is a cultural difference between Irish Water, which tried to root itself in the public service, and the manner in which Ervia operates.  From that perspective, we fear that this is the route to privatisation and that fear is grounded.  Developments are taking place within Ervia in an attempt to evolve the management structures of Irish Water staff with Ervia staff.  The committee needs to pay close attention to that development because it is the route towards privatisation.  We believe the service can be run by local authorities, but we are also open to considering any proposal that would totally preserve the delivery of services within the public sector.  We are opposed to commercial development of the water service and that message needs to go out loud and clear.</p> <p>  On the question of staff efficiencies, it is difficult to see how capital investment could be sustained with a reduced number of staff.   Since we started to engage with Irish Water, we have kept the system running in local authorities and have managed to reduce staffing levels by close to 1,000.  We have the capacity.  We have shrunk the system as far as it can go, but we have never been found wanting in circumstances where we have been met and engaged and delivered.  </p> <p>  The final point I want to address is local government, which is very dear to my union's heart.  We predate the foundation of the State as a union founded in local government.  We have talked about bins and higher education.  The loss of water services will take between 20% and 30% of the income base from local authorities.  Some local authorities in the Dublin area, to which Mr. Berney alluded, may withstand such a reduction but I doubt that, notwithstanding what management thinks.  Smaller local authorities will be devastated.  The funding from Irish Water is used to pay for corporate services, not just operational staff on the ground.  This funding is no longer available.  Approximately one third of the funding for the services delivered by local authorities will disappear on the day this occurs.  </p> <p>  We will continue to engage.  The creation of Irish Water occurred in turmoil.  The one constant throughout was the willingness of the trade union movement to sit down and deal with problems.  We did not get involved in large measure with much of the public debate on the issue.</p><p>There is a sense of disappointment that the people who kept the show on the road are now staring down the barrel of the gun.  Our people refer to the proposal to transfer staff from local authorities to a new body as "conscription".  We understand there is legislative provision to allow for this.  Any organisation that tries to set itself up when its workforce is totally opposed to the arrangement is destined for a fall and we believe that, unless there is engagement and we are able to deal with the issues we are outlining this morning, the difficulties we face will increase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Hearne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#F00200"><p>I represent engineers throughout the local authority sector.  For generations, engineers have been responsible for the design, building, maintenance and operation of water services within the State.  They have a deep sense of and a deep commitment to public service and in many cases engineers do what their fathers and grandfathers did before them.  Their reaction in 2012, when we first engaged on the establishment of Irish Water, was one of conditional optimism because at that time we had been struggling with a legacy of chronic underinvestment in the sector.  General operatives, plumbers and other staff were also expected to provide and maintain a service on a shoestring and chickens were coming home to roost all over the place.  We saw that with the outbreaks of cryptosporidium and water outages in different parts of the country.  Privately, engineers were worrying deeply about what would happen if we had an outage in the Vartry reservoir, where there is no backup supply and there would be perhaps hundreds of thousands of people without water.  The staff have a deep commitment to providing services to their communities.  The staff belong to the communities - they are not some contractor brought in from some other part of the country to carry out work.  They are local staff and they have a commitment to and vested interest in ensuring the service is provided to the best standard.</p> <p>  During 2012, 2013 and 2014 we became increasingly concerned with the way the proposal to establish Irish Water was implemented.  It was done without any consultation with unions or staff who provide the service.  We were increasingly concerned that the intention was to gather everything together in one organisation in order that it could be privatised in the medium term.  In 2012 we were in the middle of the biggest fiscal crisis in the history of the State and this was not an unreasonable view to take.</p> <p>  Our members are in favour of the service being retained in the public sector and, indeed, in the local authority sector.  They are concerned that the impact it will have on local authorities will be substantial, following on from the privatisation of the bin service.  There is also a concern that moving the water service from local authorities removes it from public scrutiny and accountability.  We want to ensure that what has been built over generations is not only maintained but restored and expanded to provide the best possible services to our citizens.  There are issues such as the retention of local knowledge of general operatives, plumbers and engineers, all of whom have an intimate knowledge of the local water services structure and infrastructure.</p> <p>  Another point that has been repeatedly made to me over the years concerns ethos.</p></speech>

As long as I have been in the Houses I have never seen so many people from one group.  I acknowledge their deep commitment to public service.  I was first elected to a local authority in 1999 when I became a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council so I know about and value the knowledge to which Mr. Hearn refers.  He spoke about the commitment of engineers and their local knowledge, of which there is an awful lot.  While much of it is not documented, there is a history there.  A man could tell me where a repair was carried out ten years ago and point to a few skeletons in the cupboard.  One cannot buy that sort of knowledge.  I worked with ICTU members and I do not like anything that whiffs of a forced transfer of anyone's terms of employment without negotiation but I recognise that it can happen.  If there is a logic for something to happen, it must be done through meaningful industrial relations, human resources procedures and negotiation.</p> <p>  It appears from what witnesses are saying, and I have read something similar, that much of this seems to have been hatched out and planned without them being fully aware of it.  It also appears that local authority staff currently working for Irish Water may be subsumed into Ervia, although I understand some have returned to Irish Water.  I am concerned about the speeding up of the process of terminating service level agreements.  I was happy to hear the point about apprenticeships and I believe local authorities are best placed to organise them.</p> <p>  I do not like dealing with personalities but I have always found Gerry Grattan to be exceptionally helpful, both when I was a councillor and when he was here, which he has been on a number of occasions.  There is a synergy now and I hear from engineers, management and local elected members that the process has bedded down, though it has taken a long time.  It is key that it remains within the local authority.  I note that witnesses have said they are happy to negotiate and come up with better options.  Maybe there are better ways of doing things, even within their own structures.</p> <p>  I congratulate ICTU on producing a report that is concise, focused and to the point.  I will try to be helpful without criticising ICTU.  It should engage more with local councillors and get political.  Unions were political years ago and, without passing judgment, I note that no Member of the Labour Party is here, although some will be following proceedings on the monitors.  The unions were great at mobilising and their members served as community activists working on behalf of citizens.  That role has become a little lost along the way and people are looking to the trade unions to assume it again.  With local elections scheduled for May 2019, trade union representatives should start engaging with politicians and making their case.  They are making their case here but I suggest they engage in more regular communication.</p> <p>  The first section of the report contains nine bullet points, which refer to active dialogue. It is important to keep this to the fore.  It should not be a case of "my way or the highway" and we cannot have a predetermined outcome in meaningful negotiations.</p><p>Mr. Berney made that point really well, and I agree.  </p><p> He also stated "The unions favour the continuation of the delivery of the public water service through local authorities".  I agree with that but it needs to be reformed.  It has not worked as well as it should.  There need to be greater efficiencies.  Maybe it could be done in a more regionally structured way.  There has to be a better way, because the current system has not altogether worked and there were huge issues around delivery.   However, I hear what the witnesses are saying and I think there is a need for that.  If it is kept open and we talk about streamlining and professionalising it and getting a slicker operation, that is the way forward.  </p><p> Mr. Berney continued by stating "The unions are open to considering any proposal ... to streamline or improve the efficiency of the current system."  I think that is to be welcomed.  They are also open to looking at other models, which may be available.  I do not know what is best practice right across Europe but other models may exist there.  As for the Irish Water proposals to establish a single water utility, I see the need to have a centralised policy and a vision, a master plan for the whole thing, but I also see the importance of ensuring that delivery can be rolled out and retained in local authorities.  I am very supportive of that.  </p><p> As for the proposed constitutional referendum, yes I am completely opposed to the total privatisation of Irish Water.  A lot of politicians here are or at least they say they are and that is important.  I will give a commitment to raise in Seanad &Eacute;ireann this very day where we are regarding the Bill, whether the Minister is serious about bringing it forward and what the story is?  I will check that out.  </p><p> I am sympathetic.  I am committed and am happy to meet the unions at some other stage as well.  However, I encourage the witnesses to engage with all of the 950 sitting county councillors around the country.  They are all part of networks with people in other political parties and ICTU will find many great allies there.  I think it will lighten the unions' load and I wish them well with their work.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#G00200"><p>I apologise for being late.  I have special knowledge of this area, being the wonderful Minister who brought in the damned legislation in the first place and lost my job as a result.  Thankfully I kept my seat so that people realised what I was saying was the truth all along.  I recognise a lot of the issues here.  There are areas where I agree with the representations and areas where I disagree.  That is fair enough.  I absolutely agree on the single most important point made, which is that if Irish Water is to be set up, it should be absolutely on its own grounds.  It should not be involved with Ervia or any other organisation.</p> <p>  I attended a meeting attended by a number of Ministers of the day and senior executives of local government, Irish Water and Ervia.  I very strongly made the point that I was totally opposed to Ervia being involved in any make, shape or form and I remain so.  If Irish Water is to have a future, which I believe it should, it must be as an independent stand-alone organisation, separate in every way from any other organisation.  I agree and concur with the views of the Minister and indeed everybody here who has spoken.  There should be a referendum on the ownership of Irish Water to the effect that the only shareholder can be the State.  I will absolutely support that. </p> <p>  When we were setting it up, a key point was the concept that nobody would have to change his or her job.  If people worked on water infrastructure for a local authority, they would have an option to move into another part of the local authority if they wished.  There was no blunderbuss or gun to the head forcing them to go to Irish Water.  However, engineers and other workers had an option to join Irish Water if they wished.  A lot of them did so.  I know lots of them.  They have a career with which they are happy.  However, if someone was not happy with it, the other option was to stay with his or her local authority.  If there was work such people could do or wanted to do, there would be a place for them for the rest of their days.  However, there was never any question of involuntary movement of people from employment at a local authority to anywhere else.  I would be absolutely opposed to that and the unions are absolutely right to remain firm on that point.</p> <p>  At the time, our vision of Irish Water was that it would generate new synergies.  Dublin was mentioned but Dublin is a stand-alone organisation that basically has the capacity to run on its own because it is such a big city.  However, problems arise in smaller counties with disparate water supplies.  I think County Kerry has 30 or 40 separate water supplies, as opposed to the main line that can be used in places like County Kildare.  There are huge advantages for poorer counties where a lot of water is being wasted and which did not have the necessary investment as such capital investment was not available to the local government.  Roscommon County Council, for instance, did not have the money to repair the pipes through which it was losing 60% of its water.  It was a joke and was not sustainable.  The amount water that was being lost throughout the country was entirely unacceptable.</p> <p>  Regarding the question of scale of regional development, I note the comments made by the witnesses.  The unions recognise that a regional operation would have synergies, and would improve services for people in areas that would not otherwise have the capacity to have proper safe and potable water.  I do not have the map in front of me, but I understand that one of the problems encountered in Kerry was that a whole new line through the centre of the county was needed.  The council just could not do it but Irish Water could.  There are lots of fantastic things Irish Water can do and is doing.</p> <p>  I live in County Louth, where we have had significant interruptions of supply at Staleen.  The last interruption in supply was a couple of weeks ago.  I went out at 7 a.m. to find that the workers had been working all night.  They went in and worked under floodlights.  They gave every single moment they could at no notice at all.  They went straight out, and there were at least 15 or 20 of them when I was there.  I want to put on record that the commitment of the workers to public service is second to none.  It was absolutely fantastic and we do not want to lose that either.  What the unions are bringing to the table is the experience, the commitment, the workforce, the skills and the corporate knowledge.  They are all good things that must be integrated into the new organisation called Irish Water.</p> <p>  One point made is that it must be a public utility.  The referendum will deal with that.  There must be no mandatory changing of position from local government to anywhere else.  I respect the engineers very much as well.  I would use the word "idealism", a word we do not often hear.  Many of the professionals and ordinary workers in Irish Water are totally committed.  They have an awful lot to offer and we must not lose that.  That is where I stand on this debate.  </p> <p>  Reading the correspondence, I note that negotiations are ongoing and obviously, they will continue.  There should be no forced change but I agree with the witnesses absolutely and will campaign with them on the Ervia issue because that is critical.  We want a complete break there.  Ultimately, however, I think that the net benefit of Irish Water completely outweighs the old way pursued by the county councils.  It just was not working and was not cost-effective.  The cost of a cubic metre of water in Kildare was half the cost in Wicklow.  In other words, a business using water commercially in County Kildare as opposed to County Wicklow was paying twice the unit cost.  It was not sustainable.  We now have a uniform cost all over the country.  That is very good for business and for inward investment.</p> <p>  I take the points made about the problem with the Vartry reservoir.  The fact is that could happen today or it could happen tomorrow.  It has not happened for more than 100 years but if and when it does, it will be absolutely catastrophic.  The fissures are there in the rock and I have seen them myself.  There is no alternative water supply and Dublin will have no water.  That is why it is so important to proceed with the alternative supply to the greater Dublin area.  Insofar as I can, I will be very much putting my voice behind what the witnesses are saying.</p> <p>  One other point is that one of the assessments made at the time examined the age profile of the workforce.  I expect there to be significant voluntary - I stress voluntary - redundancies for people who might wish to take that up and who are probably over 55 or something like that.  I did not see the data but perhaps the witnesses have.  Given what is going on - I am not familiar with the nuts and bolts - it might be helpful if there was a significant voluntary package for people.  At the time, we spoke about that option in principle.</p></speech>

I watched the debate on that awful afternoon and the provision was an affront to democracy.  The only reason the issue of conscription arose is because the legislation provided for it.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd's point on the need for a central vision and so on.  I will provide a copy of our submission to the clerk to the Oireachtas joint committee for distribution to its members.  In 2012, we gave a submission to the public consultation process on the creation of Irish Water and made that very point.  If some of the advice that we provided to the public consultation process in 2012, which was based on our experience of delivering water service, had been taken into account, we would not have been in the mess in which we found ourselves subsequently.  Of course, our view was not taken into account.  </p> <p>  The final question was on a voluntary severance package and measures like that.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right in that given what is envisaged in terms of the expansion and development of the service, the investment in capital infrastructure and the need for a range of things, we cannot see how the workforce can be reduced.  A voluntary severance programme would be all very well but it would not obviate the need to increase the workforce to backfill the number of people who have left.  The workforce is probably at the point where it is barely able to carry out the service that is required.  If we are to continue expanding the service to correct the infrastructure etc., at this point we do not see how a voluntary severance package would be appropriate. </p></speech>

I thank members for their verbal assurance that they support our call for a referendum.  We need to move on that matter.  The political parties needs to stand up and be counted at this stage.  They have all given verbal support and we still are waiting for the referendum to be put before the people.  Whether it is a political party or Independent Members, in order for them to show they take our members and the public seriously, this matter needs to be acted on and put to the people.  While enough Deputies, Senators and others have given verbal support, we need this matter to be acted on.  I ask the Vice Chairman to convey our view to the Minister and call on him to put the referendum to the people as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Without going into too much detail or being critical, our members have told us that Irish Water has unnecessarily spent money.  For example, Irish Water has replaced equipment that works but yet has not replaced equipment that should be replaced.  Such matters can be addressed through direct discussions that therefore would improve efficiencies.  I agree with Mr. Berney that there is no issue with the amount of staff.  If anything, we believe Irish Water is understaffed, which is a matter that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  As for efficiencies, while I could go into more detail about that subject, there is scope for discussion on where Irish Water's resources could be better spent elsewhere.  We would welcome a conversation on that matter.  </p> <p>  I wish to echo the point that Mr. Berney made about providing voluntary redundancy packages.  The initiative would act like a red flag to a bull and would antagonise our members.  As has been said, our members have dedicated their lives to providing services through the water service.  A voluntary redundancy package for employees would send a completely wrong message to our members as to how the Government is positioning itself on the future of Irish Water.  A redundancy package would be viewed as writing our people out of the script.  Our members have conveyed to us that they would prefer this question to be settled over the coming period to everybody's satisfaction, and sooner rather than later.  </p></speech>

Deputy O'Dowd has mentioned the intrinsic importance of these jobs to the people who live in rural counties and to their communities.  It is perceived that the future of those jobs and communities are under threat.  He mentioned County Louth and so on.  Our members have asked whether they still will be working in this area in five or ten years' time.  The constant threat to their job security is hugely damaging.  Our point is that this issue must be resolved and preferably sooner rather than later.</p> <p>  I welcome some of the Deputy's comments about the conscription issue.  It was reassuring to hear that he opposes conscription.  His comments will go some way to alleviate people's worries but the fundamental question about job security in the water services must be addressed.  Our members believe that is best served through the local authorities, as has been outlined.</p> <p>  In terms of engagement down the road, a voluntary redundancy package would be the worst thing that could be put on the table.   </p></speech>

The area has been sadly lacking in the past number of years.</p> <p>  I agree with my colleagues when they questioned where the 1,000 whole-time equivalent jobs are going to go.  If our experience of contractors is anything to go by, then the initiative could cause quite a bit of difficulty for us.  We could never willingly agree, in any shape or form, to the replacement of whole-time equivalents with contractors.  Recently we have experienced considerable difficulties with contractors over employment standards, terms and conditions and, in particular, their failure and unwillingness to engage with the dispute resolution machinery that was set up by the State. </p></speech>

I am just giving my opinion.  I do not wish to argue with Mr. Berney.  I have read what the Minister said and what Mr. Berney said, which was on that basis, "we were willing to participate in a process of active dialogue".  That is fine.  I still profoundly disagree with the witnesses about voluntary packages.  When a new utility is set up and there are new synergies and changes, such packages may be welcomed by some people and not welcomed by others but it is up to the individual to decide.  I know of many industries where people want and would welcome such an option but it is not forced on them.  Nobody has to take it but in many cases, it can meet the needs people can have at a particular time.  I am not talking about Mr. Berney's business, necessarily.</p></speech>

The unions have negotiated voluntary severance packages in many places, in the private and public sector.

It relates to the question of a referendum, which featured strongly in the correspondence back and forth between the ICTU and the Minister.  ICTU supports a referendum to keep water publicly owned, as do I.  Is it a condition for ICTU that there be a referendum in order to support a stand-alone company?   I see real dangers in a stand-alone company, as it would be easier to privatise than it would to privatise services in 31 local authorities.  The question of a referendum is key.  In his correspondence, the Minister indicated he was favourable towards a referendum but I can say, from what I see in this House, that the large parties have no intention of facilitating a referendum.  They will offer words and hints but they block any serious attempt to push it forward.  Is the holding of a referendum a condition of ICTU supporting a stand-alone company or does it see it as two separate issues?</p></speech>

That was before this proposal ever emerged.  In the view of ICTU, there is no link between one and the other.  We believe the question of securing public water in public ownership through a constitutional referendum should happen regardless of other plans in any other area.  We discussed this earlier and to repeat what the Minister has told us on the holding of a referendum, he said he was happy to facilitate the holding of a referendum but he wished to facilitate a referendum on the removal of the eighth amendment from the Constitution in the first instance.  Now that has been done, our view is nothing prevents a speedy passage through the Oireachtas of the legislation required to hold a referendum.  Our view is that a referendum could be facilitated this calendar year.</p></speech>

ICTU received one answer from the Minister and I would be very interested to see whether the Taoiseach would give the same answer.  At any time I have heard him speak on the issue, he has not been seeking to hold a referendum on this issue any time soon.  I am asking the question the other way around.  It is not whether ICTU sees it as a stand-alone issue but whether it is prepared to give the green light for the stand-alone utility before it gets a crystal-clear guarantee about the referendum.</p></speech>

If one looks at the agreement we have with the State, the Department and the employers on that transformation of the water service, it refers to an enduring relationship between the local authorities and Irish Water in the continuation of service level agreements beyond 2024.  I understand the point Deputy Barry is making and why he is making it.  Our view on the question of a referendum, however, was developed prior to the proposal that we are discussing today on the Ervia proposal to take full control of the water services.  Now that the referendum on the eighth amendment is out of the way, we will press for the immediate holding of a referendum on water ownership, which I believe can be done in the current calendar year.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee I welcome from Threshold, Mr. John-Mark McCafferty and Mr. Gavin Elliott; from the Irish Property Owners Association, Mr. Tom O'Brien and Ms Margaret McCormick and from the Union of Students in Ireland, Mr. Michael Kerrigan and Ms Amy Kelly.  As previously agreed by members, we will not hear an opening statement from the witnesses as the submissions from the witnesses have been read by members in advance of this meeting.  Instead, we will go straight to questions from members.</p><p>Before we begin, I wish to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies on the committee had indicated to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, when he brought the heads of the Bill before us, that we were mindful to support and to assist him in trying to get the legislation through before the end of the session.  However, we still felt it was important to bring in a range of witnesses to express their view.  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, appeared before us earlier in the week.</p> <p>  I request the witnesses to record their key concerns with the legislation or suggestions of which we should be mindful in terms of getting the detail of what is being proposed in the heads of the Bill correct.  At the centre of the Bill is the two civil sanctions for breaches of the rent pressure zones and the non-registration of tenancies.  When the representatives from the Residential Tenancies Board were before us, one of their points was that while they welcome these additional policing powers, they have a problem with data because while people register their tenancies they do not necessarily update that information with the RTB if there is no subsequent Part 4 tenancy.  Therefore, the board's ability to police, even with the new legislative framework, will be dependent on having a lot of good quality data.  The RTB suggested as an additional amendment to the Bill, an annual registration but not necessarily with the current registration fee for a tenancy.  If landlords were required to register the tenancy each year, that would mean the RTB would have up-to-date information on the tenancy, the rent and so on, from which it could extrapolate on whether there were potential breaches in certain areas.  Do people think that is a good idea?  Do people think it would be a good idea but in certain contexts?  I am thinking in particular of the representatives from the Irish Property Owners Association who represent the landlords and how they would see that pan out.</p><p> The other issue we discussed was student rent and we wanted representatives of the USI to appear because there has been concern recently about certain student rents.  I did a recent radio interview with a property agent from Galway who was arguing strongly for legal clarity on whether student licences are covered under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  It is almost like some landlords are using the ambiguity to undercut others.  I am interested in whether people think this is an opportunity to deal with that matter.  Representatives of the RTB were clear when they came before the committee in indicating that student licences are included under the terms of the Act.  They were explicit about that and said they were always of that view.  They encouraged students to contest cases if they felt landlords were in breach of this.  I am interested in people's views on that.</p><p> We are not looking to overly burden this legislation but there is an opportunity to revisit some matters, including the Focus Ireland amendment.  Too many families have been issued with vacant possession notices to quit.  That is continually driving the numbers of families presenting as homeless.  Is this an opportune time to deal with such an issue?  We will have a further opportunity later in the year to come back to other matters related to the Residential Tenancies Act but some of us are trying to establish whether one or two additions to this Bill such as the clarification on student accommodation or measures to help prevent family homelessness might be worth considering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#L00200"><p>I thank the Deputy and I note his opening comments on the acceptance by the wider constituency of members of this forum, and that they have no issue with and accept the terms of the Bill.  There might be disappointment that the Deputy is the only member who has taken the time to attend and listen to our views.  The Deputy first dealt with rent control measures, which are at the heart of this.  We are disappointed but not surprised by the provisions in the proposed Bill.  The wording of the legislation is extremely one-sided.  Everything seems to be captured with respect to sanctions and fines for landlords who breach the legislation but there is not much about tenants who default or do not pay rent.  There is nothing in there to support or in any way acknowledge landlords who may have tenants in place since 2012 or 2013 sitting on rents that may be 40% or 50% below current market values.  There is nothing to balance or address that matter.  If one breaches the tax code and, for example, does not file a tax return, there is a sanction of &euro;3,000.  If a landlord overcharges rent by &euro;50, the sanction could be up to &euro;30,000.  The proportionality of sanctions relative to the crime is completely out of sync with any other walk of life or business.</p> <p>  At the heart of this and all other legislation introduced since the downturn directed at the buy-to-let or property sector have been intervention and measures impacting on property owners.  These include tax and general procedural matters but they have all come with a cost and burden to the property owner and, in most cases, with little opportunity to pass them on to a client, which is at odds with practice in many other businesses.</p> <p>  The legislation comes on the back of what is an unprecedented supply issue.  There has been much focus on rent and on sanctions for, and control of, landlords because of the supply issue.  The population is increasing and the economy is recovering but housing supply is decreasing.  Independent evidence indicates that for every three properties sold in the buy-to-let sector, only one remains in the sector.  Supply is going down but demand is going up.  Regardless of this or any other Bill that is introduced, that will not change.  There must be intervention and support aimed at people willing to invest in the property sector.</p> <p>  Investment in the property sector is not a quick process and one does not get in and out in a couple of years.  There are substantial entry costs and one assumes substantial debt obligations.  The returns are relatively low, taking into account that 53% of income goes on tax and there are mortgage repayments. On what basis do members feel landlords should take on an investment with a return of less than 5% before tax in circumstances where they not only have financial obligations but there is a legal framework that is difficult to follow unless they are practising solicitors or barristers.  It is complicated and I wonder how or what the average investor with one or two properties - 92% of people are in that bracket - will make of this legislation in terms of compliance.  One could quite unwittingly contravene the legislation, finding oneself in a serious position, facing criminal and financial sanctions that could lead to bankruptcy.  I am interested in understanding the basis on which members feel the legislation will in any way address the supply problem.  If they were considering investment in property, would they feel that stacks up on a financial basis?  Would they be comfortable with the legal obligations that must be taken on?  This is not big business and, in many cases, it amounts to a small personal pension plan.  There are approximately 300,000 tenancies with only 6,000 are in dispute.  It is not a business in which there is rampant disregard for the law.  There are not so many disputes that we need a legal framework that is so complicated and that is unprecedented anywhere else in the world.  It does not necessarily relate to this sector but Airbnb has stated that the regulations governing the short-term letting of property in Ireland are unprecedented not only in Europe but in the world.  They are among the most serious and stringent rules that the company has come up against.</p></speech>

There is the matter of financial returns and legal obligations to be taken on.  I understand a political agenda is driving this but, nevertheless, the problem is greater than politics.  People face sanctions and penalties for renting out a one-bedroom apartment.  If they rent it at &euro;1,050 when they are meant to rent it at &euro;1,020, they face a fine of &euro;30,000.  There needs to be a reasonable and proportionate basis to what we are considering.  If everybody is honest around the room, they would admit politics rather than economics or need is driving this.  We would like to bring reason to the debate.</p> <p>  We would like clarity on rent control and caps, particularly as they relate to the imbalance between properties that are below the market rate and those being newly brought to the market.  Most of the properties newly brought to the market are from REITs, which do not pay tax.  Investors such as us pay 53% tax on our received rent but we cannot increase that to market value.  The REITs can buy new stock and they do not pay income tax.  They can rent at the full market rate and we would like that imbalance addressed.  There are people who were good to tenants in the downturn and did not increase rents when the market increased, although they could have.  They may have wanted to look after a good tenant in that way.  We have many examples of that, although they will never hit the media.  Those people need redress under this legislation.</p> <p>  We would also like clarification on the definition of when and how one can escape rent cap measures by refurbishing a property.  It is currently a fudge.</p><p>It seems that one cannot avoid the rent cap without insulating one's entire house and building an extension, even though one could transform an apartment for &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 and make it a more enjoyable residence for a tenant.  However, under the current definition it is hard to see how or if that would allow a landlord to avoid the rent cap.  We would like clarity and some detail on that issue rather than a blanket fudge.</p><p> We seek clarity on the termination of tenancies.  A landlord could unwittingly err in a notification to a tenant at the end of a four-year tenancy and be stuck with an additional six years because of a technical error on the notice or it not being in the prescribed format even though the intention and substance of what was done was in order.</p><p> We would like rent arrears to be addressed.  We have numerous examples of people who have taken disputes to the RTB on over-holding and rent arrears.  The tenant can appeal the decision and continue not paying rent, knowing that when he or she eventually has to leave at the end of that process, he or she will not be pursued for the rent because the RTB does not have the funds to do so and, even if it did, the tenant will not have the rent anyway.  We would like a fair acknowledgement that if landlords have to go through the elongated process to have a person not paying rent removed from a property that, as in any other commercial dispute, there would be a requirement of security for costs whereby a tenant could not appeal a notice of removal for not paying rent if he or she did not lodge the rent in court.  A tenant would have to lodge the rent with the RTB prior to disputing the case in order that the board has the ability to compensate the landlord should the tenant lose the case.  It is only fair that if one takes a case in any aspect of business, one is required to show that one is good for damages in the event that one loses, and that should be the case in this regard.</p><p> Overall, we are disappointed but not surprised by the Bill, which is one-sided.  I am a little concerned by Deputy &Oacute; Broin's opening comments that several members support the legislation and are seeking to move it to approval.  I wonder why we were invited to the committee if that is the case.  On the basis that supply is at the heart of this issue and that people are leaving the market because of the financial and legal obligations that are now upon them, I urge a rethink in favour of property owners.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kerrigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#M00300"><p>The majority of our concerns relate to student accommodation, which is the responsibility of several Departments.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned support for people looking to get into the market and invest in the market.  Higher education institutes are eager to get into the market.  We have been waiting years for a borrowing framework for institutes of technology that seems no closer to being delivered.  A grant for higher education institutions to invest in student accommodation is needed and it was recommended in a 2015 HEA report.  The student accommodation strategy launched last summer identified an excess demand for 23,500 beds in Ireland last summer, which is to increase to almost 26,000 next year and will still be at almost 21,000 in 2024.  Solving the student accommodation crisis will go a long way to solving the accommodation crisis in the private rented sector.  Recent international research indicates that students who live close to or on campus have higher rates of retention and scores on development scales than commuter students.</p> <p>  Higher education institutions have come to rely heavily on income from international student fees, particularly in the past five years.  Ireland is expected to have another 37,000 international students by 2020.  Those students spend significantly in the economy and there is associated income from their friends and family who visit as tourists.  However, the availability of on-campus accommodation is a prerequisite for attracting international students.</p> <p>  There is significant demand for bed spaces for students with disabilities for various reasons.  The Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, stated in the D&aacute;il a number of weeks ago that price is a function of supply and demand, but with the projected excess demand in 2024, we cannot continue to wait for supply to meet demand.  We can wait no longer for a borrowing model for institutes of technology.  Room prices have risen to more than &euro;1,000 per month.  We cannot be content to try to minimise the increases but, rather, we must see prices decreasing.</p> <p>  The main issue we have with the Bill is not what is in it but, rather, what is missing.  We have raised concerns with the committee over the lack of regulation for purpose-built student accommodation.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned that the RTB addressed issue that before the committee.  Students at NUI Galway have made several complaints and we look forward to hearing the outcome of those complaints.</p> <p>  For several years, USI, along with the Departments of Education and Skills and Housing, Planning and Local Government, ran a homes for study campaign aimed at getting homeowners with spare rooms to rent them to students.  Such homeowners can earn up to &euro;14,000 a year tax free through the scheme.  We hope to increase that number by &euro;4,000 by the end of 2019, which we hope will alleviate some of the demand on student accommodation.  However, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 outlines that it does not apply to a dwelling in which the landlord resides, which has caused significant issues for students living in digs-style accommodation that we encourage them to take on.  Such landlords are not obliged to provide a rent book or statement of paid rent and there is no legal requirement for the accommodation to meet minimum physical standards.  Notice of termination is decided upon by the landlord and, although it is supposed to be reasonable, that is not defined.  The landlord is not obliged to register with the RTB, while the student cannot use the board's dispute resolution service if a disagreement arises and is not protected under the Equal Status Acts, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender, civil or family status, age, race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or membership of the Traveller community.  We would like this Bill or another to address the issue of protecting students in purpose-built accommodation under the Residential Tenancies Act.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gavin Elliott" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#M00500"><p>Overall, we welcome the Bill.  It promises to strengthen the rent pressure zone legislation, will increase tenants' rights and provide a degree of rent transparency although it is certainly not everything for which we asked .  We have some concerns and there are some provisions which we would like amended.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. O'Brien on a couple of matters.  The first is that this is another amendment to incredibly complex legislation.  It has long gone beyond the stage where a member of the public can read the legislation and understand what he or she is supposed to do to follow the law.  It is getting to the stage where not only must one be a solicitor or barrister to navigate the legislation, but also one who specialises in residential tenancies law.  Two amending Bills this year will add to that complexity.  We may be asking for the moon but we would like the Department to consider redrafting and restating the entire Act.  That would take time but it would be well worth doing.  Perhaps the committee could pressure the Department in that regard.  </p> <p>  We echo the concerns on resourcing and funding outlined by some members when representatives of the RTB appeared before the committee.  If the new sanctions regime is to succeed, the board must be properly resourced.  There have been intermittent resourcing issues for a long time and we are a little concerned that sufficient money will not be allocated.  We support the sanctions regime.  It is currently relatively limited and only applies to certain scenarios.</p> <p>  In response to Mr. O'Brien's comments on proportionality, there is a potential fine of a maximum of &euro;30,000, which is divided into &euro;15,000 in costs and &euro;15,000 in fines.  It is limited to that amount to keep it within the jurisdiction of the District Court.  Proportionality is built into the Bill because it is an administrative sanction and must be so, as it would not be constitutional otherwise.  The proportionality is clearly spelled out even in the heads of the Bill.</p> <p>  We wish to raise a wider concern about the interaction between the new sanctions regime and the dispute resolution mechanism of the RTB.  For example, what happens if an investigation concludes with the landlord being fined but there has also been a breach of a tenant's rights?</p><p>Can a tenant then bring a dispute on the back of that?  It would be a strange scenario if a tenant could walk into the RTB and lodge a dispute with a report or sanction from the RTB in his hand and say he or she now wants compensation because the RTB sanctioned the landlord.  We need a little bit more clarity on how they interact.</p><p> I will refer to something the Minister has spoken about in the past as a potential option.  That is a legal definition in the Act of "likely to constitute substantial change" and "substantial change of nature".  They are very important phrases for the purposes of the rent pressure zones and for evictions.  A legal definition, although difficult, has to be tackled.  </p><p> It is a more technical point but we very strongly welcome the changes in head 6 to section 41 of the 2004 Act.  It is very welcome housekeeping in terms of the Residential Tenancies Act.  I do not think anyone would argue that the current interpretation of the RTB is the same as the intended interpretation of the Oireachtas when it passed the Bill, which is that a further Part 4 tenancy is a new tenancy.  The language used in the Bill does not really reflect the intention of the Bill.  It is important housekeeping.</p><p> There is a question for the committee but also for Members of the Oireachtas more generally.  There is a concern about the wording in head 9 on the notice periods, particularly the 28-day notice period, for a notice that is found to be invalid where the time period has expired.  The wording in the heads of the Bill could result in an unintended consequence in cases where a landlord deliberately issues a notice of termination with one day given as a notice period which is found to be invalid and the notice period thereafter is 28 days.  It is clear the intention is if a notice is deemed to be invalid for reasons other than incorrect notice period, when a dispute is lodged with the RTB and the notice period has expired the notice period will then be 28 days.  That is not explicit in the way it is drafted.  It would potentially leave a massive loophole in the legislation.  </p><p> The rent register is not everything we asked for.  It will not address the problem we raised.  The RTB has acknowledged that.  It is really not rent transparency.  I think it has said it is a step along the way.  We have no particular issue with the proposals except possibly to warn of the potential for tenants to be given only enough information to be suspicious but not enough information to demonstrate their rent is lawful or unlawful.  A situation could arise where a person goes to an advocacy organisation or a Deputy and asks them what to do because he or she knows the rent on the street and he or she is paying considerably more than the rent on the street.  The best advice in that scenario might be to lodge a dispute with the RTB.  It can be done online and it costs &euro;25.  The landlord will then have to prove the rent is lawful.  It could lead to the unintended consequence of the RTB responding to speculative cases because people are not being given enough information to know whether the rent is right or wrong.  They are being given just enough information to know it might be right or wrong, in which case it could lead to more cases before the RTB.  From a resourcing perspective it is an issue for the Government but, more generally, it is something no one would really want to see happen.  </p><p> On the issue of student accommodation, we agree with everything that has been said by the USI.  We also echo what was said by the RTB.  It is our belief that an awful lot of student accommodation agreements between landlords and students that are termed licences are actually tenancies.  Clarity is required on the issue and we welcome the Bills from Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il on that issue.  </p><p> On the wider issue of licensees, it is a very complicated issue.  There is an awful lot of very delicate balancing to be struck between the rights of homeowners, in some instances, and licensees.  It is something we encourage the committee to have a look at in the medium term.  It would require an awful lot of careful examination and it is probably appropriate for a committee such as this to examine.  Beyond student accommodation, lodgers and people on the rent-a-room scheme are also licensees and have very few rights.  The equality legislation, which does not necessarily cover residential tenancies, covers the provision of accommodation.  In some instances the equality legislation would protect licensees from discrimination but not in every case, particularly where somebody is sharing his or her primary residence.  </p><p> In terms of opportunities for amendments, I can direct the committee to our website which has lots of them.  I will outline some of the smaller opportunities for amendment in this Bill.  I am cognisant of the fact there is another one on the way.  We would like to see a definition of rent to help navigate the RPZ rules.  We would like to see clarity on things like service charges, parking charges and extra charges.  We would like to see that tackled by a definition of rent so we have certainty about what rent means.  We are harping on about it.  Section 34(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act has no purpose anymore and should be deleted.  It allows for evictions for no reason at the beginning of a new further Part 4 tenancy.  Given that section 42 disappeared at the beginning of 2017, there does not seem to be any reasonable purpose for section 34(b).  </p><p> We are quite exercised about the issue of receivership, given that 2,900 buy-to-let properties were included in the Ulster Bank sale and 4,000 in the PTSB sale and there may well be more coming along.  That is an enormous number of individuals who are now in a very precarious position.  There are an awful lot of landlords who are in a precarious position as well.  We would like to see movement on that.  I understand the Minister has indicated that something is coming along.  However, it has been delayed considerably.  </p><p> I will respond to some of the issues raised.  We agree entirely that the tax treatment of landlords is something that needs to be looked at in detail.  The tax treatment of landlords has to be rebalanced in their favour.  They labour under a relatively unfair situation.  </p><p> In terms of pursuing rent, the enforcement of determination orders is now dealt with in the District Court which is very welcome.  It will help both tenants and landlords considerably in enforcing RTB determination orders.  That is still to play out but we do not see any particular difficulties with it.  </p><p> It is not everything we asked for.  It will not solve problems in many cases but we do not have any particular issues other than the ones we have raised.  It is dependent on the will of the RTB and the Minister in resourcing it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret McCormick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#N00300"><p>There are quite a number of issues.  It is amending legislation but it is not balanced.  It is substantially in favour of tenants and is not balanced for landlords.  It will sanction landlords on one side without dealing with the problem of rents that are substantially below market rent.  That needs to be in the legislation.  It needs to be added in to give any sort of balance.  We are criminalising people who may have just one choice.  The choice from their banks is to increase their income and payments.  The market and the law are telling them they cannot do it even when they are substantially below market rent.  If they do increase it, they are breaching legislation.  If they increase the rent, they may keep their properties.  These rents are below market rent.  If they do not increase the rent, the banks will repossess.  We have 22,000 buy-to-lets in arrears.  We have a massive problem.</p> <p>  The other thing about the rent pressure zones is they do not take into account long leases.  The market is looking for security and some landlords gave security and long leases including indefinite leases in some cases.  RAS leases had requirements around when rent could be increased built into them.</p><p>Many of these leases are based in the initial legislation.  They now have to comply with the rent pressure zone provision introduced in the new legislation.  In some cases, rents can only be increased every three years.  The law also sets specific timeframes for tenancies.  The people who have provided the lengthy leases and the security of tenure we were looking for are the people who are substantially disadvantaged.  The legislation needs to be amended to allow for an increase in rents that are substantially below market rent.  This could be a once-off, or something a landlord could be allowed to do over a period of time.  This must be done to make this legislation balanced.  </p><p> On the technical problem around the termination of tenancies, I welcome that where a previous notice has been technically wrong this can now be rectified within 28 days.  We have no problem with that, assuming the correct notice was given in the first instance, but we need to look at the problem around the first six months and at the end of tenancy.  If a person wants to serve notice of termination of a tenancy he or she must do so before the tenancy ends and this must be done correctly.  The legislation is really difficult in this regard.  Barristers come to us for advice on it and solicitors also have difficulties with it.  A landlord trying to negotiate it has severe difficulties.  It is really easy to get it wrong.  If a tenant does get it wrong, he or she cannot serve it again because a new tenancy will have come into play and for six years.  It is really important that this be addressed in the legislation.</p><p> As stated earlier by my colleague in regard to rent arrears, there a are small number of tenants who, on signing a one year lease, are not paying a penny from start to finish.  The law is allowing this.  The law states that the rent must be paid during the tenancy but it also provides for an appeal.  We need to provide in law that during the appeals process rent must continue be paid to the landlord or the RTB.  Approximately 92% of landlords have less than three properties and 70% have only one.  We are losing landlords and properties from the market because of this.</p></speech>

Before doing so, I would like to comment briefly on some of the issues that have been raised by the representatives of the IPOA.   I congratulate the association on its gallant attempt to persuade the committee that landlords are one of the most oppressed groups in Irish society.  The information and data provided to this committee and to Members as public representatives tells a different story.  For example, we were recently informed that the average return on an investment in residential property in this State is 7.08%.  When compared with 27 other European Union countries, not only is the return here higher than in any of those 27 countries, it is higher by some distance.</p> <p>  Reference was made to Airbnb.  We would love to have more information on what is going on in this area but Airbnb does not share its data.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that increasingly Airbnb is moving from an informal sharing arrangement between people, householders and so on to an opportunity that is making significant money for investors and speculators.  Across Europe, in cities like Barcelona, Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam, regulation has been introduced but Ireland is lagging behind in this regard.</p> <p>  On refurbishment, I can cite a dozen or more examples of landlords in Cork city who have got around the rent pressure zone requirement by laying new carpets and painting the inside of a house.  This practice is rampant.  According to recent statistics from the Central Statistics Office rental income over the last few years, albeit before profit, has increased by more than &euro;1 billion per annum.  If the IPOA has an issue with that I suggest they take up with the Central Statistics Office.  I have not been convinced that landlords are among the more downtrodden groups in Irish society.  I do agree with the representatives of the IPOA that there is a political agenda here.  Unfortunately, that political agenda is different to the one indicated.  There is a political difficulty with the fact that 37% of the largest party in this Parliament and 33% of the second largest party are landlords.  I am not suggesting that they act as a conscious group or lobby but their thinking is informed in significant measure by their vantage point within society and this is one of the reasons for the delay in introducing the legislation that is needed to protect the rights of tenants.  </p> <p>  I will now move to questions.  My first question is to the representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland.  I was recently informed by a person involved in a student union in a college in Cork that she was aware of at least three students who study by day and sleep in their cars by night because they cannot afford the rents being asked by landlords in the vicinity of the college.  The issue was taken up in the local media and it became a talking point for a day or two.  Another issue that she raised with me, which I tried to highlight and I think is a more significant issue, is that bedrooms in at least 25 residences in the vicinity of the college have been partitioned off to cater for between nine and 15 students.  She also said that the landlords had attempted to gain legal backing for this on the basis of it being hostel type accommodation.  Many of these properties are owned by one landlord.  By my calculation, there are close to 400 students in this situation.</p><p>Has that come across the USI's radar and, if so, and would Mr. Kerrigan like to comment?<br/><br/>The representatives of Threshold gave a very interesting presentation.  Their points about some of the unintended consequences have been noted, particularly the point about the 28 days which the committee would do well to look at.  The representatives of Threshold on the ground in Cork city will be familiar with this case.  It relates to substantial refurbishment as grounds for issuing notices to quit.  The Leeside apartments were purchased last year by a vulture fund.  Notices to quit issued within a matter of days.  It is not a question of applying a lick of paint or throwing down a few carpets; substantial refurbishment is indeed taking place here.  The apartments have been turned into a <i>de facto</i>building site with Kango hammers while people are trying to live their lives, put children to sleep and so forth.  Everybody knows that when the work is done the rents there will be substantially increased, possibly up to being doubled.  Do the representatives of Threshold have a comment to make on such a scenario?  What legislative changes would be appropriate to stop such profiteering at the expense of ordinary residents?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#P00200"><p>It is refreshing to get the opportunity to address comments such as this because often we see in the media erroneous and irrelevant comments thrown out that have no basis.  Deputy Barry's first point related to return.  Return is a function of annual rent over capital value.  That figure of 7%, which is high for Dublin, is a gross figure.  Minimum financing costs on that investment are 5%, which brings it down to 2%.  Tax is applied to the profit at a rate of 53% before account is taken of service charges, repairs, PRTB costs and LPT.  Therefore it is a heavily negative return, not a positive return.  That 7% is gross and before costs.  While 7% sounds good in the media, the reality is that it is a negative.</p> <p>  I know the Deputy cited an example of somebody who applied a lick of paint to a property in Cork and got outside the rent cap.  How did they get out of the rent cap?  Did the RTB come out and approve that or was it something that was done outside the rules?  The latter must be the case because a lick of paint would not qualify as refurbishment.  It is nice to throw that anecdote out there and it sounds good.  We represent compliant landlords.  Our body does not have members who flout the rules.  We hear about such landlords and we would sanction and admonish those who are flouting the rules.  We do not hear those cases but I know the media pick up on them because it is a good story and it furthers the political agenda.</p> <p>  The Deputy threw out a figure of rents having increased by &euro;1 billion.  I would like to know what the pool of rent or total rent is.  In 2010, rents reduced by 50% from where they had been.  That is a matter of public record.  I am a landlord and I can tell the Deputy it was 50%.  When rents have increased by 50%, they have increased by 50% following a drop of 50%.  While it sounds good again, the reality of it is different.</p> <p>  In addition, during the period in which rents increased, costs also increased.  We had the introduction of the local property tax, more punitive tax measures and the application of the universal social charge to rental income.  I do not know what planet people are living on, but if they believe landlords should invest in property and essentially offer a charitable service where they offer accommodation for less than market costs and make a loss, while generating additional taxes for the public good, that should be stated as public policy.  We would then see a further reduction in the rent pool.  Would Deputy Barry invest in property on the basis that he would not cover his costs and would operate at a deficit, but he would be acting in accordance with his conscience and offering a charitable service?  That is how the system is working.</p> <p>  I am surprised at some of the comments from Threshold, whose core objective is to cater for its tenant base.  That is an appropriate aim which I understand but the organisation is continually pushing against the landlord, driving an anti-landlord agenda and making things more difficult, costly and onerous for the landlord.</p> <p>  People do not rent property because they love it and they get enjoyment out of it.  They do it because they are trying to provide for a pension.  At some stage people will decide to invest in shares instead of investing in property.  It is a dry investment and they get 5% or 6% per annum with none of this nonsense around regulation, being tripped up on technicalities, being taxed to the gills and having debt obligations.  That is what is happening.  We are seeing a shrinking in the property investor population.  For every three properties sold, one is being rented out.  In two years' time, the position will be even worse.  We will have great regulations.  Landlords will not be able to move without getting clearance from the RTB.  The tax authorities will be all over them and the politicians will have dealt with them.  However, we will not have any stock and that will create a bigger issue than the problem the country faces now.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in saying there is a political agenda, but all the political agenda has done is to drive down supply.  If the real aim is to help tenants and decrease rents, the politicians are failing abysmally.</p> <p>  On the issue of Deputies being landlords, maybe they are; I do not know.  However, that is not evident in any of the rules that have been introduced since 2010 or 2011.  There is absolutely no landlord bias.  I would have to say fair play to Deputies because if they are landlords, which is not evident, they have taken the hit.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Union of Students of Ireland.  I do not where the media get these examples, but they always find the one case where a landlord has divided a house into 15 units.  While it happens, every single business has rogue operators.  That includes building, distribution, etc.  The landlord business will never be an exception to that.  By pulling out the exceptional case and drafting a series of laws and introducing costs to deal with the exception, if that is where we are going, that is fine, but it is bad legislation in that context.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and my colleagues from Threshold raised the issue of the resourcing of the Residential Tenancies Board.  We would welcome an increase in resourcing because the system does not work for us, just as it does not work for tenants.  Resourcing should not be increased at the expense of the landlord.  If everybody in the room was being objective, we would all agree that the RTB is a tenant body and not a landlord body.  We have been before the board of the RTB and if one looks at determinations and the issues that arise in the RTB, they show it is a very pro-tenant body.  To the extent that resourcing needs to be ramped up in the RTB, it should not come at the expense of the landlord.  I question whether the tenant should have an obligation to part-fund the registration fee.  At the end of the day, the RTB's role is to protect the tenant's interest and the tenant surely should make a contribution to that fee.</p> <p>  We represent compliant landlords.  We have regular meetings, many of which focus on educating the landlord.  We accept this legislation is coming and it is onerous and complex.  However, landlords need training; professionals would need training on this.  Whether we streamline the legislation into one Act or otherwise, people need training.  As a body that is trying to educate landlords and ensure we do not have the kinds of issues the legislation is designed to address, the IPOA should receive some degree of State funding - through the RTB or some other body - to facilitate training.  This could involve RTB staff coming in to talk to our members.  If we are trying to act on behalf of responsible and obedient landlords, operating in a very tough legislative and tax regime, surely funding could be provided to allow that training.</p></speech>

The worst comment I heard in recent years also related to Cork.  A mature student in UCC, who stayed in the university until late at night when it closed, would sleep under a bridge until it opened the following morning.</p><p>That case was not too dissimilar to those of the students mentioned.</p><p> We see that large numbers of students are living in small rooms throughout the country, especially in the major towns and cities, including Dublin, Cork, Galway and Maynooth, where there have been serious accommodation issues in recent years.  Rogue landlords are in the minority, but they exist and simply because they are a minority does not mean we should do nothing about it.  These rooms are not only being taken by students but also working professionals and foreign nationals because they are desperate.  Students are working in precarious jobs and do not get the grants that were available five or six years ago.  Students are desperate because grants have not increased in value, whereas the student contribution has increased by 375% since 2008 and the costs of accommodation have increased significantly.</p><p> We do not have enough purpose-built student accommodation.  Students are being forced into the private rental sector where they are at a disadvantage straightaway.  The vast majority of students seeking to rent do not take 12-month leases because they move home for the summer to work or whatever.  When a student is looking for a nine-month lease at the start of the year, he or she is at a disadvantage.  They must also look for a new lease every year, which means they pay a new rent and it is always at the higher rate of market rent.  Students are always disadvantaged and cannot compete with young professionals or families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Amy Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#Q00200"><p>I wish to highlight several points.  We can pick out one or two of the hard cases but there are also many hard cases on our front.  I was vice president for welfare for two years in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology Students Union and I saw the hard cases on a daily basis.  They were common; it was not a question of dealing with one every couple of months.  When asked about basic heating in the house, students were told it was a privilege for them to have heating.  These are the issues that students in particular come up against when looking for rental accommodation.</p> <p>  If students have a concern during their tenancy, they are afraid to make a complaint because of fear of eviction and something else happening during their tenancy.  This is particularly the case for digs-style accommodation, which is what we are before the committee to speak on today.  Many students do not want to open their mouths because of fear of what may happen if an issue arises.  Such accommodation is what we are relying on during the academic year.  We are in June and many leaving certificate students are doing the leaving certificate.  They are not thinking about accommodation, but others have been thinking about it since they started the process of choosing a college course.  This is because the media has been reporting, rightly, that most purpose-built student accommodation is 80% or 90% booked out with a small percentage reserved for incoming first-year students.  That is a concerning statistic.  There is a heavy reliance on digs.</p> <p>  The issue is not one of changing legislation but of introducing legislation for digs-style accommodation because there is currently no protection for the tenant.  The law is completely in favour of landlords.  The terms and conditions of a tenancy in digs-style accommodation is at the landlord's discretion.  I will offer some examples from my time.  We think of digs-style accommodation as being close by or across the road from the campus at which the student is studying.  During my time in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology we had students based in the Dublin Road campus or the Cluain Mhuire campus who were living in accommodation as far away as Claregalway or Athenry.  They had to rely on poor public transportation because they were coming from other parts of the country.  That was as close as they could get to their campus.</p> <p>  There are issues with facilities.  Usually in digs-style accommodation facilities are completely at the discretion of the landlord.  Students may not even be able to use the kettle in the house.  They may only have the facility of the bedroom and many are not allowed to have even one visitor to the property.  It is solely a matter of sleeping in the accommodation and then leaving.  Some students may be told they can have food.  I have met students who were very upset because the food they were being provided with was substandard, for example, chicken nuggets and chips and the cheapest of cheap food.  If these students have a disagreement with their landlord which they want to resolve, they have nowhere to go to resolve it, even if they have contracts or a written agreement.</p> <p>  August is the busiest time for incoming students.  During my final summer in GMIT students union people who were willing to rent out digs-style accommodation were coming to our reception desk.  A student would come at the same time and we would introduce the parties there and then.  The accommodation was not even getting to the stage of being advertised publicly.  That is how much of a crisis we were in.  We were getting people in at the same time and meeting them there and then, such was the demand.</p> <p>  Students are not being taken seriously in the rental market, especially with regard to tenants' rights.  There are cases in which landlords are not listening to students.  As officers throughout the country, we are fighting on behalf of students with Threshold.  I was in frequent contact with Threshold during my time.  The charity was very helpful with advice.  The situation for students is not right and needs to change, in particular with regard to digs-style accommodation.  We need to fix this problem. </p></speech>

The sector is part of the solution but it is not the cause of homelessness.  Investors invest in the sector and its role is to provide homes.  However, the sector is not the reason we have a homeless problem.  It is the responsibility of the State to ensure adequate homes for its people.</p> <p>  We seem to be in the position where the private rental sector is now seen as the solution for everything.  As a result of the large amount of legislation and the different tax treatments, it is almost impossible for a landlord to navigate the sector, between housing standards, the Residential Tenancies Act and all the legislation that has been introduced to deal with the sector.  So much is involved that instead of encouraging people to enter the private rental sector, we are discouraging them from doing so.</p> <p>  The nature of the market is that only 10,000 accommodation units are provided by real estate investment trusts and similar companies.  Some 92% of landlords have fewer than three properties.  We have legislated out of all proportion for normal investors, given that 70% of landlords own one property.  We are back to the position where every time some problem arises in the sector, it is brought back to the landlord being responsible, but that is not the case.  I will accept that, like in every walk of life, there are bad landlords and tenants, but that is not reflected in legislation.</p> <p>  The rental sector must be made far simpler but many aspects of this Bill make it far more complicated.  Issues will arise that will make it far more difficult.  Consideration is being given to the issue of extended tenancy.  Previously, a tenancy had a start and a finish under the legislation.  Now, a tenancy is be extended.  I do not know how anyone managing a property can get around this and understand it.  In addition, landlords are to be sanctioned if they do something wrong.  Market rent is no longer market rent because we have rent pressure zones.  The legal definition no longer applies to market rent.  Every time the legislation is changed there are unintended consequences.  The number of tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board has declined by 7,000 and we know we have far fewer landlords available now.</p> <p>  We knew when bedsits were being removed that it would create a problem and we saw landlords exiting the market.  We can see landlords exiting the market now.  We now have an exit strategy, especially for older landlords.  They are the very people who bought properties and rented them out as a form of pension arrangement.  They cannot navigate the sector and their rents are substantially below market rates.  We have to stop and try to be fair to the sector.  We need to be fair to both tenants and landlords.</p></speech>

I am aware of the issues in the Leeside apartments.  I know both Deputy Barry and Councillor Ryan have been active in supporting the tenants and Threshold in Cork has been assisting.  I do not want to talk about that case in particular since the adjudicator has not come back yet and it may be appealed.  On the issue of substantial refurbishment and change, we have a legislative regime which envisages three different levels of landlord intervention in a property.  In ascending order, there is routine maintenance, substantial refurbishment, which means a notice of termination can be issued, and a substantial change in the nature.</p> <p>  At the very least, we need to put those three levels on a legislative footing and give some sort of definition of what those levels are.  It is a matter for the committee and the Oireachtas to decide whether the intended purpose of the substantial change in the nature of exemption has succeeded, in the first instance, and whether it is worth a candle in respect of the abuse of that particular section.  The intention was to not allow a situation where landlords simply allowed apartments or houses to fall into deterioration because they could not raise the rents on them more than 4%.  It is a question, again, that we need more statistics to address and it is for the Oireachtas to decide whether it should remain in the legislation. </p></speech>

We operate on the basis of what families and individuals come to us in the context of the housing market, so we witness the acute situations many people find themselves in.  We respond with advice, information and advocacy - that is with both a small "a" at the Residential Tenancies Board and a big "A" in this type of work influencing policy.  That is our agenda and it is based on fairness, on responding to the housing market as we see it and on a mission to prevent families and individuals from becoming homeless, as many now are.  We stand in that breach between people holding on to or losing their home.  That is our agenda.  I want to make that response in respect of the comments made this morning.</p></speech>

When people find themselves in those circumstances, however, it is up to the State to cater for them - it is not up to private individuals to do it at their own cost.  Reverting to the issue of substantial refurbishment, it costs about &euro;15,000 to do a basic refurbishment of a two bedroom apartment.  The difference in enjoyment of that apartment that a tenant will have pre and post the refurbishment scenario is substantial.  I am interested in knowing why Deputy Barry feels the landlord should not be able to charge more for that apartment on the basis that he or she has substantially improved the quality of the living environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#R00500"><p>I have a couple of points for Ms McCormick and Mr. O'Brien.  I am genuinely not anti-landlord.  I am probably one of the few Deputies living in the private rental sector who likes living there.  In most of the debates here and in most of my public commentary, we acknowledge that the vast majority of landlords are compliant and provide a good service.  We want to see a restructured private rental sector in the future.  That would be good for tenants because it would give them security of rent and tenure and also good for the landlords who make that investment because they could make a fair return.  I repeatedly say that publicly and here as well.</p> <p>  I accept the sincerity of the witnesses' points and I ask them to at least consider the sincerity of ours.  Ours is not a political agenda.  We have two problems.  We have far too many accidental landlords who got into landlordism as a passive investment but it is not a passive investment, it is an active one.  Many people took on substantial liabilities when they got into that situation.  I accept that people who bought a single investment property at the height of the boom are now in difficult financial circumstances.  That is a real social and economic problem.  Our other problem is that rents are rising far too high for working families - not for social housing tenants and I will come to that in a second.  </p> <p>  Looking at the RTB rental index published yesterday, it was 7.8% in Dublin in the last 12 months and 7.1% overall.  People's wages have not gone up that much.  I accept that a category of landlords is unable to make a return of any kind.  The flip side of that is a growing number of families, particularly working families, cannot afford the asking rents of &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,200.  They are not exceptional cases, they are standard.  We have to have a conversation at some point where, instead of us butting heads on some of the substantive issues, we have to be able to sit down and work out how we fix some of that.  We are not going to agree on it all but how do we fix some of it?  </p> <p>  Ms McCormick and Mr. O'Brien are here because those of us on the committee take our job seriously.  We are open to being persuaded that we deal with some of the points raised in the detail of how the legislation is drafted, and I think we can do that, or we are open to being convinced that this is the wrong thing to do or that there are other things that could be put in, either now or in the next Bill.  The witnesses should not think that we invite them in here and do not listen.  We genuinely do and I am going to go through a couple of the points where I agree with them.  I want to highlight first, however, some of the points where I do not necessarily disagree but I do take a slightly different view.  </p> <p>  Part of the problem with our public debate is that we think of landlords as a homogenous group and they are not.  There are single property landlords who have properties from before the boom and who do not have mortgages, or do not have significant mortgages, and they are making significant profit.  A large number of landlords, accidental and deliberate, bought properties during the boom and they are the people that the witnesses were talking about.  In many instances, they are making a loss on their rental properties and I accept that.   Some of them are in mortgage difficulty with their primary residences as well.  We also have many professional landlords, who are medium-sized operators, who are making a profit.  </p> <p>  The witnesses are right, and Deputy Barry and I raise this regularly, the new institutional investors - the real estate investment trust, REITs, and the capital funds - are getting disproportionate treatment in respect of tax.  They have no tax on the rent roll, no tax on capital gains and, if they are structured properly, from their point of view, no dividend withholding tax.  The playing field is not level and there is no dispute on that.  Many of us spend much time arguing against all of that because it creates all sorts of difficulties.  </p> <p>  There is a heavy level of State subsidy going into the rental sector.  I refer, for example, to tax relief on the interest portions of mortgages.  That is a significant cost lost to the State annually.  It is also increasing - it increased from the last budget to this one and it will increase again.  The Government wants to restore it to 100% and it is currently available at 100% to people on the housing assistant payment, HAP.  I am not saying that to offset the difficulties that the witnesses outlined.  All I am saying is that it is legitimate, as a landlord representative organisation, to raise local property tax, LPT, and other rising costs but there are also increasing tax deductions available.  Over 100,000 rental tenancies are subsidised by the State, some at very increasing costs.  Homeless HAP is now paying out &euro;1,800 to &euro;1,900 for families.  Standard HAP is close to the market rent in large parts of Dublin.  It is important that we put all of those facts out there.  There is much subsidising of the private rental sector and that has to be acknowledged.  </p> <p>  On short-term lets, I will send the document to the witnesses to let them know what we are proposing because this committee put much work and spent a lot of time looking at this issue.  We think the Minister is moving in this direction.  We are not proposing to close down short-term letting and the regulatory regime that we unanimously agreed is less onerous than Barcelona, Madrid and New York.  It is closer to what exists in London.  We think it is a fair set of proposals.  Airbnb has a particular business model and an aggressive lobbying strategy and that is its right.  If the witnesses look at our proposals, they will see that they are different from what they may have read in the newspapers.  They are certainly not restrictive in any way.  I agree with the witnesses that we need training for landlords.  If we think about it, a taxi driver has more regulatory and training requirements before they can get into a taxi and drive somebody around.  The home I live in as a tenant, however, has very little in respect of professional support and training requirements for landlords.</p><p>I would therefore be strongly in support of that and of additional resourcing through the RTB and to representative organisations to help landlords to professionalise.  I think Threshold has been calling for this for years, as have others.  I agree with Ms McCormick about the now confusing relationship between HAP, RAS and long-term leasing.  An increasing number of RAS landlords are exiting the scheme completely because of what they see as disadvantageous treatment.  Many of us have raised this in the D&aacute;il, in committee and with the Department privately to see how we might resolve it.  Again, we do not always disagree with the representatives of property owners but there are areas where we are in agreement.</p><p> One of the points the RTB made very clearly was that it is not in favour of criminal sanctions.  It thinks it is the wrong route to take and wants a civil sanction regime.  The RTB made the point very clearly that it wants to be able to distinguish between an administrative error or genuine mistake and vexatious breaches of the rules.  This is why I think Mr. Elliott's point about the sliding scale of sanctions is absolutely right.  It is not the case, and it would be wrong of us as a committee to suggest, that if someone makes a small error, he or she is liable for a &euro;30,000 fine.  That is not the intention of the Bill, and we will certainly not suggest that when we get into the detail of it.  However, the purpose of enforcement is to ensure that, no matter how many people breach the rules, the sanction for doing so is too great for them even to think about it.  This is not only beneficial to the tenant; it is actually beneficial to the vast majority of landlords, who are trying to do a good job.  If 1%, 5% or 10% of landlords break all the rules and undercut the law-abiding landlords, it is not good for the landlords either.  I therefore encourage the Irish Property Owners Association to consider that some of this regulation, if done right, will actually be beneficial to the members it represents because it levels the playing field between that percentage of landlords, whatever it is - we do not know - who break the rules and those who abide by the law.</p><p> I wish to make just a few quick points before we finish.</p></speech>

The reason we are supportive of this in principle is that if one looks at what is happening with the rent index, it is clear that a very large number of landlords are either availing of exemptions, correctly or incorrectly, or breaking the rules, and it cannot be left to tenants, particularly vulnerable tenants, to police the rules.  Therefore, all I ask of the representatives of the Irish Property Owners Association is to engage with us, when the Bill is published and they see the final detail of it, to tease out some of the other points it raises.  We are open to such engagement.  However, the rising level of rents is not sustainable for the people paying those rents.  If we can have a conversation about how we might address the concerns of landlords who are in difficulty, who I believe are in the minority, and if we level the playing field between the REITs and investment trusts, I think there will be things we can work on.  Likewise, the length of time it takes to deal with a vexatious tenant is not acceptable, and I do not think anyone here would argue otherwise.  If the representatives of the Irish Property Owners Association want to have a serious conversation about this, many of us are more than open to it because the process does not work for good tenants or good landlords either.</p> <p>  Despite the fact that we support the Bill, some things the representatives have said have given us food for thought.  However, just as they think we are all anti-landlord, if they were to engage in a slightly different way with us, I think they would be surprised that stabilisation of the rental sector in the interests of tenants and landlords is actually what most of us want.  I think this could be achieved by a more constructive dialogue.</p></speech>

There are votes coming up in the House.</p> <p>  I will respond to one question I was asked which relates to substantial refurbishment.  The majority of people who come to my constituency clinic and who are facing notices to quit are being evicted on the basis of not being able to afford rent increases above the caps brought in on the back of "substantial refurbishment" or are being asked to vacate in order to facilitate "substantial refurbishment".  I am aware of many cases of rent increases above the 4% that are being sought on what I would consider, and what the residents would consider, to be spurious or relatively spurious grounds.  Unfortunately, however, not every tenant has the information, the knowledge and the confidence to take cases to the Residential Tenancies Board.  I have come across many people whom I could have advised otherwise, but they come to me after the fact.  This happens all the time.  Then there are the cases, such as the Leeside apartments case, in which a corporate entity looking at an investment opportunity to increase rents very significantly - in this example, perhaps a doubling of rents - invests serious money in refurbishment, which no one denies, but people who have lived there for years, people who have young kids, people who are on low incomes and people who are unable to find accommodation elsewhere, given the scarcity of lettings, the number of people queuing for each letting, etc., face eviction.  This is wrong.  There are other cases, which are perhaps the cases to which the representatives of the Irish Property Owners Association have pointed, in which a small investor landlord must carry out significant work on a house and feels he or she is entitled to a rent increase above 4% on the back of that.  The point I would make is that we are living in exceptional times.  There is, if not officially declared, in reality a housing emergency in this country.  More than 10,000 people, if the figures were computed properly, are officially homeless.  This does not count the number, double or treble that, of people who are unofficially homeless - couch-surfing and so on.  That people are being put out on the street on the back of rent increases, irrespective of how justified a landlord might feel in seeking the increase, on the basis of investment he or she has put into the house, is just not acceptable, in our view, in the context of a housing emergency.</p> <p>  The debate will continue, and I am happy to continue it, but I do not think we have the time here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018061400002#S01000"><p>Going back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's and Deputy Barry's comments, what we have is probably a theoretical argument.  I absolutely accept that there are accidental landlords in the market.  If the policy is that these people should not be in the market, let us get into the debate as to where the rental market is going.  The REITs have no appetite to acquire units on a piecemeal basis, one here and one there; they want lot sizes together as they are easier to manage, etc.  Who will provide the rental stock then?  The choice is either the private accidental landlord, the small landlord, or perhaps the professional landlord, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin says, or the State - perhaps a combination of both through the housing agencies, etc., or the private investment community.  However, if we accept that the private investor gets into the market, we are into a theoretical discussion as to what return someone should get on his or her money for investing in a market.  Are we asking people in the private community - this goes back to Deputy Barry's point - to take on and provide accommodation at substandard returns or at a cost to the landlord?  This is really what much of this comes back to.  If the private community says this is not something it is willing to do or, most likely, can afford to do, we are back to the argument that the State should really step in and provide accommodation and cater for the people to whom Deputy Barry refers.  It is not fair to ask the private community, regardless of whether an individual believes it would be a nice thing to do, to house people at its own expense.  People pay a lot of tax in this country.  Despite what is put out in the media, Ireland is a high-tax country on a personal tax level.  People already pay their way through taxes, and it is not fair to ask them to subsidise housing in addition.  If that is where we are going, I suggest that policy should be aimed at boosting supply and perhaps increasing the role of the State in the rental market.</p> <p>  My second point is just based on anecdotal evidence.  Members can take it whatever way they want.  I accept that rents are rising but I deal with this business every day of the week and there is a ceiling on rent because, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin rightly said, wages are not rising at the same level as rents have been.  Rents have risen from a very low level, but wages have not risen as much.  Essentially, assuming there were no rent caps, if one put up one's rent by 10%, I can tell members one would be waiting to rent it because people would not be able to afford to rent it.  Most people will not take on a rental commitment in excess of what they can afford.</p><p>There is a fine line between pushing rent up to a level where the landlord will not get any inquires and keeping it at a level that is affordable.  The market will only pay what the market can afford.  I would have thought or I am pretty sure that without the rent cap rents would have stabilised.  There is an affordability element.  People only earn so much and they can only afford to pay so much.  They cannot rent for more than what they are earning.  On a logical basis, rent could not have kept on increasing, regardless of whether rent caps came in.</p><p> Reference was made to interest deductibility.  Interest rates are very low.  There is already a reduction in interest relief that is claimable.  It is not a major incentive to landlords.</p><p> I urge the committee to consider one point.  If criminal sanction is the way we are going, then to incentivise tenants to pay their rent there should be criminal sanctions if tenants do not pay their rent.  I am not being smart oe facetious, but we cannot have it on one side and not on the other.  Let us suppose a landlord overcharges rent by &euro;30 per month and is subject to a criminal sanction, but a tenant does not pay any rent for two years and there is no criminal sanction.  There has to be a balancing.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien said that without the rent caps we would not have seen such an increase.  I do not believe that.  We have seen a 7.8% increase in the price of rent in Dublin and 7.1% across the country.  The increase is significantly higher for student accommodation.  Rent caps have helped in some way.  We need only look at the purpose-built student accommodation that has not necessarily been seen as operating under the rent caps.  We have seen a 27% increase in student accommodation in DCU and 18% increase in student accommodation in NUIG.  The rent caps are not perfect, but, believe me, they are better than nothing.</p></speech>

The <i>daft.ie </i>website did research on this.  The company said that existing tenants were at a rate of 25% below the market.  We are looking at all the new tenancies.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Helen McDonald and Mr. Robert Nicholson, who are both principal officers in the pensions policy area of the Department.  In my statement, I will try to set out and address the changes that have occurred in the area of pensions and related payments since the committee published its report last July.  In short, there have been three main areas of material change: the first being the measures introduced in budget 2018; the second being the measures announced by the Minister towards the end of January this year to deal with people impacted adversely by the 2012 rate band changes; and the third being the publication of the Government's Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 in February this year.  I will  take each of these in turn.<br/><br/>I refer first to the budget 2018 changes.  I think the committee will know all of this already but I will outline the changes for the record.  The rate of the State pensions was increased by &euro;5 per week and proportionate increases were provided for those on reduced and qualified dependent payments.  This brings the full-rate State pension contributory payment to &euro;243.30 per week and the full-rate state pension non-contributory payment to &euro;232 per week.  These increases became effective in the last week of March this year.  In addition, a Christmas bonus of 85% was applied to all core long-term social welfare payments, including pension payments.<br/><br/>A secondary and new telephone support allowance of &euro;2.50 per week was introduced for those living alone who receive the fuel allowance.  This measure is specifically targeted at the most vulnerable pensioners to provide them with access to personal alarms or phones for security.  It is also aimed at encouraging social contact and minimising social isolation for those living alone.  Payment of this new allowance began last week and benefits approximately 126,000 pensioners.<br/><br/>The fuel allowance payment was increased by one week from 26 weeks of payments to 27 weeks.  As the committee is aware, this was subsequently extended by a further week as a once-off measure to assist people during the unseasonably cold weather at the start of March.  In addition to that, although not a specific budget 2018 measure, since last October, recipients of the fuel allowance can now opt to receive it in two lump sum payments, the first in October and the second in January, rather than receiving it as a weekly payment.  This facilitates people buying fuel in bulk and availing of any special offers or discounts on the purchase of the particular fuel that meets their specific needs.  To date, in excess of 58,000 people have availed of that opportunity.<br/><br/>A further provision of &euro;10 million was made to maintain and enhance the free travel scheme for the approximately 915,000 direct beneficiaries of that scheme.  The purpose of this extra provision is to facilitate more private commercial operators joining the scheme for the first time, for existing participants sustaining existing routes and adding more of them and for operators to return to the scheme where they had previously withdrawn.  This provision also allows for the discount applied on free travel payments to Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway to be reduced from 40% to 30%, putting it on an equal footing with other commercial operators participating in the free travel scheme.  That summarises the measures brought in in budget 2018 and the things that have changed since the committee published its report last year.<br/><br/>Moving on to the second set of measures, on 23 January this year, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new interim total contributions approach, TCA, which will include up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model to qualify for a higher rate of the contributory State pension.  This interim TCA, which we refer to as T12, will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions, as opposed to the timing of them, determines the final pension outcome for recipients.<br/><br/>Under the new arrangements a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new home caring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where he or she satisfies the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Crucially, unlike the existing homemakers disregard system, periods of home caring before that scheme was introduced in 1994 may be recognised under the new scheme.  Up to ten years of other credits, for example, when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  For example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years of paid contributions, five years jobseeker credits and 15 years home caring credits over a 50 year working period.<br/><br/>The interim TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, comes into effect from 30 March 2018.  Pensioners do not need to contact the Department at this juncture.  Instead, the Department will invite approximately 51,000 pensioners who were assessed under the current rate bands in place since 2012 to have their pensions recalculated under T12 to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  The Department has established a dedicated unit to progress this initiative and that unit is currently working to design and develop the required processes, procedures, legislation, IT solutions and staffing needed to implement it.  Once that work is completed, the Department expects to send out the invitations near the end of the year and to begin payments, including arrears for any period from 30 March 2018, from the first quarter of 2019.<br/><br/>On 28 February the Government of its comprehensive Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023.  The roadmap details a series of 43 specific actions presented under six strands, which taken together, will modernise our pension system while continuing to target resources at those most in need.  The first strand is reform of the State pension; the second strand concerns a new automatic enrolment system; and the third and fourth strands relate to occupational and private pension schemes and improving measures around those; the fifth strand relates to further reform of public service pensions provision; and the sixth strand is about supporting fuller working lives.  However, for the purposes of this morning's meeting, I will concentrate briefly on the measures relating to the State pensions area and auto-enrolment.<br/><br/>The roadmap confirms that the Government will introduce the total contributions approach for all new claimants of the contributory State pension from 2020 onwards.  To this end, the Minister recently launched a public consultation process on TCA and departmental officials will, next week, brief Oireachtas Members and their staff as part of this process.</p><p>It is important to note that, contrary to some erroneous reporting in the media, no decisions have been made on the key elements of the total contributions approach, such as the number of years of contributions or credits that will be required for a full pension; how self-employed persons who were not in the social insurance system prior to 1988 will be dealt with; or what transitional arrangements may be necessary or suitable on the introduction of the system.  </p><p> The Minister has made it very clear she is keen to hear people's views on these things before determining recommendations for Government, hence the public consultation process.  The roadmap also sets out how the Government will explore how future increases in State pension payments will be formally linked to the CPI and average wages.  This requires study to determine what elements need to be included in calculations and over what periods.  We will commence that later in the year.  Furthermore, the roadmap sets out the Government's commitment to no further increases in State pension age before 2035, beyond the increases to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028 that are already legislated for.  Any future changes in the State pension age after 2035 will be linked to increases in life expectancy.  </p><p> Contrary to some media reporting, Ireland will not have the highest pension age in OECD countries by 2028.  While Ireland has legislated for a specific age, quite a number of other OECD and EU countries have complicated formulas linked to life expectancy which will result in some of them having the same pension age or higher pension ages than Ireland.  </p><p> There are also proposals in the roadmap to provide individuals with the capacity to defer receipt of the State pension contributory on an annual basis up to the age of 70.  In return, an actuarial adjustment would be applied to increase the rate the person receives when the pension entitlement is drawn down.  The objective is to expand cultural norms and perceptions around retirement age and support a positive ageing environment where older people are to the greatest extent possible encouraged and provided with greater flexibility to work to and beyond the normal retirement age if they so choose.  In addition, the roadmap sets out how consideration will be given to flexibility with respect to the age at which people who do not have the requisite number of contributions for a full-rate State pension may continue to make social insurance contributions beyond the State pension age, again if the person so chooses.</p><p> I will address Ireland's supplementary retirement savings gap.  The Government has confirmed that by 2022, it will begin implementation of an automatic enrolment retirement savings system.  While employees will maintain freedom of choice to opt out should they so choose, the objective of this reform is to encourage personal long-term saving for retirement purposes and to help individuals survive what would otherwise be unwanted and significant reductions in living standards at retirement.  An interdepartmental programme board has already been established to strategically steer this work and it is intended to launch an automatic enrolment straw-man proposal in the near future which will act as the basis for a full national consultation process.  The Government has already made it clear it is determined the State pension is and will remain the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  Accordingly, any auto-enrolment system will not replace but will simply supplement the State pension.  It will result in members making defined contributions into personal accounts which in turn will be supplemented by contributions by employers and the State.  However, many of the details of the design are yet to be determined and will be set out in the straw-man proposal I mentioned.  While not an exclusive list, these will include matters such as the preferred operational structure and governance of the system, the target membership for the system, the contribution rates that may be required for that system, the financial incentives that could be provided by the State, the rate of savings or investment options that may be available to members, the terms for opt-out and re-enrolment and the options available for subsequent draw down of pensions.  I have listed them to give the committee a flavour of the types of issues that need to be teased out in the public consultation and the final design of the system.  While suggestions for each of these will be made in the straw-man they are not meant to be definitive.  They are being provided to help stimulate debate and discussion and hopefully some degree of consensus over the course of the remainder of the year.</p><p> We expect that public consultation to begin in the very near future and to run until the last quarter of the year.  It is intended it will include a number of fora to bring people together for that discussion and debate.  </p><p> I hope this gives the committee a sense of the changes that have occurred over the past year and an overview of the major reforms planned over the coming months and years.  My colleagues and I are happy to try to answer any questions the committee has.  </p></speech>

I will focus my remarks this morning on the issue of the State pension and specifically changes that occurred and which have been proposed since the publication of the committee&rsquo;s report in July 2017.  An increasing number of older people are experiencing fear about retirement due to worries about income adequacy.  Less than half of those aged between 20 and 65 have a private pension.  Three out of four private sector workers have no pension apart from the contributory State pension.  A fair State pension enables older people to age with dignity and independence, keeping them out of poverty.<br/><br/>A substantial percentage of older people are reliant on the State pension for the majority of their income.  For those over 65, more than three-quarters of their income is made up of public transfers.  Latest CSO SILC figures show a largely unchanged at risk of poverty and consistent poverty rates for the over-65s and that one in five people aged over 65 who lives alone experience deprivation.  The at risk of poverty rate stands at &euro;12,358.  A full State pension is slightly above this figure and stands at &euro;12,651.  A State pension for those with an average of 39 or fewer contributions is below the at risk of poverty rate.  <br/><br/>While the State pension remained largely unchanged in times of austerity during the recession, vital secondary income supports for older people were devastated.  Between 2009 and 2015 an older person on the State pension and household benefits package lost over &euro;13 each week.  Some of the cuts to secondary income supports have been partially restored and we are very grateful for that but a lot more progress is needed, particularly for those in receipt of the fuel allowance.  There has been a 200% to 300% increase in prescription charges.  There have been new taxes on water and property and rising energy and medicine costs.  These new taxes, charges and rising prices in recent years can have a greater impact on older people who are living on a fixed income.<br/><br/>A key issue we are seeking to have addressed this year is the change introduced in September 2012 to the eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension.  An extension of band rates and minimum qualifying contributions saw the top rate for the contributory State pension left alone but it became harder to qualify for it and easier to qualify for the lower payment rates.  While those with a full PRSI contribution record and entitled to a full pension were unaffected, many of those with a reduced record lost out.  Research commissioned by Age Action on this issue and discussed here previously shows that this change, combined with the averaging rule used to calculate contributions, is punishing women who took time out to care for their children or for other reasons. <br/><br/>Of the 36,000 - now estimated to be more than 50,000 - initially affected by these changes between September 2012 and June 2016, more than 62% were women.  They will continue to be affected in the years to come, receiving smaller <i>pro rata</i>increases in the pension.  In the October budget, Age Action is asking the committee to support two specific proposals.  First is an increase in the top rate of the State contributory pension of &euro;5 per week and, second, to reverse the 2012 cut to the State pension. <br/><br/>We welcomed the announcement in January 2018 by the Department that those affected by the 2012 changes would be offered the option of reassessment under the total contributions approach, TCA, including a home-caring credit of up to 20 years.  At the time of announcement, it was noted that the TCA 2012 system will address anomalies from the yearly averaging scheme.  Age Action welcomes the genuine efforts made by the Minister and the Department to resolve the pension cuts imposed by the 2012 changes and the averaging system.  In particular, the new home-caring credit will have a real impact on people&rsquo;s lives and enable many more people to avail of a contributory State pension while also recognising the valuable contribution they have made to Irish society. <br/><br/>The announcement of the TCA 2012 scheme saw a commitment to target the benefit at those who had periods caring without undermining the contributory nature of the pension scheme.  However, thousands of people, both men and women, lost out because of the 2012 changes and will not benefit from the announced initiatives.</p><p>Among this group are people who worked in countries without bilateral agreements and the self-employed, who were not required to pay PRSI contributions before 1998.  Changes in 2012 saw an increase in the minimum level of contributions required for a State pension from 260 to 520.  This change meant that many people are now excluded from the contributory pension and in some cases this happened overnight.  We continue to be contacted by those affected by the 2012 changes who are angry there is no backdating of lost pensions to 2012.</p><p> Much uncertainty exists regarding implementation of the total contributions approach.  Callers to our information line frequently express confusion as to how the new system will operate and whether there is an onus on them to contact the Department.  We understand that the drafting of legislation is under way, with letters to those affected expected in the autumn and payments expected to begin early in the first quarter of 2019, to be backdated to March 2018.</p><p> We urge that the burden of proof for those applying for home caring credit is light, recognising that it may be difficult for people to obtain documentary proof going back over 30 years.  We welcome the commitment we recently received from the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, that this will be the case.</p><p> Promotion of the scheme in clear and accessible language should be a priority to alert those affected and offer a degree of security and certainty to those awaiting correspondence.  The wider implications of the total contributions approach and, in particular, back payment from March 2018 remain unclear, specifically the ramifications under the fair deal scheme.  Clarity is also needed on the reassessment inclusion of those not having the minimum 520 contributions.</p><p> Age Action believes reversal of the 2012 changes is the simplest and most straightforward way to deal with the loss of income inflicted on tens of thousands of pensioners.  However, we recognise a simple reversal of these changes would not benefit people who took time out from work to provide care at home or those affected by the remaining anomalies mentioned earlier.  Therefore, we are calling for a reversal of the 2012 changes that also includes concession of the extra 20 years of homemaker and carer contributions, along with a ten-year contribution for reasons other than these.  A reversal of the 2012 changes would also do away with the requirement to put in place a new system to assess people throughout the State at the stated 40 years of the total contributions approach.  Reversal to a pre-2012 pension calculation would negate the necessity to write to the estimated 50,000 people, await their response and process applications.</p><p> Consultation is under way on the overall total contributions approach due to be implemented in 2020.  The final look and implementation of the total contributions approach remains undecided.  There is no guarantee the final total contributions approach will be as proposed, or even introduced at all but this is how the cohort of the people in question will be treated.  Instead of assessing them using a new system that may or may not be implemented in its current proposed form, Age Action suggests it is more sensible to reverse the 2012 changes, as the D&aacute;il voted for last year, and simply restore the income of those who have lost out.</p><p> We would not like to see a new set of anomalies created under the total contributions approach.  A requirement for 40 years of contributions to get a full State pension would mean people with fewer contributions could be worse off than they are today.  For example, today somebody with 50% of the required number of average contributions gets 85% of the State pension.  Under the new system this will fall to 50% of the State pension rate.  We urge particular consideration of the situation of those due to retire in the coming years who entered the system under one set of rules and may be disproportionately disadvantaged by changes introduced just before they retire.  How the self-employed will be dealt with under the system remains unclear, as does any possibility of purchasing additional credits.</p><p> To date, Ireland has been unusual in setting the pension rate in the budget every year without using any particular formula.  We welcome the commitment in the roadmap for pension reform to benchmark the State pension to 34% of average earnings, with future increases to depend on the consumer price index or average wages.  To ensure those reliant on the State pension would not fall into poverty, the national pensions framework committed to sustaining the value of the State pension at 35% of average weekly earnings.  We recommend a roadmap to get to 35% to reach this commitment.  CSO figures for the first quarter of 2018 indicate that average weekly earnings are &euro;742.19.  This would indicate a State pension of &euro;259.77, which is substantially higher than the current rate.  Taking current figures, this would provide older people with an additional &euro;846 per year.</p><p> Indexing of current and future pension rates will facilitate proper planning.  It will provide peace of mind for older workers and, crucially, it will depoliticise the budget process.  Clarity is also needed on any implication for the non-contributory State pension arising from indexing the contributory State pension and whether any protection for the non-contributory State pension will be applied.</p><p> Departmental figures show the State pension system cost approximately &euro;7.3 billion in 2017 and payments to more than 600,000 people over the age of 66 were made every week.  Demographic changes alone will lead to an increase of approximately &euro;200 million per year in the State pension.  Even with the retirement age due to rise to 68 by 2028, there is a legitimate question on the sustainability of the State pension system.  People are living longer, healthier and more active lives.  We need to develop solutions to fund the State pension that enable people to age in dignity and to support older people who wish to continue working but who fall victim to ageism and discriminatory mandatory retirement clauses.</p><p> We welcome recent guidance on longer working lives from the WRC and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  A more flexible approach to retirement age is needed in the context of living longer and increasing pension ages.  If they could, many older workers would choose to continue to work.  As we highlighted to the committee last July, this desire and ability to continue to work for longer varies according to sector and an individual's circumstance.  We hope to see movement through the Oireachtas of both Bills on mandatory retirement.  We would like to see progress on the 2017 Bill to abolish mandatory retirement clauses and for it to move to Committee Stage.  Age Action's information line frequently receives calls from public sector workers who are due to retire but who wish to continue to work.  The delay in the progress of the Bill is leaving people in limbo and, in some cases, is forcing them to retire against their will.  A fair State pension would enable older people to age with dignity and independence, keeping them out of poverty.  We look forward to working with the committee to make this a reality.</p></speech>

I have one or two points on Mr. Duggan's presentation.  The intention, as he has reiterated, is to have this in place for payments by the first quarter of 2019.  He has told us the letters will go out towards the end of the year, and approximately 51,000 letters are to go out, and payments, including arrears, will start from March 2019.  Is Mr. Duggan confident of achieving the objective of this being in place by the first quarter of 2019?  A total of 51,000 individual cases must be looked at and processed.  I got the initial impression from the Minister that the letters would be going out much sooner, but it looks like they will not be going out until towards the end of the year.</p> <p>  Mr. Duggan said the homemakers credit will be paid up to a potential maximum of 20 years and that those on social welfare could claim other credits of ten years.  Let us assume somebody has more than 20 years between both.  Is the maximum for both 20 years or is the 20 years confined to homemakers credit?</p> <p>  Ms Joyce referred to the great deal of angst about the change from 260 contributions to 520 contributions for a basic qualification.  Are there any plans to look at this?  The statements emanating from the Department and from interviews the Minister has given indicate it is not up for discussion.  Could we find out what exactly the position is on this?</p> <p>  What has been said on auto-enrolment indicates the Department is up for discussion on consideration as to how exactly it will be implemented, by which I mean whether it will be done separately by the State or farmed out to some of the private pension providers.  I am not opting for one or the other; but note that according to friends in the UK, when the auto-enrolment system there was set up, the initial cost of establishing it and developing all of the technology was pretty horrendous and a multiple of what was anticipated.  I suspect if that is the case here - as a smaller country, proportionally the costs could be even higher - ultimately, the pensioners will be those who will pay for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Duggan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018061400002#G00100"><p>I am as confident as I can be that we will progress the initiative sufficiently this year to start making the payments in the first quarter of next year, as promised.  We have always said we would start issuing the invitations in the fourth quarter.  The reason is that we knew we had to build processes and procedures.  We had to get legislation drafted and enacted, and we had to get a complicated IT system developed.  We always knew it would take more than six months to get all the preparatory work done and, therefore, the fourth quarter was when we could start issuing letters to people.  We want the systems to be ready and we do not want any delays being once people are invited to seek a review.  Many of them will be simple and easy to process.  There will be no big issue trying to work out whether they are entitled.  It will be a simple calculation, particularly with the system I mentioned.  Consequently, once we are able to issue invitations I am confident we will get payments going for all those cases quickly.  Hence, the first quarter is realistic.</p> <p>  There will be some cases where we will have to do exploratory work.  While we are keen to ensure we do not put a heavy burden or onus of proof on anybody, we are obliged to protect the Social Insurance Fund and taxpayers' money and, therefore, we will have to do certain checks to comply with the Comptroller and Auditor General's requirements and obligations.  Aside from that, we will make this as simple as we can for people.  I am confident we will get payments going in the first quarter of next year.</p> <p>  The home caring credit of 20 years is new.  There has not been anything similar to it previously.  A disregard was introduced in 1994, but that is not a credit.  It is a disregard and it only works in a yearly averaging system.  It would not work in a system that is reliant on counting the number of contributions rather than an averaging approach.  There has always been a limit on the number of credits people could claim for pension calculation purposes.  In this case, we have set the home caring credit at the maximum limit.  A person can claim 20 years of credits in whatever way the person wishes that pertains to the person's life and the circumstances in which he or she found himself or herself, but there is a limit of 20 years.  We did not put the same limit on home caring as is on all the other credit systems.  We allowed it to be at the maximum, and the maximum has been maintained.</p> <p>  The move from 260 to 520 contributions is not new.  While it was introduced near the beginning of the decade, the reality is that it was introduced in legislation in the 1990s, not in 2012.  It has been flagged for 20 years and came from a significant volume of analyses and reports carried out over the years.  The legislation has been on the Statute Book for a long time.</p> <p>  With regard to the automatic enrolment system that was introduced in the UK, the Deputy is correct that initial costs were high.  A number of aspects in the UK are different.  First, the scale is significantly vast compared with here.  That does not mean we do not have high costs but that there is a proportionality element to it.  Second, the UK felt it had to introduce a backstop arrangement, if I can use that phrase.  My UK colleagues do not appear to like it much.  It had to introduce a contingency in the event that the market did not provide a service to low income individuals, in particular.  That has resulted in much of the significant cost the Deputy mentioned.  It will go out for consultation so we are not being definitive about any aspect of the design but we will be particularly interested to hear people's views on that matter and whether there is a necessity for a State default.  However, there are also alternatives that would not require that and thereby would not incur the type of costs the Deputy mentioned.  I am hopeful that we could steer it in that direction.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dea referred to the changes to home caring and so forth.  Specifically on the T12, I acknowledge the Department will write in the fourth quarter to the 51,000 individuals it has identified, but there will be others outside that who clearly would like to have their cases reviewed.  What process is in place for that?  Will there be a way for them to contact the Department and ask for their cases to be reviewed?  In terms of the evidence that people will have to provide, I am interested in getting clarity on that for the many women who took time out of their working lives to look after their families.  I understand the Minister corresponded with Age Action Ireland.  Could we get some specifics on what type of approach will be taken if people cannot provide evidence?  What evidence will be sought?</p> <p>  With regard to the overall total contributions approach, Mr. Duggan said no figure has been put on it.  However, it has been widely circulated that it will be up to 40 years.  It would be alarming if that was to the case but we have to hear officially what it is.  It is thought that it will be between 30 and 40 years.  The self-employed have been identified as a cause of concern and returning emigrants will be another concern.  Many people have been forced to leave these shores against their will to find employment elsewhere.  What provision will be made for them?</p> <p>  The pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and it will go up again in 2028.  There is a serious anomaly currently where people are forced to resign at 65 years due to the nature of their contracts and then must sign on for jobseeker's payment for a year until they get the State pension at 66 years old.  What thought has been given to this by the Department?  Is it expected that people will be forced to sign on for jobseeker's payment for two years when the pension age increases to 67 years?  The Department will be aware that I have introduced legislation on this but, like many other legislative measures tabled by the Opposition, it is caught in the red tape the Government has brought forward and is waiting on a money message.  As Age Action Ireland has said on numerous occasions, many people would like to remain in the workforce for a multitude of reasons.  That should be progressed.  Again, I call on the Government to issue the money message and allow that critical legislation move to Committee Stage and, if amendments are required, to allow that to happen.</p> <p>  The other concern is that the pension age will then go up to 68 years in 2028.  Contrary to what Mr. Duggan said with regard to other OECD countries, Ireland far exceeds any of its European counterparts in terms of how fast we are moving to increase the pension age and the timeframe for progressing it.  The UK, for example, is only increasing its pension age to 67 years in 2028.  At the same time, we will increase our pension age to 68 years.</p><p>Germany will not increase the pension age to 67 until 2031.  It is also frightening that, in 2035, we will review this again with the possibility of increasing it further.  I have serious concerns about this.  This was part of a deal struck with the troika with no consultation and it far exceeds the rate of change in any of our European counterparts.</p><p> I have a few questions for Age Action.  Is the organisation satisfied with the total contribution approach being put forward by Government and the continued reliance on contributions?  What pension system would Age Action like to be introduced?  Should it be a basic or a universal pension?  What are its views on auto-enrolment?  Is the increase of &euro;5 the main issue for the people it represents?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.2285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Duggan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018061400002#H00200"><p>The Deputy is correct that, other than the 51,000 to whom we will write, there are people are on reduced rate pensions who may do better under the new system but will not be captured by our mass invite.  At the same time, we will publish a great deal of information about how the system works, how it will be calculated and so on.  Lots of information will be provided publicly so that people can look for themselves.  We will issue a general invitation, with advertisements on radio, in newspapers, on social media and so on.  We will provide a briefing to public representatives, such as committee members, to make sure people are as informed as they can be that this is available and may be relevant to them, in which case they can send in a request for their pension calculation to be reviewed.  It will be nothing like those numbers but there will be some people and we will provide a means by which they can seek a review.  We will concentrate initially on the ones we know about.</p> <p>  As I said in reply to Deputy O'Dea, the evidence people have to provide will be simple and easy.  The degree of evidence they will have to provide will probably be nil.  If somebody is on our system as having received child benefit for the period in question and was not been in employment at exactly the same time, it will be an easy calculation to make and we expect that many of them will be in that category.  Other than that, it will depend on what they are claiming credit for.  If it is for childminding or caring, it means they were not in receipt of child benefit in this jurisdiction so we may seek some proof that they had it in some other jurisdiction.  That is easy enough to get from the systems in other jurisdictions and it will not be particularly onerous.</p> <p>  It is a little more difficult for people who were not looking after children but were looking after others and we have not yet teased out precisely what type of evidence we will seek in those cases.  We are more than happy to take suggestions from anybody, including the committee, on that.  We will discuss what the audit expectation is from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have not made any firm decisions on that.  That is part of the design work we are doing.</p> <p>  I can be definitive that no decision has been made on the number of years of contributions required for the TCA and we have said this on every occasion we have spoken publicly on the question.  In the consultation document we launched, one of the main questions relates to people's views on the number of years of contributions that should be required to achieve a full contributory pension.  The confusion arises from the fact that T12 is based on 40 years but that is an interim solution to deal with a very specific problem and does not necessary dictate how the full implementation of TCA will be dealt with from 2020 onwards.  It is very much an issue to be decided and we genuinely want to hear people's views.</p></speech>

There is concern because the 2020 solution provides for a 40-year pension life and Mr. Duggan is correct that this is not necessarily the same as the post-2020 total contribution scheme.  He then suggested people make recommendations but the problem with that is that we are blind when we make them.  Age Action said somebody with 20 years' payments in the new scheme would have a higher average on the current scheme than the 2040 scheme.  The problem is that we do not know the cost of any of the moves.  If we decided that total contributions should be a 30-year scheme, we have no means of determining whether that will increase the total budget by 10%, 20% or 50%.  We can objectively look at the issues as they arise but it is difficult to know what the cost of implementation might be.</p> <p>  If the Department introduced the 2012, 40-year, total contribution scheme across the board today, what would it cost?  That is the challenge for those who wish to make recommendations.  We are all concerned about the fact that 20 years is long and that somebody who has only paid in 20 out of 40 years will be on a half pension.  As a committee and as individuals trying to make recommendations, it is problematic because we do not have a calculation to base them on.</p></speech>

I do not buy the argument that somebody on 20 years of contributions will get half a pension under a TCA model.  If that is all they have in their life it will be true, but the vast majority of people on 20 years of contributions in a 50-year working lifespan probably have other elements to attract credits.  Consequently, few people will end up on a half-rate pension purely on the basis of the number of paid contributions.  It would be difficult for us to give definitive answers to examples committee members might send us because of this.  We can only base them on what we know.</p></speech>

At the same time, we are trying to see what people think about all the individual elements, which is why we have produced a comprehensive paper setting out all the issues.</p><p>We then asked a series of questions to get people's views.  We would like to try to achieve a balance.  The Deputy is suggesting that a requirement for 40 years of contributions for a full pension is too long.  I do not buy into the sense of alarm because that must be balanced by the fact that people are living much longer than in the past and the likelihood that an extensive and reasonable system of credits will be provided that will also be available for a range of contingencies.  When these factors are combined the 40 years of total contributions is not as long as it may seem.  It should not be viewed in stark terms but in the round.  Rather than taking the figure of 40 years and saying it is horrendous, we must look at what else is part of the package.  The introduction of the new home caring credit, which is unlimited in the sense that it has no start date and is for a full 20 years, is a significant development.  This option did not exist previously and makes a great difference to the calculation of the 40 years.  A range of credits is also available to people, depending on their contingency, that will also significantly mitigate the 40 years' requirement.  Notwithstanding that, no decision has been made on whether the period will be 40, 30, 32 or 35 years, for that matter.  </p></speech>

Furthermore, no decisions have been made on how people in self-employment will be treated under the total contributions approach, TCA, model.  We are acutely aware that self-employed people only came into the system in 1988 and, consequently, the maximum number of years of contributions they would have if they were to retire in 2020 under the new TCA approach would be 32.  If the model was 40 years, they would end up with a 80% pension but if it was a 30-year model, there would be no problem.  It depends on the final model.  In addition, if the final decision is that the years required will be in excess of what the self-employed could attain in the period available since 1988, we will have to introduce some transitionary measures to deal with the issue.  The consultation paper asks respondents what these measures should be or what shape they should take.  We genuinely want to hear what people have to say on this, not only public representatives but also self-employed persons and those who represent them.</p> <p>  It is not the case that we are on our own regarding the increase in the pension age.  The difficulty with making comparisons across Europe is that it is almost impossible because Ireland is one of the only countries that sets a definitive retirement age at a definitive full year age.  It is 66 years now and will be 67 in 2021.  A large number of countries have adopted crazy pension ages, for example, 66 years and five months, and use complicated formulas for determining what the pension age will be in future.  At least ten of the existing EU member states use formulas based on life expectancy to determine what the pension age will be in future.  As a consequence, it is impossible to do a direct comparison with Ireland.  I will give a few examples.  The pension age in the Netherlands is now 65 years and nine months and the age is increasing by three or four months each year.  Next year, it will be 66 years and one month and the following year it will be 66 years and five months and so on.  It is expected to reach 67 years by the end of 2021 or beginning of 2022 and it will continue to increase based on life expectancy.  There is no doubt that, under the Dutch model, the pension age in the Netherlands will exceed 68 years by 2028.  Numerous other countries have similar types of systems.  In Greece, the pension age is now 67 and the country has introduced a life expectancy element that will increase the pension age by a number of months each year.  It will have increased considerably by 2028.  The pension age in Italy will reach 67 years in the near future and it has also introduced a life expectancy calculation that will increase the pension age by several months each year.  We believe the pension age in many countries will exceed 68 years before Ireland reaches a pension age of 68 years.  </p></speech>

In Austria, for instance, the pension age is 65 years for men and 60 years for women and will move to 65 years for both by 2033.  I have already given the example of Germany, where the pension age is moving to 67 years for men and women in 2031.  There is no complicated methodology or procedure in those cases and no link to life expectancy.  We are moving further and faster than any of our European counterparts.</p></speech>

Many European countries are doing exactly the same as we are but they are doing it in a more complicated way.  It is a pretence that Ireland will be alone in reaching a pension age of 68 years by 2028.  That message is misleading and I would not like it to go out.</p> <p>  On the mandatory retirement age, we have always said that there was no such thing in Ireland.  If people retire from an occupation at 65 years, that is a matter of the contract between them and their employer.  There is no statutory retirement age and there never has been.  The reform plan sets out a number of measures to extract people from what has become a societal norm.  European law does not necessarily support this norm and objective justification is now needed for setting retirement ages in employment contracts.  Employers must consider very carefully how they will deal with the law in this area, which changed in 2015. </p> <p>  As my colleagues noted, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, has issued guidance for employers on that particular area and the European Human Rights Commission, EHRC, has issued guidance on fixed-term contracts.  We hope the combination of European law, the WRC guidance and the EHRC guidance and the consultative forums undertaken by IBEC will result in employers grasping this issue.  If they do not do so - and the roadmap sets this out - towards the end of this year or at the beginning of next year, we will start a process of assessing other measures that could be introduced.  These may include some of the measures to which the Deputy referred.  However, we want to give employers the opportunity to get to grips with the issue.</p></speech>

The evidence is available.  The relevant legislation received cross-party support to facilitate its progress.  We are now caught with red tape.  All the evidence is available and people want to stay in work.  They are being forced to sign on for a jobseeker's payment for a full year because they cannot get their State pension at 65 years. </p></speech>

We would welcome more efforts and work being done to have a greater discussion and quicker movement on the issue because it is creating significant uncertainty in people's lives.  As I mentioned, some people will choose to work longer and some may not, while others will have to work longer.</p> <p>  We receive many calls about jobseeker's allowance.  Psychologically, it can be difficult to have to retire from work and then go on the dole.  People receive a reduced rate for a period of time which they find particularly difficult, given the rising cost of living.  </p> <p>  The most recent OECD work on pensions recommends looking at flexible contracts and retirement dates.  Flexible retirements dates have not worked, for example, in Germany.  A combination of a flexible retirement date and allowing access to a proportion of a pension payment seemed to be a greater incentive and resulted in a higher take-up.  Throughout the OECD area 50% of people aged over 65 years engage in part-time work.  Some further work could be done on that issue.</p> <p>  On the specific question of whether we are satisfied with the TCA or the universal pension, my colleague will comment on that issue, but the options are worth exploring.  Anything which would give greater certainty to older people coming up to and in retirement would be positive.  There are options which are worth exploring.  We would have more of a focus on something which would provide a greater rate and more security.   Mr. Scully will talk about that issue.</p> <p>  On auto enrolment, we welcome anything which will lead to greater security in retirement and older age.  There are a few questions we and others have about the implementation of such a scheme, including fund administration and the privatisation of risk, a matter the committee has previously discussed.  The UK example was discussed.  I understand early on the scheme was found to be affecting women disproportionately because of the rate and age at which it was set.  A slight tweaking and modification of the scheme took place in the United Kingdom.  We should be mindful of the lessons learned in other countries. </p> <p>  On whether the amount of &euro;5 is our main concern, there is a &euro;16 gap with the State pension.  Indexing it at 35% of average earnings was a commitment given in the national pensions framework.  Our concerns also relate to secondary income support because that is where people are finding that day-to-day living has been affected.  We welcome the changes to the fuel and telephone allowances, but there is a need for progress and a restoration of these allowances.</p></speech>

The move from averaging is long overdue.  Averaging was iniquitous and penalised almost everybody.  People were affected by the changes made in 2012.  The total contributions approach is what should be used in the future.  I accept that the 40-year period is up for discussion.</p></speech>

I will be absolutely clear.  The Government considered our report which has been published on the website for anyone who wants to look at it.  It states that if the final design of the TCA is more favourable than the 2012 interim model for those pensioners who opted in to it, they will be allowed to transfer to the final scheme in 2020.  They will be not be disadvantaged at all.</p></speech>

There were two main issues dealt with in our report which featured in the debate on the changes made in 2012.  I remember debating this matter in 2012 in my former capacity as a member of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  There was the historical injustice represented by the averaging system and the injury added to it by the changes in bands and contributory requirements.  To be clear, the proposals which have been brought forward under the TCA12 scheme address one of those issues, but they fail to address and possibly compound the other.  Everybody was happy to see the issue of averaging being addressed.  I was was very happy when the Minister made commitments on care credits because it was something for which I had advocated for years.  It is an important recognition of the contribution made by carers.  I have a number of specific questions about the care credits before I come to another issue, namely, the changes in bands and contributory requirements.</p></speech>

Will those who may, for example, have accumulated five years of care credits be able to use them to access back-to-educaiton schemes which may have onerous requirements to be met?  If one did not work in the two year period prior to becoming a carer, one will not have contributions towards a pension.  Will the contributions count and will they be separate from the tenure periods mentioned such as the times in receipt of jobseeker's allowance rather than the time spent providing care?</p> <p>  There is very real concern that a large number of those in receipt of care credits may not always have been providing caring, but they will be affected by the scheme because we know that many were affected by measures such as the marriage bar and the culture surrounding it.  They may have left a job on marriage, but it would not be classed as providing caring.  In that regard, has consideration been given to how we can ensure those years will be captured, as they are in the case of the homemaker's disregard, perhaps by considering things such as the qualified adult payment?  Will those who were relevant persons in the case of the qualified adult payment be considered?</p></speech>

There are also a number of other issues being considered.  We hope to do what the Senator suggests.  We have to consider the matter very carefully because wrinkles are caused in other areas.  We have to be sure that when we address the issue, we wil not create yet another anomaly which will have to be dealt with by some other measure.  The issue is being looked at favourably.  We do not intend to use the payment in the case of re-entry credits.</p> <p>  The final question on the marriage bar confuses me considerably.  The marriage bar primarily affected people working in the public service and with some larger employers.  Persons who were in such employment would never have received a State pension had they remained in that employment.  I am always confused when the marriage bar is raised as a significant issue in the context of the State pension.  My mother-in-law was such an individual.  She might have received an occupational Civil Service pension, but she would never have received the State pension.  I fail to see how it is relevant in the calculation of the State pension.</p></speech>

While I recognise Mr. Duggan may not see it as such, politically, even the Minister and others have recognised it as being relevant.</p><p>The key point is that there were a number of people who were accessing the homemaker's disregard because of a culture which prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s which made it difficult for married persons to work.  Effectively, they were homemakers.  In the transition to care credits which is positive overall I want to ensure those who were contributing through a homemaking role during that period will not be disadvantaged because, for example, they may not have had children in the home.  There will be a small cohort for whom this is important.  Perhaps I might follow up with others with whom we have worked on the issue, or perhaps we might follow up on it because I have a number of other issues to get through.  </p><p> The issue of re-entry credits is one to which we need to return.  If someone has spent five years caring and wants to go back into the workplace, he or she may end up with a very onerous number of contributions to make up.  It is important that people are facilitated in re-entering the workplace.  I am surprised that the issue has not been considered and that it was dismissed by the delegates outright.  Perhaps it is issue to which we might come back.</p></speech>

I credit the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, for introducing the care credit.  I believe she has embraced and recognised the contribution those provide care make.  However, the other thing that happened in 2012 was that the bar moved.  I will come to the issue of signalling the move.  The number of contributions moved from 260 to 520 and a large number of people found themselves falling down the bands to reduced rate pensions, particularly, as it happened, women.  The change had a huge impact and created a lot of the concern in 2012, yet the solution makes the same mistake.  Where previously there was a move from 260 to 520 contributions, people are now required to have 1,040 credits and contributions alongside the 20-year requirement, presuming that they will the maximum of 20-year care credit, which will be difficult.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Duggan's clarification, but here is my point.  There is still a 20-year requirement.  There is an issue with the recognition of care.  Effectively, it still functions as a disregard.  It is not a situation where care provision is fully recognised.  For example, somebody who has worked for 20 years will not access the same pension as somebody who has worked for ten years and provided cared for ten.  In the long term it is good that the care credit is being recognised as an element.  However, persons who have provided cared for ten years are not going to benefit from it as an active care credit in the calculation of pension.  Their position has not been made better by much.  Those who happen to have 20 years of contributions will be fine, but there will be those who will be on a reduced rate.</p></speech>

I have been clear that the care credit is an improvement.  What I am pointing out is that there is a danger in moving the goalposts.  The 40-year threshold is a concern because there is a wider frame.  There is a moving of the goalposts in moving to a 40-year period instead of 20.  That is a concern and it will mean that potentially not as many will benefit.</p></speech>

We will move on to the 40-year requirement.  Mr. Duggan indicated that there had been a signalling for 20 years, from the 1990s until 2012, in advance of the change in the threshold from 260 to 520 contributions.  My concern is that potentially we are talking about a two-year period of signalling if we bring forward the total contribution approach in 2020, whereby the requirement will be doubled from 20 years to 40.  I know that Mr. Duggan has said no decision has been made, but he is seeking an opinion.  As such, I think doubling the requirement with a two-year lead-in period is completely unfeasible, unacceptable and dangerous.</p></speech>

In 2010 the national pensions framework proposed a total contributions approach in the calculation of the State contributory pension.  It set out a 30-year model.  However, it only set out a requirement to have ten years of credits.  Also they were only allowed from 1994 onwards.  As such, there have been at least ten years of notification during the 20 year period about which the Senator is talking.</p></speech>

Care provision is being added to the mix, but when it is added, the requirement goes up.  We are not saying we are going to add it and give it equal status.  If we were to be consistent, we would be looking at a 30-year requirement in line with the original vision for the total contribution approach.  We would then accept 20 years of care credits as part of the 30-year requirement.  That would represent care provision being given equal value as working contributions.  Mr. Duggan is saying that because we are taking care into consideration, we have to expand the threshold and move the goalposts by an additional period of ten years.  That does not give adequate recognition to care provision, which is why I am saying the requirement should be 30 years.  These are opinions.  As Mr. Duggan says, nothing has been decided, but I am putting forward this point.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the 2010 document, which was based on a 30 year cycle.  We changed to a 40 year cycle only because of addressing the 2012 anomaly.  It is worth acknowledging that up to the 2012 issue being addressed, the total contribution had always been considered over the 30 year cycle or that was the main proposal.  </p><p> On the issue of care, and caring, we can as a committee agree to differ.  The old system would have allowed one third of the total time to be accounted for caring, under the new system the main proposal is for half.  As individuals on the committee, we can make our recommendations on the proposals based on that.</p><p> Has the Senator other questions?    </p></speech>

The sustainability of society as recognised in our Constitution, depends on home life and care which is part of the common good.  The question of sustainability is not simply an economic exercise, it is more substantial.</p> <p>  We need to look at the intergenerational question to a wider degree.  There is a wider section of intergenerational relationships, for example those who will reach pension age at different stages will by the time they reach pension age, have contributed to the education, free third level education, jobseeker supports and other social welfare supports as is only right.  It is not a simple one way chart of payment </p></speech>

Those who have insecure employment, returning emigrants and immigrants have gaps in contributions and the lead-in to the change of adding ten years will really affect anybody between the ages of 40 and 50 years.  In that regard, I will ask all my questions now.</p><p>What are the changes in respect of voluntary contributions?  The threshold for making voluntary contributions was raised from an income of &euro;260 per week to &euro;520 per week.  If we were to see a change in the requirement, we would need to be absolutely assured that people could make voluntary contributions.  I would be concerned if we saw a raising of the threshold.  Can we be reassured that the threshold for making voluntary contributions will not be raised if people potentially are to be meeting new targets?</p><p>A question was asked previously on the indexing of the non-contributory pension.  I welcome the indexing of the contributory pension, I would like an indication of the intentions in respect of the non-contributory pension in the future.  Is it planned to index the non-contributory pension, perhaps at a slightly lower rate, so that there would be some level of a similar guarantee and predictability in respect of the non-contributory pension?  </p><p>On the supplementary system scheme, how is it proposed to recognise care in the scheme?  In terms of contingency funding and the backstop, if the market did not provide in the United Kingdom, I do not believe that we can expect that the market will provide in Ireland, given that market pensions have lost 30% of their value in one year in very recent memory.  I think we can anticipate that we will need a backstop.  Given that the supplementary pension system is coming through, is the Department in active engagement on the issue of marginal rate tax relief at present, which we know ties into cost?  As mentioned, the troika recommended that we make changes.  </p><p><b>Chairman:</b>Senator.</p></speech>

There is no change in that respect, but I cannot give commitments in respect of thresholds.  That is obviously a Government policy matter and will probably be dealt with in a budgetary context.

Usually supplementary second pillar pensions are concerned with consumption smoothing, so avoiding reductions in living standards at retirement.  That is generally an income-based measure to prevent those reductions.  If that is the target membership, one is then in the space of the level of pre-retirement earnings of the individual.  For example  if the State pension is &euro;12,500 or &euro;13,000 per annum is it legitimate to enrol somebody in a pension who is earning less than that when they will get a higher replacement rate from the State pension than they would from their earnings?  It is then balancing the question of the cost of those contributions to the individual with a limited discretionary income in terms of short-term demands as against long-term gain.  The question is where is the balance to be struck in that case. </p> <p>  I think in the reform plan, a figure of &euro;20,000 was given as an indicator because we know definitively at that level of income that individuals will suffer a material reduction in living standards when they retire even with the State pension, so they should be enrolled.  The space below that begins to be more challenging for the reasons I have mentioned but also because, typically speaking, it would proportionately affect certain groups more, for example, women, because they work part time - and as the ESRI has highlighted a greater number of women are on the minimum wage as are people from the ethnic minorities and people with disabilities.  We need to look at those issues and again no decisions have been made, but it is a fundamental for auto-enrolment.</p> <p>  On the questions of fund administration, privatising risk and so on, traditionally in pensions policy there is the multi-pillar system, where the State, through the social insurance system guarantees a minimum level of income and poverty avoidance in terms of the State pension and then adequacy is around what the individual needs in order to maintain his or her living standards.  Again that is an earnings-related indicator.  The framework as to how that is to be managed in terms of an auto-enrolment system is yet to be decided.  There are major questions around a public service obligation on the State structure, as in the United Kingdom or does one move towards a structure where there is State involvement but a regulation of the number of providers or does one just roll out the existing retail structure.  The key question Ireland has to answer relates to population because we have a far smaller population than the UK in terms of generating economies of scale.  In the United Kingdom, there is the National Employment Savings Trust, NEST, which Deputy O'Dea referred to earlier and it has 7 million members.  We estimate the population in Ireland for such a scheme would be between 500,000 and 800,000, but we absolutely believe they need to go into a small number of large, efficient pension schemes.  What that small number is has to be defined - is it one, two, five, ten?  We do not believe that the existing infrastructure is fit for purpose.  We believe it is very difficult to provide services to lower income earners at a cost that makes it economical to do so, unless one generates scale and the impact then is on the member outcomes because they pay more for the service.  We know scale creates the capacity to deliver services to these individuals.</p><p>If it is to be an earnings related system where an individual in investing to work their income to generate retirement income, there will be an element of risk.  That is about getting the default options right.  We know that in the UK, 90% of people are defaulted into a choice quality assured investment package and that 90% of them stay in it.  The design of that package and how it should be structured is crucial.  However, again, that has not been looked at in detail yet.</p><p> Tax relief is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the annual budgetary process.  We talked to over 50 sectorial interest groups representing all strands on auto-enrolment.  There have been two broad arguments.  First, it is argued tax relief, as it stands, is more beneficial to higher earners which is unfair.  Second, it is claimed that the first argument does not consider the amount higher earners contribute to the social insurance system, which is then redistributed to provide State pensions to lower earners.  It also does not recognise the proportionately greater level of tax that higher earners pay and tax in drawdown.  I am not taking a position on these but those are the two ends of the spectrum from our discussions.</p><p> From an auto-enrolment point of view as a policymaker, the question that has to be answered is what the policy objective is.  In this case, our policy objective is to enrol middle and lower income earners into a product which will generate a reasonable retirement income.  Is the financial incentive, as it is structured, suitable to ensure those people stay in the system and save?  That is a question for which I do not have an answer.  One must look at the potential behavioural impact of change.  We need to recognise that people of modest income levels, &euro;32,800 and above, are receiving marginal rates of tax relief on those pension contributions.  Effectively, a change to that system would be a pay reduction for those individuals and may result in the opposite behaviour we want.  It may encourage them to opt out of pension saving rather than opt in.  It is absolutely not an easy question to answer.  It is fundamental to the success of auto-enrolment and a key one for our consultation process, as well as for the review the Department of Finance is undertaking.</p></speech>

It is currently linked at the top rate of 95%.  We would like to see a categorical and stated link between both contributory and non-contributory pensions.  It gives clarity to people and a little bit of security.</p> <p>  Another point which has come up in discussions is that the proposal is linked to the CPI, consumer price index, increase and then average wages.  What will be the impact if that decreases?  What will be the knock-on effect for the non-contributory State pension as well?  We are talking about a minimum protection for both, particularly for the non-contributory pension.</p> <p>  Is there any room for discussion for the 520 contributions threshold?  We get calls on that quite frequently.  People are unsure if they will be included in the TCA 2012 and we would welcome clarity on that.  Regardless of whether 30 years or 40 years is decided in the consultation process, we would like to flag that a clear transitional timeline needs to be put into effect to allow people to acquire voluntary contributions and to make appropriate plans for the future as well.  We are looking within two years for that to come into effect.</p> <p>  On auto-enrolment, &euro;20,000 was mentioned as a base figure for opting into the system.  For those who may be underneath that income threshold but may wish to avail of auto-enrolment, will it be possible for them or can they expect a State contribution for that?  We would welcome more clarity on this.</p> <p>  We have talked about risk management and the State&rsquo;s role in regulating this area.  The more certainty and regulation that people can have for these schemes, the better.</p></speech>

It was stated some measure may need to be looked at around facilitating part-time workers.

We would never try to index link on the basis of a quarterly return.  That would be dangerous because one could end up in a situation where earnings come down.  Any index linking system we devise must have a period of time in it, as well as number of elements and smoothing effects.  Accordingly, it is not as simple as taking one quarter of earnings and comparing it to the State pension.  It will be significantly more sophisticated than that.  That is why it requires a degree of study and so forth.</p> <p>  Eligibility for SPC is set at 520 contributions.  That has been the case since legislation was introduced in 1997.  There is no change to that, even with this interim measure to deal with the 2012 rate line changes.  There is no proposal to do that either.  It has to be remembered that there was a period of 20 years when those numbers of contributions changed upwards over time.  That was to reflect the fact that more people were in the system for much longer and that the number availing of it was increasing apace.  That is fairly typical across the spectrum of EU countries.</p> <p>  Auto-enrolment for those earning under &euro;20,000 is being actively looked at.  We set out in the reform plan, by way of example, that &euro;20,000 could be the floor.  If something like that were to emerge, then those who earn less than that would be allowed to opt into the system.  Accordingly, it would be the opposite of those over &euro;20,000 who can only opt out.  No decision has been made as Mr. Nicholson said.  It is under active consideration.  When the straw-man document is published, we will be seeking the definitive views of people on how we should deal with earnings of less than &euro;20,000.  We are conscious of how someone earning under &euro;20,000 can afford to put some of their income towards a long-term savings package.  At the same time, why should such people be denied an opportunity to get the employer contribution and the State incentives that will accrue from that as well?  Accordingly, we want to make this as available to people on their own terms as we possibly can.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that a system like automatic enrolment where people will be compelled legislatively to enrol - they will be able to opt out - will require significant regulation, regardless of the model which ends up being chosen to provide for it.  There will undoubtedly have to be a significant regulatory vehicle underpinning it.  That is also one of the measures which will be part of the design of the system as we take it forward.  One of the elements of that will be reflected in the straw-man document when we publish it.</p></speech>
