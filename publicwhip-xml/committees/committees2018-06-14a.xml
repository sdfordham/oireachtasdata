    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018061400002#C00200"><p>We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy.</p> <p>  We have restructured today&rsquo;s engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland on the National Treatment Purchase Fund to deal with a matter arising out of correspondence following our meeting with the Health Service Executive and the State Claims Agency.  We have asked representatives from the HSE and the State Claims Agency back to explain an apparent conflict in evidence and we will deal with this matter first.  Following that, we will have a short engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland to inform our examination of the National Treatment Purchase Fund financial statements in the afternoon.  We will take other business of the committee separately at an appropriate time during the meeting.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is matters relating to CervicalCheck and evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have invited representatives from the HSE and the State Claims Agency to provide clarification in respect of a contradiction in evidence given by the two bodies to the committee at our meeting of 17 May.  As Chairman of the committee, and I know I speak for all of the members, I have to say that if information given to us is inaccurate or misleading, we regard it as a most serious matter.  Witnesses do not give evidence just to the eight or ten people in the room but to the national Parliament on the public record while representing a State organisation.  It is even more serious in this case as it relates to one of the most significant health issues we have experienced in many years.  If we suspect that any witness has failed to provide accurate information to us, we will engage with him or her again until we are satisfied that we have obtained clear and correct information.</p> <p>  We are joined today from the HSE by Mr. John Connaghan, director general, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, national director of strategic transformation and planning, Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck, Mr. Paul Connors, national director of communications, and Mr. Damien McCallion, national director of the national screening service.  We are joined from the State Claims Agency by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director, Mr. Pat Kirwan, executive head of business development, Ms. Jenny Foley, solicitor and clinical claims manager, and Dr. Cathal O&rsquo;Keeffe, head of clinical risk.  We also have Ms Celeste O'Callaghan and Ms Mary Jackson from the Department of Health.  We did ask the State Claims Agency for its legal representatives to be present but we received correspondence - No. 1376 - from Mr. Breen explaining why they are not here today.  He might elaborate on this during the course of the meeting.  I understand Mr. Breen is fully informed and in a position to answer all questions that would have been directed to the agency's legal representatives in any event.</p> <p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be completely switched off or placed on aeroplane mode.</p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p> <p>  The committee was given clear views at the previous meeting but the matter of clarification has been mentioned.  If something on the record is not correct, we want the record corrected.  Clarification, expansion, further explanations and more information are not the issue.  If information on the public record is not exactly right, the record must be corrected.  If inaccurate information has been placed on the record, the committee will require an apology because this is the record of the national Parliament.  Talking around the issue or expanding on it will not deal with the inaccurate information on the public record.  I make this point clearly because witnesses often believe that if they expand on statements made at a previous meeting, it will explain the context.  However, if the record is not correct, it must be corrected and appropriate action must be taken by the relevant witnesses.</p> <p>  I will set out what happened regarding our previous meeting with representatives of the Health Service Executive.  The committee received a letter from the State Claims Agency after the meeting stating Mr. Gleeson's assertion did not accord with the facts.</p></speech>

What is really troubling before we even start, and I say this to all public bodies, is that when the witnesses left the room they may have been in doubt about whether what was said was accurate.  The HSE should have reverted to us with a statement setting out the exact position and clearing up any confusion that arose.</p><p>Representatives of the HSE would not even be here today if the State Claims Agency had not written to us.  If it had not written to us, we would not know we had not been given fair evidence with full candour.  If representatives of public bodies ever leave the committee room, go back to their offices and think that perhaps they did not explain a particular point, they should write to us and correct the record straight away rather than leaving us to pick it up from a third party.  I think the witnesses understand that general principle.  I say it to all representatives of public bodies who appear before the Committee of Pubic Accounts.  </p><p> At the meeting of 17 May, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked questions about who in the HSE, CervicalCheck and the State Claims Agency attended various meetings or spoke with people.  People watching proceedings will not remember that particular exchange.  We will ask the communications unit to play an extract of the meeting on screen so people will remember the precise issue we are talking about.  </p></speech>

The witnesses will understand that we left the room with a clear impression.  We want the record corrected with regard to this matter.  The public expects that when senior Department officials and officials from State agencies attend here there is a level of truthfulness and candour.  We are entitled to believe it.  We accept all the evidence we get in good faith.  It is a source of major concern to us when we are alerted by somebody else that the evidence given may not have been accurate.  That is why we have a duty, not only in this case but in cases involving all witnesses who come in here from week to week, to make sure evidence is accurate.  If it is not accurate, witnesses should come back to us as quickly as possible and correct the record.  That did not happen in this case.  That is why we are here today.  It adds to an issue involving delayed information and women not being informed when the national Parliament is not adequately informed.  It gives a very bad impression of how the HSE is dealing with the issue.  It is Mr. Connaghan's responsibility to take that forward.</p> <p>  At this stage, Mr. Connaghan wants to make a short statement, followed by Mr. Gleeson.  Deputy O'Brien will then be the first speaker for ten minutes.  We are doing ten-minute slots.  </p></speech>

Would that be okay?  It would save about ten minutes.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the committee today.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Damien McCallion, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, Mr. John Gleeson and Mr. Paul Connors.  I will begin by setting out some points regarding the issues of concern about the evidence given by the HSE to the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts held on 17 May and further concerns raised by the committee at its meeting of 31 May.  I reassure members of the committee that as director general I fully understand the obligation placed on me to provide any information requested, to act with integrity and to be accountable, open, honest and transparent in evidence provided to this or another committee of the Oireachtas.  My colleagues are also aware of these obligations and have and will fully comply with them.</p> <p>  Before I address the specific issue of the evidence given to the committee regarding the conference call with the State Claims Agency, I will briefly update the committee on the interim report on recommendations issued by Dr. Scally last Tuesday and to bring it up to speed on the actions we have taken since the last meeting of the committee, bearing in mind that members of this committee have previously raised issues on communication, transparency, management and governance.</p><p>On Dr. Scally&rsquo;s interim report, we welcome the report and the recommendations.  In the interests of transparency, it would be my intention to not only publish any recommendations on the HSE website but to also publish our progress tracker against each of the recommendations in the final report such that the public can observe and measure progress.<br/><br/>Since the commencement of the scoping exercise, the HSE has prioritised the provision of all relevant documents to Dr Scally in a manner that is both useful and timely.  As previously advised to the committee, we have a special team in place to do this work in a manner that is both useful and timely.  This remains an ongoing process.  The HSE had a productive engagement with Dr Scally and his team yesterday morning, Wednesday, 13 June, with regard to how required documentation has been provided up to this point and how the HSE can guarantee the future management of documents to the satisfaction of Dr Scally.  The HSE has provided to Dr Scally as many of the documents as possible that have been requested by him within the timescale required.  Documents pertaining to contracting of the laboratory services have been prepared for release but in some instances require legal clearance and in others the consent of other parties prior to their release.  This was discussed with Dr. Scally at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.  We have been working intensively with our legal teams to release the laboratory contracts without compromising the terms of those contracts.  We have made a breakthrough in the past number of hours on this matter.  Consequently, we hope to be in a position to release the contracts to Dr. Scally shortly.  <br/><br/>The HSE has provided the vast majority of documents to Dr. Scally&rsquo;s team in electronic format.  Due to certain technical issues, relating to software limitations in some locations, it has not been possible to provide some documents in a searchable format.  However, a methodology is being agreed with Dr. Scally to overcome this problem in the future, which is designed to further enhance and sharpen the focus of the document searches.  This involves more specific technological interventions.As director general of the HSE, I reiterate my intention to continue to fully co-operate with Dr. Scally in the most productive manner possible to ensure that he is properly assisted in his work.<br/><br/>Turning now to the actions we have taken thus far, we have strengthened the overall management of the programme with a national director, Mr. McCallion, reporting to me as director general.  Mr. McCallion&rsquo;s role is broad in scope and will not only cover the existing task of informing and supporting the women involved but will extend after the Scally review reports to ensure all recommendations are implemented fully.  We have engaged external support as part of a records support team to ensure we fulfil the requirement to meet both legal requests and access requests for clinical records.  I ask the committee to note that in the absence of a fully computerised electronic healthcare record, this entails a manual search for records dating back, in some cases, years and potentially over a number of sites.  We are committed to meeting the standard of 30 days on access requests. <br/><br/>The committee previously voiced concern on risk management and oversight in screening.  We are in the process of establishing a risk committee, which will be chaired independently by someone from outside the screening programme, enhanced with the appointment of a chief risk officer to support the work of that committee.  The CervicalCheck programme has a quality assurance committee, which has an independent chair.  <br/><br/>Since the establishment of the helpline, we have taken more than 24,000 calls with the vast majority of these now returned.  Four support centres have been established, with 50 staff engaged to provide that support at various stages.  I ask the committee to be aware that we continue to receive calls on a daily basis, although these are reducing significantly in number.  With regard to practical support for the 209 women, each of these has an individual named person who is based in each community healthcare organisation.  For those who want to access that support, it has so far covered the provision of medical cards, home support, physiotherapy, counselling, etc.  Our job is to provide immediate support to the women affected and to ensure that is delivered with empathy and consideration. <br/><br/>We are supporting the international review panel, which is being commissioned by the Department of Health.  We have provided matching data from the national cancer registry.  We are transitioning from the CervicalCheck audit process to the audit process being developed by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  This will require a significant team to be put in place within the HSE to support this process.  We understand the Department is concluding the contract for this work and the scope of work will include all women who were part of the CervicalCheck audit and those registered with the national cancer registry. <br/><br/>Turning to the substance of today&rsquo;s meeting, at a meeting of the committee on 10 May 2018, the State Claims Agency, SCA, confirmed that it was told by CervicalCheck that all the women had been communicated with<i>.  </i>The SCA, by letter dated 22 May 2018 to the committee, confirmed the basis for this initial evidence to be a teleconference held on 20 April 2018 in which the SCA legal team of four was provided with information by Mr. John Gleeson of CervicalCheck.  This information, as<i></i>carefully noted<i></i>by the SCA legal team, was &quot;that all women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed that they had been informed by their treating clinicians&quot;<i>.  </i>The committee will be aware from my letter of 30 May that I had asked the SCA and CervicalCheck to discuss why there were two apparently contradictory statements.  My letter of 30 May accepted that the advice on the teleconference of 20 April that, &quot;All women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed that they had been informed by their treating clinicians&quot;, is correct and accepted by the SCA and CervicalCheck.  In particular, Mr. Gleeson has advised me he does not dispute the note as recorded by the SCA on the legal file as it reflects his understanding of the position regarding communication with the women at that point in time - 20 April.  With the Chairman's agreement, I will ask John Gleeson to make a short statement. </p></speech>

There was no reference to a particular meeting or exchange.  As the transcript illustrates, Mr. Connors replied to the Deputy first before, as he can explain, under the impression that the person was not in the room.  I, therefore, replied, "No" - first, because I thought there must have been another meeting between the HSE and the SCA at which I was not present and, second, because I would not have made such an unqualified statement.  In subsequent explanation and questioning by Deputy O&rsquo;Brien when he said that the person was a CervicalCheck person, I felt that he must in fact be referring to me.  The recent exchanges I had had with the SCA, including telephone calls and teleconferences, concerned a specific court case.  I did not recall the specifics of every question and answer during those exchanges but I sought to clarify on two occasions during the PAC meeting what would have been the substance of what I could have said.  As the transcript shows, what I tried to say later was that I did not think anyone from CervicalCheck could have said that because it would never have been our understanding.  Communications would have issued to the treating clinicians in respect of all women with cytology reviews and we would have believed that the clinician would have communicated with the women as appropriate.</p> <p>  In the letter provided to the PAC subsequent to that on 22 May, which I had sight of after that, the statement "All women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed they had been informed by their treating clinicians" and reference to a legal note is, I believe, consistent with what I have said, with what I intended and with the understanding shared with the SCA of what was meant in our exchanges.  I certainly did not intend to cause any confusion or lack of clarity or directness.  If that was the case, I apologise for it.</p></speech>

The meeting that has been referred to earlier, to which Mr. Breen and Mr. Connors refer, took place in March 2017.  I was at it, as were a colleague of mine and a colleague of Mr. Breen's.

That was the narrative put forward at this committee.  That was the understanding of all members when we left.</p></speech>

The witness, on 20 April, said that he told the State Claims Agency that all women had been informed or it was his assumption that all women had been informed.  However, he knew on 20 April that was not the case because he gave evidence to this committee stating that he became aware that it was not the case when the Vicky Phelan case became public knowledge.  That is what Mr. Gleeson said.  Therefore, when he had the conversation with the State Claims Agency he knew that all women had not been informed.

It is on file - I am sure the letters are here in front of me - that the HSE highlighted that the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 had not yet commenced and this was proving an obstacle to open disclosure.  The witness had to know that the section on open disclosure has still not been commenced.  The HSE put it in writing that the failure to commence Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 relating to open disclosure was an obstacle to open disclosure.  Mr. Gleeson and all senior figures in the HSE must have known that open disclosure was not fully operational because the legislation to back it up and give people protection had not yet commenced at that point.  It still has not commenced.  That correspondence was sent months ago, in January or February this year, which means Mr. Gleeson must have known there was an issue with open disclosure.  Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was designed to facilitate open disclosure.  The HSE knew Part 4 had not been implemented, yet Mr. Gleeson is hanging onto the view that open disclosure was occurring.  What was the purpose of the legislation if Mr. Gleeson believes there was 100% open disclosure?  He could not have believed that.  While I accept that he was acting in good faith in making the assumption that the women affected had been informed, it was not a valid assumption to make based on the state of his knowledge of the issue of open disclosure.  Does the witness accept that?  I am trying to understand his assumption.  I find it hard to believe that he validly arrived at that assumption.</p></speech>

This is an historical issue, and there are many historical cases.  We were aware that some women had sadly passed away and that some letters - it is a continuous process - might have gone out yesterday and appointments were being set up to talk to the women.  I was not aware of the full extent of difficulties being expressed with the open disclosure policy, alluded to by the Chair.  I am sure they came to me in time, but at the time I was not aware at that time that Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was about to be enacted to remove one of the barriers to open disclosure.  I am sure I would have learned that.</p></speech>

We find ourselves arguing about words and whether a fair assumption was made.  There are women listening to this discussion which calls to mind the argument as to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  It is not helpful to the women involved, the HSE or public confidence in the HSE's approach to this matter when there may some obfuscation involved in dealing with a particular issue.  I do not believe the assumption made at the time was valid.  Had the witness said that an hour ago it would have been helpful.  I hope Mr. Connaghan, as the new director general, observes what is going on here and understands the public concern about how the HSE is handling this issue.</p></speech>

If there is something that a witness has provided in evidence which is unclear to the committee or where the witness subsequently realises that he or she has been talking at cross-purposes with a meeting that happened a year before, it is good practice that we are more proactive in terms of writing to the committee to explain matters.</p><p>It would be good practice to be more proactive in writing to the committee to explain things.

I wish to make a comment to the acting director general of the Health Service Executive.  One of the HSE's publications is entitled Building a high quality health service for a healthier Ireland.  It refers to the values of care, compassion, trust and learning.  I wonder if people watching today who have followed the CervicalCheck scandal feel that any of those boxes have been ticked.</p> <p>  Mr. Breen referred to legal correspondence that referred to an earlier meeting.

The Vicky Phelan case had been in the public arena.  There had been debates in the D&aacute;il and there were meetings in other committees as well as this one.  I say that in regard to timing and what Mr. Breen said at this committee.</p> <p>  I cannot figure out why Mr. Breen would have been so certain that all the women had been informed or would be informed by their clinicians.  I cannot figure out why he would give us that information in the context of the meetings that we were having.</p><p>It does not make any sense.  How can we trust any information we get from the HSE when this circle cannot be squared?</p></speech>

The HSE then instituted a procedure to check whether all women had been informed, discovered that many had not, and immediately set about ensuring those women were informed.  That happened from the end of April into May and we met on 17 May-----</p></speech>

Those numbers had been ascertained between the end of April and the meeting on 17 May.  Those women were diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer from 1 September 2008.  Our knowledge was that, sadly, some of them had passed away and others were in the process.  When Deputy Murphy refers to "all women"-----</p></speech>

At the meeting on 17 May, we were told that women would be facilitated in getting their records in the context of the experience of a person going to Limerick and not being able to get her records having been raised.  We are now being told that in the absence of fully computerised electronic healthcare records, the retrieval process entails a manual search for records going back many years in some cases and potentially over a number of sites and that, although the HSE is committed to meeting the 30-day target, that does not always happen.  We understand that records may go back for a significant period and that people may wish to access their full health records but the scope of this issue is relatively narrow.  People will not look for their records because they had a broken toe when they were aged five.  Specific records are being sought.  We were given an assurance at that meeting that there would be no obstacles to the retrieval of such records but it now appears that issues are arising because the HSE does not keep records in a certain way.  Is there an obstacle to women getting their records within the 30-day timeframe?  We are being made aware of issues in that regard.</p></speech>

At that meeting I committed to putting someone in charge of that process and bringing in all necessary resources.  A number of critical cases involved people who were terminally ill and we committed to prioritising those cases such that the information would be provided in order that court deadlines could be met.  The request for access to records may come directly from women or from their solicitor, which may be by means of a freedom of information, FOI, or data access request.  All those requests are currently being met.  I am aware of one case in which an extra day will be needed and that was agreed yesterday with the woman concerned.  We are currently providing access to records in accordance with the deadline.  An issue which initially caused some problems was the volume of legal correspondence received which meant that we could not concentrate on getting the records out but, rather, had to try to deal with that correspondence in terms of acknowledgements and so on.  We have now put extra resources in place such that legal letters are acknowledged in a timely manner.  With the exception of the case that arose yesterday to which I referred and which was clarified this morning with the lady involved, we are meeting the targets for access to records.  For access requests the current target is 30 days, while for legal requests, it is meeting the deadlines for pending court cases.</p> <p>  Several steps are needed to provide the records, including the hospital records regarding the woman's cancer treatment and so on, the screening records and the associated correspondence between the hospital and the screening system.  Although some of the records are automated, all of those elements must be gathered.  We are currently achieving the deadlines for access requests and we will continue to put in whatever resources we need to achieve that.  We have put a full team in place.  We have three full-time legal people and an administrative team to which we have appointed a manager.</p></speech>

Some correspondence might still be issued via letter and that must also be provided.  The search for records could extend to a woman's hospital, which may be her colposcopy clinic, her treating hospital - those may be different institutions - the CervicalCheck screening centre in Limerick and the national screening service offices in Dublin.  That is the process through which we work and we then link with the SCA regard to legal cases to ensure that all records are provided as requested.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson is telling this committee that he was making an assumption on the basis that clinicians would have informed women.  I am saying that is not tenable because, in 2016, Mr. Gleeson wrote the memo or was part of writing a memo that gave discretion to clinicians and if the woman had passed on, the next of kin would not be informed and it would simply be noted on her file.  Mr. Gleeson's position is absolutely inconsistent because he was part of a number of people who wrote that memo that developed a strategy that women would not be informed or, at least, that they would limit the number of women who would be informed.</p></speech>

It is the context of the guidelines the HSE would have to comply with with regard to full disclosure.  It says only in exceptional circumstances based on the clinical interest of a service user, it is likely that the service user will not benefit from open disclosure, and it goes on to give reasons.  What Mr. Gleeson had in the circular that was given to clinicians was that, as a general rule of thumb, the outcome should be communicated to women.</p></speech>

The words "as appropriate" are important in this context.  If we go back to the letter that we got from Mr. Connaghan, which clarifies, after the meeting that took place between the officials: "Mr Gleeson's understanding was consistent with the record of the call.  Mr Gleeson's understanding of the communication with the women was that at the time he assumed the women had been informed by their treating physicians."  In his opening statement, he says "we would have believed that the clinician would have communicated with the women as appropriate".  The words "as appropriate" do not appear in this and that is key.  Mr. Gleeson knew that not all of them would have been informed by their treating clinicians.  I want to put this to Mr. Breen.

I appreciate Mr. Connor's directness on that.  To be fair to my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, he is the one who pursued this matter.  What worries me is that we are left with this ram-jam of a story and we will have to make a decision on what we believe happened.  We must take the word of witnesses that there was no disagreement at the meeting between the State Claims Agency and HSE.  However, neither organisation should have intercepted something that would obviously come back before the Committee of Public Accounts once the letter had been written to the SCA.  Having been before the committee before the State Claims Agency wrote to the committee, surely Mr. Connaghan was aware that there was a problem with this evidence?  Soon after the meeting it became clear that the information given at the meeting was incorrect.  Given that this is glaringly obvious to everyone following proceedings and everyone present, why did Mr. Connaghan choose to do and say nothing?  The only reason the committee is addressing this issue again is that the State Claims Agency wrote to us about it.  Mr. Connaghan needs to reflect on that deeply.</p><p> In layman's language, this was a case of the HSE believing the committee had not noticed this and the HSE had, therefore, got away with it and would say nothing.  However, when Mr. Breen and his colleagues wrote to the committee, the HSE had to deal with the issue.  If ever a series of events symbolises my view of arse covering in the HSE, it is this.  We are being told a story and we have to take people's word for it.  The committee took their word last time and it has since transpired that there were inaccuracies.  That is fine.  We will take the word of the HSE again today and it may stand up.  The committee will have to make a judgment on that but it is not a court of law.  </p><p> However, the bigger issue is why the HSE did not deal with the issue once it became clear there was a problem.  In fairness to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, that became obvious when he raised the matter.  While I acknowledge Mr. Connaghan's statement that there is a lesson to be learned from this, it is not damn well good enough.  We represent the public and the whole country is following these meetings, as are HSE management and staff.  The impact of the performances of HSE witnesses at this committee and other committees has had a serious and negative impact on its staff.  The administrative work creeping up on the HSE is multiplying as a result of those performances.  HSE staff did not like what they saw, namely, multiple instances of arse covering.  As a result, many people in the organisation believe they must push everything up the line, rather than assume personal responsibility in case their managers land them in it.  I have outlined one such example and the events that transpired following a meeting of this committee.  While the problem that has arisen may have been accidental, the fact that it was not dealt is emblematic of the HSE.  If Mr. Connaghan cannot see what is glaringly obvious, I do not know where we are going.  He may respond if he wishes.</p></speech>

It was to satisfy my own curiosity as to why there were two contradictory statements.  It is entirely reasonable that I would ask for a version of events and for the truth on the matter.  That is why, in the letter of 30 May, the committee got that response.  It was entirely reasonable that the committee asked for some clarification. </p></speech>

I will do a quick fire round of questions because we all have limited time.</p> <p>  I have a habit of drifting through committee meetings and I attended a meeting of the finance committee when representatives of the State Claims Agency appeared before it.  I accept the agency's hands are tied in many cases by the legislative basis on which it operates, for example, tort law.  Considerable time has passed.  What proposals has the State Claims Agency put to the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Finance on how it can change the current position?  The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il he had instructed the State Claims Agency to use mediation in all of these cases.  We now know that if the laboratories do not disentangle themselves from the HSE, the agency will be locked into a certain position.  Will Mr. Breen set out in detail the engagement between the State Claims Agency and the Government?  I presume they have engaged in days and weeks of intensive negotiations and discussions involving legislative proposals and whatever else may be needed.  How many meetings have taken place?</p></speech>

If I may, I will explain some of the changes because the changes that we have brought about are very precise.  Traditionally, if we were dealing with a medical negligence case where there is a plaintiff and a defendant, and we are obviously always for the defendant, we would engage a series of expert reports, have the person examined and engage other experts in relation to quantum.  We are not doing any of that.  We are immediately, in our defences which we are required to put in, we are admitting breach of duty in relation to the non-disclosure point, and we are asking the plaintiffs in the cases if they would share their reports with us immediately so that we can get to mediation as quickly as we possibly can.  I need to explain this to the Deputy.  He is asking me what changes are there and I need to explain them to him.  By doing it in this particular way, we are short-circuiting these cases by an incredibly shortened time.</p></speech>

I first have a question for Mr. Gleeson.  I do not live far from his offices, although it is in a different county which beat Tipperary in hurling this year.  I also know some of the people who work with him and I have met and spoken to people who work with him and people who work in CervicalCheck.  There are some very good, impressive people working in that organisation.  There are, however, serious issues with CervicalCheck.</p> <p>  On the provision of information, we all know that approximately 4,000 documents were provided on a USB key or CD-ROM or in some electronically scanned document.  Yesterday, the Minister for Health said he had issues and used the word "pathetic".  I do not know if that is correct but that is the word he used.  Why has Dr. Scally not been given direct access to all the files which all the staff have?  Why is he not being given remote or direct access to all those files?  Did the HSE ever propose that he have such access and, if so, why has it not been provided?</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson or someone with him proposed to give Dr. Scally the same full access that the relevant HSE staff had.  However, that was shot down in preference for taking the electronic files, putting them on a device - be it a USB device or a CD - and giving that to Dr. Scally, which he has gone ballistic over and which the Minister has called "pathetic".  As a result of this, the Taoiseach had to stand up in the D&aacute;il yesterday and say that he was instructing the HSE to do otherwise.  Why did the HSE not give Dr. Scally full access from day one?  The Taoiseach and Minister for Health are on the same page as me about this.</p></speech>

In fact, it is not what was agreed in the D&aacute;il.  However, that is not the issue.  Dr. Scally was clear in that he was furious about the documentation.  Everyone present knows that.  We have now revealed that the people in Limerick just wanted to give him full access.  As usual, though, when it went up the food chain, a decision was taken somewhere in the HSE that it would have to edit that documentation in some way.  Why can we not give him full access?</p></speech>

The Minister for Health has had discussions with Dr. Scally since then and I have had communications with the Minister for Health.  There is a contradiction in this somewhere.

That is my understanding, but he can confirm that himself.</p> <p>  There is medical cover.  There are consultants working in Dublin to deal with those medical calls.</p> <p>  Regarding the 209, there is the potential for more.  We are notified on an ongoing basis of audits and cancers.  If audits conclude, we will immediately make full disclosures to women.  Once the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists commences the international panel, that will assume responsibility for all future audits.</p></speech>

Has the 209 figure increased and, if so, by how much?  Does the HSE expect it to increase even further?  Are there cases where women ring in but there is no doctor to ring them back?</p></speech>

I expect the figure to increase before the royal college's review concludes.  As we are informed of any change in interpretation from an audit, we will inform the women first.

People are being added to it at the moment as the audit progresses.  Of the 1,482 women who were part of the cervical cancer audit, 46 audits are still in progress and 12 are concluding.  Once those are concluded, the women will be contacted about those audits.  From that point forward and once the royal college process commences, any future audit will run through.  To be clear, there are 12 women in the current audits and 46 in the ongoing audits.  Those women will be contacted as the results are disclosed to them.  I anticipate that, as the royal college process commences, which will happen in the coming weeks, we will cease all audits on the basis that we do not want two audit processes to be running at the same time.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on medical cover, I am sorry, but I thought I had clarified that.  There are medical consultants available to any of the call centres.  We have medical consultants in Dublin to take those calls.  Those calls are listed, co-ordinated and allocated to medical consultants.  There is not necessarily a doctor in Limerick, but there is access from Limerick to medical consultant cover in Dublin.</p></speech>

It is one that his own staff are telling him and of which he was probably made aware in the past 24 hours when he visited Limerick yesterday and returned with Mr. Gleeson to prepare for today.  There should be a doctor there.  The staff in Limerick need a doctor who can deal with these cases.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  If there are complex cases remaining from the calls, it is our intention with the interim clinical director to ensure that they are allocated directly to hospitals.  To recap, the call centre model involves a call centre in Cork that effectively takes the first line of calls and provides advice to women.  That amounted to approximately 14,000 calls.  The second level was general nursing and the third was oncology or colposcopy nursing, for example, the team in Limerick, which has done phenomenal work in a short time.  The final level is the medical piece.  That is either dealt with directly by a consultant or referred to a hospital.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify this.  It has been a complex process.  I am not going to say it has been easy.  There have been more than 25,000 calls.  At the point when the help desk was established we had a backlog of several thousand.  Earlier, I described the model of four tiers of calls.  We have more than 50 staff in each area.</p></speech>

I was at the meeting in May.  Then, I was missing for the 17 May meeting.  I came back.  We were in Africa with the Committee of Public Accounts, so we were not missing in action.  Then, I saw Mr. Connaghan's response.  I am on record as saying that I was shocked at Mr. Connaghan's response on the inconsistency between the HSE and the State Claims Agency.  The agency wrote to us indicating that a scoping exercise was in being with a view to a commission of inquiry or whatever inquiry would be settled on.  Mr. Connaghan, as the new person, decided not to attend that meeting.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I believe it is entirely reasonable for me to ask both parties to come together to explain their versions of events and to explain the alternative version of events and why there was a difference.  At the end of the day, that difference did not exist because we agreed with the latter part of the letter of 22 May.</p></speech>

We are here to oversee governance and procedures.  We are not here to ask people whether their job is tenable.  That is not our role.  Our role is to see whether procedures are in place.  I am not reassured by Mr. Connaghan's approach on procedures.  The State Claims Agency has said certain matters were not recorded in the way suggested.  Mr. Connaghan saw fit to call the relevant people together.  Mr. Connaghan did not attend the meeting.  There are no minutes of the meeting.  That does not represent good governance or accountability for someone who is in charge, does it?</p></speech>

That is the problem - it had been given.  That will be looked at in future, presumably by the scoping inquiry.  Forgive me if I am wrong, but this looks like Mr. Connaghan decided to get the one story.  That added to the insult.</p> <p>  I will leave that for today.  I will leave it for the inquiry but I appeal to Mr. Connaghan to reflect on it.  Did Mr. Connaghan read all the briefing documents that were produced to us eventually by Mr. O'Brien?

They are signed by Simon Murtagh, acting head of the National Screening Service, on behalf of Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, national director.  The issues coming up relate to the results of the audit coming through with problematic findings and communications to women.

Deputy Connolly was not at the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that she referenced.  The transcript of that meeting and the previous meeting of the Joint Committee on Health addressed all those issues in full.  The purpose of the briefings requested and shared with the director general and the Department was to explain the matter to those people.  They would have received a verbal briefing in advance, at the same time as they received a written briefing, to the effect that the CervicalCheck programme was conducting the audit and that those responsible had come to the point where they wished to communicate the findings to women.</p></speech>

I have only ten minutes.  I have before me the transcript of the meeting that I missed.  I have read it in detail.  I was present and asked a question on the memorandums given to us at 3 p.m. that afternoon.  I was present for the questioning on the memorandums.  I could not possibly accept the language in the memorandums on the strategy being communicated.  Again, I am leaving it for the commission and the scoping exercise.  I have read them.  The officials are taking another position now.  The three documents I have before me show me that there was a strategy in place to contain the message.  I am asking Mr. Connaghan whether, when he read all those documents, he still thought it was appropriate to contain the message.</p></speech>

I do not have them in front of me but it did not immediately read to me that this was a containment strategy.  There was clearly a strategy to make the audit results available to women.  That is why all the treating clinicians had a letter asking them to pass on the results in question.  I did not immediately read that interpretation into it.  This is the subject of copious evidence given over seven hours at the previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

Anyway, I am leaving it.</p><p>I would say to Dr. O'Keeffe that I think the language was wrong.  I think it was totally unacceptable.  When a new person joined the HSE, the organisation should have reviewed the matter.  In my opinion, the action was not good governance.  </p><p> I have a few questions for Mr. Breen about the State Claims Agency.  I have attempted to find out how many cases are pending, in whatever form, such as a warning letter or proceedings settled.  How many cases are there in terms of the cervical smear programme?</p></speech>

I wish to raise two issues and one is for Mr. Connaghan.

Information was starting to be provided between 24 May, to Dr. Scally, up to 7 June to close out that information request.</p> <p>  I think where Dr. Scally's disappointment lies is the fact that the information provided to him was not totally in an immediately searchable format.  We are looking at the technical reasons to try and readjust that right now so that he can search all documents.  I mirror his disappointment but there is no question of full co-operation with the HSE.  All of the staff understand that.   </p></speech>

Why was it unclear on 11 June after so much pain and difficulties?</p></speech>

So obviously he looked at that and discovered some things that he did not like, in terms of the transmission of those documents.  We are working to sort that right now, okay.</p></speech>

Mr. Connaghan said he would like to consider Mr. Gleeson's offer of access.  How, in the name of God, did he not know about it before today?  This is the biggest health scandal in decades and Dr. Scally has come out and criticised the HSE about access.  Surely, it was fed up the line that the programme manager had given an open disclosure access policy, perhaps with limitations, yet Mr. Connaghan is only becoming aware of it today.</p></speech>

Something occurs to me and it is that I have only met Dr. Scally once and that was at the outset.  It is important to make sure I have oversight of where Dr. Scally's review is going, that we are supportive of it and that we can provide the required information.  I will probably need to set something up.  I will be doing so this afternoon in order to have regular contact with Dr. Scally to make sure we iron out any issue.  I thank Mr. Gleeson for making the suggestion.  It is something I need to consider.</p></speech>

Yesterday the Minister for Health called the witnesses "pathetic", but Mr. Connaghan was not even told that this had been offered.  He really needs to sit down and have a chat with people because it is embarrassing.  I cannot go any further.</p> <p>  I request clarification on one thing Mr. McCallion said.  We know that the number of women affected will increase.  He talked about a further 12 audits and 46 ongoing audits.  Will he clarify if that means that there are potentially a further 58 cases?</p></speech>

I am not accusing anybody of telling lies or giving misinformation or whatever nice version one wants to use about lying.  As we all heard, Professor Scally has a history of dealing with stuff like this in other organisations.  It does not make sense that it would be acceptable to somebody at his level to receive scanned documents on a disk or a USB stick.  Neither he nor anyone at his level would think it was practical to go through documents in that manner.  It is not believable and I find it incompetent that scanned documents would be given in a format that was not searchable, as Mr. Connaghan said.  It is a needle in a haystack job.  It is not the way to go about it.  That it took until 11 June to find out that this was the format in which he had been given the information does not add up.</p> <p>  Many of us on the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Health, including me, believe we are constantly met with resistance, avoidance of disclosure and every barricade that can be put in our way in our engagement with the HSE.  For the public looking in, I estimate the combined salaries of the witnesses present per year to be in the region of &euro;2.5 million, leaving the rest of us out of it.  I have said here before and at the Joint Committee on Health that we are dealing with a population the size of that of Manchester.  For normal people looking in, this is madness.  It is a dysfunctional system that is rotten to the core and not fit for purpose.  We have all of the witnesses, many of whom do great work, but committee members are like a court of law.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has to read transcripts and we then start dancing on the head of a pin with words such as "assurances" and "assumptions".  The last time we had the word "feelings" from Dr. O'Keeffe.  All of this language does not give us answers and, to my mind, it is a complete waste of time.  Somebody needs to take control.  I thought Mr. Connaghan was in control, but the fact that he has admitted that he has only met Dr. Scally once, which was at the outset, seems mad.  It seems reasonable on something of this magnitude that he would be meeting Dr. Scally on a weekly basis to be updated.  To have to sit here on a such beautiful day land listen to Mr. Gleeson talk about things he had "assumed" is disrespectful to us and the public.</p> <p>  I do not buy the notion that somebody thought that giving scanned, unsearchable documents was the way forward.  It seems to be a deliberate attempt to stop information from being received.  I do not buy either the notion of not having statutory authority because I have often inquired of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and it seems people with no medical qualifications have access to medical records.  The issue can be dealt with.  Many people go to doctor A for treatment and doctor B gets to see their files and there is no confidentiality issue.  It is just another barricade put in our way in trying to get the answers.</p><p>I just wonder what the point of all the witnesses is at this stage.  They are not able to answer us.  Who is to blame?  Is it the labs, the audit process, the system, politics or something else?  We are still here.  I do not know what is the point of this meeting.  It must be the tenth or 12th meeting with the witnesses I have attended and we are no further along.  There is no point to the witnesses being here because they are not giving us answers.  If this is - I am trying to think of a word that does not include bad language - the mess we are in, they clearly cannot manage things.</p><p> The public and the medical people are becoming more annoyed because we are now undoing all the good that was done through the screening process in this country over ten years.  We will probably reverse our 7% reduction in cervical cancer rates.  The whole negativity around this is bad for public health, which, as far as I am concerned, it is supposed to be the witnesses' job to protect.  I am a Government Deputy and I just think the whole lot of them should be sent packing and we should get new people to do this.  It is the middle of June.  This has been going on for weeks now and we are none the wiser.  We are looking at people who are paid with taxpayers' money and who are supposed to be accountable to us telling us "Well, maybe", "Oh, I assumed this" and "I felt this".  I just do not have any time for it because I do not buy it.  It reminds me of when I used to try to get away with things with my parents when I was a teenager and I tried to baffle them with my various versions of the story so they would not know where I was.  That is what the witnesses have managed to do today.  We do not know who is in charge, who is accountable or what qualifications people have.  I looked at the organisational structure of the HSE and it has changed in the past two days.  The HSE has been shifting the deck-chairs around on the Titanic as well.  It is just insulting.  The witnesses' continuous behaviour at these meetings is insulting to the elected Members of this House and to the public.  It is a waste of our time.</p></speech>

It was agreed that a scoping inquiry, as opposed to a commission of investigation, would be the best way to proceed - there is likely to be a commission of investigation afterwards - to identify the issues.  The inquiry was given until the end of June.  This was publicly known.  It would have been known to the witnesses that the end of June was the target date for completion of that work.  Was Mr. Connaghan consulted before the Cabinet met about whether or not there was a capacity issue with doing it within that timeline?  Was there any engagement in that regard?</p></speech>

That the documents had been digitally generated but then scanned and sent in a format that cannot be searched would certainly underscore the point that Vicky Phelan made that she believed it was stonewalling.

I am sure CervicalCheck will want to reassure people and it will want women to continue to engage with the screening process, as I would myself, and it will want to give every assurance to people that they can have confidence in the screening programme.  It seems to me that in order to give that confidence the very first thing that should have been provided and worked on was the labs and their reliability and if one lab was better than the other so that Dr. Scally could come to a judgment on that.  There was a breakthrough yesterday on the contractual obligations relating to that.</p></speech>

One of Dr. Scally's objectives is to provide assurance in respect of the laboratories, particularly in the context of the importance of the screening programmes.  The Deputy is right.  One woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer through screening every two days and that is the key point on which, hopefully, Dr. Scally will give assurance.</p> <p>  In terms of the laboratory performance-----</p></speech>

I was only trying to reflect the importance of the testing, which was the Deputy's point.</p> <p>  In terms of the performance of the laboratories, all of that information has been available and will be made available.  The committee had sought copies of the contracts as well so we had to go through a process to ensure that we did not in any way undermine some of the terms and indemnities contained in the contracts that could, in effect, impact on the State.  We have got an agreement with the laboratories to release those contracts, as Mr. Connaghan said, with some provisos.  We will be going through that with Dr. Scally and also writing to the Chair of the committee in terms of the release of those contracts.</p></speech>

Earlier, Mr. Connaghan stated, "This will require a significant team to be put in place within the HSE to support this process."  He went on to say something else and the word "understand" jumped out at me.  He said, "We understand the Department is concluding the contract for this work and the scope of work will include all women who were part of the CervicalCheck audit".  Is it the HSE or the Department of Health?  That jumps out at me as being odd.  If the HSE is running the programme I would have thought it would also be involved in the contractual obligation around the process.  What is going on in relation to that?</p></speech>

The HPV roll-out is a separate project.  I think what Mr. Connaghan is referring to in the opening statement is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' review, which is of the 3,100 women I mentioned earlier who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer.</p></speech>

While the Department is leading on that - it is independent, rightly so, of the HSE - we have been working very closely with it in terms of the numbers to ensure that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is clear on the total numbers and the size of the task it is taking on.  I think what was being referred to in the opening statement was the international expert panel, which is effectively being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the faculty of pathology in the UK.

Deputy Connolly referred to some of those matters such as concern in the HSE about screaming headlines and potentially undermining the screening programme.  It was well known in the HSE and there was talk about how it would communicate, but then it did not communicate and held back letters.  We know the body of memos that are there.  I think there were four of them.  The State Claims Agency takes responsibility for any court actions and it has to do an assessment of what is likely to happen.

There is a great deal of interaction between both, so there is an awful lot of learning that arises from the claims side that is fed back through our risk management side on closed claims analysis, for example, across the range of health services.  To put the particular meeting in context for the Deputy, it was very much a preliminary meeting with the screening service.  It was not something we had worries about.  A lot of claims occur in hospitals due to medical negligence so they were our priority.  This was a very introductory-type meeting.  Mr. Gleeson was at the meeting and he might speak about it as well.  It covered a range of things.</p></speech>

We now know information which we did not know previously, particularly in relation to women being informed.  It was assumed that women were being informed through their clinicians.  Unfortunately, we now know that was not the case.  That is what has caused a lot of controversy in this committee and a lot of trauma and hurt for the women themselves.  I presume lessons have been learned in that regard.  Is it the case that we are not relying on clinicians now?  Are we still relying on clinicians to inform women into the future?  Is the process changing?  Can someone explain what happens now?  At the meeting of 17 May, I made the point that because of the failure to put in place a check at the end point, we did not close the loop.  I asked Mr. Gleeson who was responsible for ensuring the loop was closed.  I was told it was not possible at the time to state who was responsible.  Mr. Gleeson said it may or may not have been his responsibility.  I asked him whether he would go away and reflect on whether it should have been his responsibility.  Somebody needs to be held accountable.  I am genuinely not looking for a head on a plate.  Somebody needs to put their hand up and say "I was the person responsible for ensuring the loop was closed, but it did not happen and I apologise for it".  Nobody has done that yet.  I think somebody should do it.  I want to give the people in the room an opportunity to take responsibility for the loop not being closed.  If they can take responsibility for it now, and if they want to comment on it, the floor is open to them.  I think it is important.  Much of the stuff that is out there at the moment relates to the fact that the women who have been affected by this issue feel that nobody is being held accountable and nobody is taking responsibility.  That, outside of everything else they are going through, is causing hurt to these women.  They see a lot of officials and politicians coming in and having a ding-dong back and forth without anybody putting up their hand and saying "I was responsible, I apologise, this will not happen again".  Do we now know who was responsible for closing that loop?  If that person is here, would he or she like to make a comment?</p></speech>

I am relatively new in the role of director general and in my understanding of the full scope of responsibilities and accountabilities in that role.  From my perspective and in my role, I need to be accountable and responsible for the performance of the system.  I understand the committee had a discussion at a past meeting about whether the previous director general was accountable and responsible for the actions of every single person inside the system.  The answer at that point was that it was going to be pretty hard to have such accountability and responsibility, given that people sometimes step out of the system.  The role of the director general and the board of the HSE, when it is established, is to make sure that a proper set of system controls and procedures is in place, that there is a safe system of working and that all of this is regularly monitored with good procedures.  I fully accept that my responsibility lies at that level.</p></speech>

I have always said that this is a systems failure.  Mr. Connaghan is now admitting that it was a systems failure.  If he is not admitting that, maybe I am reading into it incorrectly.</p></speech>

The person who previously held Mr. Connaghan's position said it was not a systems failure.  I appreciate the fact that Mr. Connaghan is now taking responsibility for that.  Given everything we now know about information and assumptions, does Mr. Breen have full confidence that all the information the State Claims Agency is getting on CervicalCheck is factual and correct and that no more assumptions are being made?</p></speech>

The information we are principally seeking now is in respect of the ongoing claims and ensuring that we have all of the relevant records and documentation we require.  We are getting those and getting them in a way that meets our needs.  We do not have any doubts about the quality of the information or the rapidity with which we are receiving it.</p></speech>

He was the person responsible for ensuring that loop was closed initially.  It was not closed, for whatever reason.  As already stated, at our previous meeting he was uncertain whether it was his responsibility.  If Mr. Gleeson would like to comment, he should feel to do so because I think it is important that women hear that someone is taking full responsibility.  I know Mr. Connaghan has done that from the HSE point of view.  If Mr. Gleeson has a comment, it would be important for CervicalCheck.</p></speech>

The failure was not to have any responsibility assigned.  That was the failing in the system.  It did not continue the loop.  Had I assumed or been assigned responsibility for it, then it could have been done.  I have already apologised for that link not being made.  I reiterate that apology now.  We have to learn from this process and make sure that final step is taken and if it is assigned to me I will be more than happy to ensure it happens.</p></speech>

It links directly with the hospitals.  I will take the 209 women as an example.  Disclosure was made in the case of 42 of those women but not in respect of the balance.  A central team linked directly with the hospitals ensures that the loop is closed in respect of the supports for those women.  We maintain a database that keeps an up-to-date picture of exactly where each of those cases stands at any point in order that the loop is closed.  The serious incident management team set up in respect of this has the directors of hospitals and all of the other relevant directors on it to make sure that all of those loops are closed.  We track all of the contacts made with each of the women.  That is not just in respect of informing them but also in trying to keep track of all the different requirements they have.</p></speech>

I sat on the health forum years ago and watched this debacle emerge when all the experts told us not to outsource.  Quest was mentioned in particular at the time.  I am not blaming the witnesses for that but I certainly put blame on the establishment of the time and the type of philosophy that existed.  We watched this happen and now it will cost an absolute fortune.  That may be a bad choice of words given the suffering of many women so I am not making it in that context but in the context of actual cost.  We had an excellent laboratory in Galway that was doing a brilliant job but it was all outsourced.  Here is a golden opportunity so is the HSE looking at insourcing the tests?</p></speech>

We need a clinical lead to be able to close out the process.  The Deputy asked what is the preference and I can answer from my perspective as director general.  No matter what is the service, I have always had the preference to attempt to do as much insourcing as possible.  However, that needs to measured in terms of resilience of the supply chain, value for money, quality etc.  There are some caveats.</p></speech>

There is not a week that goes by when the courts are sitting that there are newspaper articles or television coverage of victims of wrongdoing being forced to go through the process of having to defend and vindicate their rights.

Very often when we settle without an admission of liability it is because we have a very strong expert report which would say that an individual practitioner in the circumstances is not liable yet there is very often damage to the person and for good reason we settle without the case admission of liability.

In my experience, it is the setting of a date that prompts the settlement.  In terms of the 3% and the horrific cases we read about and the families involved in those cases, would it not be more appropriate for the State to deal with these matters more directly and with the admission of liability rather than expending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of euro on an annual business saving face for individuals?  It may be that there is a report stating that individuals did not do anything wrong in accordance with procedure and medical practice, but ultimately the State is still coughing up large sums of money to compensate patients.  Where in this equation, from a taxpayers' money perspective or a patient care perspective, is it worthy of the State to pursue individuals through the courts and then finally settle on the steps of the court without admitting liability, which is often what happens?  To me, it seems horrific to do this to people.  I understand these are complex cases but, putting it mildly, this practice has to stop.  There must be a process of mediation before cases get to the courts so that these families do not have to go through that experience, not to mention the public moneys being expended in that process.</p></speech>

The agency in no way wants to bring people to the steps of the courts or into the courts unless it is compelled to do so.  By way of example, the other day we were facing a case with a demand for &euro;3.9 million.  After a day in court, the case settled for &euro;75,000.  This is an inevitable situation in which we find ourselves at times.  Where settlement demands are so significant and beyond our professional estimate of what should be given we are compelled to go to court.  We do so because we have a duty to the taxpayer.  The 3% of cases that go to trial are cases where there would be a very fundamental liability point.  I will give another example.  Two weeks ago, we had a case which we requested be discontinued, based on our expert report prior to the trial.  We were willing to provide our expert report on why the case did not have merit yet the case progressed and was withdrawn after one day.  There are inevitable situations where this happens.</p> <p>  In cases of catastrophic injuries to infants, many are settled before court but they require to be ruled on by a court and, therefore, it appears that we are bringing a family into court but we are not.  We are required to do this under ordinary rules.</p></speech>

They tend to be much more complex, the reason being it is very difficult to say that one case has a value of &euro;30,000 and another has a value of &euro;50,000 yet the range of injuries might be relatively non-variable.  The issue is how they impact on the person, the age of the person, the sex of the person and so on.  There are many qualitative differences that lie in these issues.</p></speech>

I do not think he is correct because an electronic spreadsheet is easily searchable.  It is possible to convert documents to searchable format.  I do not buy the idea that there is some complexity involved in searching documents.  As far as I am concerned the issue here is that somebody made a decision that Dr. Scally was to be given scanned PDF documents rather than electronic hard copies.  In other words, rather than give Dr. Scally a desk, computer and password in the HSE to enable him to access the documents somebody made the decision to give him scanned documents, which he has made very clear is not appropriate.  I do not think Mr. Connaghan is correct in saying data searching is a complex process.  Perhaps, I misinterpreted him.  We all do it every day.  If we receive documents in PDF format we convert them.  I do not understand what the technical issue is and so perhaps Mr. Connaghan would elaborate.</p></speech>

On the laboratory data, Mr. McCallion said that drawing out historical data is a complex process.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked Mr. McCallion about the results from the laboratories for 2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016.  I have a photograph of the results on my phone which is dated 9 May.  I do not know on what date the committee received them but I got them on that date from the witnesses.  We were able to get them on 9 May, which is a month ago.  What is so complicated about getting the results for previous years?  Do the witnesses expect us to believe that there is not a similar data available for other years?  The data we have comprises four columns detailing the names of the laboratories, the form of screening that took place, the number of inappropriate smears, the number of negative results and various other percentages.  How is it that it was easy to get the results for that period when today we are being told it is complex to draw out historical data?  Are we back to technicalities with searching the spreadsheet or there is another reason?</p></speech>

Maybe there was nothing to see, but it seems a bit odd.  I turn to the QA matter.  This is back to the regulation and we are dealing with Brexit.  Every country or area has its QA people who come in to ensure the machine is working properly, that the guy checking is qualified and that the QP is right and all that.  However, would that QA process have involved any examination of the tables I have been speaking about to Mr. McCallion?  I see those as two separate things.  QA is about machinery and skilled operators but it seems to be conflated here today.  QA is a question of whether the laboratory is working, ensuring there are no rats in the corner, that the temperature is right and that people sign in so the right people are in the room and nothing is compromised.  Am I right in saying that?</p></speech>

The body tests the laboratory for that whether it is blood testing or whatever.  Second, we have published quality assurance guidelines on our website.  If one works within the programme as a laboratory, these are what must be met.  Having been awarded a contract, one will have to be accredited and meet these standards.  Third, we do quality monitoring against those quality standards.  The national certification body will do its annual audits for the accreditation and we will do ongoing monitoring against the standards set in our QA guidelines.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach made a commitment - and I am paraphrasing - that the objective was for the women not to have to take legal cases but that the State would take the cases.  As such, the women would not have to do it directly themselves.  What engagement would there have been before that commitment was made?  Is that possible when a statement of claim has already issued and proceedings have already commenced?  Is there anything new that has come in to mediate following that statement?</p></speech>

In other words, he or she will want to put his or her case before the courts in terms of the legal documents required such as a personal injuries summons and so on for the purposes of laying out what the claim is about and where there have been failures by the defendant.</p><p>In these particular cases the women are anxious to do this to get their proceedings out in any event because they want to make sure they are within the Statute of Limitations.  That is an important issue for them.  They will also rely on an expert report and will want to paraphrase some of its content in their pleadings.  In the hopefully unlikely situation where mediation fails, many of the women will want to fall back on the court.  In any event the women, some of whom are gravely ill, would want the court to lay out set timelines.  That is a choice for the women to go to court to set these matters out for their protection.</p><p> The process that we are engaged in respect of the mediation effectively runs parallel to that process.  The judge keeps an eye on the case on a case management basis to make sure the parties are doing what they should do because the women are gravely ill.  At our end, we are going as fast as we can to mediation, which is exactly what the Taoiseach had said.</p></speech>

This is why they are going back to court, understandably.  It is to ask the court to be a guardian of the process to make sure that things are happening.  That is why, unfortunately, we see these applications.  We would prefer not to see them.  Where we want to get to, in line with what the Taoiseach has said, is that these women will be going to mediation and not having to go to court.</p></speech>

The Department of Health officials were asked why the scoping inquiry is taking longer than expected.  They need not give an answer now but I want detailed notes from the Department on the work that went into preparing the timescale, not the terms of reference.  The Department came up with a timescale and the Minister announced it would be in place by the end of June.  We want to know how that timescale was arrived at, what consideration went into the work required and why somebody felt it that could be completed in that time, and whether it encompassed adequately what was requested in the terms of reference.  I always knew it was an impossible timetable based on what was being asked.  I would like to see what notes the Department had on it and whether it was a realistic timetable to begin with.</p> <p>  At the end of all this, does Mr. Connaghan believe the clinicians should have communicated with the women as appropriate?

If we can have this level of debate about a word, as to who should have done what or who believed what, and it has taken two hours to get through this in public, I would hope in private that the witnesses would move much more quickly in trying get to the bottom of issues like this.  I would be fearful that if the witnesses were not in the public eye, a debate like that would go on interminably.  That is a worry.</p></speech>

However, we should have fail-safes behind that.  We all realise that other things wrap around the system to make sure we have a feedback loop and we close that loop.  It is not just clinicians.  We need to have wider things around there to make sure the system itself does not fail.</p></speech>

The first item to deal with is the minutes of the meeting of 31 May.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  There will be no matters arising that will not come up in the rest of our correspondence so I will move on to correspondence.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  The first are Nos. 1378 (i) and 1378 (ii), opening statement and briefing material from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  Nos. 1379 (i) and 1379 (ii) are an opening statement and briefing documents from the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  Next is No. 1381, the opening statement from the HSE for this morning's meeting, and No. 1383, the opening statement from Mr. John Gleeson  This correspondence, discussed earlier, is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Correspondence Nos. 1339B (i) to 1339B (iv), inclusive, 1340B (i) to 1340B (iv), inclusive, and 1341B (i) to 1341B (xxv), inclusive, were held over from the previous meeting.  They are from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, dated 25 May and 28 May 2018 and provide information requested in respect of our meeting on CervicalCheck.  There is a considerable volume of material.  We met HSE officials this morning regarding this particular issue but we also have scheduled a meeting with the HSE for 5 July in the normal course of events to deal with its annual financial statement.  We will note these items for the moment.  They include quality assurance guidelines and the audit methodology paper that preceded the CervicalCheck audit in 2010.  I will hold these documents for a minute and we will come back to them.  There is a question as to whether they can be published.</p> <p>  No. 1353B  is correspondence from Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach, regarding the process followed in respect of information being brought to the Government relating to cases against the State.  He also deals with queries we had on the strategic communications unit and the &euro;700,000 spent on Project Ireland 2040 and includes a note on the training provided to staff on protected disclosures.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  People are free to use that documentation.</p></speech>

We will write back and ask for an update on the final figures when all invoices have been processed.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for teasing out that issue.</p><p>The next item is No. 1357B (i) to (iv) from the office of the chief administrative officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 30 May providing information on the legal advice to the former Garda Commissioner, a note on the Garda training college risk register and an update on the implementation of the recommendations in the internal audit report on the training college.  We will note and publish all of that.</p><p>The next item is No. 1358B from Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute;, dated 30 May providing a lot of follow-up information requested by this committee, including details on the relationship between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and RT&Eacute; in the context of oversight; an analysis of the 81 contractors paid as limited companies; a note on costs associated with legal contracts; and responses to the other specific questions we put.  We will note and publish these documents which provide all of the answers required in a clear manner.</p><p>The next item is No. 1364B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 1 June 2018, providing information regarding guidelines on expenditure on hospitality by public bodies. That arose from our discussion on third level institutions in Cork<b>.  </b>We will note and publish that correspondence.  The next item, No. 1365B is also from Mr. Robert Watt, dated 1 June 2018, providing follow-up information requested by the committee on the European structural reform support programme, including information on the scope and expected outcomes of the project.  The correspondence also includes notes on the sequencing of moving public service bodies to the finance shared service and on the financial reporting standards of public bodies.  We will note and publish all of that.</p><p><b></b>The next item is No. 1366B from Mr. Barry O'Connor, president of Cork Institute of Technology, dated 7 June 2018 providing follow-up information requested by the committee including a letter issued from the institute to the Higher Education Authority dated 22 May 2018 and a note on the pension paid by the student services company, which includes details of those eligible to benefit from the pension scheme and whether anyone in the institute or on the board is involved in the company.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p><p>The next item is No. 1367B from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president of University College Cork, dated 8 June 2018 providing follow-up information requested by the committee on Cork University Foundation, Athena Swan, Infini-LED, IMI pay scales, the IMI aspiring leaders programme and a note on key management personnel.  We will note and publish that information and members are free to use it as they see fit.  </p><p>The next item is No. 1376B from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency dated 12 June, relating to his attendance at today's meeting.  We dealt with this earlier, so will note and publish it now.  It is only a formality.</p><p>The next items of correspondence are from or related to private individuals.  Item No. 1312C is from Deputy Catherine Murphy dated 18 May 2018 regarding the Road Safety Authority, RSA ,which was held over.  We will hold that over again for now.  Item No. 1347C is from Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Reardon at the office of the Garda Commissioner, dated 28 May 2018, providing a response to the committee regarding a report on the operation of GoSafe cameras.  It also relates to the issue of road safety issue and we will hold it over again for now.  </p><p>No. 1351C is correspondence from an individual dated 29 May 2018 regarding the provision of training related to bereavement in the HSE.  The allocation of training resources is a matter for each public body.  I do not think that this committee can provide advice on how to access funding for the training required other than to contact the training unit in the HSE and I propose that we write to the individual accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item is No. 1352C (i) to (iii) from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 29 May 2018, provides information requested by the committee on alleged PRSI misclassification of employees.  The correspondence deals with employed versus self-employed status, the PRSI and taxation systems and the appeals structure.  We discussed this previously.  We have also received a reply on this matter from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I propose that we send a copy of both items to the individual concerned.  We will keep this issue before us.  The information provided here is useful to members.  We will publish it on our website for the benefit of the public who may have an interest in that topic.</p><p>No. 1354C is correspondence received from Mr. Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 30 May 2018, confirming his attendance at today&rsquo;s meeting, which we will note an publish.  Nos. 1342C, 1355C (i) to (vi) and 1362C dated 24 May, 30 May 2018 and 2 June 2018, respectively, were received from an individual on the issue of wards of court.  We will hold that over.  The correspondent has been in touch with me and a number of other committee members.  We will meet one or two of the people who have asked for a meeting and return to the issue later.  We will not deal with this matter today.</p><p>No. 1356C (i) to (iii) is from an individual, dated 30 May 2018, enclosing copies of letters regarding the Irish Horse Welfare Trust in Wicklow sent to Deputy Andrew Doyle and the animal health and welfare division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I propose we note the correspondence.  No. 1359C (i) to (iii) is correspondence from an individual, dated 31 May 2018, relating to an FOI request to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The committee is being copied on the correspondence which relates to road contracts and the disposal of waste.  We will note that.  We are not being asked to deal with anything as such but are being copied in on correspondence. </p><p>No. 1361C (i) to (ii) is correspondence from an individual, dated 4 June 2018, regarding evidence provided by officials of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment related to RT&Eacute; at the meeting of this committee on 3 May 2018.  The individual states that information given to the committee regarding a request by RT&Eacute; to the Broadcasting Authority for RT&Eacute; 2+1 to be included on the Sky platform was not correct.  The individual also sent a copy of this correspondence to Ms Cronin of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Ms Cronin has written directly to the committee, as per item No. 1374C, dated 11 June, on the matter.  Ms Cronin explains the process followed and apologises for the lack of clarity which may have risen.  I am not satisfied with that correspondence and have a proposal to make in that regard.  I raised an issue at the meeting in question.  RT&Eacute; representatives were talking about the commercial situation and I asked why RT&Eacute; 2+1 was not on the Sky platform.  The witness from the Department gave the impression that a request had been received but would have to go to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, first.  I asked what stage the application was at and was told that it was with the BAI.  An individual who was watching proceedings carefully felt that what was said was not true and submitted an FOI request to the BAI which confirmed that it had received no such application.  The letter from the Department does not correct the record.  Evidence was given in public by a very senior assistant secretary of a Department that was not accurate.  We had a similar issue this morning and brought the people involved before us.  While I do not propose that we go to that stage on this issue, we would not have known about it were it not for a vigilant member of the public contacting us to tell us what was said was incorrect.  That has been proven to be the case.  In the meantime, the assistant secretary has written to the committee to explain the background and context but has not corrected the record.  </p></speech>

We are going to write to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to confirm its understanding of the situation, because it was referred to by the Department, which I do not think was correct.  We will also write to Dee Forbes of RT&Eacute; because all the senior people from RT&Eacute; were here and they had to know that there was no request to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland because it had not even made a request to the Minister to have RT&Eacute; 2+1 put onto the Sky platform.  I put in a parliamentary question the other day and received a written answer on Tuesday night.  The Minister said, however, that to date he has not received any formal proposal from RT&Eacute; requesting permission to transmit an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  In the D&aacute;il on Wednesday night, the Minister said no such proposal had been lodged.  Both RT&Eacute; and the Department allowed the discussion to take place as to where the process was.  I gather that informal discussions may have taken place but a formal proposal was never made so I am asking RT&Eacute; to clarify its position.  Specifically, I want to ask it if there is such a thing as an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel, because somebody has told me it does not even exist yet, never mind being on the Sky platform.  We want the record to be corrected and we do not want there to be a lot of beating around the bush, referring to context and background, etc.  What was said on the record was not accurate and it is to be corrected and apologised for.  We will accept it in good faith if we get straight answers.  I take it that is agreed, as I have gone through the stuff and members will see I have been on the case.</p></speech>

I suggest bringing in the three Secretaries General but, in the first instance, we could write to them to ask them what they did with the cash.</p></speech>

My understanding, and that of the public, would be that it was sold for &euro;400 million and that was to be ring-fenced specifically for the housing crisis.  If it is still in Ervia and has not made its way directly to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, what is going on?  It is smoke and mirrors.</p></speech>

We all know why we are inviting it  in.  Some people will ask why we are bringing it in so I will explain, for the record.  There is income from the Passport Office, in the order of &euro;50 million, in the Appropriation Accounts which we are examining.  It is very much part and parcel of the funding of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Before the Secretary General comes in, we want to deal with the following items with the head of the Passport Office.  We want it to give us the different types of application methods.  We know about the online system but we want to know how many went through this route last year and until the end of May this year.  I do not want the average processing time - I want it broken down by days.</p></speech>

An Post parcel express renewal applications has a target of 15 working days but this is different from first-time applications and it is the latter where difficulties are being experienced.  There is a target of 20 working days in that case and it said in a reply to a parliamentary question last week that it was 35 days in some cases but some take seven or eight weeks.  I do not want an average but how many are dealt with within ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 days.  I will ask for information on applications from Northern Ireland and Great Britain because it says they are adding to the figures.  It says applications are up by 20% but 20% of what?  We will also ask for a note on the number of applications received in the various foreign missions, the number of Great Britain renewals and first-time applications.  We want figures well in advance so that we can digest them.</p></speech>

There are three topics: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Vote; international co-operation and the Ireland bilateral aid Vote; and the Passport Office.  We will ask the Passport Office how it is handling the &euro;50 million in public money it gets annually and how efficient it is.  We will all hear that staff are run off their feet but there is something seriously wrong with the management there.  In 2016, income was &euro;12.3 million ahead of expectations due to a significant increase in passports but we hear that every year.  It should know that summer comes around every year.</p><p>We will ask for an explanation on that.  Representatives of the Passport Office will be here next week.  </p><p> On 28 June we will have representatives of the Tax Appeals Commission and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in to discuss the write-off of taxation debt.  On 5 July, we will have the HSE in on its most recent financial statement which will be available at that time.  On 12 July we will have a report on the National Treasury Management Agency's financial statements which will include the State Claims Agency regarding the topics we discussed earlier.  </p><p> Perhaps all members received the letter I have.  We discussed the issue of the funding baseline for various local authorities and I received a letter, dated 5 June, from the Department saying a consultation process is commencing.  Members can comment on the process until 3 July.  If they do not have that letter I will ask the secretariat to circulate my copy because several members expressed an interest in that topic.  If they have something to say, that is the formal process by which to say it.  </p></speech>

That is definite.  We said we would consider doing another periodic report from the end of January up to April.  The secretariat is working on summarising the meetings that have been held.  It is not a draft report but the secretariat putting all the information together as a discussion document.  It will be circulated early next week and we will discuss it, perhaps, next Thursday for an hour or two.  For those who are interested in leaking it and for those who are interested in receiving the leak, it is not a report of the committee.  It is not a draft report; it is just a summary.  It is our starting point.  It helps crystallise and refresh our memories about what was said and the evidence we received at all our meetings since January, which will ultimately lead to a periodic report.  It is a first step in assembling information.  There will be nothing in it that has not been said in public session or sent to us by way of correspondence.  We want to get his discussion document launched before the break.</p></speech>

We will examine the 2016 financial statements of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and matters related to the fair deal scheme.  To assist us in our examination, we have invited representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland to discuss related matters with us in a short session before we deal with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p><p>I remind members and those in the Public Gallery that Nursing Homes Ireland is not a public body and its representatives are here voluntarily.  We are joined today by Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive, Mr. Maurice Pratt, chairperson, Ms Vicky McDwyer, director and Ms Sinead Morrissey, practice development facilitator.  Behind them are Mr. Michael McGlynn and Ms Fiona Kenny.  They are all welcome to today's meeting.  I apologise for the late start.  We had indicated that we would meet this morning.  We had representatives of the HSE and the State Claims Agency in and it went on much longer than we had predicted.  I thank the witnesses for waiting for us.  As a result we are tight for time and, therefore, I ask the witnesses to be as concise as possible with their opening statements.  They do not have to read it all.  The key points will be sufficient.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones or to put them on airplane mode.  Putting phones on silent is not enough because it will interfere with the recording system.  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times.  </p><p>I ask Mr. Tadhg Daly for a synopsis of his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.973" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018061400002#MM02900"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to appear.  The committee has received my opening statement and the associated appendices, so I do not propose to read it in its entirety in the interest of time.<br/><br/>As an organisation, Nursing Homes Ireland has previously provided this committee with evidence of gross inequity that has been applied by the State in the utilisation of the fair deal scheme budget.  We have had previous correspondence with the committee.  We also made a submission in March 2017.  The budget amounts to almost &euro;1 billion of health spending per annum.  The way the State spends that budget effectively means that HSE nursing homes are being paid fees that are, on average, 60% higher than those payable in respect of residents in the private and voluntary sector.  In some instances, the fees in respect of residents in HSE nursing homes are four times those provided for residents in the private and voluntary sector.  That is outlined in detail in appendix 1.  In excess of 70% of private and voluntary nursing homes are small family-run, owner-operated business with fewer than 60 beds.  Independent analysis provided to the Department of Health described the scheme as operating in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner, lacking rationale, consistency and fairness, only applying to the private sector and in the long run being unsustainable.</p><p>The NTPF is abusing its dominance as a monopoly purchaser, threatening the viability of the private and voluntary nursing home sector.  Last week, HIQA, the independent regulator, informed of the voluntary closure of five nursing homes during 2017 due to financial concerns.  Its report states: &quot;There are examples of certain smaller nursing homes &ndash; which provide a more homely environment &ndash; closing voluntarily due to concerns over the financial viability of running such services.&quot;<br/><br/>Private and voluntary nursing homes provide care in a home from home to more than 23,000 residents throughout the country.  Nursing homes are an essential part of our health service, providing care in the community in line with Government and cross-party support, as presented in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Four in ten applications for the fair deal scheme are from persons in acute hospitals.  Each year, almost 9,000 people, which is an average of 800 per month, avail of transitional care in private and voluntary nursing homes.  Without our sector, acute hospitals would grind to a halt.<br/><br/>HIQA's report last week stated, &quot;nursing home providers are committed to excellence and striving continuously to improve the quality of their services&quot;.  Furthermore, the regulator stated, &quot;inspectors met and spoke with many people who use services and found that they were well looked after by competent and caring staff&quot;.<br/><br/>Our members are tasked with providing care under the fair deal scheme for fees that are, on average, 60% less than those payable to HSE counterparts.  It is a fact that one third of the fair deal budget is allocated to State nursing homes that provide 20% of capacity.  The fees in respect of HSE nursing homes are not subject to independent scrutiny.  There is no negotiation process, no scrutiny of expenditure and no transparency, and there is long delayed and infrequent publication of those fees.<br/><br/>Another anomaly I bring to the attention of the committee is the myriad costs, including but not limited to capital costs and commercial rates, that are not included in the publicly published fees.  Appendix 2 contains the statutory instrument, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the commencement of the scheme.  The HSE, as administrator of the scheme, in effect pays the nursing homes under its control whatever fee it deems appropriate.<br/><br/>The most recent publication of HSE fees in February this year revealed the disparity in fees between HSE and private nursing homes has increased from 53% to 60%.  Over the 16 month period from October 2016 to February 2018, the fees in the HSE or State sector increased by an average of 11%.  Over the corresponding period, the increase in private and voluntary nursing homes was on average 3.9%.  Analysis of the most recent data informs the extent of this disparity.  Appendix 1 outlines the examples of County Westmeath, where the fee differential is 163%, County Laois where it is 122% and County Longford where it is 115%.<br/><br/>There has been some admission by the State that the cost of care in public nursing homes requires deeper analysis.  The review of the fair deal scheme, published in July 2015 and commissioned by the Department of Health, recommended a value for money review be undertaken by the Department with regard to public nursing home costs.  The review recommended actions and timelines to address any cost distorting factors that cannot be attributed to inherent differences between the public and the private sectors.  That was in 2015, more than three years ago.  Speaking to the committee in March last year, representatives of the HSE committed to the review being undertaken in 2017.  It remains outstanding.  In April 2018, the Minister for Health informed the D&aacute;il of the value for money analysis and stated the Department would work on the analysis throughout 2018.  We highlight that accountability and transparency remain outstanding with the continued delay of the value for money review.<br/><br/>The gross inequity in the funding of nursing home care is threatening the viability of the private sector and I mentioned the five nursing homes that closed last year.  The Department of Health's DKM Economic Consultants report, published in 2015, stated the fair deal pricing model &quot;operates in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner, lacks rationale, consistency and fairness, only applies to the private sector, and in the long run is unsustainable&quot;.  This is the pricing model set by the NTPF, whose representatives will appear before the committee after this session.  Of stark concern, the report warns: &quot;It is untenable that the State quality regulator can assess differentiated dependency levels and in doing so impose costs on nursing homes, while the State price regulator (NTPF) claims it is unable to reflect the same factor in its pricing decisions&quot;.<br/><br/>When the fair deal scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The review was published six years later, in 2015.  It pointed to the NTPF in its methodology used historical prices and, on many occasions, geographical location to set fees.  It stated there was a requirement for a review of the system to be undertaken within an 18 month period.  Thirty-three months on from this recommendation, and nine years after the introduction of the fair deal scheme, this pricing review of the scheme remains outstanding.  This is evidence of prevarication by the NTPF, inexcusable delays and a lack of transparency from what is, in essence, a public body.<br/><br/>To say our members are frustrated would be an understatement.  We reiterate our call for the publication by the NTPF and the Department of Health of the pricing review.  In Appendix 5 of our submission we have outlined what we argue are some pertinent questions the committee may consider appropriate for the NTPF in the afternoon session.  Our members are under sustained pressure to sustain services.  It is unsustainable and untenable that the State tasks private and voluntary nursing homes with providing this specialist care for such low fees, which are, on average, 60% below those applied by their HSE counterparts.  The inequity in the fair deal scheme is compounded by the fact there is no independent appeals process in the NTPF.  This effectively means the NTPF, acting on behalf of the State, can adopt a take it or leave it approach with regard to fees to provide care regardless of the consequences.<br/><br/>The fair deal scheme is explicit and definitive in defining the goods and services covered.  It explicitly excludes a range of services, therapies, specialised wheelchairs, transport and social activities that are essential to support the health, well-being and day-to-day living of nursing home residents.  In Appendix 3 of our submission we have included the extract from the NTPF deed of agreement which our members are required to sign to be party to the scheme.  Nursing homes are obliged to provide certain services that are explicitly outside the definition of long-term residential care services.  Accordingly, it is appropriate for nursing homes to charge for services provided that are outside the definition.  All charges for services excluded under the fair deal scheme are detailed in the contract for care and agreed with the individual resident on admission to the nursing home, as required by regulations.  The regulatory requirements stipulate registered providers must ensure that contracts of care are clear, unambiguous and contain full details of the services to be provided and any charges.  Our guiding principles as an organisation commit our members to clarity, openness and transparency with regard to all fees and charges.<br/><br/>It is also a fact that there is discriminatory or limited access to medical card services for residents in private and voluntary nursing homes.  When people cross the threshold of a private nursing home the services they would ordinarily hold on to in their community are no longer available.  This is discrimination of older people on the basis of where they reside, which is, in essence, their home.<br/><br/>The NTPF, as a monopoly purchaser, adopts a take it or leave it approach to negotiations.  The Department of Health review informed that pricing is set on historical and geographical determinants and, as I stated, there is no independent appeals process.  We acknowledge and respect the role fulfilled by the HSE in nursing home care and the dedicated staff in the public service.  However, very serious questions arise surrounding transparency, accountability and fair allocation of funds for the provision of care in HSE nursing homes.<br/><br/>That the Government committed to a review of the system for pricing is an acknowledgement that the current pricing system is not fit for purpose.  Appendix 4 of our submission sets out the terms of reference for the pricing review.  The committee will note that according to one of the terms of reference, the deadline for completion was 1 June 2017, which is more than one year ago.<br/><br/>The minutes of the meeting of the working group to oversee the recommendations confirm that Deloitte and Prospectus provided a draft pricing report to the Department in June 2017.  The minutes further confirm that the NTPF requested a revised draft to be produced, and confirm that the revised draft has been received by the NTPF and is being considered by it.  This draft report has not been published.  We are concerned about the delay in publishing the report.<br/><br/>The harsh reality is that the State wants to fund care for residents in the private and voluntary nursing home sector for fees that are significantly less than what it costs the State to provide such care.  Critically, policymakers need to ensure the system strikes a balance between value for money and acknowledging the costs and ensuring the sustainability of the private and voluntary sector.  While the private and voluntary sector is characterised by committed and resilient providers and staff, it is undoubtedly the case that failure to acknowledge the true cost of care threatens the sustainability of current provision.  Transparency must be applied to HSE expenditure.  We welcome the committee's examination of NTPF and wish it well with its work.</p></speech>

In effect, it sets its own fees irrespective of anything else.  Based on my statement, I argue that, given that a number of nursing homes closed last year and that the regulator has highlighted the fact that they have closed due to financial and viability concerns, the fee in the private sector is lowballed, which has serious implications for the sustainability and viability of the sector and for the continued growth required in the sector given the ageing population.  Quality will also be an issue.</p></speech>

They are quite vague and open to interpretation.  We have argued that there is a requirement for a model that recognises the true cost of care and the inputs that are required, recognising capital costs, the return on investment and all those elements.</p></speech>

At this stage, it is all maximum dependency because the fair deal scheme has a care needs assessment such that only those who are regarded as maximum dependency are accepted.  The average age is now almost 83.  The patients are older now and more dependent.  There are varying factors but it is a matter for each individual member to negotiate the fee that is pertinent to its operation.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund examines all accounts and records.  It has full visibility of the nursing homes' individual costs.</p></speech>

If I were a nursing home owner, I would have to determine the detailed criteria used by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, as a State purchaser, rather than just refer to historical fees that were set, as referred to in the fair deal review, or, indeed, county averages.  The former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, is on the record of the House as outlining that the idea of a county average bears no relevance either to the cost of providing such a service or the standard of care.</p></speech>

If one is in a public nursing home, for example, there might not be charges for social activities and social programmes so it raises the question as to where the budget comes from.  If one is in the private sector, however, one will have to pay for those services, despite the fact that there is one statutory scheme with the same rules for everybody.

The contribution would come from that or it may come from families who would contribute.  It would be with the agreement of the resident.  It would be outlined in the contract for care, as required by the regulations.  It is clear and transparent.  Many members advocate on behalf of residents to try to increase the provision but if it is not forthcoming it might be that the person would have to pay over and above what would be regarded as the standard.</p></speech>

Based on feedback from our members, we argue that it is done on a take it or leave it basis.  I am sure that members of this committee and other Deputies will have received representations on this model.  Existing nursing homes have a deed of agreement that runs for a defined period, perhaps one, two or three years, at which point it comes up for renegotiation.  In the case of a new nursing home, it would have to contact the NTPF and enter negotiations.  It highlights what we see as a lack of sophistication in the model.  Sometimes it is based on the average county rate, irrespective of the service provided.</p></speech>

The private and voluntary sector is clearly providing that.  Our concern relates to the residents.  If we keep putting pressure on fees, it will have an impact on the viability and sustainability of services, and on standards.  As I noted in my opening statement, the State knows what it costs to provide 24-7 residential care, because it pays that in its own facilities, but then it tries to pay up to 60% less in the private and voluntary sector.  There is a benchmark, which is what the State is paying its own facilities.</p></speech>

According to HIQA reports, the standard of building and physical environment in the private sector is better than many in the State sector.  Dependency levels is a line thrown out from time to time but in effect there is a care and needs assessment.  All those who are assessed as requiring residential care are assessed by the HSE.  The Dementia Services Information and Development Centre highlighted that the HSE was much more restrictive in its admission policy regarding residents who are not independently mobile.</p></speech>

Sometimes older buildings are more costly because they are not purpose-built.  It might require additional staff to move people around and so on, and there can be historical costs such as pensions.  Has Nursing Homes Ireland conducted an analysis or does it have the documentation to demonstrate that it is a like for like cost?</p></speech>

The value for money review is being undertaken because the State is concerned that HSE costs are spiralling out of control.  In a 16-month period, between October 2016 and February 2018, there was an 11% increase.  I have provided the members with the figures.  They can see that it would be an understatement to say that the differential is significant.  That is why the value for money review is important to get a handle on what the costs are and to verify their legitimacy.</p></speech>

The fact that is provided for in the terms of reference is an acknowledgement that there is a lack of transparency in the current model.  The other two terms we would highlight are  No. 6, which highlights that particular consideration should be given to an independent appeals mechanism, which is currently absent, and No. 7, which referred to the appropriateness or otherwise of a system where it can be proofed against inflation in relevant areas of cost for a number of years.</p></speech>

In that case, there should be an independent appeal, having exhausted internal mechanisms.  We do not suggest that everybody should go to independent appeal at the first hurdle.  Rather, there would be an internal process and, all things being equal, when negotiations break down, it would go to external appeal.</p></speech>

That is the point I was making in my opening statement.  Under the regulations, nursing homes are obliged to provide a range of activities and services for residents to ensure their quality of life.  However, these matters are expressly excluded under the fair deal scheme.  That is the disconnect.  On the one hand, an arm of the State has sets standards, with which we agree and support, for the provision of a range of facilities and services, while, on the other, a different arm of the State has not included these matters in the fair deal scheme.  That is where the element of charges arises.</p></speech>

The nursing home sector is important.  As Mr. Daly stated, hospitals would effectively grind to a halt if the sector did not operate efficiently.  When one considers that 30,000 people call one of the 458 private or voluntary facilities or the 122 public facilities home, it crystalises how important the sector is.</p> <p>  That 79% of facilities are private makes the points the witnesses have articulated for us all the more important in how we tease out the funding mechanisms.  In the HSE's 2016 accounts some &euro;900 million was allocated for nursing home support schemes.  From a public expenditure point of view, the Comptroller and Auditor General would be interested in examining how that nearly &euro;1 billion was spent and, if there were significant disparities in the funding models, determining how to go about addressing them.  The facts outlined by the witnesses speak for themselves and show the major disparities.  Under the fair deal scheme, a private provider has an average spend of &euro;35,000 versus an average spend of &euro;71,000 in the public sphere.</p> <p>  Deputy Marc MacSharry touched on the issue of geography.  The methodology is similar to that used to fund local authorities.  It is difficult to work out from the graph on screen.  The Deputy used the example of Dublin versus Sligo and cited land costs.  In my county of Meath there is an average weekly cost of &euro;1,600 in the public sector versus &euro;2,200 in the adjoining county of Westmeath, which is difficult to understand.</p> <p>  Mr. Daly touched on the type of care provided.  According to his opening statement, many people with dementia were refused admission to HSE-operated facilities because they were "not independently mobile".  If those with the most pressing and complex needs find themselves in private nursing homes and public homes are being funded to the tune of twice what private providers are receiving, how does it impact on the quality of care provision by and the resources available to private providers?  I am interested in hearing his views on how such homes are even surviving.</p></speech>

In essence, it is why we are before the committee.  Recently, we engaged with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and met some of his officials who were undertaking an examination of the scheme.  The Deputy referenced my opening statement.  It was not us saying it-----</p></speech>

It also states, curiously, that HSE facilities which receive the highest payments because they are said to be accommodating those with the highest needs are more restrictive.  We see this on an ongoing basis.  Likewise, the review of the fair deal scheme's pricing methodology referred to this approach lacking logic, being ad hoc and only applying to the private sector.  When it was introduced in 2009, the aim of the fair deal scheme was to ensure equity and fairness for all residents and providers.  Instead, the disparity with what the HSE pays for its own facilities has grown since.  It is putting significant pressure on our sustainability.  This has been verified independently by HIQA which has outlined that five nursing homes closed voluntarily in 2017.</p></speech>

It would not be in anyone's interests, particularly given that we have an ageing population, but it is the reality and what I am hearing every day from our members who are literally living hand to mouth in trying to keep their businesses afloat.  More than 70% are small family-run businesses.  I argue that many providers are probably not remunerating themselves appropriately for their work.  Family members may be helping out in many cases.  That is the reality on the ground for a 24/7 business.</p> <p>  On quality, HIQA's previous report pointed out that providers were striving continuously to improve their services.  However, if we continue to exert downward pressure on fees, it will have a serious impact on the sustainability of services and quality.</p></speech>

He outlined how it is explicit in what it provides, namely, basic care, bed and board, bedding and laundry but it does not include such basic things as newspapers, hairdressing, activities and transport.  This is an issue I raised with the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall when he was before the Committee on Public Petitions two weeks ago.  He was talking about dealing with complaints from nursing homes and he touched on this specific issue because he said it was leading to the impoverishment of our elderly.  He said that he saw situations where grandchildren were coming into nursing homes with more money in their pockets than the grandparents they were visiting and that was leading to an eroding of the autonomy of these people.  He was looking at a case where they had maybe &euro;7 per week to live on.  I raised this with the Taoiseach on Tuesday and again he was kicking to touch saying that Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, was looking at it and so on.  I ask Mr. Daly to comment on that in terms of the contract for care and what needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

When the scheme was launched in 2009, as an organisation we sought leave for judicial review of the scheme on the basis of the definition of long-term residential care services.  We were very concerned at the narrow definition of long-term residential care services and the fact that it explicitly excluded many of the services that would be regarded as being included in such a scheme.  We concur with the Ombudsman's concern around the fact that on the one hand a resident pays 80% of his or her income and then on the other hand he or she is told that it does not cover everything because the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, under section 40 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, has defined a long-term residential care service.  That is why we have included that in appendix three to show the committee exactly what is included and excluded.</p></speech>

If there is a situation where the Ombudsman is coming into a committee and saying that it is leading to the impoverishment of our elderly people and that their grandchildren have more money in their pockets than they do, it is not a case that they are living.  They are just seeing out their time; it is like a jail sentence.  I agree that it has to be addressed.</p> <p>  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for his view on the huge amount of public money that is being put into this sector and how we can look at a situation where care is being provided on the private side and is complying with Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards at an average spend of &euro;35,000 and yet double the amount of money is being spent in the public side.

I will start with the pricing review.  Mr. Daly said it has been overdue for two or three years.  Who is holding up the pricing review and who is involved?  What role do the NTPF, the HSE, the Minister and the Department of Health play?  Among all four of those, who decides on what will happen in the future?  Why is it being held up?  What does Mr. Daly think the reason is that the review is not taking place sooner rather than later?</p></speech>

As I understand it, the minutes that have been released under freedom of information confirm that Deloitte and Prospectus submitted their piece on time.  In essence that is a question for the NTPF which will be in this afternoon because we are concerned at the delay and prevarication around publishing that review.</p></speech>

The Health Act 2007 and subsequently the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 are set by the Department of Health and the Minister and ratified by the Oireachtas, so that is that element of it.  The HSE is the administrator of the scheme so it administers the budget on an annual basis and the NTPF has a role which is confined to negotiating with the private sector.</p></speech>

They are only caring for 20% of residents.  That means that 80% are in voluntary and private nursing homes.  That is very unfair and the figures Mr. Daly is throwing out do not sound right to me.  One third of all the money that is being spent is going towards 20% of the care.  That means two thirds is going to 80% of the care.  Straight away there is something wrong and there are questions marks over that.  In my own county of Kilkenny, there is one nursing home and eight voluntary and private homes.  I get representation on a continuous basis from the private nursing homes in my area, which is natural being a local politician.  The voluntary sector has to fundraise.  I know that because there are one or two of them very near to me.  I give towards the fundraising as well because it is just to keep the doors open.  This sounds very wrong.  One nursing home in Kilkenny costs &euro;1,596 per week while in the voluntary and private sectors, it costs &euro;901 per week.  That is almost &euro;600 of a difference, or 77%, according to the chart in front of us.  That is massive money.  I want to keep all the services open because they are all needed but that shows there is an awful anomaly between the public, private and voluntary spheres.</p></speech>

I know that private nursing homes are under pressure.  When I am out canvassing, I go into them and I am told they are trying to keep the doors open and provide a service but it is getting harder.  It tells its own story.</p> <p>  How does Mr. Daly think the fair deal scheme is working?  It was a good idea when it was introduced by the then Minister for Health, Mary Harney, and everyone was delighted with it.  How does he think it is working now from his perspective and the perspective of private nursing home providers?</p></speech>

From the residents' point of view the fair deal scheme is a good one as there is certainty around the availability of nursing home care and it means that people know in advance how much they have to contribute themselves based on their income and their assets.</p><p>From the point of view of operators and representative bodies, the pricing element is deeply flawed.  The pricing review committed to dealing with and addressing that, but the delay in that regard is having a negative and very severe impact.  As Deputy Aylward stated, it is becoming more difficult for people to keep the doors open because of the cost of operating, the dependency level of older people, the cost and complexity of care, the cost of regulation and commercial rates.  Costs are only going one way while our members are trying to maintain value for money, to use Deputy Connolly's phrase.  There comes a tipping point, however, at which operators will no longer be able to sustain viable services.</p></speech>

Last year, we raised with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and other farmer representative bodies the issue of discrepancies which mitigate against agriculture and probably private business as well.  I refer to the cap of three years or 7.5% on individuals which does not apply to members of the farming community.  I would like to ascertain where Mr. Daly stands on that issue as a private supplier before I raise it with the next grouping to come before the committee.</p></speech>

We have engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and understand that an amendment to remove that provision, which the farming community regard as unfair, is with the Office of the Attorney General.  That is a matter for Deputies and policymakers.  I suggest that the definition of long-term residential care services, as mentioned by Deputy Cassells, should also be considered when amendments are being made to the scheme.</p></speech>

He mentioned medical cards.  Is he of the view that people lose their medical cards when they go into private nursing homes?  I did not understand the point he made in his statement in that regard.  If a person is entitled to a medical card and goes into a private nursing home, he or she does not lose the entitlement to that medical card.  What point was Mr. Daly making in regard to medical cards?</p></speech>

For example, the provision of occupational therapy or physiotherapy to a person in the community is given a higher priority.  In regard to persons in a nursing home, we have letters on file from the HSE stating that it does not provide services-----</p></speech>

Our longer opening statement references a report published several years ago by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the provision of such services.

To be fair, the HSE undertook a quality and patient safety audit a number of years ago which also highlighted that in some respects there was a postcode lottery.  It is back to funding.

The issue is more about access to allied health services.  I can revert to the committee and provide it with information and documentation in regard to physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and specialised wheelchairs, for example, to which a person would ordinarily be entitled but which are more difficult to procure when the person is in residential care.</p></speech>

Old-age pensioners pay approximately 80% of their pension towards contracts for care.  One may read in newspapers of issues regarding the 20% remaining being taken for extra services such as hairdressing.  I am not making any accusations but there are question marks in regard to how that money is being used.  The patients are old and some are senile.  Who takes care of how that 20% is spent and what money is left over?  Patients depend on someone within the system to look after that 20% of their money and to ensure that the services for which they are paying are being provided.  I received a phone call from a journalist prior to the witnesses' appearance before the committee in regard to the misappropriation of moneys in some institutions such as those represented by Mr. Daly.  I do not mean for my use of "misappropriation" to be taken up wrongly.  I ask Mr. Daly to comment on obtaining value for money for the 20% that is left and how the money and the extras are dealt with.</p></speech>

It is their money and they choose how to spend it.  If they reside in a nursing home, a contract is agreed with the resident or their representative which sets out the fees based on the individualised care plan about which I spoke earlier, in terms of their will and preferences and requirements.  It is all transparent and up front, but it is ultimately a feature of the scheme because the scheme excludes those services.</p></speech>

If there are moneys left over for savings, such as in the case of a person who wishes to save &euro;20 per week, possibly towards burial costs, who oversees that and ensures it is being done and carried out properly and in accordance with the wishes of the patient, in particular those who do not have family members?  If a resident has family members, the situation is different because the family members will visit the nursing home regularly and ensure the money is being spent correctly.  If a resident has no family members, however, it is up to the nursing home to ensure that.  I am seeking a general opinion on that issue.</p></speech>

We are concerned about what we see as a take it or leave it approach.  We are also concerned about the prevarication in publishing what, in essence, are terms of reference set by the Minister for Health and his Department.  The delay in publishing the review is a source of serious concern.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily about profit <i>per se</i>, but people make a profit.  I do not think it is a dirty word, but it is important that the service being provided be sustainable.  In the Deputy's own words, 80% of the service is being provided by the private sector.  It is a key feature of the regulatory environment.  In essence, all of our members provide a home from home for 50 or 60 people.  We want to ensure the sustainability of that service.</p></speech>

I looked at the Health Service Executive arguments, which claimed there was a high level of dependency for various reasons in the public nursing homes which was one of many reasons that led to higher prices.  Another was that its public nursing homes function in a different way.  For example, the public nursing home in Carraroe has other functions.  It runs a day centre in Carraroe and has many other functions in the community which a private for-profit nursing home would not have.  That was another issue raised by the HSE among other issues that lead to higher costs.</p></speech>

There is one scheme which is a statutory scheme set out by the Oireachtas which is supposed to provide equity for the residents and for the providers of care.  However, in effect, there is a much higher remuneration or fee payment to the public nursing homes than in the private and voluntary nursing homes.</p></speech>

I made the point in my opening statement that from October 2016 to February 2018 the cost of care in the public system had increased by 11%, cognisant of increased salaries, increased wages and increased costs of operations, whereas the corresponding increase provided by the NTPF on average was 3.9% in the private sector.</p></speech>

The word "boycott" was used in every publication.  Three or four newspapers published the article.  Mr. Daly was at the meeting.  He was asked a question earlier by Teachta Connolly.  He said he did not use the word "boycott".  However, he was not asked whether he used it.  He was asked whether the word "boycott" was used at the meeting.

However, he cannot come in and try to pull the wool over people's eyes.  If he wants to not answer questions, that is entirely his prerogative.  However, in not answering questions and not being upfront, in my view, it causes concern for me.  He knows perfectly well he was not asked whether he used the word "boycott" personally.  He was asked whether somebody at the meeting used the word "boycott".</p></speech>

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission would be investigating whether something actually happened.  What is in the public domain that we know about from the leaked documents was that it did not happen because there was strong legal advice at the meeting that the organisation needed to stop there.  One of the lines in it was that the discussion could give rise to a dawn raid by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and its members.  Obviously the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was not able find any adverse findings against Nursing Homes Ireland because it did not happen, but that does not mean there was not discussion on it.  I have gone through all the articles in all the media coverage.  There is no doubt that the legal opinion given at the meeting was that there was serious concern about being in breach of competition rules because of some of the language that was being used and the direction in which the meeting was going.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

The matter is only closed when everybody says it is closed.  It might be closed for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, but it was not closed for the Committee of Public Accounts which dealt with this in the past.  We have said we might come back to it.  Therefore from our perspective it is not closed because Mr. Daly is not answering the questions today.  He is perfectly entitled not to answer them, but he is not answering them.  Therefore we do not know to this day whether the word "boycott" was used, other than what we see in the public domain in the media, where the leaked documents indicate it was.</p><p>Mr. Daly is saying that he did not say it, but he cannot say whether he heard it.

This was a meeting that was discussing pricing.  The word "boycott" was used, or at least that is what we were told.  I refer to Mr. Paul Rochford.  The media reports that the threat of not taking in new admissions from the acute hospitals is a potentially very powerful lobbying tool, that as a lobbying group the biggest threat Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, and its members have is ceasing admissions and new beds.  The word "boycott" was used and the word "lobbying" was used several times.  Legal figures advised against going down this route and that it could give rise to a dawn raid by the CCPC.  Given that he was chair of HIQA, for Mr. McEnery to be at a meeting where the discussion was going that way was problematic for Mr. Daly.</p> <p>  I will finish on this, because I will not get any response from Mr. Daly.  Mr. Daly has raised more concerns for the Committee of Public Accounts today than he has dealt with questions.  I note instances where a witness appears before the committee, even in a voluntary capacity, and they do not answer questions.  There is a very real public interest in this issue.  The content of this meeting has been reported in the media several times, and Mr. Daly had an opportunity today to clear up some issues.  He could have said that the word "boycott" was not used, if indeed it was not.  That would have cleared that up.  However, he is not in a position to do so, which I think speaks volumes.  I think we will have to come back to it at some point.</p></speech>

As part of this meeting, we will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund on its 2016 financial statements and matters related to the fair deal scheme.  Earlier we heard from Nursing Homes Ireland, and the matters it raised may form part of our discussion.  We are joined from the National Treatment Purchase Fund by Mr. John Horan, chairman, Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive, Mr. Se&aacute;n Flood, finance director, and Ms Liz Lottering, audit, quality and research director.  From the HSE we are joined by Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, assistant national director for older people and palliative care, and Ms Deborah Jacob from the finance division.  They are all very welcome to today's meeting.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect witnesses to answer clearly and with candour questions put to them by the committee, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>Deputy Connolly has indicated as the lead speaker.  Then we will proceed with the other slots.</p><p>I apologise in advance that I have a commitment and I must leave in a moment.  Mr. Horan will make the opening statement.  He might summarise it as best he can because of the late hour.  Before he does so, I will ask him two questions, on which he can come back in writing to the committee.  I am not going to take up the committee's time.  I refer first to the waiting list initiative, which is detailed on page 16 of the NTPF's accounts.  The NTPF has done a lot of work on orthopaedics, ear, nose and throat, ENT, general surgery, and the waiting list initiative.  I ask the witnesses to come back and tell us how much of this was done in private hospitals.  I understand that in the past some of it could be done in public hospitals.  I ask the witnesses to give us the breakdown of this, the details of the waiting lists for these people and, to the extent that the witnesses can, because I know an average is only an average, the average cost of the treatments under orthopaedics, whether a hip, a knee or anything else, and the average cost for ENT and ophthalmic procedures on cataracts.  We all know awfully old people who come to our clinics and who have no quality of life.  I am sure the procedure only costs a grand or two.  I do not know the figures.  The witnesses need not provide the figures now, but I ask them to give us a full breakdown of how that money is spent.  There is a crying demand from people who have been on waiting lists for a long time for some detailed information on this.  The witnesses can get us the full breakdown in their own time and as soon as practical.  We would appreciate that.  If we have any further requests for information after we receive that reply, we can come back to the witnesses in writing at that stage.</p><p>Mr. Fitzgerald, who is the assistant national director for older people and palliative care, might send me, as Chairman, or the secretariat a detailed report on where we are in respect of Abbeyleix District Hospital.  He has been in contact with the people there.  A decision was announced years ago to close the hospital.  This has not happened, it is still there, and I hope the facility can be kept in public use long into the future.  All I am asking Mr. Fitzgerald is to send a detailed note by way of up-do-date information to me.</p><p>I am looking for Deputy Aylward, who was due to take over from me.  Will Deputy MacSharry take over for just two minutes until Deputy Aylward comes back?  I have to leave now.</p></speech>

The National Treatment Purchase Fund, often referred to as the NTPF, was established in April 2004.  The NTPF board is an independent body operating under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The board's financial statements before the committee in this session relate to the financial year 2016.  The audit of the board's 2017 financial statements is scheduled to commence in July of this year.</p> <p>  The role and focus of the NTPF has evolved over time, reflecting changes in policy and available funding.  The original remit of the NTPF required it to make arrangements for the provision of hospital treatment, either within or outside the State, for patients on long-term waiting lists and to collect and validate information about patients waiting for public hospital treatment.</p> <p>  In 2009, the NTPF acquired responsibility for negotiating and agreeing payment rates with private and voluntary nursing homes for the provision of residential home care for older people being supported under the fair deal scheme.  Responsibility for the administration of the fair deal scheme rests with the HSE.</p> <p>  In 2012, the NTPF moved away substantially from the direct commissioning of patient treatment and put more focus on data and analytics, pricing, and audit and quality assurance.  The board reduced its staffing levels to reflect its changing role and the reduction in annual budgets.  In 2015 and 2016, the NTPF provided administrative support to the HSE by disbursing payments to private hospitals providing patient treatment for the longest-waiting public patients.</p> <p>  In 2016, the NTPF received funding of almost &euro;29 million to pay for patient care and &euro;5.1 million for its other activities.  The NTPF reported an operating deficit of around &euro;320,000 for the year.</p> <p>  The graph now being shown to members profiles the changes in the National Treatment Purchase Fund's spend over the years 2012 to 2016.  Patient care expenditure accounted for around 89% of the NTPF's expenditure in 2016.  The balance, 11%, related to administration expenses.</p> <p>  The primary focus of the patient care expenditure in 2016 related to the provision of treatment in orthopaedic cases, at around 43%; ear, nose and throat cases, 14%; and general surgery cases, 12%.  The balance, 31%, covered a range of treatments.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the NTPF's financial statements for 2016.  The report draws attention, however, to the NTPF's accounting treatment of staff pension benefits.  The legislation establishing the NTPF gives the Minister for Health the authority to set the accounting framework for the board.  In doing so, the Minister directed that pension benefits should be accounted for as they are paid, rather than as liabilities accrue, which is what generally accepted accounting practice requires.  As I have explained previously to the committee, this accounting treatment for pensions is common to a number of health bodies.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce to the committee my colleagues: Mr. Liam Sloyan, who took up the position of chief executive of the organisation on 4 May 2017, Ms Liz Lottering, who is our director of audit, quality and research, and Mr. Se&aacute;n Flood, who has recently been appointed as the organisation's director of finance.  As I have said, Mr. Liam Sloyan was only appointed to the position of chief executive in the course of 2017.  Similarly, the director of finance has only recently taken up his position.  Therefore, neither of them was in office during the accounting year 2016, but between all of us, we will be pleased to deal with any queries committee members may have about the financial statements for that year.</p> <p>  We have provided committee members with some background material.  Rather than go through this in detail, I propose, by way of this opening statement, to deal briefly with some aspects of the matters.  In the interests of good timekeeping and given the late hour, I propose not to cover all the material supplied to the committee in the written version of this opening statement, the Acting Chairman might be glad to hear.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-14a.1361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018061400002#XX00200"><p>The members have it in writing and can refer to the hard copy if they wish.</p> <p>  I am pleased to be in a position to report that since its inception the National Treatment Purchase Fund has carried out some great work in delivering faster treatment to hundreds of thousands of patients in the public healthcare system.  While not wishing to delve too much into the history of the organisation it is worth noting that in its first decade as an independent agency, the NTPF succeeded in reducing inpatient waiting times for public patients from their original levels of two to five years - depending on the category - down to an average waiting time of 2.5 months.  This was achieved through the direct commissioning of patient-level treatment for public patients by the NTPF - mostly in private hospitals.</p> <p>  In 2012 the Government assigned additional responsibilities to the NTPF and effectively signalled the end of the organisation&rsquo;s direct patient treatment commissioning role.  It also reflected a major resulting change in the operational framework of the NTPF, as this commissioning work had represented a significant part of the activity of the NTPF since its inception, as we have seen in the presentation by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The result was that the organisation re-focused its efforts on areas such as data and analytics, audit and quality assurance and its role in respect of the nursing home support scheme, which was referred to earlier.  Through these, the organisation continued to provide valuable support services to the broader healthcare system at a time when it was undergoing significant change and reform.</p> <p>  In 2014 a new NTPF board was appointed, one of the first selected under the Public Appointments Service process.  This board has a wide range of skills covering areas such as medical, legal, accounting, IT, procurement, personnel and general management.  While continuing to oversee the ongoing operations of the organisation, at that time this board applied itself particularly to the task of preparing the organisation through the development of a detailed strategy and action plan, all aimed at supporting performance improvement for the faster treatment of patients.  The outcome of this work meant that the NTPF was well placed to support the commitments contained in A Programme for a Partnership Government of 2016 in the specific funding allocated to the organisation to reduce waiting lists in 2017 and 2018.</p> <p>  On foot of the decision of the then Minister for Health in 2016 to re-establish the individual patient-level commissioning role of the NTPF and, importantly, with the allocation of the enabling funding, the organisation is particularly well placed now to make an increased positive and valuable contribution again towards shorter waiting times for patients.  I say this with confidence based on the organisation's proven track record of having done so in the past.  It is also based on what has been achieved more recently - in the past 12 months.  The outline of the organisation's objectives is contained in my written statement, which has been provided to the committee.</p> <p>  In order to deliver on the requirements placed on the organisation under the programme for Government 2016 the NTPF budget was increased to &euro;20 million last year, with a further &euro;55 million committed for the current year.  I am pleased to report that we have successfully resumed commissioning of patient treatment and that detailed arrangements are in place with private hospitals for this work.  An in-sourcing initiative was also undertaken to treat patients in public hospitals for specific procedures and treatments.  Through this process - and using &euro;5 million of the &euro;15 million allocated to us for patient treatment work in 2017 - day-case patients were brought into the system and more were then placed on treatment pathways in private hospitals.  A further tranche of funding was then committed to an in-sourcing initiative under which up to &euro;5 million was provided for treating patients in public hospitals.  In the second half of 2017 a third phase of spending was decided upon based on our experience with the first two private and public elements.</p> <p>  A specific target was that the active inpatient and day-case waiting list numbers would be less than 9,153.  At the end of October the number was down to 7,282.  We aimed to remove 7,000 patients from this list through acceptance of offers of treatment funded by the NTPF and a total of 8,192 people were removed from the list.  It was proposed that 700 of the longest-waiting patients would be treated from the gastrointestinal scope waiting list and as a result of our initiative, 1,382 patients were removed.  These are just figures but in human terms each one of these patients, and their families, have had their pain and suffering dealt with at an earlier date and have been enabled to get on with their lives.</p> <p>  Importantly, from the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, the NTPF can identify each patient and the precise treatment that he or she received.  We can assure this committee that value for money was achieved and that despite the funding allocation being small in the context of the overall spend on health, a real impact was made.  Our decisions on the specific uses for the current year's funding allocation of &euro;50 million for patient treatment were informed by our experiences with last year's approach.  By the end of this year, the organisation will have arranged treatment for a further 20,000 inpatient and day-case patients.  NTPF-funded treatment is being provided in private hospitals or in public hospitals where there is available capacity.  The focus will be on those waiting longest, for around 50 different procedures.</p> <p>  To date, in 2018, the NTPF has made arrangements for almost 9,000 inpatient and day-case patients and this has contributed to the number on the inpatient and day-case waiting list, reducing by a further 3,000 in the first five months of 2018, despite the challenges posed earlier in the year by Storm Emma.  The number on this waiting list is currently 7,500 lower than at its peak ten months ago, a reduction of 9% on the list.</p> <p>  Earlier, I mentioned the nursing home support scheme - the fair deal scheme - which was established in 2009.  The NTPF was given a specific key role on the pricing of long-term residential care.  Given the significant sums of public moneys, of the order of &euro;1 billion, being allocated to this scheme, this matter will be of particular interest to the members of this committee.  While the NTPF&rsquo;s role is very precisely defined and quite limited, through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act the organisation was given a vitally important task for the users of the system and for national finances.  Specifically, the NTPF is mandated by statute to negotiate with nursing home proprietors for the purposes of reaching an agreement as to the maximum amount that will be charged for the provision of specified long-term residential care services.  I am happy to be able to record that the NTPF has delivered consistently on this mandate over the past eight years.  The organisation has done this by setting up the system of agreeing prices, which had not existed previously, by successfully negotiating and agreeing prices with approximately 430 nursing homes and by renegotiating and updating these prices on a fully negotiated basis with each nursing home over the years of the operation of the scheme.  By the end of April 2018, more than 430 nursing homes had pricing contracts with the NTPF and the average price of long-term residential care paid to these nursing homes amounted to &euro;955 per resident per week.</p> <p>  Another key figure is that these nursing homes are providing care to 17,500 fair deal residents.  On behalf of the organisation, I assure members of this committee that the NTPF will continue its work to ensure that value is achieved for the taxpayer and that the substantial funds being made available to the fair deal scheme are maximised for the benefit of those assessed as being in need of long-term residential care.</p> <p>  The review of the nursing home support scheme has been discussed with the other group.  Any proposals to amend a successful system benefitting the 17,500 residents and involving State expenditure of close to &euro;900 million should be very carefully scrutinised and considered.  The NTPF is currently working in the first instance with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform in a review to ensure that viable and effective systems continue to be provided for both providers and users of long-term residential care nationwide.  I assure the committee that the NTPF has undertaken this task with all the due diligence that would be expected of us.  Our overriding concern throughout the process has been to provide the best possible inputs to the steering group, which includes the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This group will, in turn, bring its proposals to a broader working group that will include officials from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  When the review was initiated by the Department of Health, it was recognised by it that the NTPF would require professional and independent costing and other technical and relevant expertise to inform our review of pricing.  We have been working with Deloitte on this and it has consulted a wide range of stakeholders and interested parties.  Their work is close to completion and these matters will be considered by the steering group in the near future.</p> <p>  The remainder of my written statement contains information on the NTPF annual accounts, which are a matter of record and I am sure we can get into in more detail on those later.  As the chairman of the NTPF board, I wish to reassure members that our objective is to ensure the National Treatment Purchase Fund continues to be well directed and managed in accordance with all appropriate governance requirements.  We have a cohort of skilled board members, a committed executive team and employees giving us a base of significant experience and skills.  Our aim is to ensure that all of the functions allocated to us by Government are carried out effectively and efficiently and that we will continue to be in a position to demonstrate that all funding voted to the organisation is being spent as intended to reduce waiting times for patients in the public healthcare system.  I thank the Acting Chairman and members of the committee.  The members of the executive and I will gladly take any questions members may have. </p></speech>

People who have a requirement for long-stay care are assessed through the needs assessment process.  Although they would have long-stay care needs, there are different levels of dependency.

This was borne out and mentioned specifically in the review of fair deal back in 2015.  That was the assessment at that stage.  Dependency is a huge gamut, really, and it will have a variety of things with different personal needs and requirements.  I think there would be different issues there for people with dementia at different levels and indeed for people with different levels of physical need.  My comment from a HSE perspective is that we would still contend that in general the HSE will be able to provide the care for people at higher levels of dependency for a very simple fact that the model of staffing the HSE has is significantly higher in nursing than would be the case in the private nursing homes.</p></speech>

I feel that over the years private nursing home capacity increased significantly while public capacity significantly fell.  Again with good reason because with the introduction of the residential standards in 2009 and even before then, many of the buildings and residences themselves in public nursing homes were of poor quality and had high levels of occupancy, particularly in bedrooms.  We had to reduce our bed stock.</p></speech>

I saw St. Francis's home.  The Chairman is gone but he has fought a battle for Abbeyleix at the same time.  In the week it was close, the HSE made an announcement that there were not enough public beds, which was particularly difficult to accept at the time.</p> <p>  What is the proper balance?  What is the policy that the HSE has been given by the Government?</p></speech>

Our view is and any discussions I have had indicate that it relates to perhaps having no less than 20% if at all possible.  From a HSE perspective, we would say that holding a percentage of that level and nature would be important because the HSE is also obliged that in the event of a nursing home failing, closing or something catastrophic happening in terms of the residents, the HSE has to step in to provide services.</p></speech>

The National Treatment Purchase Fund was set up as a temporary measure but has become an institution and is still in place.  That is not a reflection on the witnesses.  It was set up by Government to reduce waiting lists.  I note Galway is distinguished by being one of the worst in the region, with massive waiting lists for inpatients and outpatients.</p> <p>  The opening statement mentioned procuring public beds in public hospitals under the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the mind boggles at this.  Its role is now to pay for public beds in a private manner in a public hospital.  The witnesses will see my cynicism here.  Two operating theatres closed in Merlin Park, which was nothing to do with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, but in the course of a solution a number of beds closed in St. Finbar's ward, a brand new state-of-the-art orthopaedic ward in Galway.  Are the witnesses aware that beds and wards are closed in public hospitals?  Are they aware that, in a centre of excellence in a brand new ward, beds were empty, though not the whole ward?</p></speech>

The Deputy said it was a temporary measure.  We did a lot of good work in the first decade but our mandate changed quite significantly in 2012 and we adjusted to the new circumstances to provide a strong measure of support to the health service, which was being reformed.</p> <p>  I smile to myself a little at the question on public money in public hospitals.  An ideological criticism has been made of us that we are giving public money to the private sector, that is, private hospitals and private nursing homes, so we decided to test the system last year to see if we could get value for money within the public hospital system.  There may be a blockage in some areas while there is capacity elsewhere and we try very hard to utilise that capacity.</p></speech>

I am getting to a point here, if I could, Deputy.  The bed numbers are growing, the number of nursing homes has bee fairly static over the past three or four years.  It has hardly changed.  The average contract term has gone up from 19 months, about three years ago, and it is now coming in at 30 months.  Private nursing homes are voluntarily sitting down to individually negotiate deals with the NTPF for the prices that will be paid under the fair deal scheme - taxpayers' money.  So, more beds are being committed and the term that the people are willing to commit to is being extended.  The whole thing adds up to a very large sum for the State's Exchequer so I would be very reluctant to say: "Let's have a new system."</p></speech>

They are the four elements.</p></speech>

How can I reconcile someone paying &euro;950 a week versus &euro;1,400 a week?  I am just taking advantage of the fact that there are experts in the room.  I must ask about this matter because that is part of my role.  Therefore, I am interested in hearing an explanation from the experts present.  How can someone be charged &euro;950 a week versus &euro;1,400 a week?  The position of the HSE is that it has a lot more high-dependency demands than the private sector.  Is there any reason that the price cannot be &euro;950 on the public side as well?  I am sure that there is a level of dependency in private nursing homes.</p></speech>

The nursing homes who participate in it and the residents who have signed up for it have done so willingly.  It has brought a degree of certainty to an area that was causing a lot of concern for elderly people and their families.  It has given them a degree of security that they did not have previously.  It has been a great success from that perspective.</p></speech>

Board members are obliged to let us know about any connections they have with any companies with which we deal or discuss at meetings.

I do not know how patients manage it.  I certainly could not manage if I was told at six in the morning that I could only use the loo three times a day.  However, charges were applied to patients for all continence wear for a period.  There were protracted efforts for that money to be returned to them, some of whom had disabilities.

They may not be legal cases but there are a number of cases of protracted correspondence with families of residents who are seeking to have money returned to them that was taken by the institution for continence wear.</p></speech>

I understand that recently there were some issues with regard to a new incontinence contract arrangement that was rolled out by my colleagues in primary care and which had some negative effects around the countryside with regard to supply, etc.  I have not heard of specific instances of charging for additional continence wear.  My remit very much covers older persons services and the nursing homes support scheme itself.  This service is separate from the scheme but I can come back to the Deputy in this regard having consulted my colleagues in disability services.</p></speech>

I am not aware of three pads per day.  Continence wear is provided to people with medical cards where there is a requirement for it.  I presume that in any of those contractual arrangements, when we went to procurement, we had professional people around the table indicating requirements.  If it is three, it is three; I will argue with Nursing Homes Ireland on that.  I will come back to the committee as it is not my field.</p></speech>

I want to ask a few quick questions.  I want to ask the witnesses the same question I put to Nursing Homes Ireland.  The Deloitte price review is being held up and Mr. Daly referred to it as "foot dragging".  Can the witnesses comment on the foot dragging?  Are the private nursing home providers and voluntary associations being included in the review?  Are they being asked for their opinions?  Are they all being included in this Deloitte report and will there be opinions sought from them on what we call a fair deal?</p></speech>

I will run through it quickly.  The stakeholders that were consulted under this review include the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform; HSE services for older people; HSE disability services; HSE estates; HIQA; Age Action Ireland; the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; the Office of the Ombudsman; Nursing Homes Ireland; a number of individual nursing homes; Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank investors; the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund; our own solicitors, Philip Lee; and a consultant geriatrician.  We are being exhaustive and thorough.</p> <p>  There was mention of the review that was carried out on the fair deal scheme.  It states: "In considering the financing of the scheme, the review concluded that the National Treatment Purchase Fund has done an effective job in introducing and managing a pricing system for long-term residential care facilities."  We have done a good job and got a system up and running.  It is working well.  It might be possible to improve on it and we are going through a precise and thorough process to ensure that if we change the system, we come up with something that will work and that will improve the system for everyone involved.</p></speech>

Is that a good move?  If a private nursing home signs up this month, it is doing so for 30 months.  If the review takes place and more money is made available, is that provided automatically under the contract?</p></speech>

There are variations between those durations.  The longer one provides a strong degree of certainty for the nursing home operator, the resident and the Exchequer.  There a fixed view as to what is going to happen in a year or two years.  I am sure members talk much more than I do about multiannual budgeting.  That provides a degree of stability and certainty that would not exist otherwise.  It is an indicator of confidence in the scheme by the operators.</p></speech>

We have some voluntary homes in our constituency.  As I said earlier, they have to fundraise simply to keep the show on the road.  Is that going to be taken into consideration?  I am asking about the voluntary sector in particular.</p></speech>

Can your organisation offer a comment on the agricultural side and the farming sector?  There is discrimination there.  I had it from Tony O'Brien.  I got a commitment that there was a discrepancy.  The authorities accepted it and agreed to try to do something about it.  The Minister has given a commitment but it is dragging on.  As we discussed already, there is a three-year cap on a house but there is no cap on a farm.  Is this going to happen?  Can your organisation comment on it?</p></speech>

A person based in his or her private home gets a service from GPs as well as all the other services.  However, let us suppose a person goes into a private nursing home.  Seemingly, from the evidence given earlier, that person loses all of that.  Does the deputation have any comment on that?  Should it be part of the arrangement when the organisation is making a deal with a private nursing home that these services should be included in the cost?</p></speech>

It seems to me to be discriminatory.  People in their own homes can get these services.  However, if they go into a private nursing home and are paying &euro;1,000 or &euro;900 per week, they are excluded from these services.  To me that does not sound fair.</p></speech>

Certainly, that is not our position.  I was in the Gallery and heard that stated several times.  I would be most concerned if that was happening.</p> <p>  I wish to point out that when a person is in residential care, whether the set-up is public, private or voluntary, the person is being provided with 24-hour care and with a level of service.  These people are no longer able to stay in their own homes.  Let us suppose a person receives primary care services through the medical card or whatever and is provided with therapies and so on.  Those services are available at a certain level.  The service is a scarce resource.  The service provider will be concentrating on those people who are residing alone, perhaps.  Such interventions might keep people at home for longer.  The fact that a person is in long-stay care, regardless of the centre and whether it is public, private or voluntary, means that person is less of a risk because of the 24-hour care and service provision.</p></speech>

If a person has a problem, he or she still needs to get the treatment or care.  I think those responsible should review it.  I am asking whether your organisation can review it.</p></speech>

There should be no discrimination for a person because that person is in residential care, especially if the person has a need for a service.  The fact that a person is in residential care should not mean he or she should not get the services.  That is what I am saying.  I agree with that.  I am simply saying that if an occupational therapist has a long waiting list, in fairness, the people he or she is more likely to look after are those who are at home.  It would be a natural thing for the service provider to do that.  That would be a clinical call.  Let us suppose a person is in a residential care setting and needs a service.  Is there sufficient capacity to provide that service for everyone?  That is another question.  There may not be.</p></speech>
