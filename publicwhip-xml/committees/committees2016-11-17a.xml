He is accompanied by Mr. John Riordan, deputy director of audit.  Are the minutes of 10 November agreed?  Agreed.  I propose we hold over the opening statement of Cerberus until we meet its representative in the afternoon.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence in category B, that is, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings.  Items 154 to 163B, inclusive, 171B and 186B, all refer to late accounts.  I propose we note them for now and return to them when we discuss accounts and statements shortly.</p> <p>  Items 168B(i) and (ii) are correspondence from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing a response to a series of questions from the committee following our engagement with the Revenue Commissioners in October.  It is a fairly extensive reply and I thank Mr. Cody for that.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Items 169B(i) and (ii) is an e-mail from Ms Michelle Lowe of NAMA attaching a copy of PIMCO's offer letter to NAMA in December 2013.  I propose we note and publish that, and it will be added to our Project Eagle file.  Items 173B(i) and (ii) is correspondence from Dublin City Council responding to the committee's letter of 26 September on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and contracting of professional services.  A copy of a response given at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting in the last D&aacute;il is attached.  Is it agreed to note and published?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item 175B is an e-mail also from Mr. Martin Whelan of NAMA informing the committee that it cannot release statements of interests made by members of the board, committees and senior members of staff in accordance with section 35 of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  Is it agreed to note and publish that?  Agreed.  I have asked the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisor to prepare a note on this.</p><p>Our committee is agreed that, outside the meetings, the secretariat can seek additional information it knows is of interest to the members.  We had written to NAMA seeking a copy of any declarations of interest board members or members of the Northern Ireland committee had published.  They said that, under the legislation, the documents are confidential and not subject to the ethics legislation and not for publishing.  However, I was in touch since then looking for any declaration of interest signed by any member at any Northern Ireland committee meetings or board meetings in connection with Project Eagle.  I want to see copies because we have been told on several occasions that some members, especially those of the Northern Ireland committee, had signed a declaration of interest.  Mr. Rowntree, when he was here, said he never saw them and that they were just handed to the Chairman.  I checked the legislation this morning and noted it states they are to be made available to all board members at the meeting.  It is not satisfactory for it to be handed only to the Chairman.  That said, the minutes of the Northern Ireland committee record the items of disclosure but they have been redacted in the set of minutes given to us.  If we are considering this matter, we want to see the declarations signed by the people at the meeting.  We are quite specific on the fact that we should get that.  We will make clear to NAMA precisely what we are looking for.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is an e-mail from Mr. Martin Whelan of NAMA attaching a response to the information requested on 3 November.  We will note and publish that.  Every week, we have a letter going to NAMA seeking additional information.  The replies are coming back.</p><p> Items Nos. 177B(i) and 177B(ii) concern an e-mail from Mr. Brendan Smith of the accounts branch in the Department of Social Protection attaching a copy of the Social Welfare Appeals Office annual report for 2015, as requested at our meeting with it in October.  Can we agree to note and publish that?  Agreed.  It is not the document I was looking for, however.  The document we received yesterday is a summary of the activities of the Social Welfare Appeals Office detailing the categories of appeals it dealt with.  I was looking for its annual financial statement, not a summary of its hearings and activities.  We will be specific in seeking a copy of its financial statement.  There is other outstanding information from the Department of Social Protection that we have not received yet.  I would like to receive it within the next seven days because several weeks have elapsed since it was first requested.</p><p> Nos. 178B(i) and 178B(ii) refer to an e-mail from Mr. David Meisels, head of litigation at Fortress Investment Group, attaching a letter of response on the committee's areas of interest.  It is not an extensive letter but I propose to read it into the record because Fortress was the underbidder.  Cerberus was the successful bidder.  Some time ago, in early November, in advance of a committee meeting I asked the secretariat to write to Fortress posing specific questions.  We received a reply today but since our last meeting we have agreed to invite its representatives.  We have not had a response on that yet.  We wrote the letter to them because I wanted to get information flowing.  I have the authority to invite representatives without clearance from the committee.  We have since obtained it.  We still hope the representatives will come.  Although the letter received is short, it deals with a couple of specific issues.  Since Fortress is a key player on this issue, having been the only underbidder at the end of the competition, we should read the short response.  We will not have a big discussion on it.</p></speech>

I agree it is important to obtain clarification from the Controller and Auditor General on a number of items of correspondence we have got to determine whether the information is new to him.  The Fortress letter states that the bid process requires an unconditional bid that "could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid".</p></speech>

It is dated 11 November and it was sent by e-mail to the clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It states:<div></p><p><i>Re: Special Report 94 National Asset Management Agency's Sale of Project Eagle</i></div>Dear Mr. Lenihan:</p><p>I write in response to your letter, dated November 3, 2016, to Mr. Randal Nardone of Fortress.  Fortress appreciates the opportunity to address the Committee's requests for information, which are reproduced in bold below, followed by Fortress's response.</p><p>The first question I asked was how Fortress became aware of the sale of Project Eagle.  The response is:</p><blockquote>Fortress learned of the formal Project Eagle sale through press reports on or around February 13, 2014 that NAMA was seeking to complete a sale of the NAMA Northern Ireland loan portfolio to PIMCO.</blockquote> <p>The second question I asked was how Fortress became involved in the sale process.  The response is:</p><blockquote>After learning of the Project Eagle sale process through press reports (described above), on February 13, 2014, Michael George of Fortress reached out to Andrew McDowell, Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister, and Brendan McDonagh, Chief Executive Officer of NAMA, to express interest in participating in the sale process.  Mr. McDowell put Mr. George in touch with Ronnie Hanna, head of Credit at NAMA, and John Collison, Head of Residential Delivery at NAMA, who informed Mr. George that Fortress would be invited to bid, and that NAMA had engaged Lazard to oversee the bidding process.  On February 14, 2014, a Fortress representative spoke with Lazard regarding the bidding process.</blockquote> <p>The third question I asked was about the basis on which Fortress made its bid.  This is the response:</p><blockquote>Consistent with its general approach, Fortress reviewed and analyzed available information, assessed the value of the assets for sale and the circumstances of the sale transaction, and exercised its professional judgment in determining its bid, taking into account its perception of the potential risk of the transaction in relation to the potential reward.  Fortress devoted substantial resources to this effort, which involved the deployment of a large team of its investment professionals, and the engagement of a number of external advisors at substantial expense to the firm, including legal counsel, property and asset advisors, and insurance and environmental consultants.</blockquote> <p>The fourth question I asked was about Fortress's rationale in making a bid below the reserve price.  It responded:</p><blockquote>As described above, Fortress formulated its bid on the basis of its professional judgment and its evaluation of the assets for sale and the circumstances of the transaction.  Considerations taken into account by Fortress included the quality and completeness of the diligence information made available to Fortress; that the portfolio constituted a large exposure in a very small, concentrated region: and that the bid process required an unconditional bid which could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid.</blockquote> <p>My final question was whether there were any other matters that might be of interest to the committee regarding the sale of Project Eagle.  The reply is:</p><blockquote>Fortress is not aware of any additional information that may be of interest to the Committee at this time.<br /><br />We hope the information provided above is of assistance to the Committee.</blockquote> <p>The letter is signed by Mr. David Meisels, managing director and head of litigation.  Since we received this, we wrote to Fortress representatives, at the request of the committee, to invite them to appear before us.</p><p>Let me highlight the issue that has just been mentioned, namely, the condition of the bid such that it &quot;could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid&quot;.  That is a very important issue we will have to take up with NAMA.  The number of people who could bid was made very limited.  NAMA has said here a few times that it wanted people to bid who, in their own right, could write the cheque for the full amount and would not have to borrow or work with other people to put the funding together.  NAMA has said that was in the interest of confidentiality but, clearly, normal purchases of this kind would have some groups of people financing them.  The NAMA bid specifically excluded that.  It made it much more difficult for people to make a bid in that the person coming to the table had to write the cheque without recourse to any bank.  That is a very clear issue.  Is my interpretation reasonable?</p></speech>

More important, we will have discuss to it-----</p></speech>

He had access to lots of information we did not have.</p><p>I want to get clarification on a number of issues.  Was the information new to him?  The first element was that Fortress learned of the sale through the press.  Was this new information for the Comptroller and Auditor General?  The second element is that it had to be an unconditional bid and could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid because that would reduce its capacity to bid higher.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016111700002#C00200"><p>As far as we were aware, Fortress became aware of this because of press reports.  In figure 4.6 we show how it came about that individual potential bidders came into the process.  As a result of becoming aware of the process through the media, both Goldman Sachs and Fortress made approaches to NAMA or Lazard.  We were aware of the cash-only bid.  I think we referred to it in the report.  I suppose the point is that none of the bidders were to be in a situation where a bank or funder would also have to get involved.  It would introduce a conditionality on their bid if they required external borrowing.  That is not to say that when the acquisition occurred, they used bank borrowing.  As far as we were aware, that did happen with Cerberus but that was post-acquisition by then.</p></speech>

If we have to let the Comptroller and Auditor General come back afterwards, we will do so.  Out of courtesy to the person who is coming to assist the committee voluntarily, however, I want him to read his opening statement and I do not want any discussion until he is here this afternoon.  I have no problem with the question but, out of courtesy, we should let him make the opening statement before we discuss it.</p> <p>  As Chairman, I can say that there are significant issues arising from the correspondence as we move along that we have not previously put to NAMA so when it is here next Thursday, in addition to responding to various remarks at various other meetings, there will be quite a number of new questions for it.</p> <p>  We will move on with the remainder of our correspondence.  Category C is correspondence from or relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Items 153 C(i) and (ii) concern an e-mail attaching a letter from Nursing Homes Ireland regarding the discrepancies in the fair deal fees paid to HSE nursing homes by comparison with their voluntary and private counterparts.  I propose that we write to the HSE for a response in the first instance.  However, the cost of nursing home care, the HSE, the private sector and how they interrelate, are certainly issues we will want to discuss as part of our work programme.  We will certainly come back to that in our work programme for the new year.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding all this work, I do not know if we would be in a position to start indicating when we might turn to an issue such as that.</p></speech>

I do not want to delay matters but I am trying to get a sense of how we would frame the discussion we need to have on this issue within the HSE audit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016111700002#C01300"><p>It is something I want to examine and potentially report on by way of a special report.  It involves a processing in the HSE but there is also a collection of fair deal proceeds when the debts fall due, which is a Revenue Commissioners issue.  The best way to examine it in detail and look at the process - the numbers coming in, the time involved in that and the collection process for proceeds - is by way of a special examination.  I expect to start that towards the end of the year or in the first part of next year and to report on it next year.</p></speech>

There is a specific note on that so members can see that this was already in the back of our heads all along.  The HSE has published substantial documents on its website in recent weeks relating to the cost of every HSE institution where people are being cared for.  Private nursing homes are providing information to us about what they are being paid by HSE.  The point about whether it is the same service or a similar service is moot.  There is quite a bit of information available to allow us to have a discussion early in the new year.  That report will take a while.  The Minister of Health will have three months to consider it and it will probably be after the summer before we see that report.  We can have our discussion early on in the new year.  I think there is unanimous agreement on that issue.</p> <p>  The next item is a letter from Deputy Niall Collins forwarding a copy of a letter from an individual about the Irish Greyhound Board and the Limerick Greyhound Racing Track.  I propose we write to the Irish Greyhound Board for a response on the issues raised in the letter.  </p> <p>  Item 165C is an e-mail from the Charities Regulator attaching a letter of response from Mr. Tom Malone, head of compliance, regarding a charity shop in Cork.  Is that noted?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Items 174C(i) and (iii) concern correspondence received from the HSE attaching a letter and a briefing note responding to a query from the committee regarding the National Ambulance Service.  The matter in question is being dealt with internally as a protected disclosure and the investigation will be completed in November and findings relayed to the discloser.  Can we agree to note that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item 179C is correspondence received from an individual relating to the payments of Aosd&aacute;na grants to an a specific artist.  The clerk wrote to the Arts Council in respect of other correspondence on this topic from the same individual last week.  I propose we note the correspondence and await a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item 180C is an e-mail from NAMA attaching information relating to the sale of a specific office unit in Dublin.  Attached is a copy of the letter from the individual raising the matter and our request for a response.  We can note that.  It is not directly connected with Project Eagle.  It is a separate property query.</p> <p>  Item 187C is correspondence from Deputy Connolly attaching a copy of  a letter from Cerberus to the former First Minister, Peter Robinson, and the former Minister of Finance and Personnel and current Economy Minister, Simon Hamilton.  Is this noted?  What one was that?  Have we a copy of that?  I presume we have all seen it.  It says "Dear Minister".  Was it addressed to the First Minister?  </p></speech>

I presume it is the First Minister.  We do not know whether it was the deputy First Minister.  We will enquire about that.</p> <p>  The next items are statements and accounts received since the previous meeting.  Before we go to statements and accounts, I want to refer back to the number of correspondence items this week dealing with late accounts.  Members will recall that the clerk undertook some weeks ago to write to the parent Departments of all bodies that laid accounts late, namely, more than three months after being certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am referring to all the accounts we have seen since this committee has been in place.  The requirements are stated in a circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and aim to ensure that in the normal course the accounts of bodies and funds under the aegis of Departments and offices are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of the Comptroller and Auditor General issuing the audit certificate on the accounts.  These requirements are also stated in the Comptroller and Auditor General's letter on completion of his audit.  We decided at a previous meeting to compile a full list.  We have a list.  I will ask members to have a look at it and we will come back and discuss it in further detail in case there might be individual organisations about which members may have a query.  We will discuss it at our next meeting.</p><p>The list is comprehensive and will be included in correspondence for the next meeting.</p><p> The next matter is reports, statements and accounts of bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and received since our meeting of 10 November 2016.  The list is short.  The first matter is the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange, which received a clear audit report.  The next matter is the Kerry Education and Training Board, which received a clear audit report, except that the report discloses that when the board took over responsibility for Tralee training centre in 2014 staff supporting the finance function of the centre did not transfer to the board.  A significant knowledge gap relating to the accounting systems and processes in the training centre resulted in delays in extracting financial data required for the preparation of the statutory financial statement.  I assume the Comptroller and Auditor General was able to complete the audit.</p></speech>

However, severance payments of &euro;145,000 were made during 2015 and associated legal costs amounted to &euro;66,400.  The authority did not obtain sanction for these costs from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as required.  Audit testing also identified non-competitive procurement of goods and services in 2015 to the value of &euro;700,000.  The statement of internal financial controls sets out the steps being taken by the authority to address the matter.  We will note this and if Deputies wish to take up the matter directly, they are free to do so.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland received a clear audit report for 2015.</p> <p>  The next matter is the work programme, which has been circulated.  In addition to our meeting this afternoon, we have a meeting with Lazard next Tuesday, followed by another meeting at 9 a.m. on Thursday with Mr. Frank Daly and Mr. Brendan McDonagh from the National Asset Management Agency.  As the meeting on Thursday will take several hours, we will have one or two breaks.  In fairness to NAMA, representatives of the agency appeared before the committee at the beginning of this process.  Given that a great deal of information has come to light in the meantime, it is only right and proper that NAMA be given an opportunity to appear before the committee again as we reach the conclusion of our public hearings.  If Deputies have questions or wish to elicit information that could be obtained by writing, they should circulate them to the clerk.  We will continue to send NAMA a letter every week seeking further information.</p></speech>

Project Eagle was the code name given to the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  To date, we have met the Comptroller and Auditor General on his report, representatives of NAMA, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his officials, Mr. Brian Rowntree, a former member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, or NIAC as it is known, and the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Martin McGuinness.  We have also met three members of the current board.</p><p>I welcome three former members of the board of the National Asset Management Agency and thank them for making themselves available to the committee.  We are joined by<b></b>Ms &Eacute;ilish Finan, Mr. John Mulcahy and Mr. John Corrigan.  Ms Finan was on the board until December 2013, Mr. Mulcahy was on the board until January 2014 and I understand Mr. Corrigan resigned on 4 January 2015 when he retired as chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency.  The witnesses cannot answer questions relating to matters after those dates, for example, when the Project Eagle sale went through and when PIMCO withdrew.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off all mobile telephones.  I advise witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> We do not have any opening statement today.  We will go directly to questions from members of the committee.  The first speaker today is Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

I will start with Mr. Corrigan.  He was in a unique position in that he was a member of the board of NAMA but he was also in the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  The year 2013 was important in that IBRC was liquidated and instead of a &euro;3 billion payment annually, or a little more in some cases, it was elongated.  In terms of the European Central Bank, ECB, and the pressure that we have heard others talk about, was there additional pressure in 2013 to accelerate the process?  Was the ECB putting on more pressure than it had been?  Was that changing dynamic a factor and did it have any bearing on the way the sale of Project Eagle occurred?</p></speech>

I will talk about my own position in that I straddled the two organisations.  I was chief executive of the NTMA and I was <i>ex officio</i>then on the board of NAMA.  I would have characterised myself as a non-executive on the board of NAMA.  In my head I was acutely aware of the pressure that was on to make progress with liquidating, so to speak, NAMA&rsquo;s balance sheet.  There was pressure from the ECB.  It was general pressure really.  I attended a lot of meetings with the troika.  On the Irish side, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank would also have attended.<br/><br/>From my point of view, and also from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view, 2013 was a year where we were poised to come out of the IMF-EU programme.  The question which was being discussed at the time was whether we would come out of the programme or if we would have to go into a second programme.  Those were real issues that were being discussed at the time.  From the point of view of the particular brief of the NTMA there was also the question, which was very relevant, of whether we could come out of the programme under our own steam, so to speak.  There was also the question of the rating agencies, which had downgraded Ireland through the period we were in the programme.  In fact one of them, Moody's, I think it was, had us in sub-investment grade status.  The rating agencies in general adopted a very strange approach towards NAMA.  While technically the NAMA bonds were off the State&rsquo;s balance sheet, because they were only guaranteed by the Government, they were real liabilities.  From a statistical point of view they were not on the State&rsquo;s balance sheet, but when the ratings agencies looked at them, they actually put them on the balance sheet.  A number of them, in particular I think it was Standard &amp;amp; Poor&rsquo;s, gave no credit then on the asset side for the value of the NAMA assets, so a very aggressive approach was being taken by the ratings agencies.  There was general pressure on but in my experience at the NAMA board meetings, NAMA looked at its sales programmes, its sales process and its strategy purely in the context of the NAMA Act and the question of-----</p></speech>

It was unfortunate but it was probably going to happen in any event.  One cannot keep everything confidential.  It is very difficult, but we decided to press ahead.  The main thing was to ensure that there was a competitive tension in the process, which is a term of art that has been bandied about.  We were advised over the course of what happened subsequently by Lazard's that there was sufficient competitive tension in the process, so it was a decision made by the board.

Deputy Murphy must understand that when we were transferring the assets what we were actually trying to do was to recapitalise the banks.  I know it is being characterised that NAMA was trying to buy the assets cheap, but any reading of the situation will see that it was absolutely far from the truth.  In fact, we introduced this concept of long-term economic value to try to give more money for the assets so when they came into NAMA the market continued to slide and we had to take impairments as the Comptroller and Auditor General will tell the committee.</p></speech>

One is no matter what price they were transferred at in 2009 and 2010 almost all markets slid further, so one will see that in the years after NAMA transferred the assets we continued to take impairments - in other words, they were worth less a year later almost in all markets, possibly bar the US, which was the first to recover.  That is not unusual.  My perspective, coming from an investment background as I do, is that I am seldom interested in what one paid for something - I know other people are and I know it is to do with human psychology - but I am only interested in what it is worth now and what is it likely to be worth in a year&rsquo;s time.</p><p>The fact that one might take less or more than one paid for it really does not matter to me.  The decision is made at the time of looking at the asset, today.</p></speech>

A bidder can only be told the same piece of information, whether it is worth more to know it for a month or a week seems to be overblown.  Those who do not get the information first always say they would have been in a better position if they had got it earlier but I do not believe that to be material.</p></speech>

He said he would never bid blind and PIMCO appeared in the first instance to have indicated an amount almost blind.  It reverse-engineered.  It looked at what was publicly available.  Would Mr. Mulcahy have taken that approach?  Would he have bid blind to purchase something or would he want to have the maximum information for the greatest length of time?

There was an opportunity then to maybe break up the portfolio.  It was not all located in Northern Ireland, some assets were more valuable than others and I understand that it needs to be mixed.

First of all, speaking personally, I thought it was a superb deal from NAMA&rsquo;s perspective.  To shift the whole Northern Ireland portfolio in one go, for &pound;1.3 billion, was an inspired transaction.  My fear was that something would go wrong and that possibility would go away and we would revert to dealing with the portfolio piecemeal.  That would have been very slow.  I never liked the Northern Ireland property market.  My belief was that it would perform badly.  I thought we would be better holding assets elsewhere.  I would characterise the debtors I dealt with in Northern Ireland as unusually difficult.  It would have taken a lot of resources.  We had a discrete geographical area.  There were a lot of shopping centres, which I believed would be an Achilles&rsquo; heel and indeed the Deputy has probably seen the close-down of retail in the UK.  That is one of the things I was worried about.  I did not need to see a whole lot of cashflows to know that &pound;1.3 billion, based on an income roll of &pound;100 million going to &pound;85 million was an extremely good transaction.  My worry was that PIMCO, which had put the ball in play, might go away and we would have to revert to dealing with the thing on a granular basis which would have been very slow, tortuous and most unlikely to yield the same result.</p></speech>

If that was the benchmark for all NAMA&rsquo;s deals, the so-called profit - I say so-called because when one looks at the par value, it is not a profit - and if it had been applied to other deals, the profit that NAMA talked about making would have been a substantial loss.  The 55 top loans were valued some time earlier.  Would that not have indicated to NAMA that it needed to value all the loans individually so that it could measure them to know what their potential would be if they were bundled or sold in smaller bundles to maybe attract a wider group of people to purchase them?</p></speech>

We had one &pound;1.3 billion on the table.  If we had said "no" to that the chances are that it would be worth 20% less with the currency difference.  Second, the Northern Ireland property market has performed badly.  Taking it against assets down here if we had put the &pound;1.3 billion into Republic of Ireland assets, as they are called, we would be up 60%, in Northern Ireland the asset values have hardly moved at all.  Looking at the result of taking the &pound;1.3 billion, as opposed to not taking it, the answer is clear.  That is why it was a superb transaction.</p></speech>

Ms Finan seems to recall that the discussion of the PIMCO bid and the Project Eagle portfolio occurred in the latter part of 2013 but according to the minutes she appears to have been at the meetings.  That seems to conflict with the recollections of others at the meetings in Northern Ireland where it was discussed, not in detail.

It was not a board and therefore did not have decision-making capacity.  My recollection, and it is a recollection, is that the first time this was discussed formally at board was September, I think 12 September.

Effectively, from a Northern Ireland stakeholder standpoint, the concept of selling the entire bundled portfolio would have been deemed strategic and macro and, therefore, it was within the terms of reference and correct that it should be discussed in the Northern Ireland advisory committee.  It was very much strategic in its focus on the concept of the impact that it might have, first, on the stakeholder being the southern Irish taxpayers and the ability for NAMA to maximise its return and, second, the impact that it might have from a Northern Ireland stakeholder standpoint.  It was within that concept that the discussion was held.</p></speech>

There was an expectation that the Northern Ireland portfolio would be worked through and it was a big surprise when there was a change in approach.  That appears to have been known by Mr. Rowntree, or it appears to have been discussed, which tends to move it away from the strategic discussion to a more practical one.

What happened in September 2013 was that a potential opportunity presented itself.</p></speech>

That is why we introduced the competitive tension part.  Frankly, I was surprised that we had &euro;1.3 billion on the table.  I would have thought a smaller figure might have come forward.  Then the decision was not to take the &euro;1.3 billion but to subject it to a process involving Lazard and create some competitive tension to see if there was anything better available.  That is the way I would have seen that covered.</p></speech>

What does "disproportionate burden of effort" mean?  Mr. Mulcahy called it an inspired transaction that would require a great deal of resources and told us that his greatest concern was that PIMCO would go away.

I had moved from being a board member to an executive.  We were seen with some hostility in the North and the borrowers were not repentant borrowers.  Rather, they felt their troubles had been caused by a failure of the banking system in the South and through no fault of their own.  They were most unlikely to be co-operative.  What reception we would get working the assets out asset by asset in the courts of Northern Ireland was a concern.  That phrase is an attempt to capture all of that and more.</p></speech>

I also regarded Northern Ireland as having all sorts of other risks.  Something could go wrong on the security front and Northern Ireland could become an unattractive place.

Second, I considered what we were selling and believed it was a wonderful opportunity to shift a large portfolio about which I had many worries.  Third, it would generate large amounts of cash for NAMA.  Taking the three together, it was the perfect opportunity.

Usually for a loan sale, NAMA loan sale advisers provide advice on sales strategy, market conditions, estimated values of portfolio, etc.  None of this happened with Project Eagle, yet it was the first large multi-debtor sale.  Why was this advice not sought?</p></speech>

However, I think he is referring to an earlier point where the board - I think it was the Chairman - said that, for Project Eagle, there was a bespoke process initiated simply to cover off the PIMCO proposal, which was on the table, to get the competitive tension.

None of this occurred in respect of Project Eagle.  Given that it was NAMA's first large multi-debtor sale, why was this the case?  Why was the advice not sought?</p></speech>

As regards the valuations, as a non-executive, I would not have been intimately involved in the transaction but my understanding is that it was only from late 2014 onwards, when the nature of the market changed, that advisers were asked to give valuations as part of their briefs.  The role of advisers would have evolved over time.  That would be part of the reason.  Second, it would reflect the reverse nature of the inquiry, which prompted the decision by the NAMA board to examine this transaction.</p></speech>

In or around February 2014, it became widely known that the loans were on the market.  Therefore, the process of a confidential loan sale was out of the window.  It was over, it was gone.  The committee is struggling with an issue.  At this point, given that the confidential nature of it was over and everything was out in the open, why was the whole sale strategy not reviewed?  Why was there such a rush?</p></speech>

The committee has already heard from my former colleague that these transactions can be completed in a relatively short period.  Strategically, we decided to go ahead with the sale.  It was a good idea to go ahead with it.  I still believe it was a good idea to go ahead with it.  When it broke into the public domain, as I mentioned in reply to Deputy Catherine Murphy, there was discussion at board level on whether we would press ahead with it.  We decided to press ahead because it represented a good transaction in terms of NAMA's objectives.</p></speech>

If we consider it as a bulk sale, all of the players that we believed were relevant had, on Lazard's advice, been invited into the competition.  As discussed earlier, the alternative was to go back and examine the portfolio and to sell it on a piecemeal basis.  However, we did not believe that would have been a good decision.  To go back to my earlier point, perhaps the minutes should have reflected that in terms of the colour I spoke about but I certainly know that it was discussed, that we said that the bulk sale was a superior strategy for all of the reasons Mr. Mulcahy mentioned earlier and that we would press ahead with it.</p></speech>

Mr. Corrigan stated earlier that he believed the Project Eagle deal was a good idea and a good deal and that it represented the best outcome.  However, it is also the subject of two criminal investigations.  More importantly for this committee, it was the basis for a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is very critical of the process.  It is, therefore, contested that this was the best outcome.  Does Mr. Corrigan accept that to be the case, for starters?</p></speech>

Mr. Corrigan and the board view this as having been the best outcome but there is an alternative view.  That view, shaped by the Comptroller and Auditor General, was based on two years of work and a great deal of investigation into documentation, information, etc., given to the board.  That is the basis for his report.  I wanted for that to be clarified.  I will get to his criticisms and talk through some of those in a few moments.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulcahy spoke about this as being an inspired deal.  Those were his words.

I will read a passage from it that might be of interest to Mr. Mulcahy because I think it sheds some light on why and how the deal was conceived.  It stated:</p><blockquote>In April 2013, PIMCO was approached by Mr. Tuvi Keinan, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick who then introduced PIMCO to Mr. Ian Coulter of Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan, with whom Brown Rudnick appeared to be working to identify potential purchasers for the NAMA Northern Irish loan portfolio (which later became known as Project Eagle).  As we understood it, PIMCO was one of three firms who were approached at the time by these three parties.</blockquote><p>This was in April 2013.  The first discussions Mr. Mulcahy would have had as a board member was when PIMCO approached the NAMA board.  Brown Rudnick, Ian Coulter of Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan were approached by PIMCO well before PIMCO made any approach to NAMA.  The parties "appeared to be working to identify potential purchasers for the NAMA Northern Irish loan portfolio (which later became known as Project Eagle)".  The genesis of it was that the parties who made up that trio saw an opportunity and approached PIMCO.  It was not PIMCO that saw the opportunity.  Would Mr. Mulcahy agree?</p></speech>

He was working with Mr. Coulter and Brown Rudnick.  PIMCO did not approach them; they approached PIMCO.  After that, PIMCO approached NAMA and said it wanted a short and exclusive sales process.  PIMCO went on to say the three parties then requested &pound;15 million for the information they brought to PIMCO.  It is very relevant.  Mr. Mulcahy's view before he came into this room was that PIMCO had approached NAMA.  In fact, it goes back earlier.  The clock started ticking in April when these individuals approached PIMCO.</p></speech>

However, PIMCO was prepared to pay these three partners &pound;15 million for the information.  We also know from Cerberus that it was also prepared to pay two of those parties &pound;16 million for the information.  Clearly, there was a price and a premium on information, given that they were prepared to pay that kind of money.  It was not overstated.  It was obviously very valuable information if they were prepared to pay a price for it.</p></speech>

To return to the PIMCO transaction, the board's difficulty was with Mr. Cushnahan's involvement in it, and it was on foot of his involvement that the thing could not be proceeded with.  If PIMCO had been dealing with just the other two parties and paying a success fee, it would have been entirely a matter for PIMCO and would not have caused the difficulties which Mr. Cushnahan's involvement threw up.</p></speech>

With respect to the Chair, these are issues he raised.  Conclusion No. 55 reads, "Given the joint agreement between the parties to the success fee arrangement with PIMCO, all of the payment &ndash; not just the payment to Mr Cushnahan &ndash; should have raised concerns for NAMA."</p><p>The same applies in relation to Cerberus.  Mr. Cushnahan had a relationship with Brown Rudnick and Tughans and the Comptroller and Auditor General said that his departure did not mean it was the end of the problem.  The board should have interrogated it more.</p></speech>

The following finding is that the board did not appear to have asked Cerberus when it engaged Brown Rudnick, or what the precise nature was of the service Brown Rudnick and Tughans were providing for Cerberus, notwithstanding any opening statements that may or may not have been made to the effect that information was not sought.  They were clearly providing a service but the board never asked what that service was.  The board knew they were working with, or had an association with, a NAMA board member and the question of a conflict of interest was clearly discussed because other board members have said they were horrified to find this.</p></speech>

I fully understand that the board did not have all the information which we have today.  We are getting information all the time and have received some from PIMCO, Fortress and Cerberus, giving us facts the board did not have and I do not expect the board to operate on the basis of hindsight.  However, I ask the board to give us a view as to why they made decisions at the time, and there is some criticism from the Comptroller and Auditor General in that regard.  We know that Mr. Corrigan was made aware of the fact that there was a success fee arrangement involving Frank Cushnahan, Tughans and Brown Rudnick in regard to PIMCO.  It was extraordinary that Brown Rudnick and Tughans approached Cerberus and offered their services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is asking why the board never asked what these services were.  It made no connection with the fact that they had an association with a member of the NIAC and that, potentially, the process had become contaminated.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states that appropriate action was not taken.</p></speech>

Mr. Corrigan is factually wrong because finding No. 54 states that during NIAC meetings and annual statements of interest, one external NIAC member, Mr. Frank Cushnahan, declared his involvement as an advisor to six NAMA debtors.  It goes on to state that the NAMA board should have formally considered whether Mr. Cushnahan's engagement in discussions of the strategy, including the approach of Brown Rudnick and PIMCO, was consistent with his ongoing involvement as a financial adviser to a significant proportion of NAMA's Northern Ireland debtor connections.  He did have an association with debtors and declared this to NAMA.  NAMA was aware of it but did not see it as an issue.  Given that this made up 50% of the loan portfolio, clearly it was an issue.</p></speech>

The terms of reference of that committee were devised by the NAMA board, approved by the NAMA board in 2010 and marginally revised in, I think, 2011.  At no point was there ever a discussion at the Northern Ireland advisory committee on any specific borrower or any specific property.  That is a really important point to put on the record.  It was always a strategic discussion with the paramount focus being on the expeditious requirement of NAMA to sell the assets in the interest of the Irish taxpayers, with a stakeholder focus which was the Northern Ireland cohort within the country of Ireland.  It was a collaborative, strategic committee.  That was its purpose and that was how it carried out its duties.  We, and all members including the external members, were fully aware of its terms of reference and complied with the restrictions, which required confidentiality at the borrower level.  During my term of office, which coincided with the term of office of Mr. Cushnahan prior to his resignation, there were four disclosures at the committee.  They were not disclosed in the minute details but my recollection is that they referenced two or three borrowers.  At no point was there a disclosure about PIMCO.  It is really important to understand that up until the end of December 2013, the involvement of PIMCO or any other Northern Ireland party was not disclosed at the committee and therefore the board would not have had knowledge of it.</p></speech>

We heard evidence yesterday from the deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, Mr. Martin McGuinness, on the specific question of a memorandum of understanding that had emerged.  It was prepared by at least one half of the Executive in Northern Ireland.  To the best of Mr. McGuinness's recollection - he said he thought he was correct, but he might stand corrected - this memorandum of understanding had been provided for NAMA within three days of a conference call that had taken place between Mr. McGuinness, the Minister for Finance here and the then First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, in the North.  That was in February 2014, which was obviously before any sale was concluded.  Is Mr. Corrigan in a position to confirm or deny that the memorandum of understanding was provided for NAMA?</p></speech>

I do not recall anything about a memorandum of understanding.  I think I read about it in a newspaper on Tuesday.</p></speech>

To Mr. Corrigan's recollection or knowledge, as a board member all through this period, the existence or otherwise of a memorandum of understanding was not party to the sale negotiations, as far as the board had been informed.

I will give an example.  To Mr. Mulcahy's knowledge, notwithstanding the fact that he was not directly or specifically involved in loan sales, would a memorandum of understanding of this kind ever have been a precondition of the sale of a loan by NAMA to an investment company?  Would NAMA have stated, "We are selling you X for Y, but you have to release everybody out the gap from their corporate or personal guarantees"?</p></speech>

Yesterday a witness told us that it had ended up with NAMA within three days of a three-way conversation that had included the Minister down here.  I am trying to establish whether the people in NAMA knew about it at the time.  They have said they did not.  I want to take advantage of the fact that we have certain expertise before us and want to know whether that kind of thing is the norm.  We have established from Mr. Corrigan that if there was a memorandum of understanding at play, it would have served to reduce the value.  Mr. McGuinness said yesterday that, to the best of his knowledge, this had been the case and that NAMA had been informed of it.  A NAMA board member has said it would bring down the value.  That is why we are all here.  We want to know whether there was a loss of money to the taxpayer.  Therefore, it is perfectly relevant.</p></speech>

Mr. Frank Daly has given his view on it but frankly, I do not know.  I want to get to the bottom of it.  If there was such a memorandum, it would have brought down the value and that is a concern.  Mr. McGuinness said that the document went to NAMA but I do not know if that is true.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that guarantees were released and all 56 connections were out the gap.  I have a concern, which I why I am asking these questions.</p> <p>  I will now move on to the valuation issue.  In terms of valuations, Mr. Mulcahy would have been responsible for property disposals and that kind of thing.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I notice that members of this committee often interchange the word "asset", meaning two different things.  In some senses, the Comptroller and Auditor General did the same thing.  There are two meanings.  The assets that NAMA had were the loans to the debtors.  I do not want to be patronising here but this is important.  The loans to the debtors are one asset.  The underlying security, the real estate, is a separate asset.  NAMA did not have access to the underlying real estate.  It may inform the value of the loan.  In fact, it informs a fairly big backbone of the value of the loan but to dive into the value of the underlying real estate is not as pertinent as looking at the value of the loans.</p></speech>

We have already established that Lazard was not valuing the loans on this occasion - I do not know why it was paid all of the money it received - even though it did so for Tower, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out.  Why would NAMA not have obtained updated valuations for the biggest property related transaction in the history of the State?</p></speech>

I am quite independent in the delivery of my evidence here today, but certainly there were a number of factual questions which I had and they were answered.

There is a ruling made by the board of NAMA, which, I think, is a wise ruling, that the retention of papers is not material that can be held by a board member subsequent to his or her tenure.  Subsequent to each of our departures any board paper or any relevant NAMA paper was returned.  I am out of the board three years, as is Mr. Mulcahy, and Mr. Corrigan is out approximately two years.  In fairness, there was material that we would have liked to have reread.  We attended a meeting and they kindly sent, as Mr. Corrigan said, some additional transcripts, which was more about this committee.  Minutes of certain meetings relevant to the point of the PAC for main points of discussion were made available to us to allow us reflect and recall the context, and that was it.</p></speech>

There were four disclosures during his term of office as a member of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.  None of them were material interests discussed during the course of any of the Northern Ireland meetings and, therefore, it was not apparent to the members of the Northern Ireland committee at the point of his resignation and, therefore, not apparent to the board members that there was any glaring conflict.</p></speech>

They were the same legal advisors.  They had advised PIMCO.  PIMCO withdrew on 12 November.  Within a matter of, let us not exaggerate, two weeks they were now advising Cerberus.  Would that raise concerns on a NAMA board?  Should it have?</p></speech>

He makes no comment on its commercial judgment.  He looks at the records and raises issues.  What he says is that he is not reassured in relation to the 10% the witnesses say NAMA used.  He is not reassured by NAMA's explanations.  Sorry now, but throwing up of hands is not helpful because this is the report we are dealing with.  We are not dealing with allegations.  We are dealing with a report that raises serious concerns.  Mr. Mulcahy is coming in here and telling us it was superb, wonderful and he would have sold for less actually.  I asked him at the beginning if he had read it.  If he goes back and reads it, he will see that he makes no decisions, but rather raises concerns repeatedly and draws conclusions from the records or the absence of records, in particular that there was no outlining of an alternative strategy, no grounding for a change of strategy in mid-term and many other reasons.  That is why I asked if Mr. Mulcahy had met NAMA in the beginning and if he had come up.  He said he did not.  That is what I would like from witnesses here; to go through this and say "We agree" or "We disagree" on each one.  I thank Mr. Mulcahy.</p></speech>

I want to make it clear that at the board meeting of 3 April when the Cerberus business was discussed, Mr. Corrigan was noted as absent.  Regarding asking Mr. Corrigan about the discussion, when the Brown Rudnick matter came to light and the issues that emerged about that time, he was marked absent from the board meeting that, in essence, approved the Cerberus offer.  He was not party to that discussion on that particular day.  The value of today's meeting is to get different perspectives.  It would be terrible if everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet.  It might make it more difficult, but that is our job.  Before calling Deputy McDonald, I note genuinely that there is a vote in the D&aacute;il and we are finished this session.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses see that?  Yes.  Notwithstanding the lack of status of the memorandum of understanding - it was not a document of the Northern Executive, and that is a statement of fact and not opinion - there had been a discussion within NAMA or a realisation that PIMCO was minded to act in this fashion.  That is what the paper reflects, does it not?</p></speech>

There was a discussion earlier about the memorandum of understanding.  I think it was put directly to Mr. Corrigan and he replied that he did not know or hear tell of the memorandum of understanding, but I am pointing out that while he may not have seen that document, there was certainly an understanding or a discussion around the possibility, if not the probability, of forgiveness by PIMCO, because it is noted in his board document.</p></speech>

Let me remind Mr. Mulcahy that when he was talking about the transaction earlier, he said it was inspired.  He was clearly relieved and delighted as a board member that a buyer was found.  He instanced several times the issue of debtors and said they were "unusually difficult" in the North.  What does he mean by that?</p></speech>

I will not go on too long, but normally when NAMA engages with a debtor, for example, somebody in the South, we would agree a business plan that would involve them disposing of property over time as we worked it out to try to generate the largest amount of cash.  Part of that process - I do not want it to sound as a healing process - was that the borrower would accept that we had a problem and that we needed to deal with it.  In the case of many of the Northern debtors, they were less inclined to be acquiescent in that regard.</p></speech>

I never met Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  I was not aware of his involvement with any debtors.  My only awareness of that comes from the fact that in the Northern Ireland minutes of those meetings, there is, if I had read them at the time, a declaration of a conflict.

At this stage, it becomes apparent there is a problem with PIMCO.  The problem is around fixer's fees or success fees.  Mr. Corrigan does not have to rehearse that they are normal and all that because we have heard that evidence and it is on the record.  Mr. Corrigan discovered that Mr. Cushnahan was in the middle of all this and it caused concern.  I am sure Mr. Corrigan shared those concerns.  I have no doubt Mr. Corrigan was taken aback to hear of this turn of events.  What I want to ask Mr. Corrigan about very specifically is a reference in those minutes to the date of April 2013.  It is the minutes of 13 March on page 118 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  If one looks at it, in the course of what is recorded within the minutes, it says "The board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations had commenced in April 2013".  This is as the board is discussing Mr. Cushnahan and the success fees and so on.  I raised this matter with Mr. Corrigan's colleague, Mr. Ellingham, who initially suggested this was a typo.  He subsequently clarified for the committee that it is not a typo and that the date is correct.  That date, as Mr. Corrigan will know, pre-dates the unsolicited approach to NAMA by Brown Rudnick.  What I want to know is why that date of April 2013 is in there?  I want to tease this out with Mr. Corrigan.  This suggests to me that when the board was told about Mr. Cushnahan's involvement and that he was lined up to get a success fee, the board was also told that the genesis of this fee pre-dated any approach that was made officially to NAMA and that Frank Cushnahan was involved in discussions, negotiations and so on back as early as April 2013.  Was that the discussion that was had at the board?  Was it given that information?</p></speech>

I have read the minutes, as I mentioned earlier, and it is obvious now from the PIMCO letter, which was read into the record, that Mr. Cushnahan was involved, according to PIMCO in that letter, in those discussions in April 2013.  That is obvious now.</p></speech>

That suggests to me that this is an outfit that sets out the facts as they are available to it.

We can check that again with it.</p><p>Reading from this, it seems that those same facts were transmitted here.  Unless people had nodded off at the meeting or failed to ask glaringly apparent questions imparting that information, I am struggling to understand how not just Mr. Corrigan but the entire board membership at that meeting did not understand exactly what had happened and the dates involved.  April 2013, which is a key date, is in the minutes.</p></speech>

In the telephone conversation, which I was not party to so Deputy McDonald will have to ask those who were, there was no reference to Mr. Cushnahan being in consort with the other parties.  I do not know why PIMCO did not disclose that.  They are very good people.  I have dealt with them with my NTMA hat on as significant holders of Irish Government bonds.  I am not suggesting any sleight of hand on their part but the fact of the matter is that the note of the telephone conversation does not say that Mr. Cushnahan was involved in April 2013.</p></speech>

Mr. Stewart has explained why that was the case.  On the face of it, Mr. Cushnahan had resigned from the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee in November 2013 and the PIMCO transaction was not going ahead.  The reason the board did not proceed with it is because it had no evidence of any wrongdoing.  Subsequent events might suggest otherwise, as the Deputy is implying, but it was the reputation risk that we were concerned about and that is why we did not proceed with it.</p></speech>

Page 118 of the report made it very clear.  The minutes state that, "in response to a question from the Board, it was noted that, notwithstanding the premeditated fee-sharing arrangement that had been put in place by PIMCO, the catalyst for disclosure of the arrangement to NAMA was allegedly the insistence of PIMCO's Legal and Compliance Department".  In its letter to us last week, PIMCO denied that an arrangement was in place.  It said it had been approached twice and had never formally agreed to it.  Can Mr. Corrigan respond?  Perhaps he has not had an opportunity to read the PIMCO letter but PIMCO said it was approached twice by Brown Rudnick in connection with the fee arrangement but never acquiesced or formally agreed to it.  The board minutes say it was in place.  The letter seems to contradict the phone call and PIMCO's letter seems to contradict the board minutes.  There are divergent views.  Has Mr. Corrigan any comments to make on that or is he in a position to comment on it?</p></speech>

The carrying value of these loans in the balance sheet at the end of 2013 was &pound;1.49 billion.  Selling them for &pound;1.3 billion resulted in a realised loss that is booked into NAMA's accounts for 2014 of &pound;160 million or &euro;168 million.</p><p> What the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that if there were a different timing or process, then the loan loss realised, whether it was &pound;168 million or &pound;190 million, could have been avoided.  That can be neither proven nor disproven.  The NAMA board was extremely mindful and conscious of its obligations under the Act.  The board took a decision in good faith.  I believe it was reasonable and commercially sensible.</p><p> There was a loss.  When we decided to set the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, we were conscious that there was a probability that there could be a loss of up to &pound;180 million, that is to say, the difference between the reserve price and the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will correct me if I am wrong, but I do not believe the argument is about the loss.  It is about whether the loss could have been avoided by our taking a different route or timing.</p></speech>

However, it is important, for the for the record of the committee, to point out that the carrying value, which was effectively hinged the discount rate of 5.5%, is an accounting technical carrying value that was struck in 2010, based on IAS 39 and on the requirement to strike the effective interest rate at that point.</p></speech>

In early 2010, which was when the rate was struck, two considerations arose, as is correct.  First, the prevailing rate of increase of Government bonds at the time, which was approximately 1.5%.  Second, the perceived risk premium - this involves judgment - which the NAMA board deemed to be 4% in 2010.  We came to the 5.5% figure, which was then applied, from an accounting theoretical standpoint, to strike the carrying value.  Subsequently, every quarter, but especially year-end, there was an assessment of that carrying value.  What we were allowed to modify, as per the accounting standards, was the EIR rate, because that is locked once a company decides in accordance with IAS 39 on the take-on value of those loans.  Periodically, indeed every calendar year, we looked at the fair value of the underlying loans, not the underlying collateral assets.  In 2012, for example, the fair value of the loans, as disclosed in the NAMA financial statements, was actually discounted at 10%.  This was because the market had moved.  I have no bias towards the ultimate decision because I was not party to it.  However, to say that the carrying value at a discount rate of 5.5%, as decided in 2010, should somehow dictate the commercial transaction which, in the end, is defined by a market involving a willing buyer and a willing seller, is simply not a logical commercial transition.</p></speech>

I am sorry to intervene but we have heard a good deal of that before.  We have heard explanations of fair value and, for example, if a firm was to sell assets now, what might happen.  We have also had our attention drawn to a distinction in terms of the discount rate that a potential purchaser would apply and as the seller.  We do not have the scope to challenge of that now, but we have heard all of it.  I am keen to put on the record the fact that there is a strong countervailing argument against all of the above.</p> <p>  I wish to make a further point.  The 10% argument has been made by the deputation.  However, the paper trail for that only appears, lo and behold, in 2016.  That is the reality and that bothers me.</p></speech>

He is a professional man, as is the body for which he works.  Why was he so entrenched in the view that there was loss on the difference between 5.5% and 10%?  I call on Mr. Mulcahy to comment on the point as well.</p></speech>

I think he is wrong.  I think he made a mistake.  The central theme that I take issue with is that he makes a commercial judgment.  For example, let us suppose that instead of selling at &pound;1.3 billion odd we had worked out the assets.  Would that have brought about a better result?  It is unfair to ask why we did not know that at the time.  We know it now, and that is significant.  We know that no one else came along to bid more.  The property market in Northern Ireland has languished.  The market here has prospered.  If we still had those assets today and the committee asked me why NAMA did not take &pound;1.3 billion in 2013, then I would find myself in a difficult position.</p></speech>

Was the option assessed properly at that stage?  Could they have been kept or retained?  Witnesses have implied several times that NAMA would have done better if it had held on until 2015, 2016 or 2018.  Furthermore, even with Brexit coming down the road, if NAMA had held onto the portfolios and sold them individually or asset by asset, NAMA would have got greater reward than for the fire sale or quick sale.

NAMA never had the option.  The committee should remember that NAMA is not an investor.  NAMA was using money that it had to repatriate.  We had to get this money back.  It did not belong to us.  We had to give it back to the European Central Bank.  PIMCO was coming in with new money to invest in Northern Ireland.  We were relinquishing our investments.  We never had the option or luxury of working out the assets.  Earlier, Deputy McDonald referred to our original strategy.  Our default strategy, in cases where we could do nothing else, was to work out the assets.  That was never a preferred strategy.  We never had the option.</p></speech>

She said there was always going to be a tension between getting the maximum amount of money and acting expeditiously.</p> <p>  Everyone can see that if we held the assets until 2030, they would be worth more than if we sold them today.  However, we never had that luxury.  In that case, the argument becomes whether it is better to get &pound;1.3 billion now or working out the assets and getting them over a longer period.  Fortunately, for me, my judgment was proven to be correct.  The correct decision was to take the &pound;1.3 billion in 2013 or 2014.</p></speech>

There have been discussions about the borrowers and the failure of those borrowers.  There was also a sense of ill-liquidity in the Northern Ireland market.  NAMA was trying to sell a composite portfolio piecemeal.  Mr. Mulcahy is right.  Selling piecemeal over time was still a relatively short period.  Sale by 2020 was the strategic ambition of NAMA and the State in the best interests of the State.</p><p>There were, therefore, colours of strategic influence here.  One was the borrowers - absolutely - and the other was the illiquidity in the Northern Irish market.  The record and the transaction which had successfully been done in the Northern Ireland portfolio up until autumn 2013 gleaned about &euro;100 million of sales.  If one looks at the records, predominately the borrowers were put to enforcement.  So if one stress tests that decision strategically - if one holds the assets, and bear in mind we only had the luxury really until 2020 or early thereafter - one is looking at probably enforcement of a majority of Northern Ireland, which actually is financially draining.  The strategic element here, on behalf of the Irish taxpayer, was that there was a lot of uncertainty around holding those assets for what effectively was a relatively short window.  There was a known potential to deleverage the Irish NAMA balance sheet at &euro;1.322 billion.  I did not participate in the absolute decision of &euro;1.322 billion but the initial consideration and reference here - the change in strategy - was absolutely cognisant of the intricacies and complications about the Northern Ireland market, borrowers, politics and all that goes with that.  That was the strategic driver - the best for the Irish taxpayer.  </p></speech>

It became involved in October but we now learn it was looking at the portfolio in April.  A semi-open tender commenced for a few selected companies.  Why was it open for only three weeks, which seems to be a very short period?  Why was it confined to three weeks when other companies were showing an interest, for example, Fortress and Cerberus?  Given that PIMCO had a headstart of nine months and would still have been in the game were it not for what transpired afterwards, why was the tender open for only three weeks?</p></speech>

He said he was able to glean from information that was given out at meetings of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee the identity of companies that were involved in the Project Eagle sale.  He had no problem identifying them whereas Ms Finan said that no information whatever was given out at the NIAC meetings.  Mr. Rowntree contradicted that by saying he was able to identify companies and that Mr. Cushnahan, who was at the meetings, would have had inside information.  In other words, Mr. Rowntree said he was able to identify entities and derived inside information from what was presented to him at meetings in an advisory capacity.  Ms Finan is saying that was not true.  That is a contradiction in terms.</p></speech>

First, the University of Ulster report was not private to NAMA and, second, it was a coagulation and combination of a lot of publicly available information.  There was no particular information in that report that would not have been out in the market for anybody who wished to look at it.  Nothing else during the course of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee was ever at borrower or property level.  That I can categorically say.</p></speech>

Why was that?  There must have been important information or something in the papers distributed on any particular day which had to be kept private or secret or whatever word one would like to use.</p></speech>

There was absolutely no borrower discussion, no property discussion.  I can also only talk about the disclosures that were made with respect to the external members during the course of the four years.  It might just be appreciated, I suppose, that in any board or on any committee disclosures are personal to the individual.  The members of that board or committee will rely on every individual to be transparent and fully up front.  With the benefit of hindsight, if there has been an inadequate disclosure by any one individual or any other individual, that is not something that any singular or collective committee or board can ever control.</p></speech>

The witnesses stated there was not an option to work out the loans together with the supporting for the discount rate.  This is where the issue is confused.  All the back-up work done in respect of NAMA's formal strategy and the information in Appendix C, which was produced to the board on 12 December 2013, indicate that the work-out period was to 2020 and this is in line with NAMA's formal strategy.  That is obviously from where the Comptroller and Auditor General is getting that.  There is no documentation from NAMA to indicate otherwise.</p> <p>  In terms of the cashflows that are brought out, the sensitivity analysis referred to in Appendix C, which is reproduced on page 144 of the Comptroller and Auditor Generals' report, uses a discount rate of 2.5%, which is obviously lower than 5.5%.  One must accept that someone could have difficulty justifying a 10% discount rate given that none of the sensitivity analyses produced a discount rate of more than 5.5%.  Would the witnesses like to comment on the justification for the discount rate applied?</p></speech>

It is a fact that at that meeting the decision that was posed was would we consider collaborating further with the opportunity, potentially, to combine the portfolio rather than sell it piecemeal.  That was the decision and scope of that decision.  It was noted in December 2012 that the actual figure appropriate for sale would be paused for further analytics and further discussion at the board.  So there was a two-stepped approach.  During October and the December meeting it was would we deem this opportunity to collectively sell the portfolio worthy of further investigation and consideration.  The board was very happy strategically that that not only merited further discussion and consideration, but that actually it was incumbent on us to look at the opportunity and make sure were not asleep at the wheel or that we are not locked strategically into a work-out between there and 2020.</p> <p>  I do not feel I can comment on the ultimate value, subsequent to year-end.</p></speech>

Based on that evidence, it does not indicate any departure from the strategy or the 5.5% discount rate for this specific project.  The only other analysis is a lower analysis at 2.5%.  One of the witnesses said they disagreed with the significant probable loss.  It is very clear where he is getting it from because he can only act on the information and data given to him.</p></speech>

Also it was committee-wide and board-wide.  There was a verbal declaration - brief, but a verbal declaration.

It is not to do with this.  It relates to the PIMCO letter we received and read into the record last week.  The phone call referred to in the minutes deals with the arrangement of the fee.  The minutes recorded categorically based on the phone call talk about the fee-sharing arrangement that had been put in place by PIMCO.  That is based on the phone calls with PIMCO.  However, PIMCO's letter to us last week stated:</p><blockquote>It should be noted that the reference to &quot;a success fee arrangement (being) in place between PIMCO and Brown Rudnick&quot; noted in the report [the Comptroller and Auditor General's report] is inaccurate.  Whilst an arrangement was proposed by Brown Rudnick, it was never agreed to by PIMCO.</blockquote> <p>Before us, up to this letter, we have the record of the minutes that state there was a fee in place, we have the board minutes that state the fee was in place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that a fee was in place.  PIMCO's letter to us last week stated that there was never a fee in place; it was requested.  All I am saying is that the jury is out regarding those contradictory views.  In the interest of fairness, I want nobody to say just because NAMA said it, it is true and PIMCO is wrong.  Equally, I want nobody to say just because PIMCO wrote it in a letter, it is correct and NAMA is wrong.  I have to be fair.  I do not want people reaching conclusions just because we read out a letter.  There is a direct conflict there and we have to get behind that.</p></speech>

NAMA put up this defence a number of times; Mr. Daly said this when he appeared before the committee.  The restrictions in the process were to avoid what he called "tyre kickers".  NAMA wanted people who had the ability to put in a serious bid, which is fair enough.  That was the approach that was taken.

Fortress sent us correspondence.  I do not know if we can get Fortress's letter up on the screen.  It was a serious bidder.  We are told by NAMA that its presence was justification that the process was competitive.  So it was a serious bidder.  On its rationale for making a bid below the reserve price, it talks about the reasons it came in under the price.  One of the reasons is that the bid process required an unconditional bid which could not be syndicated or finance pre-bid.</p><p>If the opportunity to syndicate or to finance pre-bid was there, and this is what Fortress was telling us, it is possible it could have put in a higher bid.  These are serious players.  So when the Comptroller and Auditor General stated in his report that there were restrictions in terms of the sales process that could potentially have had an impact on the sales price, given that what Fortress has stated, does the witness see it as a potential problem and a fair question to be asked?</p></speech>

Fortress was one of the two bidders left standing.  It stated that one of the reasons it made a bid below the reserve price was because it required an unconditional bid and it was not able to syndicate or finance pre-bid.  We can get clarification but my reading of it is that if it was in the position to syndicate, Fortress could have made a higher bid and it would not have come in below the reserve price.  This was not just about tyre kickers, as it was put.  This was a serious bidder, which has indicated it could have put forward a higher bid.</p></speech>

I am saying a decision was taken by the board not to allow for syndication or for finance at the pre-bid stage.

Perhaps Mr. Corrigan could answer, as I have two other quick points to make.</p></speech>

I thank the witness.</p> <p>  My second point relates to the discount rate, the position in respect of which I will not rehearse.  Mr. Mulcahy stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General was wrong.  I had this conversation with other board members and representatives from the Department of Finance.  Just so we are all clear, in his report the Comptroller and Auditor General does not question the 10% discount rate being applied to Project Eagle in the context of it being a loan set.  He does not have a difficulty with that and he has clarified the point.  That is not the point of contention.  Was Mr. Mulcahy aware of that and does he accept it?</p></speech>

There was mischaracterisation of what the Comptroller and Auditor General-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.925" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mulcahy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016111700002#Y01600"><p>No, the Deputy is mischaracterising what I said.  The fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General stated that he makes no judgment of a commercial or strategic nature is not true.  He goes on to make precisely that.  The judgment that I object to is that he argues that instead of taking &pound;1.3 billion, if NAMA had worked out some other strategy for the portfolio, it would have made more and it would have been a better commercial decision.  I am saying I think that is wrong.</p></speech>

He never stated that they had to be held until 2020.  There was a &pound;1.49 billion valuation in terms of assets based on fact.  There was no evidence to suggest anything other than that.  The witness has accepted the point that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not have a difficulty with the 10% being applied as a market discount in terms of the Project Eagle sale because it was a loan sale.  The witness is acknowledging that it was not a criticism of his.</p></speech>

The third and final point is also important and it is directed to Mr. Corrigan.  It is very important that we understand what information was given to the board with regard to conflict of interest.  Mr. Corrigan was on the board when Mr. Ronnie Hanna would first have informed it that he or somebody else got a call from PIMCO about a problem.  There were conference calls but Mr. Hanna gave the information to the board that there was a problem.  There was a discussion between Mr. Corrigan and Teachta McDonald earlier concerning minutes and dates.  What is Mr. Corrigan's recollection - rather than what is in the minutes - of what was presented to the board at the time on the perceived conflict of interest between NAMA and Mr. Cushnahan, Brown Rudnick and Tughans?  What information does Mr. Corrigan recall being presented to the board?</p></speech>

I do not believe the board had any issue with Brown Rudnick or Tughans; it was Mr. Cushnahan with whom it had a problem.</p></speech>

I will read from the PIMCO letter.  It states "In April 2013, PIMCO was approached by Mr. Tuvi Keinan, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick who then introduced PIMCO to Mr. Ian Coulter of Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan".  When we asked for that information, we got it.  We, as a committee, asked for the information.  We asked what happened and when and PIMCO indicated it was approached by Brown Rudnick, acting on behalf of and with Mr. Coulter and Mr. Cushnahan.  That is quite explosive, as Mr. Cushnahan was a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee at the time.  It goes back to the point that this was the genesis of everything because there was no Project Eagle at this point, April 2013.</p> <p>  My point relates to when Mr. Corrigan was first made aware of a conflict of interest.  He stated that he cannot remember being told and it is obvious that he was not told that, in April 2013, those three individuals or parties were touting different bidders for business.  If he was told, it was presented in a fashion that did not ring true.</p></speech>

Project Eagle was the code name given to the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.

My name is Mark Neporent.  I am the chief operating officer and general counsel for Cerberus Capital Management.  I appear before the committee today on behalf of that entity and also with the authority and permission of our affiliates, Cerberus European Investments and Cerberus European Capital Advisors.  For today&rsquo;s purposes, I will refer to all of those entities and their affiliates as Cerberus.</p> <p>  As stated in the committee's letter to me dated 17 October 2016, Cerberus was invited before the committee to assist it in its examination of the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with respect to the following matters: how Cerberus became involved in the Project Eagle sales process; the basis for Cerberus submitting its bid; Cerberus&rsquo;s engagement of Brown Rudnick; and the context around the assurances that were provided to NAMA regarding Cerberus&rsquo;s advisors and fee arrangements.  Cerberus welcomes this opportunity to assist the committee in its work.  I will start by reading this prepared statement that I hope will assist the committee in understanding our position on these matters and in respect of the Project Eagle sales process.</p> <p>  Cerberus is a private investment firm based in New York City and has been a leading investor in loan portfolios for over twenty years in the Americas, Asia and Europe.  Our investment strategy often focuses on the acquisition of sub-performing or non-performing loans, which we refer to as NPLs, many of which are secured by real estate.  Cerberus combines financial expertise with the infrastructure, capital and experience to service these NPLs, including the utilisation of our network of loan servicers.  As the largest, or one of the largest, acquirers of NPLs in the world, we have engaged in over 80 transactions in many different countries, with more than 40 sellers since 2010, pursuant to which we have acquired over 1.2 million loans from over 1.2 million borrowers, which had an aggregate unpaid principal balance, UPB, of over $80 billion.</p><p> Cerberus first became aware of the opportunity to purchase the Project Eagle portfolio when it received an unsolicited approach from Lazard on behalf of NAMA on 6 February 2014.  At that time, Cerberus had no knowledge of the transaction or any of the other bidders or advisers involved.  We note that PIMCO's submission to this committee dated 8 November 2016 states that three potential bidders were contacted by Brown Rudnick in 2013.  Cerberus was not one of those bidders.  At no time prior or subsequent to our involvement in Project Eagle has Cerberus worked directly or indirectly with PIMCO or any other actual or prospective bidder in the Project Eagle process.  Cerberus was formally admitted to the process on 14 February 2014.  NAMA openly communicated at the outset that it had set an initial reserve price of &pound;1.3 billion for the Project Eagle assets.  That reserve price was later revised downward by NAMA to &pound;1.23 billion to reflect interim asset sales or resolutions by NAMA and, again, this was openly communicated to Cerberus by Lazard on behalf of NAMA.  Lazard, on behalf of NAMA, made it plain from the start that the timeline for the sale process would be condensed and that only limited information would be made available in the data room.  Although this presented Cerberus with certain challenges, the process and the timeline was manageable given the depth of our team and our experience.  Cerberus submitted its bid of &pound;1.241 billion to NAMA on 1 April 2014.</p><p> The Cerberus preparation of its bid entailed the careful consideration of numerous factors, including the analysis of information made available to Cerberus in the data room.  Although Cerberus did not know what competing bids would be made, we believed, based upon our discussions with Lazard, that other bidders were taking the process very seriously and that if we were to be successful, we would need to submit a competitively priced bid at or above the stated reserve price.  Cerberus was informed on the evening of 3 April 2014 that its bid had been accepted by the board of NAMA.  NAMA announced the sale on 4 April 2014.  We have since learned that Cerberus submitted the highest bid.  Our bid was approximately &pound;141 million higher than the next highest bid.  We were the only bidder to bid above the reserve price and to allocate the purchase price as requested by NAMA in its terms.  The acquisition was formally closed on 20 June 2014, several months after the announcement of the award.  The purchase price is as shown at figure 2.2 on page 28 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We note that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggests that NAMA believes Cerberus owes it approximately &pound;2.8 million under the applicable purchase documents, which, if my maths is correct, equates to 0.0023% of the purchase price.  We do not agree with the figures cited and there is an ongoing reconciliation process which typically occurs with transactions of this size and complexity.  We are engaged in an active and professional dialogue with NAMA on this matter and expect that a mutually satisfactory resolution will be reached very shortly which will result in an additional payment by Cerberus to NAMA.</p><p> Although Cerberus has extensive experience in acquiring and managing real estate portfolios in Europe, we had no investment history or experience in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland prior to the acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio.  A decision by Cerberus to invest in a new jurisdiction is not undertaken lightly but only following careful research, investigation and due diligence to ensure we understand the local political, social and business concerns relating to the proposed investment.  We recognised the added complexity with Project Eagle because the loans were under the ownership and control of NAMA, a Republic of Ireland governmental entity, while the portfolio was comprised primarily of Northern Ireland assets.  The Project Eagle transaction was not a simple acquisition of assets, but as we anticipated, it has resulted in substantial ongoing involvement in the local markets, including detailed work-out activities and negotiations with borrowers.  Cerberus was keen to understand whether there were local sensitivities associated with making an investment in Northern Ireland.  Accordingly, we adhered to our long-standing practice of having senior Cerberus executives engage with representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive to explain our investment strategy and practice and to understand local political, social and business concerns relating to our proposed investment.  As a global investment firm, we understand the need to be sensitive to such concerns and to engage as a good corporate citizen.  We expended significant time, effort and money to ensure we developed a comprehensive understanding of the political, social and business issues relating to an investment in Project Eagle before we decided to commit this large amount of capital.  The decision to bid in the Project Eagle process was taken only after these due diligence efforts.</p><p> It is common with acquisitions of this type for Cerberus to engage a number of lawyers and other professional advisers to assist it in the preparation of a bid.  As stated above, the need for a wide range of advisory and support services was particularly acute in these circumstances.  Cerberus engaged Brown Rudnick as one of its advisers to provide both legal and strategic services in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio.  Brown Rudnick was formally engaged on 24 March 2014.  This engagement followed an unsolicited approach to Cerberus from Mr. Tuvi Keinan, a partner at Brown Rudnick, in mid-March 2014 offering his firm's services in connection with the Project Eagle portfolio.  Brown Rudnick explained that it could assist Cerberus with its due diligence and evaluation of the Project Eagle portfolio.  Brown Rudnick did not itself have a presence in Northern Ireland but advised Cerberus that it had been working with Tughans and its managing partner, Mr. Ian Coulter.  We understood Tughans to be a well-regarded local law firm.  Brown Rudnick provided Cerberus with due diligence material containing information and research relating to the portfolio's borrowers' guarantees, assets and potential business plans.  Brown Rudnick directly advised Cerberus that Brown Rudnick was at liberty to share this information.  Brown Rudnick also offered to provide legal and strategic advice relating to the bid process and to help Cerberus position itself effectively with key stakeholders.</p><p> As the timeframe for the submission of a bid was condensed and only limited data had been made available in the data room, Cerberus understood that there was potential value in the services Brown Rudnick, and through Brown Rudnick, Tughans, was offering.  Brown Rudnick proposed from the outset to be paid a fee of &pound;15 million for its services.  It was agreed that Brown Rudnick would share half of the fee with Tughans, who would be engaged by Brown Rudnick, not by Cerberus, to supplement Brown Rudnick's work.  The proposed fee was only payable in the event that Cerberus completed the deal and succeeded in acquiring the Project Eagle portfolio.  Ultimately, Cerberus agreed to the fee on the basis that the services offered were expected to be especially useful under the circumstances and, when looked at as a percentage of the reserve price, the fee was approximately 1.1%, which we viewed as within a customary advisory fee range.  Brown Rudnick also told Cerberus that if Cerberus did not wish to enter into this arrangement, it would offer its services to another prospective bidder.</p><p> Cerberus is committed to high ethical standards in the conduct of its business.  This commitment is and always has been a paramount component of our culture and what we call our "tone at the top".  Prior to engaging Brown Rudnick, the Cerberus legal and compliance team held discussions with Mr Keinan and a number of other partners at Brown Rudnick, including a partner based in London who had previously been the head of enforcement at the UK's Financial Services Authority.</p><p>Cerberus was formally assured that Brown Rudnick was able to enter into the proposed arrangement, provide the services being offered and share the information Cerberus was told had already been compiled by Brown Rudnick.  The Cerberus legal and compliance team negotiating the terms of engagement with Brown Rudnick required Brown Rudnick to provide certifications, representations and warranties covering a number of issues, including compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws.  Cerberus also required Brown Rudnick to obtain the same representations and warranties from Tughans, which it did.</p><p> In advance of Cerberus being selected as the preferred bidder, NAMA sought and Cerberus provided information on the way in which it had agreed to compensate its advisers.  Cerberus disclosed this information, including its engagement of Brown Rudnick, Brown Rudnick's engagement of Tughans and the existence of the success fee arrangement.  This was known to NAMA in advance of its announcement on 4 April 2014 of Cerberus as its preferred bidder and well in advance of the closure of the transaction on 20 June 2014. </p><p> NAMA also requested certain assurances from Cerberus that no fee, commission or other remuneration or payment was payable to any current or former board member of NAMA, any current or former member of the executive of NAMA or any current or former member of an advisory committee of NAMA in connection with any aspect of Cerberus's participation in the tender process.  Cerberus sought and obtained specific confirmations on the matters requested by NAMA directly from both Brown Rudnick and Tughans.  Only after receiving these specific confirmations from Brown Rudnick and Tughans and in a reliance on them, did Cerberus respond to NAMA providing the assurances sought.  Aside from seeking these assurances, NAMA did not express any concern or reservation about Cerberus having engaged Brown Rudnick, or Brown Rudnick's engagement of Tughans.  </p><p> Cerberus is confident that no improper or illegal payments have been made by Cerberus or any of its affiliates in connection with the Project Eagle portfolio.  Cerberus did not direct or authorise anyone to make any such payment on its behalf.  Until it was informed by Brown Rudnick on 18 April 2015 of the Law Society of Northern Ireland's investigation into Mr. Ian Coulter's conduct, Cerberus had no knowledge of Mr. Coulter's alleged use of the Tughans fee or his alleged intentions.  The terms of our engagement expressly prohibited Brown Rudnick from engaging any other person to work on this transaction.  For the record, Cerberus had no contact or dealings with Mr. Frank Cushnahan at any point before, during or after the acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio. </p><p> We invested in Project Eagle in good faith.  We are confident that we behaved and acted appropriately at all times and that without a doubt our actions have been professional and correct.  Project Eagle is the subject of the UK National Crime Agency's ongoing investigation and also investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice in the United States.  We are co-operating fully with these investigations.  As they are ongoing, there are limits to what I will be able to discuss today.  I am also restricted in discussing individual borrower cases and commercially sensitive information because of strict confidentiality rules and obligations owed to borrowers and investors.  Where I can, I will seek to be as helpful as possible to the committee.</p><p> That completes the introductory remarks that I wish to make.  Cerberus very much appreciates the committee's invitation to attend this meeting and allow us to share our perspective.  I will happily take questions on the matters the committee has invited me to discuss and will answer the ones that I can.</p></speech>

It had an understanding of their business plans, the quality of their businesses and the quality of the borrowers.  It understood, or purported to understand, the local economy and we regarded that information, as well as the ability to access stakeholders through its affiliation with Tughans, as potentially very valuable.  Of course, one has to look at this in the context of the very condensed bidding process.  We were thinking this information could be very valuable commercially to us in seeing whether we could get to the reserve price and actually participate in the bid.</p></speech>

It is a good question.

We were assured, through a number of conversations with a number of Brown Rudnick lawyers, that the provision of this information for us would not involve any client conflict or have a bearing on borrower secrecy or any non-public or confidential information.  It was on the basis of these representations that we accepted its services.</p></speech>

Mr. Neporent repeated that information relating to the portfolio of borrowers, guarantees, assets and potential business plans was available.  Am I correct in assuming that the provenance of the information was by means of ongoing, perhaps lengthy personal engagements with the debtors concerned?  Is that how Brown Rudnick came across the information?  I am sure Mr. Neporent asked the company because he had to confirm for himself that the information was bona fide.  How did Brown Rudnick explain to Mr. Neporent the nature of its examination of the portfolio or the work the company had been doing on it from March 2013?</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Neporent can confirm for the committee that he - at the time that Cerberus engaged Brown Rudnick - did not know of the circumstances in which PIMCO had withdrawn from the bidding process.</p></speech>

Cerberus was told when we were approached by Mr. Keinan on or about 14 March.  I do not know if it occurred in that conversation or in another conversation on 19 March.  Mr. Keinan advised us that they, Brown Rudnick, had been acting with PIMCO and that PIMCO had withdrawn.  They told us there were a number of reasons that PIMCO had withdrawn.  One reason was there was a lot of turmoil going on at PIMCO at the time.  The Deputy may or may not know that around that time Bill Gross, the PIMCO chief executive officer, was in the middle of some controversy and was in the midst of leaving PIMCO.  This was big news in the financial sector.  Mr. Keinan told us that NAMA had a concern with PIMCO because PIMCO had disclosed to NAMA that it had a relationship, or that it intended to have a future relationship, with Frank Cushnahan, if PIMCO was to win the bid.  We were told that Mr. Cushnahan would be an adviser to PIMCO post bid.  We were not told that Mr. Cushnahan was working - had been working - with Brown Rudnick or Tughans before that.  We were not told that he was intended to be paid.</p></speech>

There were many hundreds, and probably thousands, of cumulative legal hours spent of this.  I do not really know how to answer the Deputy's question.  It is the firm's hourly rate multiplied by the hours spent.</p></speech>

In the absence of the approach by Tuvi Keinan, and Cerberus would have no choice but to continue with its existing legal advisers, with which it was happy, and if by having Tuvi Keinan bestowed no advantage on Cerberus over Fortress and Mr. Neporent said that it won the bid anyway, I wonder what the cumulative amount of fees that Cerberus may have paid would have been.  I am just trying to get a picture of that because there are only a finite number of hours between Cerberus finding out in February about this and ultimately purchasing it.</p><p>I am conscious of how much money Cerberus may have saved.</p></speech>

We paid the &pound;15 million and we also paid our other lawyers and many advisers.  Our cumulative fees, including the Brown Rudnick fee, for this was somewhere close to &pound;35 million all in.  If we did not have Brown Rudnick, we would have paid that amount less &pound;15 million, if that is what the Deputy is asking about.</p></speech>

Our purpose in providing him with that letter of investment, which I assume the committee has, was to have him understand our approach in making this sort of investment and explain that we wanted to be long-term investors and to understand the environment and that this would not be a fire sale, that is, we would not just get the loans and blow all of the borrowers out the door.  We wanted to have a longer term relationship.  It would not just be a one-and-done deal.</p> <p>  We also addressed guarantees in that letter and said that we would consider the matter on a case-by-case basis.  Most importantly in that letter is our preference for having consensual resolutions with borrowers.  Across the $80 billion of unpaid principal balance, UPB, that we have bought through more than 40 deals since 2010, the majority of our resolutions have been consensual.  We find that everybody fares better when we have that sort of consensual environment.  Indeed, that is what happened in this case, with the majority of resolutions being consensual.</p></speech>

We ensured that they understood who we were, because we did not have visibility in the Republic or the North.  We ensured that they understood what our approach was to borrowers.  Of course, we were alive to the issue of NAMA being a Republic entity and the borrowers being in the North.</p></speech>

It refers to April 2013, which is around this time involved.  The year long work would have started to kick in at this time, in March or April, that Mr. Keinan and Brown Rudnick would have been talking about.  That letter states: "In April 2013, PIMCO was approached by Mr. Tuvi Keinan, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick who then introduced PIMCO to Ian Coulter of Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan, with whom Brown Rudnick appeared to be working to identify potential purchasers for the NAMA Northern Ireland loan portfolio...".

Then PIMCO withdrew from the process and it was employed by Cerberus, which then had access to all of the information that they had over the course of the year.  Mr. Neporent said that he was assured by Brown Rudnick that they had it confirmed by PIMCO that they were able to share that information.  Is that his understanding?  Can he confirm exactly what he meant by that?</p></speech>

Did they go to you to be released from that non-disclosure agreement and then use the information they had to supply to Cerberus?  </blockquote> <p>Mr. McDonagh, who is a member of the NAMA executive and board said, &quot;No, they never came back to us&quot;.</p><p>The Chairman followed up:</p><blockquote><b>Chairman:</b>Does Mr. McDonagh understand?  Is he saying that anyone who went into that data room, even though they signed a non-disclosure agreement, could use the information they got to go off to someone else?  That is what Mr. McDonagh is telling me has happened.<br /><br /><b>Mr. Brendan McDonagh</b>: No, that is not what I am telling the Chairman.  I am telling the Chairman very clearly that Brown Rudnick and Tughans did not access the data room after PIMCO left.<br /><br /><b>Chairman:</b>What of the information before they left?<br /><br /><b>Mr. Brendan McDonagh</b>: Whatever they were doing when they joined Cerberus, or whatever they were doing for Cerberus, they could not have used any information they got under the PIMCO process.</blockquote><p>NAMA's understanding was that they could not use any information, which seems to be different to Cerberus's understanding.</p></speech>

What I specifically asked Brown Rudnick prior to our engagement was in connection with the information and the material it was going to give us and whether there were any restrictions - legal, contractual or otherwise - on the use of the information and on the provision of the information to us.  My question was not limited solely to PIMCO.  It was limited to how it got the information from anywhere.  My direct understanding was it had the contractual right to share that information with us.  To the extent there is information in the data room, and we have never done an analysis to see whether it overlapped, I had the information anyway.  We had access to the data.</p></speech>

I do not doubt his credentials or those of Cerberus in general but there is one line in the statement at paragraph 4.1 to the effect that Cerberus is committed to high ethical standards in the conduct of its business and that this commitment is and always has been a paramount component of its culture and tone at the top.  I do not like the tone of this comment.  It very much goes to the crux of the issue with regard to Mr. Neporent and his firm.  It smacks a little of elitism and a culture that exists.  Before Mr. Neporent arrived, we spoke about the auspicious name of the firm, Cerberus, which is the three-headed dog that guards the gates of hell.  It is quite interesting because it seems to be guarding a culture of opportunism and, in my view, there was opportunism at play.  Mr. Neporent stated that there was an unsolicited approach from Brown Rudnick to the firm but, nonetheless, questions arise in respect of the process in itself.</p><p>At the bottom of paragraph 3.3, Mr. Neporent states that at no time prior or subsequent to Cerberus's involvement with Project Eagle did it work directly or indirectly with PIMCO or any other actual or prospective bidder involved in the process relating to project.  He also states, at paragraph 3.13, that Brown Rudnick provided Cerberus with due diligence material, a point he confirmed earlier to Deputy Cullinane and two other Deputies.  These statements do not tally because there is an indirect link.  A moment ago, Mr. Neporent stated Brown Rudnick had a contractual right to share information with Cerberus.  This is of concern because in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General there were many complaints by other bidders who stated they did not receive enough information on the portfolio assets or enough time.  I am of the view that Cerberus was given an unfair advantage because of the salient and vital information it had on making the bid.  It was also the only bidder over the reserve price.  It is also very interesting that it had no investment history - Mr. Neporent stated this himself - in Northern Ireland heretofore.  Then it engaged this firm which approached it and an opportunity was taken.  Cerberus took an opportunity.  The risk was taken only on the basis that it would secure the bid.  This is the underlying theme.  The comment made, almost as an <i>obiter dictum</i>or off-the-cuff remark, about tone at the top indicates this to me.</p><p>What is also interesting is that NAMA described the assets as low value but Cerberus was still interested in bidding.  I know I have spoken a little bit, but I would like Mr. Neporent to answer some of this for me, if he does not mind.</p></speech>

Of course there was an opportunity.  The opportunity was generated by NAMA.  NAMA put the portfolio up for sale.

That is evident and I presume Mr. Neporent would accept this.  It is almost a rhetorical question.  I will move to the question I want to ask.</p><p>Cerberus knew the reserve price was &pound;1.3 billion.  It would have been in the interests of Cerberus to know if there were other bidders and how many there were.  Would Cerberus try to find out such things while it was in a bidding process?</p></speech>

One would like to know what the competition was and what they were doing.  Often, though, that information is not available and can only be speculated on.  In a transaction of this size there are only a handful of logical bidders, of which PIMCO is not really one.  PIMCO is not really recognised as a player in this market, something which was recognised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has only a small percentage of the market and there are only a handful of players that one would expect to see.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Neporent mentioned Brown Rudnick offering its services to another bidder so Brown Rudnick obviously knew there was another bidder to whom it could go if Cerberus did not take its services.

We asked for the reasons.  He said he did not really know but he thought potentially it was related to some issues in PIMCO with Bill Gross resigning or being under a cloud of controversy at PIMCO.  He also mentioned to us that NAMA was unhappy that PIMCO had had an agreement with Mr. Cushnahan, a former NIAC member, to be compensated for services post-transaction.

We keep asking NAMA what would have happened had it rolled out an asset-by-asset sale over a longer period, and sold them individually or in small groups, rather than a loan book sale.

Are things going well?  Does Cerberus force sales or work out arrangements with the borrowers and try to work out the assets gradually?  Is Cerberus putting pressure on borrowers?

Our experience across many portfolios in many jurisdictions is that it works out better in the end to have consensual resolutions be as large a percentage of the portfolio as possible.  It is our business strategy.  It was out business strategy and it has been our business strategy every other place we have done non-performing loan portfolio acquisition work, across Europe, the US and Asia.

All I can say is that our preferred method is to resolve things consensually.  In a portfolio with approximately 2,200 loans, 900 properties and 55 connections, there will be some disagreements with borrowers.  When we took over the portfolio, approximately 22% of it was already in enforcement of foreclosure proceedings started by NAMA.

How Cerberus spent its &pound;15 million is its affair but there is one sentence I am intrigued by and Mr. Neporent has given a reason in paragraph 3.15 of his opening statement in which he states: &ldquo;Brown Rudnick also told Cerberus that if Cerberus did not wish to enter into this arrangement, it would offer its services to another bidder.&rdquo;  Essentially Cerberus was closing it off going somewhere else.  As a business person, I would have said, given that Cerberus was in a high bid situation part of the reason it might pay somebody who said it had an insider&rsquo;s knowledge is to get the benefit and to close that person off going somewhere else.  Let us be pragmatic about it.</p></speech>

PIMCO told us in its letter to the committee, and Mr. Neporent need not be expected to know this, that in April 2013 it was approached by Mr. Keenan, a partner in Brown Rudnick.  To be pragmatic, quite a bit of work had to be done by some people before they got to approach PIMCO.  I would have assumed reading that letter that Brown Rudnick had been in the field with people, prior to the day it approached PIMCO because it must have gone to PIMCO with something.  I would feel there is a strong possibility that the work on this had commenced quite a long time before March 2013 because it could not have started on that day.  Mr. Neporent cannot comment on that because it was not working for Cerberus.</p> <p>  I can understand how there might have been an issue for Brown Rudnick not being able to disclose the information it got from the February-March period, the bidding period but there was no involvement with NAMA before the formal sales process commenced.  I could see how any information Brown Rudnick had gathered through its own resources prior to the bid processing could not have been covered by a non-disclosure agreement with NAMA.  Would Mr. Neporent think it would be free to use that type of information?</p></speech>

Although this was Cerberus&rsquo;s first involvement here it must have been one of its biggest transactions.  It did 40 transactions at $80 billion, that is an average of $2 billion each and this one is coming in at approximately $5 billion.  This would be quite a big transaction, not the biggest I am sure, or maybe it was.</p></speech>

Cerberus then engaged their services on 24 March and we have established that it was bringing to the table information on debtors and assets.  Interestingly, Mr. Neporent refers to an abstract of each loan, a view of the debt, business plans, etc.  NAMA's testimony to the committee is that the debtors were being very awkward and not playing ball with it in producing these plans.  However, Mr. Neporent states Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan were able to produce some form of business plans for Cerberus' perusal.</p></speech>

That is fair enough.  That demonstrates that Cerberus was not blindly taking a chance on the &pound;15 million.

It established that by virtue of having sight of a number of samples, as the witness referred to them.  It makes perfect sense to me.

The bit that astonishes me, which has remained the position of Cerberus and NAMA, is that NAMA had no notion of Brown Rudnick being involved with Cerberus until 2 April.  The witness may keep me right on those dates.  In other words, the agency did not know Brown Rudnick had any involvement with Cerberus until the bid was in.  To put it one way, I am a bit sceptical of that.</p></speech>

I have a number of quick points seeking clarification about times and dates.  I will also seek clarification from the witness on a number of issues that he has raised but I am just not clear on some times and dates.  In his opening remarks, Mr. Neporent indicated that at no time prior or subsequent to involvement in Project Eagle has Cerberus worked directly or indirectly with PIMCO in respect of the Project Eagle process.  I would have thought that was obvious and I am wondering why it was put in the opening remarks.</p></speech>

We had very lengthy discussions with representatives from NAMA in this committee at which they were shocked by, and very obviously exercised about, the fact that there was an arrangement between Mr. Cushnahan, Tughans, Brown Rudnick and PIMCO, so shocked that PIMCO had to go, and they were going to force PIMCO out of the process.  It was a clear conflict of interest to them that was very concerning.  They then have a conversation with Cerberus about a success fee that involves Brown Rudnick and Tughans and they do not mention Mr. Cushnahan or any difficulties or issues.</p></speech>

I would have expected Mr. Neportent, if he does not mind me saying, to have stated it in his opening statement merely to give us the benefit of the information that there had been a technical violation of the non-disclosure agreement rather than leaving it to chance.  Obviously, it came to Mr. Neporent's attention and it would be material to our considerations.  Are there any other matters that came to Mr. Neportent's attention as he prepared for this session that he now wishes to place on the record?</p></speech>

Brown Rudnick obviously was a difficulty for it because of its relationship with PIMCO and Mr. Cushnahan.  Mr. Neporent stated that it never mentioned Frank Cushnahan to him when he had a conversation with it.  My point is that the first it heard of any association between Mr. Neporent's company and Brown Rudnick was on 2 April, and yet the deal was closed on 4 April.  It is more a question for NAMA, as to why it did not conduct more due diligence in regard to all this.</p></speech>

It was clear, when Mr. Daly was here a month ago, that it happened very late, it was very tight and very quick and that there were e-mails flying all around the place to get those undertakings at short notice.  Mr. Daly said that and we can take that up with him on Thursday next.</p></speech>

I merely want to be fair to a witness who was here yesterday.  I think Mr. Neporent clarified it already.  In his written submission in September 2015 to the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr. Neporent mentioned meeting the deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness.  Mr. Neporent clarified today that he did not actually meet him.  It is just that I put it to the deputy First Minister yesterday.  In paragraph 2.8, Mr. Neporent stated he met a number of Northern Ireland politicians, and he mentioned the former First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and Mr. McGuinness, among others.

Mr. Maxim Peshkov, to today's meeting to discuss, among other items, the situation in Syria and Ukraine.  We are all shocked on a daily basis by the suffering of the people of Syria, particularly the people in Aleppo where the constant bombardment has affected so many lives killing and injuring thousands of civilians.  The rest of the world has a duty to do everything in its power to ensure this ceases as soon as possible.  As we in this country are very aware, this can only be achieved by dialogue between the opposing groups.  The carnage and horrors inflicted upon the people of Syria cannot be allowed to continue.</p><p>Before I call on the ambassador to make his contribution, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording and broadcasting equipment in the chamber even in silent mode.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I now call on H.E. Mr. Maxim Peshkov to make his opening remarks.  </p></speech>

Mr. Maxim Peshkov" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016111700002#F00100"><p>I am very grateful for this invitation.  The direct exchange of views on any issues of interest to both sides is positive and helpful to deepening the understanding between us, our countries and our countries' politicians.</p> <p>  First of all, it is my duty to say a couple of words about the bilateral relations between Russia and Ireland.  I must stress that we are ready for business interaction on all levels, including contacts between parliamentarians of both countries.  In previous years, Russian and Irish parliamentarians planned some positive initiatives, for example, the boosting of activities of the group of friends of Russia in the D&aacute;il and the visit of the speaker of the council of federation, the upper house, of the federal assembly of the Russian Federation, Mrs. Valentina Matvienko, to Ireland. </p> <p>  Unfortunately, I do not have the exact figures for this year, but in 2015, the volume of Russian-Irish bilateral trade decreased by 32.5% in comparison with 2014 and came to $1.1 billion.  Russian exports fell by 19% and came to $271.6 million.  Imports from Ireland dropped by 36% to $831.6 million.  Therefore, Ireland is on the slightly more positive side from the point of view of our trade exchange.  This year, we have very interesting projects of co-operation between Russia and Ireland, mainly in aviation.  I am sure that these plans and projects will grow wider and deeper.</p> <p>  Ireland ranks in seventh place among foreign investors to Russia, behind Germany, the UK, China, the Netherlands, Luxemburg and Cyprus.   As we see it, our task is to preserve gained potential of the trade and economic relations and, if possible, to increase it by introducing new projects in spheres of mutual beneficial interest.  I must stress that economics and trade are not the only focus of our attention.  We have very close relations and co-operation in fields of humanitarian activity, education, arts, culture and so on and so forth.  The committee will know that annually in Russia we have traditional Irish events, such as St. Patrick's Day.  We also celebrate a pancake day in Russia, as is done in Ireland.  It is one of our biggest cultural events.  Groups and artists from Russia come to Ireland from time to time to show their art.  As far as I know, at the end of this month, there will be a ballet group from St. Petersburg and an opera group from Russia performing in Ireland.  That is ongoing.  </p> <p>  I prefer not to lecture.  I prefer to answer questions.</p><p> There were two points on the proposal for our meeting - Syria and Ukraine.  The main point of our position on Syria is that the only possible way to solve the Syrian crisis is through political means.  As far as we understand, the results of the last contact between our President and President-elect Trump was that this point is mutual for both sides.  We will see how we will manage it but the only forces that must be and are excluded from the peace process are terrorists, mainly ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra.  Those two forces are officially proclaimed as terrorist organisations.  They are the main goals of our attacks in Syria and, as far as we know, they are the main goals of the attacks by the coalition led by the United States in Iraq.</p><p> As for Aleppo, unfortunately, too many fakes and lies are circulating about this part of Syria including the bombing of civilians, the use of unconventional weapons and so on.  The Chairman is right.  Civilians are being killed there but the question is by whom.  As far as we know, there are dozens of shelling incidents every day from the eastern part of Aleppo against the western part of Aleppo.  Members will know that this eastern part of Aleppo is under the control of terrorists mixed with opposition forces.  The western part is under the control of the Government of Syria.</p><p> Accusations and allegations have been made, particularly in recent days, that Russia is using its air force to bomb and so on.  I stress and remind the members that as of today, it has been exactly one month since we used our air force in Aleppo.  We stopped it on 17 October, one month ago from today.  Syria's air force is doing the same, therefore, allegations or accusations about Russia bombing schools, hospitals and so on in Aleppo are a complete lie.  There was a briefing in the State Department yesterday at which the official representative, if I am not mistaken, spoke about six hospitals and one school that was bombed and so on.  He was asked to show the address of the school and the hospitals.  There was no answer.  Every time we ask for the facts in terms of where, who and how, we do not get an answer.</p><p>With an array of American and Russian military satellites over this zone, which can control every square metre of the situation, it is very questionable as to why they do not show maps or video materials.  Where is the evidence?  If real evidence is shown, it is okay.  If not, it is a lie.  I am sure there will be more questions about Syria.</p><p> As for Ukraine, I will be very short.  Our position is the Minsk agreements must be fulfilled.  It is the only way out of this situation in the eastern parts of Ukraine.</p></speech>

With current reports of assaults on Homs and Idlib, as well as Aleppo, does the ambassador believe that the Russia and Syrian Governments are doing everything required to protect civilians as required under international law?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Maxim Peshkov" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016111700002#H00300"><p>Not only do I believe but I am sure that we are doing everything we can.  It is impossible to guarantee 100% the security of every civilian.  Does the Chairman know that for more than one month we organised and guaranteed six humanitarian routes to eastern Aleppo, as well as two additional routes for the opposition, as we can call it, to leave eastern Aleppo?  Unfortunately, very few people use these routes.  Why?  The radicals on that side of Aleppo closed these routes, meaning very few people have had a chance to go away from Aleppo.</p> <p>  In the Syrian Government part of Aleppo, there are camps and hospitals for people coming from eastern Aleppo.  Just yesterday, we sent six children from Aleppo to Russia for treatment.  They have special diseases which could not be treated in Syria itself.  The six children, with their parents, are now in Russia going through this period of treatment.  These are not wounds from shooting, but serious diseases like musculoskeletal diseases.  Every week, we are sending our own humanitarian assistance to Aleppo.</p><p>Unfortunately, according to our information, when this assistance of food and medicine reaches the eastern part of Aleppo, the biggest part of it is caught by terrorists or opposition - however one wants to call them - and civilians get a smaller part of this humanitarian assistance.  The same assistance is given via the Red Crescent of Damascus.  In these activities, the United Nations humanitarian bodies are taking part also and we assist them in sending these commodities to Aleppo, and we are doing our best.</p><p> We are not aiming at any civilian populated zones with our shelling.  War is war, as the committee will understand, but we have had very clear and good intelligence there in place of a technical nature, from space, by drones and by those working in the field.  We aim our bombs and shelling only at the places where real terrorists are situated.  It is rather difficult.  By the way, as the committee will be aware, two days ago a rather big fleet of our naval ships came to the Mediterranean and we began our new shelling from these ships of the zones where terrorists are situated.  They say several bases and a factory where they were producing explosives were hit by our rockets.</p><p> Also, we may be closer to part of the political solution of this problem.  The committee will be aware that our military forces have been in Syria for more than one year.  During this year, we managed to sign nearly 900 local peace agreements with local groups of opposition, groups of villages, smaller cities, towns etc.  We feel that it is part of a real political process.  Maybe some of these Syrians who take part are backing Assad and his team.  Others call themselves "opposition", but they are not fighting.  They have their arms, they have their munitions but they are not fighting with Damascus.  They say that they are ready to take part in a wider political process.  As for how it will be managed, a basis exists in the Geneva communiqu&eacute;.  The roadmap is clearly written in this but the negotiations are ready.</p><p> By the way, we, the Russian side, not only have contacts with Damascus and with our western or eastern partners about Syria, but have contacts, negotiations and talks with the representatives of the Syrian opposition.</p><p>It is ongoing.  We are not angels and the committee members are not angels either.  Bashar al-Assad is not an angel at all.  We live in real life.</p></speech>

It is good to have this conversation, and the ambassador mentioned the importance of dialogue.  Regardless of who is doing what to whom in Syria, we can all agree it is an appalling humanitarian crisis.  When I looked at footage from the siege of Aleppo, it reminded me very much of the footage I saw of the siege of Stalingrad.  The Russian people have been in that situation and I hope, just as so much went into the rebuilding of Russia, that people will be prepared to do as much when the time comes for the rebuilding of Syria.</p> <p>  On getting aid to civilians as well as access to food, water and medical aid, we talk about medical aid for the victims of the war but what has been forgotten is the vital medical aid for those who had illnesses before the war started, such as diabetes, asthma and a range of cancers.  Those people have gone very far down the list when it comes to aid.  There are dangers that the aid is selective, with aid going to certain places but not to others and so forth.  I wish to hear a little more on that.  The ambassador mentioned that children are being evacuated, but will he say more about what Russia is doing?  The ambassador is critical of the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Damascus, so will he elaborate a little on Russia's role in the humanitarian agenda?  Many countries are bombing Syria.  It is incredible that a peaceful protest years ago has degenerated into the current situation.  This was a functioning country with access to medicine and education, regardless of the human rights issues there.  My first question was about aid.  Has Russia taken any refugees as other countries are doing?  We are all aware of the refugee situation.</p> <p>  Second, will the ambassador go into more detail about the peace process and what he sees as Russia's role in it?  Does he agree that all the players must be involved?  He mentioned the roadmap but it would be good to hear more about it.</p> <p>  With regard to Ukraine, the ambassador said political dialogue is the way forward.  There is an agreement for the Foreign Ministers to meet.  Is that happening?  How soon can we expect to see an end to that situation?</p> <p>  Russia has withdrawn from the International Criminal Court.  Perhaps the ambassador would elaborate on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1685" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016111700002#K00400"><p>I welcome the ambassador.  We would all agree that few of us here are angels, so there is agreement on that for a start.  However, we can all accept that the situation in Syria is truly one of the worst humanitarian disasters we have witnessed in recent times.  I wish to put it on the record that I do not see myself as a pacifist so I am not approaching this from that angle.  However, we must be consistent with the principles of international law.  I believe that the use of force can sometimes be necessary as a last resort to prevent the deaths of others or the repression of people.  I have been horrified by the brutality, the violations of international law and the suspected war crimes being carried out by all sides in the conflict.  That is my perspective.</p> <p>  I watched an interview recently with the UN ambassador to Syria.  He spoke about the aerial bombing of eastern Aleppo.  His belief was that Russia had come to the conclusion that the aerial bombardment was not working.  Russia has resumed that aerial bombardment.  It is supposed to be aimed at ousting approximately 900 whom the ambassador describes as terrorists.  However, there is a population of 250,000 or more in that area.  Does he believe there is a military solution to the conflict in Syria?</p> <p>  We have all watched reports about the hospital.</p><p> Is the ambassador stating the hospital that was supposed to have been bombed in the past couple of days does not exist?  If so, will he elaborate on that?</p><p> The humanitarian corridors in eastern Aleppo have failed.  The UN have vented their frustration that aid has not been allowed into Aleppo.  What is the reason for the failure of the humanitarian initiative? </p><p> I am a supporter of the International Criminal Court, ICC, and it needs to investigate all sides in the conflict.  President Putin signed an order to withdraw Russia from the ICC yesterday.  Can the ambassador elaborate on and outline the reason that Russia is withdrawing?  Is Russia seeking to block efforts by France and other EU member states who are supporting the efforts to launch an investigation into war crimes in Syria, and in particular to bring President Assad to the International Criminal Court?  Mr. Peshkov posed a question as to who is sponsoring the jihadists in eastern Aleppo.  Does he have a view on what countries in the region are involved?  Will he elaborate on that?  I have asked already whether this is a solution to the seven years of conflict.  I reiterate the only way forward is through dialogue, inclusive round-table talks, world leaders using their influence and so on.  It is foolish to believe we can bomb to a solution to the Syrian conflict.</p><p> In regard to the Ukraine, I am in the minority on this committee, but I think the Ukrainian people have suffered under corrupt and ineffective governments for far too long.  There has been a deterioration in the socioeconomic conditions and an effective bankruptcy of the Ukrainian State.  This probably also is a minority position but I think some of the recent problems in Ukraine stem from the EU, US and Russia playing a zero-sum political game with Ukraine.  Rather than trying to railroad Ukraine down one particular political route, I think the EU and Russia should have been working together to try to create some sort of beneficial and non-exclusive economic and political social relationship with Ukraine.  I think that is the solution in that region. </p><p> I have a number of questions on it.  The conflict has claimed 9,000 lives, tens of thousands of people have been displaced.  In the opinion of the ambassador, why has so little progress been made in implementing the proposals outlined in the Minsk agreements? </p><p> The referendum that took place in Crimea on 16 March 2015 was another factor in escalating the crisis.  As the referendum was held under the worst possible conditions, including poor security, a tense atmosphere, international pressure, the short run-in, the lack of open and democratic debate, press restrictions and the lack of dialogue preceding the referendum, would the ambassador agree the referendum was not in line with good democratic practice?  I am not opposed to referendums to decide self-determination but there must be agreement on good democratic practice and I do not see it in this situation.</p><p> A Dutch-led investigation has concluded that a powerful surface-to-air missile system was used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines' plane over Ukraine two years ago, killing all 298 people on board.  It was trucked in from Russia at the request of the Russian-backed separatists and returned to Russia the same night.  What is the ambassador's response to that damning report?  </p><p> The Turkish military shot down a Russian jet in November 2015, but recently there seems to be a warming between the two countries.  Is he concerned about the serious issue of Turkey's role in continuing to arm, train and fuel jihadists involved in the Syrian conflict?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1688" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Maxim Peshkov" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016111700002#M00200"><p>I will start at the very beginning.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about humanitarian aid, medicine, etc.  Part of this issue connects to Deputy Crowe's question about who is to blame for the humanitarian routes not working.  I ask the committee to believe me when I say that Russia is not to blame.  We open them and we do not block them.  We try to use them.  I will explain what we are doing with regard to medicine.  Our hospitals are working directly in Syria.  Mobile hospitals linked with our military base are working in Syria.  Some of our non-military doctors and medical personnel are working in local hospitals.  Of course we would like to do more, but we are doing what we can.  We do not see any other foreigners doing the same things from a medical point of view.  We are the only ones doing this work on this side of the situation.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan also asked about refugees.  I do not think we have many refugees from Syria in Russia.  Perhaps some families have moved to Russia, but I do not think very many have done so.  Those who come to Russia from Syria tend to have family or ethnic links with people living in Russia.  I know there are such links between Kurds.  We have a rather big Kurdish diaspora in Russia.  Some family members of people who have migrated to Russia - perhaps not forever - have travelled to Russia to stay with their relatives, etc.  In many cases, those who are already living in Russia are from nations other than Syria, especially the nations of the Caucasus region.</p> <p>  I would not be able to tell the committee exactly how many foreign migrants live in Russia.  I think it is between 6 million and 7 million.  Most of them come from the CIS countries.  The majority of these migrants are economic migrants rather than refugees.  We have between 500,000 and 600,000 refugees - not more - and most of them come from the eastern parts of Ukraine.  As the majority of them have refugee status, they have places to live, work, etc.  The whole map of the migrants in our country can be completed with reference to Afghans who fled from Afghanistan when the mujihadeen came to power.  There are some migrants from other countries, but not very many.  The majority of migrants living in Russia are economic migrants from all parts of the CIS countries.</p> <p>  The next question Deputy Crowe asked about Syria related to the blocking of the French resolution at the UN Security Council.</p><p>The story of this resolution is interesting.  On the eve of the sitting of the UN Security Council the Minister for Foreign Affairs in France was a guest of our Minister in Moscow.  They discussed the contents of the resolution on Syria.  They were working on the text of the document.  We had agreement from the French side to include our position in the resolution.  Both sides were glad and happy and said goodbye.  Our French friend flew to Washington.</p><p> After talks with his American colleague, they proposed a draft to the sitting of the UN Security Council.  Not even one paragraph of our position was included in spite of the fact that our French colleague said he would do it.  This resolution was one-sided.  Not one word was included relating to the crimes of terrorists, ISIS or representatives of other terrorist forces and so on.  That is why we expressed our surprise to French colleagues and vetoed this resolution.  That is the simple answer.</p><p> I will address both questions about the criminal court.  I am unsure whether the committee is aware of it but neither the United States nor China is a member of this body.  During recent years, South Africa and some other African countries, perhaps Ghana, stepped away from membership of this criminal court.  The only reason is an absence of trust for the body.  During the 14 years of the existence of this criminal court, it has spent $1 billion and worked on only four cases.  In other words, it worked on four cases in 14 years.  That is the answer.  There is no trust and the court is not working at all.</p><p> Next is the question of Ukraine.  By the way, how does the Deputy understand the word, "separatist"?  That is my question.</p></speech>

They want to be part of Ukraine.  However, at the same time they want to have far more autonomy within the frame of Ukraine.  Ukraine is their motherland and they do not want to separate from it.  I appeal to committee members to be more attentive in formulating their positions.  They should be more attentive and closer to reality.  These people do not want to separate from Ukraine.  That is one point.</p></speech>

That is the main idea of the Minsk document.  My advice to the Deputy is to read it attentively.  It is a very interesting document.  All the points necessary to solve this situation in the eastern part of Ukraine are written there paragraph by paragraph.  Everything is clear.  The main idea is that the sides, Kiev and Lugansk and Donetsk, must fulfil the obligations they signed.  As soon as they do that they will find a way out of this crisis, not immediately of course, it must be done step by step.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about the role of Russia, Europe and the United States and other forces to help Ukraine but did not say a single word about what Ukraine must do.  It must do something to solve its own problems.  The Deputy is quite right about the level of corruption in the country.  It is not just my opinion but that of the analysts, even those in the West who write about the situation in Ukraine that the level of corruption is higher than before the coup d'&eacute;tat.  I do not know how to solve this problem.  It is not Russia's problem to solve the corruption problems in Ukraine.  </p> <p>  As for co-operation we are ready for any kind of co-operation.  There is a small town in the south of Ukraine called Genichesk.  The Deputy might find it on Google maps.  I tried and found it.  The town has annual problems with gas.  Before the coup d'&eacute;tat in Kiev it was taking gas via Crimea.  When all these things happened it was partially using its own gas but that was not enough for the winter.  Last year and this year the Crimeans opened their pipes to this town and are sending gas to it as a kind of humanitarian assistance because it does have money to pay.  Maybe afterwards there will be an exchange of accounts between Russia and Ukraine on this issue but it does not matter because the Crimean Government decided to give this assistance to its neighbour.  It is the only real way to achieve co-operation and mutual understanding.  The same happened last year when the Crimeans sent gas to this city.  On the contrary, Ukrainian radicals, not the Ukrainian Government or people, cut the electricity lines from continental Ukraine to Crimea.  It was a humanitarian catastrophe and I do not know if the Deputy is aware of this fact.</p></speech>

We are ready for any type of co-operation with it, be it on gas, fulfilment of the Minsk agreement or any other type of co-operation.  The next interesting thing is that the main slogan of Maidan People's Union before the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>and afterwards was &quot;Ukraine is Europe&quot; - geographically that is nonsense because Ukraine was, is and will be part of Europe - and that it wanted to be part of the EU.  That was all.  We said okay.  At the very beginning, during the time even before Yanukovych, we were telling our Ukrainian friends that if they wished to be a member or associated member of the EU, they were welcome, but let Moscow, Kiev and Brussels get together and see what the consequences of this association would be, especially the economic part.  We will have to construct new economic barriers for Ukrainian commodities if Ukraine becomes a member of the European free market.  Why?  It is to guarantee the security of our own economy.  We have special additional agreements with European countries on trade, the economy, tariffs, costs, prices and so forth.  We were telling our Ukrainian friends, &quot;You want to go this way.  Okay, let us sit down and begin the account.  Who will win?  Not us, and not you.&quot;  They did not want to do it, so now what do we see?  The main slogan of the coup d'&eacute;tat was to sign the agreement of association with the EU.  Then the process began.  What do we have now?  There is no result at all - no political association and no economic association.  The reason is that now the Netherlands is against ratification of this agreement.  What was the reason for the bloodshed, splitting the country and the beginning of civil war?  It was to get nothing.  We do not understand.<br/><br/>I think I have answered the question.  Incidentally, I have the text of the Minsk agreement and I can give it to the committee.</p></speech>

I appreciated the meeting.  I conveyed to the ambassador the terms of an all-party Seanad motion, tabled at my instigation, that we had passed condemning the bombardment of civilians in Aleppo and other areas in Syria.  Dialogue is  important on these issues.  As others have said, we are all in agreement about the appalling humanitarian crisis in Syria.  We would all join in condemning outright the brutality ISIS and its allies have perpetrated on the civilian population.  However, there are some clear issues for Russia's representatives to answer, in particular, Russia's involvement in the siege of eastern Aleppo, which has resulted in civilian deaths.  I know the ambassador has responded to some questions about that.  There is the matter of Russia's involvement in particular attacks which are fairly well established, in particular the attack on the aid convoy in September which led to the deaths of 12 aid workers.  We had this discussion last week and I know the ambassador has said that these are fabrications and so on.  Would Russia support international investigations into these attacks, into the deaths of civilians as a result of the bombardment and, if necessary, the bringing of President Assad of Syria before the International Criminal Court?  Would the ambassador support investigations in that way?  That is my first question about Syria.</p> <p>  To follow up on Deputy O'Sullivan's question on the peace process, the ambassador described Russia's involvement in negotiating 900 local area agreements to try to stop fighting.  That is very welcome but does he see a way forward to restart the Geneva process and how will Russia try to bring that forward?  With the election of President-elect Donald Trump in the United States, of whom many of us are critical, does the ambassador see a change in approach in negotiations on a resolution of the nearly seven year old war in Syria?</p> <p>  On Ukraine, there are some clear issues, if we are all agreed on them, that Russia illegally annexed the Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.  In response to that and in response to Russia's failure to play a constructive role in the implementation of the Minsk accords, the EU imposed sanctions which Ireland clearly supports.  We were very concerned to see the report yesterday that Russia is repudiating the International Criminal Court, albeit that it is symbolic.  I know the ambassador has pointed out that South Africa has signalled its intention to pull out.  Burundi and Gambia are the other African countries which have similarly signalled-----</p></speech>

I know it is a symbolic gesture, but nonetheless it is a gesture that many of us would see as concerning.  It does not bode well for Russia's intentions to engage with the EU and others in terms of achieving resolution of the issues in the Ukraine which have led to 9,000 deaths.  What progress does the ambassador see happening with the implementation of the Minsk agreements?</p><p>I have read the package of measures regarding the implementation of the Minsk agreements.  I realise that there has been some movement on the disengagement plan.  However, a roadmap is supposed to be finalised with foreign Ministers by the end of November in order to address all aspects of the Minsk deal and how full disengagement from areas of conflict will progress.  Can the ambassador indicate the progress on this process?  In December, the EU Council will review the issue of sanctions currently in place until the end of January.  Certain and clear deadlines are in place.</p><p> Reference has been made to Ukraine.  The ambassador gave me a document, dated 9 November, from the information and press department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation concerning EU Council sanctions against Russia.  The tone of the document was somewhat threatening in the sense of being rather critical of the EU sanctions.  The document also states that Russia will take appropriate response measures.  Can the ambassador indicate whether yesterday's announcement about the withdrawal from the International Criminal Court was a response measure?  If so, will there be other response measures to the EU sanctions or can we see more constructive engagement with the Minsk process?</p></speech>

First, I am keen to say that some of us think we are angels.  I have never been involved in anything following which I would have considered myself not to be an angel.  As a country, we are used to conflict and terrorism.  It is not unusual for us to listen to reports of terrible things that have happened to people.  We are used to it.</p><p>As has been said by everyone else, the things that have happened to the people of Syria are atrocious.  I am not going to repeat what has been said already.  I have a comment from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation before me.  It states:</p><blockquote>We paid attention to the irresponsible statements on Russia that have been popping up with disturbing regularity in connection with the events in Syria ... We cannot but condemn these actions that have been dictated by the biased view of what is happening in Syria and the distorted perception of our actions against terrorists.</blockquote> <p>Earlier, the ambassador used the word &quot;fake&quot;.  A saying in Ireland holds that there is no smoke without fire.  Why does the ambassador think these opinions exist?  Why does the world &ndash; I use the term widely &ndash; have these opinions?  What does the ambassador think Russia can do to change the minds of people and to prove that these statements are fake or that these impressions are not true or correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1714" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016111700002#R00400"><p>Does the ambassador accept that Ukraine and its people are entitled to get on with their lives and make their own decisions on whether they wish to have associate agreements with the EU or anyone else?  Does the ambassador accept that it is about time the Ukrainian people were allowed to do this?  I visited Ukraine twice in an official capacity.  The misinformation one gets is horrifying in this scenario.  I met university students in Ukraine.  They have no intention of joining the EU.  They want to be free to move between Europe and any other part of the world, and they should be allowed to do that.  I am horrified by the misinformation.</p> <p>  Let us be truthful and honest about this: there is resentment on the part of Russia that Ukraine is now totally independent.  Russia has taken over Crimea.  Russia should let the Ukrainian people decide for themselves.  They have a government.  Russia should let the people decide whether they go west or east and whether to stay where they are at present.  I see no attempt by the European Union to invite Ukraine as a member state or to interfere in any way with the Ukrainian relationship with Russia.  It is an independent country and it should be allowed to remain independent and make its own decisions.</p><p>It is not for the European Union or Russia to interfere with Ukraine in making those decisions.  It is simple as that, as far as I am concerned.  What is happening to Ukraine is a terrible shame, especially when one has had the opportunity, as I have had, to speak to young Ukrainians who just want peace and to get on with their lives and be able to travel freely, like every other citizen within the greater European boundaries.  It is about time we all stopped codding each other about the pretence that we are not interfering.  We are interfering with the independence of Ukraine and it should stop.  The same is happening in Syria.  I have been there on many occasions as a former Minister for Defence.  I used to go there when I visited our troops in Lebanon.  I used to meet the Minister for Defence who was also the Vice President of Syria.  Again, what is happening there is a terrible shame.  We can make all the excuses we want about bombings and killings, but the big question is who is defending what in Syria.  Why are we trying to defend the indefensible?</p><p> Every part of the world has become unsettled and it is due mainly to interference by outsiders in solving internal problems.  What are Russia's proposals for Syria?  When does it intend to withdraw from it?  What I would like to know is what is its desired end result in Syria.  Equally, I would like to know what its desired end result in Ukraine is.  Is this going to continue?  Are young people never going to have an opportunity to call themselves Ukrainian and be proud of the fact that they are Ukrainians?  Are they never going to have an opportunity to make their own decisions on whether they want to be part of a European entity or totally independent?  In Ireland we had to put up with this for many centuries and know what it is like.  It is about time we all stood back and asked the question as to what we are trying to achieve.  In the meantime, thousands upon thousands are losing their lives and young people's careers and prospects are being severely damaged.  I would like to hear from the ambassador what exactly is the agenda of the Russian Federation in both countries.</p></speech>

Is there a real desire to have a just peace in Syria?  What is Russia's position or is it, as we are seeing, just a question of continuing to bomb until eventually somebody throws in the towel and there is a winner?  There will not be any winner in Syria, least of all the Syrian people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1717" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Maxim Peshkov" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016111700002#S00300"><p>I will begin with the last question.  The main desire is to rebuild and reconstruct this poor country to make it as stable as it was before.  On who will lead the country, that is not our business.  It is not Ireland's business and it is not the business of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Turkey or any other country.  Syria can manage and solve the problem by voting.  For this process, the roadmap - the Geneva I and Geneva II communiques - outline everything: how, when, what and so on.</p><p>One could ask how one should reach what is set out in the Geneva communiqu&eacute;s.  I agree that when we are speaking about the situation in Syria we are speaking about a humanitarian crisis.  I also agree that we are speaking about hostilities, but from time to time we forget with whom we are fighting and what is happening.  I mean not only Russia, but others such as Iranians, Damascus, the United States and their team.  We are fighting with ISIS.  We are fighting with terrorists.  This goal is our united goal.  It is our common goal to fight with those forces.  I do not understand how we can fight without firing or bombing.  I am not a military person.  Perhaps the military knows some special way to fight without fighting but I do not know how.  War is war.</p><p> The main thing then is that if we are a little more philosophical and look to the roots of all the events in the Middle East, not only in Syria, but what happened in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Egypt, Algeria and Syria.  Can we blame Russia?  Did Russia go to Iraq and explode the whole situation in that country?  No.  Did Russia begin the crisis in Syria?  No.  We went there only when the fire was very hot in that country, to help the legal government of Syria to fight with ISIS, with terrorists.  That is our common goal.</p><p> I pose a question for everyone.  If one sees a reasonable way out of the situation to fight ISIS and not to harm civilians please tell us, advise us, and not only us but others who take part in the war against terrorists.  It is very simple to theorise, to say something is good or bad but when one gets down to the soil and sees what is happening in reality, it is quite a problem to find a way out and how to solve the problems.  All of us - us, the United States, their coalition, our allies - say that the only real way out is political.  Everybody agrees on that but to reach that stage needs efforts from elsewhere, not only from our side and not only from Damascus, but from those in opposition who calls themselves moderate.  If one calls oneself moderate, then one should show one's readiness for a political solution.  One should agree to a ceasefire and leave the zones where real terrorists are active.  Then we will have a real opportunity to fight with the terrorists.  When I say "we" I do not mean only Russia.  I mean all those who are fighting with terrorists in Syria, Iraq and other places.  That is it.</p><p>How can it be solved?  God knows, but we are doing our best to reach a deal.  </p><p> The next question was about Ukraine and independence.  The Deputy spoke about the Ukrainians and said, "let the people decide".  So, he gives this right to Kiev but not to the people of Crimea.  They do not have the right to express their will to live where they want to live, with whom they want to live and so on.  Only Kiev has this right and the Crimean people do not.  By the way, if -----</p></speech>

It was Kiev.  It sent so-called trains of friendship full of well-armed military.  Radicals were sent to Crimea to tell the people to behave themselves as the radicals deemed fit.  Fortunately, local paramilitaries, with no assistance from the Russian military, closed the border and turned the trains back.  That was an attempted invasion.  Of course, the Deputy knows much more than I do about Russia and the Russian military in Crimea.  He must believe me and try to be objective.  If one gives a right to people to do as they want on one side, why not give the same right to people on another side?  </p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Ukrainian decision on the European question was not only about visiting Europe.  That was not the main idea.  The main idea was to become an associated part of the European Union.  Maybe some of them were dreaming about membership of the EU but they got a clear answer from Brussels that it would be impossible in the circumstances.  Even the issue of association is now rather fragile.  The main idea was to attempt to turn Ukraine's economic priorities towards Europe.  As we see it, they were attempting to be fed by two mothers.  They wanted to have good co-operation with Russia and, at the same time, very good co-operation with Europe.  We said, "Okay, we are not against that".  However, we argued that they must take up a calculator and determine the pluses and minuses of opening up their economic borders with Europe.  </p></speech>

Sanctions are not positive for Russia, for Ireland or for Europe as a whole.  There is now some movement against sanctions in countries like Italy, France, Greece, Cyprus and so on.

We appreciate his attendance at the committee.  Since 2011, the indescribable conflict in Syria has been on our agenda at practically every meeting.  All our members have outlined very serious concerns regarding the horrors, carnage and massacre of innocent people over five years in Syria.  Those concerns echo the views of the Irish people.  There is disbelief that the international community can still allow this carnage and massacre of people, and the lack of aid getting to people in most distress, to continue.  We ask the ambassador to bring back to his government the very serious concerns of this country regarding the ongoing conflict, which must be brought to an end as soon as possible.  We appreciate the ambassador's participation.  Thank you.</p> <p>  The joint committee is adjourned until 1 December.  We may have two select committee meetings before that regarding Estimates for foreign affairs and defence.  We will notify members as soon as dates have been arranged.</p></speech>

A copy of the presentation has been circulated in advance to members of the committee.  In the time allocated to me, I do not propose to go through the pack in detail.  Therefore, my opening remarks will reference a number of slides and I will hopefully deal with those.</p> <p>  Our presentation includes a range of details, including updates on key highlights from the bank's interim results for the first six months of 2016; our interim management statement from 28 October 2016 which updated the market on our financial performance; the regulatory environment in which our bank operates; our mortgage business and our approach to mortgage pricing; our position on mortgage arrears; and some details on the governance we have both internally and externally.</p> <p>  In addition we have returned to the committee the answers to the range of questions sent to the bank in advance.  I thank the Chairman for his compliments to my colleagues who endeavoured to answer those questions.  At the outset I must briefly reference the requirements that Bank of Ireland must observe as a public company.  We are quoted on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  We make extensive disclosures to our shareholders annually through financial statements, presentations and other materials during our financial year, including our annual report, interim report, interim management statements and other markets as appropriate.</p> <p>  All statements made and information provided in this public forum are considered to be market information which is disclosed to all stakeholders at the same time.  Therefore it has to be capable of verification and has been verified.  Any comments that my colleagues or I make must adhere to the same standards.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that the State holds a 14% discretion shareholding in the bank, which has 86% private sector ownership.  The State's shareholding is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Under our approved EU restructuring plan, with all state aid having been paid, the relationship between the Minister for Finance and Bank of Ireland is governed by a relationship framework agreement, which recognises that the bank is a separate economic entity, is managed on a commercial basis and engages with the Minister for Finance in accordance with best institutional shareholding practice.</p> <p>  Our financial performance is covered in slides 4 to 8.  Slide 4 should give the committee some enhanced understanding of the scale of our business and our operations in the Republic of Ireland.  We have a comprehensive multichannel distribution platform, including Ireland's largest branch network, augmented by 1, 770 self-service devices.  We have more than 440,000 active mobile phone customers.  We have market-leading positions across the financial sector in Ireland serving 1.7 million personal and 183,000 business customers.</p> <p>  Slide 6 sets out our business highlights for the first six months of this year.  As I have already updated the market, I reaffirm that the group has continued to deliver on strategic priorities.  One of our strategic priorities is obviously lending money and we have continued to be the largest lender into the Irish economy having advanced &euro;3.5 billion of new money to Irish businesses and consumers in the first half of 2016, an increase of about 14% on a similar period last year.</p> <p>  The group continues to reduce the quantum of non-performing loans and the absolute number of customers who are in a non-performing category.  We report an underlying profit of &euro;560 million for the first six months of the year and all our trading divisions are contributing to group profitability.</p> <p>  Slide 7 outlines the geographic regions from which we derive our income.  Approximately 70% of income from our group's operations comes from our businesses in the Republic of Ireland; some 25% is derived from our business in the United Kingdom, which includes, because it is in the sterling area, our universal banking business in Northern Ireland; and the remaining 5% of our total revenue is derived from our international operations, which are probably exclusively in continental Europe and the United States of America, through our leveraged finance business.</p> <p>  Slide 8 gives some detail on our engagement with the communities in which we operate and serve in Ireland.  We have a number of activities which from our perspective are focused on encouraging enterprise, particularly in local communities, and supporting in particular small businesses and start-ups.  Most of these events take place in our local branches where our business customers are invited to showcase their business and advertise their products and services to new and existing customers.  During our last national enterprise week in May 2016, we hosted 750 events countrywide and approximately 3,000 businesses took part.  We will have another such event starting next week.</p> <p>  We also have an activity, called "enterprise towns" where we work with the local communities, businesses communities and sports, social and charitable organisations hosting major community events which are open to the public.  These activities are important to us as a commercial business to encourage community development in rural Ireland.</p><p>We have been looking at the configuration of our branch network, the reduction in the number of people utilising our branches and the fact that we have that space.  We have been converting a sizeable amount of the floor space within the branch network and we provide it to start-up businesses on a free basis to start their businesses, engage with each other and get advice from our staff.  We have opened five of those to date, two in Dublin and one each in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  More than 500 start-up companies have used Bank of Ireland workbenches to start their business.  That is important to us because it encourages enterprise and also, hopefully, those people will let us quote for their business.</p><p> Slide eight shows the continuing investment being made in the bank meeting our changing customer needs.  In that context, I wish to mention the work we do with customers in the Republic to support them in the use of new technology, whether that be desktops, use of the Internet or smartphones.  In particular, we are conscious of the fact that some of our customers are at different life stages or have different familiarity with the digital world.  We have groups of advisers throughout our branch network who engage with the active retirement groups, transition year students, business customers, farmers and community groups by holding events in our branches, local halls, communities, libraries, nursing homes and so forth.  That supports our customers not only in how to interact with us through online channels but also in being more comfortable using technology generally.  We have had 3,000 such sessions with senior customers so far this year.</p><p> Slides ten to 16 set out some key points from our interim results in more detail.  Obviously, because of the nature of this engagement and the fact the members are representatives of the taxpayer, we have set out the fact that we received &euro;4.8 billion from the taxpayers.  That money has been repaid in full.  We have returned in excess of &euro;6 billion in cash to the taxpayers for the investment and the contingent liability support that was provided.  I confirm that as of October the taxpayers do not have any risk or liabilities to Bank of Ireland under the eligible liability guarantee scheme.  The State holds a 14% shareholding in Bank of Ireland and at today's share price that is worth approximately &euro;1 billion.</p><p> Slides 18 to 20 detail the latest financial performance update, which we provided to our shareholders in October.  That confirms that we continue to trade in line with our expectations and continue to meet our financial objectives.</p><p> Slide 19 focuses on asset quality in the business.  It confirms that we continue to make significant progress in reducing the quantum of non-performing loans across our group.  They have reduced by &euro;800 million to &euro;9.1 billion at the end of September and the defaulted loans have reduced by &euro;600 million to &euro;8.1 billion.  I confirm that the reductions are across the geographies in which we operate and across the asset classes - corporate, property, business, mortgages and unsecured consumer lending.</p><p> I am providing the committee with a market update as well.  In the nine months to the end of September our total new lending in all of our business, including into the Irish market, was &euro;10 billion.  That compares with &euro;9 billion on a constant currency basis for the same period in 2015, so our new lending is up approximately 11% on the same period last year.  Our capital ratios continue to be supportive of our strategy.  Our core equity tier 1 ratio on a fully loaded basis was 10.5%, and in the period from the end of June to September we generated approximately 30 basis points of organic capital.  I should point out that since the end of September the movement in international bond yields will have significantly reduced our accounting deficit and our capital ratios will have improved quite materially in recent weeks because of that accounting movement in our defined benefit pension schemes.</p><p> Given the committee's focus on mortgage pricing and mortgage arrears, slides 26 to 30 give significant detail on that.  Slide 28 reflects our pricing strategy.  We keep all our pricing for all our products across the group under constant review and there is a range of factors for the bank, as a responsible lender, to consider.  In terms of mortgage pricing in Ireland, we have a particular focus on fixed rate mortgages.  I confirm that 75% of new mortgages provided by the Bank of Ireland in the Republic of Ireland in the past nine months have been at a fixed rate.  Our mortgage lending in the nine months to the end of September has increased from our mortgage lending in the nine months to the end of 2015.</p><p> Slides 32 to 39 give comprehensive detail, which is also covered in the questions, on our mortgage arrears.  Again, the mortgage arrears show that there has been a continued reduction in owner-occupier and buy-to-let mortgages in arrears.  At the end of June 2016, 3.3% of Bank of Ireland's owner-occupier Republic of Ireland mortgage arrears were greater than 90 days in arrears.  That compares with an industry average, excluding Bank of Ireland, of 9%.  Bank of Ireland mortgages in the Republic of Ireland which were greater than 720 days in mortgage arrears also continued to reduce.</p><p> Slides 43 to 44 give some further detail, outside of the financial results, of the work we do within the community, particularly in Ireland.  In May 2016, Bank of Ireland was awarded a businesses working responsibly mark from Business in the Community Ireland for our work in that regard.</p><p> We set out in slide 46 why we are highly focused on our strategic objectives.  We remain Ireland's largest lender.  We have market leading positions across our businesses.  Our businesses are strong and financially robust.  Our business model is working for our customers and our shareholders.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  I and my colleagues look forward to the members' questions, although perhaps not necessarily look forward to them but hopefully we will answer them professionally.</p></speech>

I thank him for the extensive information provided in advance of the meeting and the answers provided to the questionnaire.  I acknowledge the overall improvement in the bank's performance as it moves to a more stable environment following the severe economic crisis we experienced in recent years.</p> <p>  I will focus on mortgage pricing.  As Mr. Boucher indicated, the bank puts a big emphasis on fixed rate products.  That is evident from the fact that 75% of the bank's new lending in the mortgage area is on fixed rates.  That is a clear strategy on the part of the banks.  However, on the variable rates, the bank is still charging up to 4.5% for many customers at a time when the cost of funds for the bank is less than 0.75%.  The bank is still charging some customers more than six times the cost of the funds the bank is accessing.  How can that be justified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1765" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#E00300"><p>We have a very clear strategy on this, and in particular we have reflected on some of the lessons of the past.  One of the issues in the past was that there are two reasons people can have problems repaying their mortgages - either their income falls or the cost of repaying the mortgage goes up.  As a bank, we do not take interest rate risk.  We have traders who take intraday risk, so we cut out as a bank on an ongoing basis.  Even though we trade in the markets all the time, we cut out interest rate risk.  We are a commercial business and we must consider how we use our shareholders' money.  We are deliberately incentivising customers to move to fixed rates.  We believe that the current interest rate environment is abnormal.  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a material shift in bond yields even in the past three weeks.  If anyone is taking out a 20-year mortgage and they do not believe that interest rates are going to rise over that 20 years, I would ask them whether they should really be making this investment.  If one does not think interest rates are going to rise over the next 20 years, that means the world economy will still require massive quantitative easing from the central banks.  That is an unrealistic proposition.</p><p>This is a very deliberate strategy.  We are trying to encourage our customers to move to fixed rates.  They get certainty on what they repay and we get certainty from our point of view.</p><p> I would like to reiterate for anyone watching or listening - I will use the free advertising - that every one of our existing customers can avail of a fixed rate.  Every one of our existing customers could save money today, if he or she is on a variable rate and goes on a fixed rate.  Obviously, going to a fixed rate binds one into a period of time, but we say one can go into a three-year fixed rate and one does not have to fix one's entire mortgage.  One can save money and one can get certainty on the repayments.  That is our strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F00200"><p>It is fair enough that Mr. Boucher availed of the opportunity to highlight that.  Is Bank of Ireland being proactive in communicating with its customers and outlining the savings that they can make?  Typically, his customers can get a fixed rate of approximately 3.5% and yet many of them are paying 4.5% on a variable rate.  They could switch and save 1% for a year, or perhaps sign up for two years.  What is Bank of Ireland doing to inform customers of the available options?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1768" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F00300"><p>Obviously, this is always a personal choice for a customer because it is a different decision to move from a variable to a fixed rate, but we use a variety of mechanisms to point out the opportunity.  We have to be careful not to encourage.  If it was my decision, I would do it.  For example, in every annual statement we send out to our customers on an ongoing basis, we point out our product range.  We are not allowed to actively encourage a customer to switch from one product to another but we have to inform the customers.  However, I am using this opportunity, as a public statement, to say that I think it is a sensible thing to do.  We would not promote a product unless we thought it was sensible.</p></speech>

Our average variable rate mortgage is approximately &euro;95,000.  Therefore, some of our customers may not consider the potential savings - it is still money and every &euro;1 is a saving - worth their while.  I think it is worth their while.  The process is easy.  One contacts us and provides an updated valuation.  The reason one provides an updated valuation is, for example, on a three-year fixed, it is either 3.5% or 3.1%, depending on where one is.  We think it is a good idea.  I understand the point Deputy Michael McGrath is making, but that is our strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1771" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F00600"><p>I would argue that, as a product, Bank of Ireland's variable rate pricing is too high.  It is way overpriced.  From what Mr. Boucher is saying, that is a clear strategy on the part of the bank.  Bank of Ireland is happy to be an outlier on the variable rate pricing in an effort to encourage more customers onto fixed rates because it provides certainty to both the bank and customer.  Is that Bank of Ireland's strategy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F00700"><p>That is a very carefully considered strategy.  I am talking to the members, as public representatives, but I explained this to our shareholders because, ultimately, if we provide an incentive to customers, it is shareholders' money.  It is a deliberate incentive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1773" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F00800"><p>I want to ask about the rate incentives that apply in Bank of Ireland UK.  Bank of Ireland UK has a two-year fixed rate of as low as 1.43% and the two-year rate on a high LTV is 2.69%.  How long are those rate incentives in place for an individual customer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F00900"><p>It would depend on the product but it typically would be two years.  We do it slightly differently.  Each market has a different characteristic.  For new mortgages in Ireland, that is, for switchers, for first-time buyers etc., we provide cash incentives.  It probably works out roughly the same in terms of the incentives to the customer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1775" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F01000"><p>Then why is there such a difference, for example, between a 3.5% fixed rate in Bank of Ireland in the Republic and a fixed rate in the UK and in Northern Ireland of 1.4%?  That is a significant difference.  I accept it is time limited.  As Mr. Boucher stated, it is typically for three years, but how can that significant gap in the pricing be justified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F01100"><p>For a new mortgage in the Republic of Ireland, we provide 2% in cash and then there is 1% if one stays with us for five years.  It equates to the same thing.  It is just that in different markets there are different practices but, as an incentive, it probably broadly similar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1777" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F01200"><p>There is an incentive there.  I would argue for the borrower it is much more sustainable to be on a good rate - the 2% back is a one-off payment - but people will weigh that up themselves.  It is attractive for people to get a lump of cash back, if they are buying a new home and they are furnishing etc., but I would argue having competitive rates is in the long-term best interests of the customer.</p></speech>

Very few cases, 39 cases, are completed.  The bank referred 301 eligible cases to the Housing Agency.  Can Mr. Boucher tell us why mortgage to rent is so slow?  Why is it not really working?  Why are the numbers not coming through?  In the case of long-term arrears, why is that scheme not working?</p></speech>

As a commercial organisation, mortgage to rent is a produce that we would promote.  There are issues around stock.  There are issues about the availability of the finance to local authorities etc.  We have been working, in particular, with the responsible Department, both as a bank and as part of working groups.  We have pointed out areas where perhaps processes could be streamlined etc.  We have continued to engage with the Department.  However, it is difficult for us, as a bank, to identify those but we would be happy to.</p></speech>

It has been out for some time.  On the previous occasion we were before the committee, we gave a number of recommendations, as did other institutions.  To be fair, there has been movement in July 2015 and we have seen progress taking place.  I am cognisant of the fact that there has been some progress, although we would agree with the Deputy.  We would like to see more progress as well.</p> <p>  Of the 301 cases, we had the most cases going through.  However, there are limits in relation to house valuations.  Given the limit is &euro;350,000 in Dublin, it does not include many houses within the threshold.  The limit is &euro;250,000 outside of Dublin.  The income limits are also challenging.  On negative equity, there has been a significant move from negative into positive equity with the house price movements and it has restricted the number of cases that are eligible for it as well.  Further movement on those thresholds and limits would be helpful.  It is a scheme that we believe in.</p></speech>

I would like to hear Mr. Boucher's observations on the economy.  What is he, as a bank CEO, observing?  What has been the impact of Brexit so far?  What is he seeing across different sectors?  What sectors are doing well?  Where are the pressure points at present?  Would he give his observations on the economic outlook currently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#F02100"><p>In co-operation with the European Commission, we bring out what we call a monthly pulse survey.  We use an independent third party.  They interview, on a monthly basis, 1,000 consumers and businesses in a mix across regions and across industry sectors.  What I can say is there continue to be high levels of confidence in the economy.  Approximately 60% of businesses that we interview expect that their business and the economy will do better, 25% consider that it will be broadly static and 15% say it could get worse.  Broadly, sentiment is good and that has been reflected in our lending numbers.</p> <p>  However, I should say that we have been surprised, and slightly positive, about the lack of a real impact to date, both in our British business and in our Irish businesses, from Brexit.  We felt Brexit could happen and we spent a lot of time, in particular, with customers in the Border communities, for example, in the hospitality sectors and retailing, to understand how they could be impacted by different exchange rate movement.  Also, many of our mortgage customers might commute back and forth to London, or commute and work in Northern Ireland, but have mortgages in euro, and clearly their income has been impacted by that.  The impact has been surprisingly benign to date.</p> <p>  We believe that some sectors of the economy such as commercial real estate in the Dublin area could benefit but for small businesses whose sole market is the UK, clearly there is an exchange rate impact.  People in the Border countries could see switching.  Our retailer customers in Northern Ireland will benefit, and our customers in the South will not.</p><p>What I would say though, in talking to our business customers in particular, is that a lot of them have been through heavy cost reductions and their businesses are much more efficient.  I would say their risk of default is increased but it is still relatively low.  I think they will be like us - the money we earn in sterling is just worth a little bit less, and in some cases quite a lot less.  We could see some people looking at moving from what are called technical hedges, that is, buying their sterling forward, etc., to looking at perhaps structural hedging, in other words buying more raw materials in sterling or indeed relocating parts of their business to the UK to service that economy.  I think that there will be a negative impact on our economy from Brexit.  I cannot believe that there will be an overall positive basis.</p></speech>

I thank them for the 20-page document they supplied in response to our questions and the presentation, which helps us.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on the approval and drawdown of mortgages.  We see a clear pattern from Bank of Ireland's information but also across the banking sector that the approvals for mortgages outstrip the number of drawdowns by a ratio of 2:1, and that has been happening for some time.  Does Mr. Boucher agree with the Irish Banking Federation&rsquo;s analysis from 2014 when it said that it remains concerned that housing supply constraints are becoming a serious impediment to sustaining growth and this is reflected in the widening gap it sees developing between the level of mortgage approvals and actual drawdowns?  Is that a statement Mr. Boucher agrees with, and in his view is it having an impact in terms of the level of drawdowns of the mortgages Bank of Ireland has approved?</p></speech>

I would not say it is the sole reason.  Sensibly, our customers are seeking mortgage approval before they go and look for a property.  In certain locations, for example, in the main cities, but more particularly in Dublin, there could be up to ten bidders for a property and it moves beyond the price range for many.  That would be a very significant factor.  The economy is improving and so are people&rsquo;s incomes but I have a view that the primary driver is the shortage of supply.  It is just basic economics that supply is constrained and therefore people cannot get the house they want at the price they want.  We think supply is improving.  There is still another phenomenon in that we still believe that just under half &ndash; it used to be more than half &ndash; of properties are being purchased for cash.  I do not mean that someone comes in with a bag but they are not being bought for mortgages.  People are converting money they have on deposit and buying property with it.  Our lending to the buy-to-let sector is relatively low but it is a market we still try to service.  I concur with the observation that it is definitely a supply constraint issue.</p></speech>

Based on Mr. Boucher's expertise and information he has from Bank of Ireland in terms of mortgage approvals in recent months, could he tell the committee how his information would align with that statement?</p></speech>

As a builder, one's return on capital if everything goes well is around 10% or 11%.  That is what the margin is - quite a lot of cost comes out.  There was certainly an issue when the Central Bank guidelines were introduced in 2015 when builders got a little nervous and wondered whether there would be demand.  There may be some issues of affordability or the builders' willingness to meet the demand is somewhat impacted by their perceived profitability but, from our perspective, I would say that the primary constraint is supply side.</p></speech>

Is he concerned about the price of commercial property?  We have had a number of reports from Moody&rsquo;s and the IMF talking about funding industries coming in and buying commercial property which is significantly pushing up the price of commercial property.  Is Mr. Boucher concerned for the wider economy, let alone Bank of Ireland, about the significant increase in the cost of commercial property, in particular in central Dublin in recent years?</p></speech>

Many of them have made quite a lot of money because they came into the market at a time when it was depressed and they were providing liquidity.  The rise in the price of commercial real estate as an absolute threat to the economy is relatively low.<br/><br/>As a bank, we have had to learn some lessons, hard costing lessons, for everyone, so we do not finance buildings on a speculative basis for commercial real estate.  One must have a tenant <i>in situ</i>and the tenant must be a strong tenant.  We will not provide more than 65% to 70%.  It is less of an issue than it might have been in the past.  There has been quite a big pick up.  What we are seeing is that for about three years one had a yield shift, in other words, there was a liquidity phenomenon coming in and bringing in rental yields but what we are now seeing is the prices are being driven by rental growth.  Rents are increasing and therefore that is contributing to capital price rises.</p></speech>

In terms of the thresholds for the macro prudential rules, Mr. Boucher said in his submission that the threshold for the LTV rules should be increased to &euro;300,000.  The average mortgage for first-time buyers in Bank of Ireland is &euro;177,000.  How does he square that circle?  How many individuals from his point of view would benefit as a result of the change, given that the level of the average mortgage is below the &euro;220,000 threshold?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1804" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#G01800"><p>There are two features in the information we volunteered to the committee, first, that the average mortgage and the average LTV is approximately 70%.  The increased threshold is more of a Dublin issue because of house prices.  We find that some customers in the Dublin area are constrained by the threshold.  The 15% is a requirement that we have to observe and we would have sufficient demand.  We have to keep below the 15% but we would have sufficient demand to be able to go above it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1805" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#H00100"><p>Bank of Ireland is providing 15% leeway on the rules.  Some 30% is going to first-time buyers and 70% to non-first-time buyers.  Obviously, there are those who are moving and so on but there is no distinction between buy-to-let buyers and first-time buyers in terms of how this must be applied.  I would have imagined a bank would try to support those who want to get into the property market for the first time.  Given that less than one third is being provided to those in that category, is there additional scope?  How does the bank determine which individual does not have to comply with the hard and fast rule requiring a loan-to-value ratio of 90% for a loan up to &euro;220,000, and a sliding scale thereafter, or 80% for the portion above that sum.  How does the bank apply that?</p></speech>

Obviously, this is based on loyalty to our own customers.  It would not surprise us that approximately one third is buy to let because the demand for the higher amounts is primarily among people who are buying larger houses, moving up or trading up.  Perhaps my colleague Mr. McLoughlin is closer to that.</p></speech>

In response to customer demand, it is not a case of saying "No" to a loyal Bank of Ireland customer, a good customer, where we have not seen the sufficient supply to feed the first-time buyers, particularly in the Dublin area.  We respond to demand.  If the customer is a good Bank of Ireland customer and meets our risk and affordability criteria, we will give the loan to the customer.  We do not prioritise within the 15% LTV band opportunity.</p></speech>

From information released by the Irish Banking Federation, we have seen a steady rise.

People are looking for new houses.  There is no shortage of demand, as far as we are concerned.  There is a very significant rental market.  Over 300,000 are in rental properties and, as the Deputy said, they are keen to get onto the ladder.  The demand exists.  The consensus numbers suggest a market of about &euro;5.5 billion from a mortgage point of view.  We have already said there is a significant cash element on top of that of about 40% or 50%.  We predict an increase in consensus numbers resulting in a &euro;10 billion mortgage market over the next four or five years.  We would not disagree with those numbers.  There is rising demand.  Supply is a challenge.</p></speech>

I find it incredible that we are so far from the crisis while still having banks that have thousands of loans on their accounts that are still in significant arrears.  Arrangements have not been dealt with.  We see from the bank's figures that, as of 30 June, there were 5,257 principal dwelling homes in arrears for 90 days or more, with 1,100 of those in some sort of forbearance arrangement.  It seems that is just short of 20%.  I presume these are presenting as what would be called the "hard cases".  It has been reported that, in Bank of Ireland, we can expect to see significant movement in terms of the court actions in 2017.  Can the delegates state how many of the homes does the bank expect to take into possession?  Can the delegates assure us and their customers that no mortgage book, pertaining to buy-to-let properties or principal dwelling homes, will be sold to vulture funds?</p></speech>

I cannot say we would never do so but our practice and policy have been to work out challenged loans ourselves.  The customers are our customers and we believe the policies and procedures we have been following mean we can restructure over 90%, and 90% are sticking.  We believe it is working for us.  It is in our commercial interest and we believe it is in the best interest of our customers that we work these out ourselves.  As a CEO of a commercial company, I cannot say we would never sell to vulture funds but I would say it is highly unlikely because we believe what we are doing is working for ourselves and customers.</p> <p>  On the other side, my colleague is closer to the matter and maybe he can help us.</p></speech>

We have worked to keep people in the home.  Our track record since 2013 is that we have seen a 53% reduction in the number of people in arrears in owner-occupied properties.  We are working actively with those cases.  In the first six months of the year, as externally reported, we had 60 repossessed houses.  We work in most circumstances to come to a consensual arrangement with customers.  We want to work out a solution that is sustainable for the customers.  If it is not sustainable we look to a solution such as a mortgage-to-rent arrangement, which is why we believe in it.  In the majority of cases, however, we believe we can reach a sustainable solution.  Nine out of ten of our customers are fully up to date and nine out of ten are paying back and honouring the terms where we have put solutions in place for sustainable loans.  We are very keen to ensure we get the right outcome for the customer.</p></speech>

The number of repossessions is likely to increase.  In our mortgage business in the UK, which is roughly the same size as our own, the level of arrears is lower and the number of repossessions is probably double the number in Ireland.  There is a regrettable inevitability about that but obviously we see repossession very much as a last resort.</p></speech>

We look at it from our own perspective.  I am sorry but I do not know our rating.  We can check the disclosures made by the other banks but I do not have a figure offhand.  I will come back to the committee to confirm our position over the past six months relative to the size of our mortgages, the number in arrears and the absolute repossessions.  I do not want to be disingenuous in saying we do also use receiverships for buy-to-let properties.  I will include the relevant figures.</p></speech>

It seems to be much tougher in getting its pound of flesh than the vulture funds or many of the other banks.

If we make a restructuring arrangement for a customer, it has to be sustainable over its lifetime.  We would re-underwrite the entire mortgage.  We have to say what is sustainable and ask whether it is a one-and-done solution for the customer and us.  We put a lot of work into that.</p> <p>  As the CEO of a public company, I reiterate for the record that for 90% of the challenged customers who present to us and provide us with a statement of financial means, we can restructure.  Some 90% of those restructurings are sticking with us.  With regard to where we have been accused of certain things, the statistics do not bear out the allegations.  I refer to our interaction with personal insolvency practitioners and the Insolvency Service.  The number of cases that we do not support is below the industrial average.

Does the bank have some role to play in respect of this matter or should the State take it up and provide accommodation for these 1,358 people who probably entered into bad deals with the bank or for whom the bank arranged bad deals or whose circumstances changed?

They are making no payments at all.  A further 267, or 20%, are paying less than 50%.  In the report, we state that their contracted payment on a mortgage is &euro;920 per month on average.  If they were in the average residential property, they would be paying &euro;1,060 per annum.  Of these customers, 726 made no payment at in 2016 so that is the challenge.</p></speech>

If a customer refuses to engage with the bank, the options available to the customer and us are narrowed.  To address the Senator's point about local authority or social housing, my understanding is that if someone is in local authority or social housing, they must pay something.

What I would say is that the customers are now our customers regardless of whether they were acquired or walked into one of our branches or business centres.  They are our customers so they are valued customers with whom we want to do business.  If we buy these loans just to par, we achieve nothing.  We want to get customers.  Every day of every week, we want to get more customers and do more business with them.  That is a commercial imperative and if people are exiting the market, those customers need someone to provide their financial services and we think we have a good proposition.</p></speech>

Has any change in Government or regulatory policy regarding mortgage arrears been communicated to Bank of Ireland or noted by it?  At any point, has the Central Bank or any political body asserted to Bank of Ireland that it will have to offer either split mortgages or mortgage-to-rent proposals to families in arrears before it moves to take legal steps?</p></speech>

We have very strict regulation of the engagement process we have with customers with financial challenges and we support and adhere fully to it.  In particular, it encourages customers to come and talk to the bank.  We support other mechanisms so we provide financial services and other support to other bodies which provide aid or advice to customers with financial challenges so we are supportive of that.  If I talk about a more recent time period, namely the past six months, I am not aware of any material change.</p><p>We engage with the Central Bank on an ongoing basis, and it gives us advice, requests and instructions, but I would say at the edges rather than anything material.  We have not had any specific instruction on the number of customers to whom we must provide certain products.  What we must demonstrate in particular to the Central Bank is to confirm a solution is sustainable, on an equitable basis for the bank and customer and appropriate for the customer.</p></speech>

This code of conduct will be put on a statutory basis.  Does Mr. Boucher have a view on whether it will impact the bank's way of dealing with arrears cases or does he believe it is about forcing vulture funds to act more responsibly?</p></speech>

If we do not meet our regulatory obligations we lose our banking licence, which would not be very good news for the shareholders who employ me.

The hearings of this court could be held in private if requested by the debtor.  What is Mr. Boucher's view on a court being empowered to impose solutions in such a way?  The legislation has been well flagged and there may be a temptation to deal with as many cases as possible before then.</p></speech>

I pointed out earlier that the number of cases greater than 720 days in mortgage arrears is reducing without repossessions, which means we can strike deals with customers that work for the customer and for us.  If there is new legislation the bank will obey it.  I reiterate that in the vast majority of cases it is in our interests and the customers' interests that we do a deal.  Repossession is not something that works for the bank.  It does not help our reputation and costs us money.  It is not something I like to see but it is a fact of life.  When collateral is provided for a loan, at some stage the collateral could be lost.  If we did not have collateral we could not provide a 25-year commitment at somewhere between 4.5% and 3.1%.  We would go bust tomorrow.</p></speech>

One case comes to mind, where the cost of the mortgage was &euro;66,000 and a member of the family of the person who owed the mortgage offered &euro;50,000 to the bank.  Rather than take the &euro;50,000 up front, the bank in question, which I will not name, made the decision to repossess the house.  This indicates to me what Mr. Boucher is telling us in terms of doing everything to avoid repossession is not sometimes how it pans out on the ground.</p></speech>

If the bank's circumstances were to change I could not rule it out, but I would say it is highly unlikely.  What we are doing with our customers is working.  The solutions we are putting forward are working.  It is highly unlikely.  We were forced by the European Commission to sell a component of our mortgage book.  One of the requirements we had was that the bidders for the book had to be licensed and regulated by the Central Bank, because ultimately these are our customers.  We have a relationship with them and we might have a relationship with the brother, sister, son or daughter of the people involved.  Ultimately we must think about them.  I cannot tell the Senator never, but I think it is unlikely.</p></speech>

The yield on our trackers is approximately 120 basis points.  The cost of money to us is approximately 73 basis points.  We are probably not fully covering our cost of capital.  If we speak about yield or margin, we offer fixed rates to our customers but 450 basis points is our gross margin.  Our cost-income ratio is, shall we say, 50%, so our net margin is 2.25% on which we have to put capital and losses.  Our margins are relatively thin as we start.</p></speech>

That is what the European Commissioner has said.  The President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, has said it cannot all come from a push on quantitative easing.  There is a surreal atmosphere at present with negative interest rates.  I am not sure this encourages people to invest one way or the other.  The ECB has said we are doing our bit and we need other things to happen.  Economies are recovering.  Quantitative easing is probably pushing down the exchange rate as well.  What we see happening in the United States could happen more quickly than people anticipate.  The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has probably eased back on some of his commentary, but if I were able to read people's minds I would be doing a much better job for my shareholders than I can now.</p></speech>

Elderly people are being forced to use machines as a result of a drive to make banks staffless.  Elderly customers are being told to go away and come back on Friday, Thursday or Tuesday as they can only do the transaction on those days.  These people are dependent on rural transport and may have to travel miles to get to the bank.  They do not have broadband.  How does the bank plan to deal with and care for those customers in the future?  Many have made valid contributions to propping up and investing in the banks.  Many are elderly people whose families have had to emigrate because of the austerity imposed on them as a result of the recklessness of the banks.  Do the witnesses feel a social obligation to those people to provide them with a human being to help them when they go into a bank?</p><p> How many redundancies have there been at the Bank of Ireland in the past 12 months and how many do the witnesses foresee in the next 12 to 24 months?</p></speech>

We employ approximately 5,500 fewer people than in 2008.  All of our redundancy schemes are on a voluntary basis and we have agreements with the trade unions which represent our unionised staff, agreements which apply to all of our staff.  The absolute number of people we employ is pretty much the same six months on six months, but the locations where people work and the jobs they do are continuing to change as we and society evolve.  Our customers, particularly our senior customers, are extremely valuable to us and they have been loyal customers for a long time.  We need to do business with them and not just from a social perspective.  I reiterate that we have kept our bank branches open.  We think it is commercially sensible to keep them open, although they are doing different things now.  I will ask my colleague to deal with the question of how we interact with senior customers.</p></speech>

Every branch has a commercial mandate to ensure it is viable but we work with local communities and Mr. Boucher mentioned a number of initiatives in this regard earlier.  We are working to make them commercially viable.  Transactions across the counter in branches now account for 4% of total transactions so there has been a significant reduction in cash and cheque activity as a result of customer behaviours.  There is a significant move toward digital activity.  Our experience has been that elderly customers are very familiar with, and comfortable using, lodgement and ATM machines.</p> <p>  On the question on the facilities and services we offer, we have moved all our smaller rural branches to external lodgement ATM machines so that customers have the alternative of using those machines to access their moneys, not just six hours a day during the week but 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  We have extended our scope in this regard and elderly people are very comfortable with technology and using mobile phones-----</p></speech>

I completely disagree with Mr. McLoughlin's synopsis of how people are being treated.  He says cash transactions are rarer than they were in the past.  Of course they are, because people are being turned away.</p></speech>

It is not in a rural area and is not a small branch.  It has carried out a massive and very glamorous refurbishment but it no longer has teller facilities for foreign exchange, coin, cash or foreign cheques.  Yes, people can go to another branch but for people who are used to going into that branch they cannot get cash as there are no staff dealing with cash, though there are staff in the branch for different purposes.</p></speech>

The 4% is falling, year on year, and in the past 12 months alone customers have decided to reduce their cheques in circulation by 23%.  Customers are deciding to use less paper and want to use mobile devices.  More than half of transactions are done on mobile devices or tablets.  We are striving to support local communities though the enterprise scheme and that is why we are investing so strongly in the enterprise programme across all 250 branches and in 100 towns this week.  Cheque and paper transactions are going down and less and less cash is being used, while contactless cash-and-go facilities are what customers, both young and old, want.</p></speech>

One cannot get a sterling draft, for example, and one cannot even get one in some branches.

The first question I want to ask him is about a comment he made about Bank of Ireland reflecting on and learning from lessons of the past.  I refer him to the Regling-Watson report on the banking crash which cited a severe concentration on lending in the property market as one of the main causes and the Honohan report which highlighted that the share of bank assets in property-related lending had grown from less than 40% before 2002 to over 60% by 2006.  Bank of Ireland's figure for property-related lending now stands at over 70%.  Does Mr. Boucher think Bank of Ireland needs to be concerned in any way about its exposure to the property market not only in Ireland but also in Britain?</p></speech>

I think about 15% to 16% is accounted for by commercial real estate lending which is also spread between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Mortgages are loans to people.  This goes back to one of the questions asked earlier.  There is a fallback on the collateral.  We lend on the basis of the repayment capacity of the customer.  We recognise that we have exposure to the overall property cycle.  This is reflected in some of our lending practices and policies, but it would not be normal to characterise our balance sheet as 70% dependent on property assets.  I concur that over 50% of our assets are in mortgages.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland is quite exposed in the British property market.  Many reports in the media suggest a crash is inevitable or likely or possible at some stage in the near future.  What impact would it have on Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

From our perspective, a severe downturn could include a fall in property prices, including commercial real estate and mortgages, of more than one third.  We must ask ourselves whether we have sufficient capital to withstand not just the absolute quantum of such a fall but also its circumstances, that is, the depth of the recession, the level of unemployment and the fall-off in incomes which would result.  We believe we have robust capital resources.  Clearly, if there was to be such a collapse on such of a scale, we would make much less money, but the bank would be sustainable and survive.</p></speech>

The presentation states attractive international franchises provide further opportunities for growth.  However, they include the Post Office bank in the United Kingdom.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>before the Brexit referendum raised the point that the venture with the Post Office in the United Kingdom and the fall in sterling had potentially exposed Bank of Ireland to the consequences of the Brexit vote.  Is this one of the weak links in terms of Bank of Ireland's exposure to the negative impact of Brexit?</p></speech>

I think the current prognosis is that, whereas the UK economy will be impacted on negatively by Brexit, it is not anticipated, including by the Bank of England, that it will go into severe recession.  Our financial risk in British franchises is measurable and measured because it is a distribution arrangement.  It is focused primarily on the consumer markets.  These are distribution arrangements we have with our two principal partners, namely, the Post Office in the United Kingdom and the Automobile Association.  That is our route to the market.  Clearly, we take a credit risk where we provide mortgages, credit cards, car loans and so on and we must accept that risk.  We believe diversification is important.  Bank of Ireland and our UK business are capitalised and funded separately.  The fact that we are in different businesses means that we are not overly exposed to one single economy.  To go into one of the points the Deputy appropriately made earlier, we try to avoid an over-concentration of risk by having diversification.  We diversify in areas we understand.  We understand, particularly when we are outside our home market of Ireland, why it is that we are more competitive than others.  A significant strength is the power of the distribution we derive from the Post Office in the United Kingdom and the Automobile Association.</p></speech>

A consequence is that the public's shareholding through the State has seen a significant loss in value - I think of about &euro;800 million since December 2015.  To what does Mr. Boucher ascribe that fall in value?</p></speech>

I do not think our share prices moved idiosyncratically differently from those of European banking stocks.  I think we have been slightly more exposed to concerns about Brexit and the impact of the AA bond yield on our pension deficit, etc., but I do not think our share prices have been dramatically different.  We recapitalised the bank in 2011 from the private sector.  When we were able to do so, there was sufficient demand from the private sector at a relatively low share price of around 9.5 cent, whereby the State's investment could have been taken out completely.  The Minister decided, for his own reasons, that he would follow that investment.  Our share price is now about 21 or 22 cent, up 100% from what it was.  Over a five-year period that amounts to a compound return of 23%.  Therefore, the share price should be considered over a longer period.  Clearly, we would prefer it to be higher.  What we cannot do is make an absolute judgment on it.

Much of what has been discussed has been about arrears and mortgages, which is very important and has been covered quite well.</p> <p>  However, I come back to some of the matters covered by Senator Conway-Walsh - I also raised it when I was in the Chair - which is the operating environment of a bank branch.  Most people are willing to embrace technology as much as they can.  Mr. Boucher referred to people in different life stages, which is not a phrase I had heard before, but it covers a lot.  People are banking differently.  Presumably with contactless technology, credit and debit cards etc., the volume of cash circulating is lower than it used to be.  Where do the witnesses see cash versus non-cash transactions, where they have come from, where they are going?  What is Bank of Ireland doing to try to encourage people away from cash?</p> <p>  Obviously there is a significant cost in dealing with cash and transporting it.  I live relatively close to the Central Bank in Sandyford and I often see enormous cash deliveries being accompanied by three or four Army lorries before and after trucks and occasionally helicopters.  Cash is being transported all over the country when there are lots of alternatives.  Is there resistance from some customers to dealing in non-cash activity?  What is Bank of Ireland doing to promote it?  Obviously, there are charges on debit cards and credit cards.  I acknowledge that some of them are Government charges.  Is Bank of Ireland trying to encourage people to move away from pure cash and if so how?  What are the barriers in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.1919" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam McLoughlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016111700002#N01100"><p>The Senator referred to several digital devices, including contactless cards.  The bank has invested significantly in this technology and infrastructure to facilitate making that available to customers if they want.  The same applies to mobile and online capability.  Most of our activity is on mobile devices, as opposed to even on cards.  We have made the pricing in terms of fees and charges for those digital devices significantly cheaper than paper.</p> <p>  On the broader question on cash, I do not have a strong view on where it is likely to go.  Recent statistics from the Bank of England indicate that cash is still very prevalent and the quantum of cash in the UK has probably doubled in the past ten years.</p> <p>  However, we see a significant reduction in the use of cheques.  There is a very significant infrastructure behind the processing of cheques.  The bank has to take cheques in the 250 branches, bring them back every day to a clearing centre and process them overnight.  That is an expensive process and is a significant cost, which is ultimately passed on to the consumer in charges for cheques.  We see that number coming down.  I mentioned the trend of 23% in the past 12 months.  I believe that trend will continue.</p> <p>  People just like to have a wad of cash in their pockets and I do not think that number will change dramatically.  We constantly point out there is a security risk to customers when they take out significant amounts of cash, both bringing it to the bank and taking it away from the bank.  We are conscious of that.  We support our larger business customers who have significant volumes of cash by providing a cash-in-transit service to their business so they do not have to go from their business to the branch and then from the branch to the Central Bank in Sandyford.  We try to make that process as easy as possible.  I do not see cash reducing significantly but I see other paper items reducing.  The prices we charge customers favours the non-paper transactions, given it is a significantly cheaper means of making payment for customers.</p></speech>

That is becoming more of a phenomenon in countries such as Switzerland.  That could have a negative impact on the circulation of money for the economy because credit is not being created.  That is another risk of very low and negative interest rates.  People do not see an incentive to do other than hold cash.  It is using our shareholders' money.  We are encouraging it because it is in our interests as well.  We have quite a differential in our charging between using our payment online and using a paper transaction.  We try to incentivise it that way.</p></speech>

We have talked mainly about borrowing and mortgages etc. but there is almost a zero interest rate for money on deposit.  When one takes away 41% because of DIRT, USC, PRSI and various other charges, there is almost no incentive for people to have money on deposit.  What can Bank of Ireland do to reward those who are in a position to save?  Is there any hope for those people at all?</p></speech>

Let me use a different example.  When a credit union places deposits with us, we have to create 40% of liquidity on the added charge.  We have to put that back with the European Central Bank and we get charged 40 basis points.  It is becoming even more bizarre that it is costing us money to take in that.  Our model is that we customer-fund it.  Learning some of the lessons of the past, our capital and our customer deposits should equal our customer loans.  Our wholesale funding should equal the liquidity we have to hold.  The incentives are relatively low other than there is nowhere else to place it.  It costs us a lot of money to do that.</p> <p>  We have a pensions, life and investment business primarily trading under the brand of New Ireland.  New Ireland was formed at the founding of the State inspired by people who wanted Ireland to have its own industry there.  We provide different products.  We need to ensure that customers do not immediately move from one end of the risk spectrum, which is cash or deposits, to seeking, hunting and chasing yield outside what is a normal risk appetite.  We try to structure our products in that way.  We spend a lot of time with customers to ensure they understand the potential risks.</p> <p>  I would concur with the view that quantitative easing is penalising savers and pensioners but it is trying to do something.  Anyone who believes that it is the solution is wrong.  The Central Bank does not believe it.  It is meant to be an attempt to pump-prime the issue.  Ultimately we could have some very perverse behaviours where people who are prudent are being penalised.</p></speech>

The customers are bypassing them.  If I give a different example which may be counter-intuitive, 90% of our small business loans, those below &euro;300,000, are now done online or on the phone.  We only introduced this service for customers.  They are dealing directly with the underwriters and we are providing services outside of hours where that suits customers.  The local branch's job is to identify the opportunities with the customers, to tell the customer he or she will talk to the underwriters and tell the customer what documentation he or she will need.  The world is changing very quickly.</p> <p>  We are investing in branches because we believe that is a way to generate revenue.  We have to be in the local communities to understand what is going on and where the opportunities are, but the work of the branch definitely is changing, which is changing the work of my colleagues.  There are fewer and fewer jobs in our branch network for transactions.  For that reason, 2,500 of our colleagues are doing some form of education supported by the bank to equip them for the new world and we are trying to move our customers with that.  I cannot guarantee that we will have 250 branches.  We are making a different strategy and we have to explain to our shareholders.  A lot of others are closing branches and we want to try and keep them open because we think it is a good idea for us.</p></speech>

Many people live in the area where I was a councillor for more than 12 years.  It is an older population cohort, generally of people who would have been used to a different style of banking.  There are many who are loyal Bank of Ireland customers but who would say branches do not really want customers to visit, that the queues are ever longer and even the number of hatches in the branches are smaller.  I queued yesterday for 24 minutes for one teller, who had to go and have a comfort break in the middle of it and left us all staring at an empty hatch, and we were only in that branch because our own branch has gone cashless.  The perception exists that the bank is trying to push customers online the whole time.  What does Mr. Boucher say to customers who say banks - I do not suggest it is only Bank of Ireland - do not really want customers in branches queuing for a transaction?  I suppose the banks do not, but what does Mr. Boucher say to those who say they want to go in as they always did?  They always used to do business in a certain way and while they accept they can do certain business online, they cannot lodge foreign cheques online.  I hope the bank is working with the non-incorporated entities because they are in a limbo between business and personal.  Most customers, if they can, will go online, but some are not capable of it.  Some customers are not willing to do it.  Some do not trust technology.  What is Mr. Boucher's response to customers in that situation?</p></speech>

I would have to be honest about that.   What we are trying to do is transition.  As Mr. Liam McLoughlin pointed out, we are working with customers to get them comfortable with technology.  If one gets customers comfortable with technology, then they can do that.  On technology, most customers can work a mobile phone.  They can work a remote on the television.  Hopefully, our technology is not that complex.  Increasingly, we are listening to customers, working on feedback and trying to make it less complex to deal with us.</p> <p>  If people do not feel that we want them in our branches to do business with us, then we have failed and we would have to question why we have the branches in the first place.  We are putting in a huge effort, but the work and role of the branch is changing rapidly.  We are trying to transition and any transition will not work completely smoothly.  It is not working smoothly for us and it is not working smoothly for all of our customers, and we know that.</p></speech>

One used be able to get sterling drafts and now one cannot get a sterling draft for less than &pound;3,000.  That, clearly, has stopped many customers who wanted small sterling drafts from going into Bank of Ireland's branches because they cannot get those drafts anymore, and they are now going to the post office.  That would suggest it was a conscious decision by the bank that it does not want to be providing drafts for ordinary people.</p></speech>

I have nieces and nephews who live in England and one likes the idea of a draft if one is sending something for their first communion or whatever but they get hit with a &pound;20 charge on the other side.  One is diminishing significantly the value the beneficiary gets.  Anywhere in the euro area, and in Britain, one can transfer by merely getting the IBAN of the person.  That person is guaranteed to get the money when one sends it.  The world is changing.  I would question why any consumer would have a desire to send a sterling draft to someone because the beneficiary, that is, the person one has sent the money to, gets whacked with a big charge by his or her own bank.</p></speech>

It also would come down to trying to educate the customers as to the implications, for us and the customers, of using one service or another.  The provision of a foreign cheque or a sterling draft is not good news for the person who receives it.  He or she would far prefer to receive it electronically as he or she will know when they have got it.  One is not asking, "Did you get that yet?"</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher may be aware that the bank has taken tellers out of a branch in Caherdavin, in Limerick city.  It is the first branch in the mid-west where this has been done.  The branch is used predominantly by an older population and the residents in the area have come to me.  Sixty of them, many of them elderly, held a dignified protest outside the branch.  I have spoken to the bank's regional management, who, in fairness, have been amenable to meet.  Bank of Ireland is creating branches where customers effectively meet machines when they go in.  I accept the bank has staff there to assist them.  However, I would have always recognised Bank of Ireland as very much the old-world bank.  It was the bank that had that image and gave that perception.  I have two questions.  Why Caherdavin?  It is a big issue.  The residents in the area asked me to bring it up with Mr. Boucher, and that is my role.  I would ask, "Why?"</p> <p>  Mr. Boucher made reference to closing branches and I do not like that kind of talk.  Bank of Ireland states it does not wish to lose customers.  Mr. Boucher might explain the logic.  He made reference to the 4%, but this particular branch in Limerick has a high concentration of older customers.  The question is whether branches are perceived as being cost centres or profit centres.  Why was Caherdavin picked, why is the bank moving towards this model of having a branch where there are only machines and what will there be in future?  Customers have an attachment to their local branch.  They have an attachment to their local manager and staff.  These are hugely important.  One can pay for all the advertising in the world on television, radio and elsewhere but the teller behind the counter is a hugely significant positive advertisement for the bank.  Will Mr. Boucher outline for me the logic behind why the bank, specifically, in Caherdavin in that region, is moving towards that model where it is removing all tellers and why the bank would not have a teller over time, maybe for one morning a week?  Will Mr. Boucher deal with that issue for me?</p></speech>

As I have said, if we have to close a branch then there is a failure on both sides.  We are a commercial organisation.  I have heard others nearly boasting about the number of branches they have closed.</p><p>If we have to close, it is a commercial failure, which we do not like, but we are changing the role of the branch.  I referenced earlier the massive amount of training and education my young colleagues are doing.  We have no desire to close branches.  If we have to, we have to, but that is the choice - either the branch evolves or we close.  We are making significant investment because we believe, in our own enlightened self-interest, that supporting local communities in doing business in local communities gives us a commercial advantage and makes us sustainable in the longer term.  That is our strategy.  My colleague undertakes that strategy.  Perhaps Mr. McLoughlin will address that aspect</p></speech>

People should be told that the teller service will reduce over time.  What happened here was people were not aware that the tellers were going.  I ask Mr. McLoughlin as a measure of goodwill to look at putting a teller in for an hour a morning so that people become familiar with what the bank is proposing to do.  They like the branch staff.

I would say that around 4% or 5% is more normalised if there is a very diversified portfolio.  The key thing from a capital point of view and a sustainability point of view  is whether the bank has provided sufficiently for potential loss on both the specific and model basis.  We think we have.  We are seeing write backs where the economy is improving and collateral value is increasing.  Mostly our write backs come from where we have provided against the potential of default of a customer and then restructured that customer.  Then then move out of default, that is, their loan is on a sustainable basis.</p> <p>  The purchase of loan books is the cream on the cake from our perspective.  My colleague, Mr. McLoughlin, and my other two colleagues, who run our British and corporate divisions, are required by me and our shareholders to achieve their business objective targets without the purchase of loan books, that is, by engaging with existing and potential customers on a customer-by-customer basis.  We see opportunity.  If people are exiting the market, we see an opportunity to gain new customers.  Our new lending in the first nine months of the current year was &euro;9 billion.  Our balance sheet shrank but &euro;2.4 billion of that was actually non-performing loans coming down.  That is good redemptions.  We disclose to the market in the six months at the end of June.  For the following three months our core loan book, excluding non-performing loans and trackers which are amortising, grew.</p><p>Our new lending is growing from the customers from whom we are making money.</p></speech>

I spoke about the number of transactions being lower.  We look at how the bank will engage better with the community.  One aspect of the model is driven by business engagement for start-ups and, in that context, we opened a new centre in Limerick last week.  The issue is how we engage customers differently.  It is almost bringing business development into the bank.  We are pushing the model of the enterprise town initiative, we have 100 enterprise towns and we have five running this weekend.  We are running our second enterprise week this year during this week.  The model is based on engagement in the community and engaging with our customers more directly.  We have sector specialists in the business world.  The job of 14 agri-specialists is to be visiting farms all day every day.  It is much more a case of a one-to-one relationship with the customer and in the community rather than actually investing in bricks and mortar.</p></speech>

We asked how the bank's share price performed in the past six months, in the past year and in the past two years.  The response was that Bank of Ireland share price performance is a matter of public record.  That may be so.  A number of questions were answered in that way.  I think it would be far more helpful for the committee if the relevant information were provided to members when they pose questions prior to a meeting.  It is a quick reference for us for what essentially is a short meeting.  I think the bank would be seen as being more forthcoming with information.  I know it is in the bank's annual reports and other reports, but for members it is helpful if the information they seek is provided.</p></speech>

This relates to what people think about banking generally and the fact that the banks received the support of the State.  What  we are coming to now is the bad debt within the bank that cannot be readily serviced.  The experience I have had with customers of banks - not just those of Bank of Ireland but right across the sector - is that the banks are now back up on their feet but that those who are still struggling in their homes and families are being treated badly.  While Mr. Boucher states that there is an individual approach and solution to most of the problems relating to borrowing in the bank, the amount of hardship that Bank of Ireland and others have inflicted on individual borrowers by chasing them for repayments is significant.  It would be remiss of me were I not to say to Mr. Boucher that I believe he treats people badly.  I am talking about people who are willing to attempt to repay but who, for one reason or another - they are in the same boat as the bank was it got the &euro;4.8 billion from the State - do not have the capacity, either in terms of their families or their businesses, to get back on their feet that easily.  While the bank has offered them solutions or is working with them to identify such solutions, matters are extremely difficult for them.  Mr. Boucher stated that the level of repossessions is likely to increase.  We have seen the repossessions up to now.  Bank of Ireland got &euro;4.8 billion in support from the State, which it has paid back.  However, people who borrowed from the bank and who are attempting to repay their loans are not, in my view, getting a fair deal from the bank.</p> <p>  Members of the committee asked whether Bank of Ireland lobbied or made submissions on the mortgage-to-rent scheme and the answer from the bank was "No".  Some people might think that is fair enough but do not.  The witnesses operate at the coalface and they know from the various statements that they have taken from individuals and families that the latter are in real trouble.  There should be an obligation on the bank - working with the State - to devise some sort of strategy and policy to ensure that the people in question are not evicted from their homes.  It shocks me when I read the various reports - and I know there is another side to the story - relating to how people are evicted and treated.</p></speech>

From Bank of Ireland's perspective, the bank quite rightly repaid the State's investment.  In order to do that, we had to make tough decisions with our own business and we had to make choices.  We had a responsibility - as everyone does - to make reductions in the number of people we employed, to restructure our businesses and to raise private capital.  We had to make choices.  In an ideal world, some of those choices would not have been made.  However, we had to make them and we were obliged to sell businesses.  Ultimately, we repaid the taxpayer.  We are not asking to be thanked for that.  That was our responsibility.  A lot of our competitors have not repaid the taxpayer but I cannot speak for them.  I cannot speak for their practices.  We have an ultimate responsibility.  We also have a responsibility to the providers of our capital, our depositors and all of our other customers who are doing their best to meet their repayments.  What I continue to stress - again because it is a matter of public record, anything I say is verified or verifiable - for customers who engage with us on mortgage arrears, is that we can meet the need of 90% of them but for the other 10% we cannot.  We cannot solve every issue in society.</p></speech>

Does the bank not have a responsibility to those people - families and businesses - who make up the SME sector in this country to work even harder with them to ensure they can be brought across the line in some way, shape or form, either by keeping their family home or beginning to perform again in an economy that needs them?</p></speech>

In answer to an earlier question, I noted that roughly 50% of our owner-occupier mortgage holders who are more than 720 days in arrears have not paid a single euro to us for years.  Where is the responsibility on that side?  There is a responsibility on both sides.  Both sides enter into an agreement.  We work with our customers and strive to do the best for them.  We have a responsibility to our shareholders, the providers of our deposits, our other customers and to society as a whole.  We recognise that but we cannot solve every single situation.</p></speech>

The bank has a responsibility, not just to work with those people but to make submissions to the Government outlining the fact that a certain cohort of borrowers simply cannot repay and that the bank will have to repossess, thus thrusting more people onto the housing waiting lists around the country.  I believe that the bank has that responsibility because we created this - all of us - in the first place.</p></speech>

Senator Kieran O'Donnell was referring to a community issue and I am saying that right across the country, there are families in deep distress.

It is in that context that I say that the bank has a responsibility to work with the Government to highlight this fact.</p> <p>  A Bill will be passed in the D&aacute;il in the near future - the Courts Bill 2016 - which I call the eviction Bill, which will return jurisdiction for these matters to the Circuit Court.

I would like to see the bank making a submission to the Government outlining the profile of these people and how they can be helped, not just by Bank of Ireland but by the Government itself.  The Government is devising strategies and policies which may not suit the profile of the people we are discussing.  That is all I am saying.

I am talking about the people who are trying, those who are pushing themselves to the pin of their collars trying to repay Bank of Ireland and other banks.  I am not being personal - I am talking about the banking system.  That system was saved but is not responding to a genuine group of people who are attempting to rebuild their lives.  This is having a terribly negative impact on society.  It is horrific to watch it, both in the courts and in the family homes that I have visited.</p></speech>

The Deputy may have missed it earlier when we spoke about the model of banking.  People's behaviour, not only in banking, is changing dramatically.  There is a significant move in people's behaviour towards digital activity, for example when booking flights and everything else as well.  That is not just for younger people.  I know a significant portion of mature people who use mobile phones to book flights.  There has been a big shift in that area.</p></speech>

I ask that Bank of Ireland does a demographic analysis or provides the criteria to the committee for the analysis of how they change the model of a branch.  I am sure the bank has its statistics and data.  If the demographics of the area show it has an elderly population, the bank should not go down the route of going cashless, teller-free or of lowering the number of tellers.</p></speech>

When I say the appropriate time I mean the bank's cashflow was gone and the bank was in a very difficult state.  Would Mr. Boucher not consider going further with parliament building?</p><p>That particular building on the Green should have been donated back to the State.

We have &euro;4.8 billion.  We have given back &euro;6 billion and the State also holds shares worth &euro;1 billion.  Most people would prefer cash in their pockets, but the building is always for sale if anyone wants to buy it.  Every one of our assets is for sale at the right price.</p></speech>

The State still owns a voluntary shareholding of 14%.  The reason we received the investment was that we would be able to fulfil our function in ensuring there would be an economy that would prosper.  It is also in our interest, given that we are the largest lender into the economy, having repaid the State.  The capital we received was from private sector shareholders who believed Ireland would recover and that our bank would recover.  It is their money; it is not Richie Boucher's.  It is our shareholders' money.</p></speech>

I have seen Mr. Boucher's interaction with committee members on the write-off and it seems to wrangle with him.  Most institutions with which I deal - I deal with Bank of Ireland and others - engage in write-offs in particular ways.  Has Bank of Ireland participated in the warehousing of difficult loans, namely, loans under stress?  It has been brought to my attention that a percentage of a loan that is not performing is warehoused.  The anticipation and the agreement is that when that period of warehousing expires, the loan will be written off.  Is Bank of Ireland operating in that manner?</p></speech>

It is a contractual arrangement.  In the case of a business, where there is limited liability, we say there is an A loan which is what the business can sustain.  Very often there were activities outside the business and the customer needs time to sell them - that is a B loan.  If the customer performs for three years, contractually, we will write off the balance.  It is not voluntary.  The Senator is asking me a question about voluntary write-offs.  That is a contractual arrangement.  We do a deal on an arm's length commercial basis.  That is a commercial-----</p></speech>

Potentially, their balance sheets are not as strong as they look on the day.</p></speech>

We are fully provided for.  As we have provided for it, that is included in the provision.  We give the customer an incentive, as in a commercial transaction; if he or she meets his or her terms of the contract, there will be an incentive at the end.  As a commercial organisation, we understand how incentives work.  There is an incentive for us and an incentive for the customer.  We have provided fully for this on the basis that we have to be prudent, given that we may not get the money back.  In fact, we are unlikely to get it back.  They are contractually agreed write-offs, but I am not conscious that we provide for voluntary write-offs.  I cannot see why a commercial organisation would volunteer to write off money.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher will be aware of Horizon 2020, the &euro;80 billion European Union research and innovation programme which has given rise to the InnovFin fund from which Bank of Ireland, in partnership with the European Investment Fund, EIF, has an apportunity to avail of &euro;100 million.  How much of that &euro;100 million has been divested for new lending since October 2015 when Bank of Ireland did the deal with the EIF?</p></speech>

There is a lot of investment in agricultural lending also, but I have not seen any documentation or publication from Bank of Ireland on lending in the technology sector.  If Bank of Ireland is not lending in the technology sector, an elemental part of the InnovFin fund, is it because there is reticence on the part of banks - I believe Bank of Ireland is the only bank that has drawn down funding from the InnovFin fund - to lend in the technology sector as the risk profile might be too high?  I am trying to gain an understanding of where Bank of Ireland sits on lending in sectors other than, for instance, agriculture or traditional SMEs.</p></speech>

We have changed our model in the past couple of years and appointed a number of very experienced external non-bank sector specialists across ten areas, including technology and long-term health care services.  Network and business lenders are very conscious that availing of such a lending opportunity would be referred to the head of technology sectors.  In fact, this year we have increased the head count in the technology research area.  In terms of our branches, we have picked out five locations where we offer a start-up opportunity to technology companies.  We opened one in Limerick in the past two weeks and two weeks before that we opened one in Cork.  By their nature the teams are very specialist.  Interestingly, they comprise non-bankers led by non-bankers, but they know to whom they should refer that kind of lending opportunity and we have a skilled and central team to look at the matter.</p></speech>

If we end up with equity, we have usually made a mistake, but we provide capital through specialist companies such as Kernel Capital and Delta to provide equity because that is their specialist skill.  We look to engage in lending on top of this.  As my colleague, Mr. McLoughlin, has pointed out, we recognise that some of these skill sets are not natural to bankers; therefore, we have hired people from the external sector and are training them in lending.  It is easier to train someone to lend than it is to train someone to be a technology specialist.</p></speech>

There are a number of aspects to it.  I agree with my colleague's idea but my perspective on it is that, first, it reminds our colleagues that we are in business to do business and not to merely to shuffle paper around.  It is good for my colleagues to see people starting businesses and trying to sell products.  That is one of the most positive aspects of what I call our "workbenches".  My colleagues see, on an ongoing basis, what it is like to try to start a business, to be in business and - to use one of the Chairman's examples - to experience what it is like for our customers.  That is a very important aspect.  We might get 35% of the growth in the economy but if we can do our part in helping the economy grow, to get businesses to grow-----</p></speech>

I  come from Cork and represent a dairy production area.  Where is the Bank of Ireland with respect to the other banks in terms of competing for new business in that space?  Is it highly competitive or behind the curve?</p></speech>

We believe we have done approximately 50% of that.  The vast bulk of that new lending - this relates to an earlier question but is quite a different matter - has been for land, where a farmer plans to expand his farm.  We found that most farmers fund new milking parlours and so on primarily out of cashflow.  Most of the new agri-lending is for farm expansion.  We try to be competitive on price and structure.  We were the first bank to recognise the lessons of the past, namely, that the dairy industry is a cyclical industry.  We were the first bank to bring in a flexible loan.  We saw how it worked in other countries.  Recognising that it is a cyclical industry, if a farmer is granted a seven-year loan, typically we would amortise on a sliding scale of seven years.  We recognise that there will be periods when cashflow will be stronger and when the customer can speed up the repayments.  During periods when cashflow is weaker, customers pay the interest but they do not have to pay the capital.  As Mr. McLoughlin pointed out, we recognise that we had a skills deficit, so we have hired people - including from banks that have exited the market such as ACC - with experience of the sector because we need to learn as well.  We are trying to invest in capability, product features and, obviously, in the provision of capital.</p></speech>

It would be futile for anybody to suggest that because we are probably the closest to the people on the ground in that we represent them every day of the week.  The angst in regard to the branches and how they are evolving relates to the deficit in the personal relationship.  While people of all ages can engage with the bank's 365 online model - and that can lead to subsequent phone calls with a person - the concern is about the one-to-one banking relationship.  It is in that context that we are to articulate the point regarding places, such as Caherdavin, where the bank has flashpoints.  It is not an ageism issue.  I am a customer of the excellent branch in Mallow.  I have a relationship with the people there.  Over the years, however, there has been a diminution of the traditional relationship, particularly in respect of people going into the branch to discuss new lending or borrowing for day-to-day services.  That is the point we are trying to articulate.  Traditionally, the pillar banks always had that relationship with the person on the street.  We recognise that the Bank of Ireland must evolve and move to a certain point and that there are cost elements involved, but it should not throw the baby out with the bathwater and move completely to an online process.  If it were to do that, customers might leave.  Customers need to know they are being listened to and they need to have eye contact with an official in the bank if they are transacting new business or even dealing with daily transactions.  Does Mr. Boucher understand the point I am making?</p></speech>

Human contact with people on the ground is hugely important to us.  That is why we have retained those colleagues.  I am proud of those colleagues who are investing in their education and skills base to be fully qualified as professional people to interact with customers.  I would be the first to admit that as we go through a transition period, we will not get everything right.  We are listening and trying to figure out what works.  We are trying to make this work because if it does not work, then we have a problem as a commercial entity.  If customers feel that we do not want to talk and engage with them, then something has gone wrong in what we are trying to achieve.  What we are trying to achieve is that balance between being a commercial organisation and being efficient.  If we do not have customers, we do not have a business.  We can be as efficient as we like but if customers do not want to do business with us, then the shareholders would boot me out pretty quickly.  We have to manage that but we would be the first to admit that we will not get this perfectly right all the time and we have to evolve.</p></speech>

Is it possible for Mr. Boucher to answer how much that sponsorship is costing the bank and whether a proportion of that is filtering down into encouraging young people, male and female, into game?  My thinking here is from a CSR perspective, as opposed to mere sponsorship and getting the name out there.</p></speech>

It is an extremely important part of our pitch.  Our pitch to Leinster Rugby and Munster Rugby was that it was not just a financial commitment on our behalf.  It was important to us because it filtered into the local communities and we said that it would have Munster flags.  It was particularly an issue for Leinster, so one of our big pitches to Leinster at that time was there would be a financial benefit to it but that it would guarantee that it would move beyond Dublin 4 with our branch network and our ability to do that.  That was my pitch to Mick Dawson at that time.  It is hugely important for us.  That sponsorship does not work for us unless it is seen to be relevant to the local communities in which we operate.  Sometimes I am accused because I am from more of a rugby background but it is harder for us to do that with, for example, the GAA.  We work with the GAA in different ways  We believe strongly in sport and community sport and that is a very important part of what we do.</p></speech>

We are talking about corporate sponsorship and we are all interested in the growth of the game.  I am interested in discovering whether parcels of that funding go into the development of the game among young people in particular.  Mr. Farrell is nodding his head.  Is there a message that Mr. Boucher wants to impart about how he is concerned about the future of the game and that this is not merely corporate sponsorship and about  flags?</p><p>What I am trying to tease out is whether that sponsorship actually enhances the game.</p></speech>

If it was only for the professional team, then I do not believe our shareholders would have got the value they should get from any money we spend.  An important part of it is how Munster Rugby and Leinster Rugby use the money we provide, as well as the other money they generate from elsewhere, to grow their playing base and so on.  As someone who is interested in the game, it has been interesting to see how rugby has expanded outside of its traditional support base and player base into women's rugby and more non-traditional areas.  The co-operation with the GAA and other sporting communities has been interesting too.  As a father and as someone in my local community, I believe involvement in sport and having young people of different skill bases and interests involved in sport is an important part of developing the community.  That is something I aspire to personally.</p></speech>

From an accounting perspective, we are forced to use the double-A European corporate bond.  Quantitative easing has driven that down and that has an accounting impact.  However, the schemes are strong, robust and viable.  We are going through our process of tri-annual valuation of our main schemes.  We provide the information to the pensions authorities and they are robust.  This has an impact on our capital and what I tried to say earlier - it is a market disclosure - is that the movement of the bond yield has changed this artificially.  On accounts, my colleague is an accountant and there are other accountants present, so I have to be careful.  The discount rate, which is not really related to the underlying schemes, has moved with the movement of the bond yield but the schemes are strong and robust in their own right and are economically doing everything they should be doing.</p></speech>

I gather the figure was quoted by LCP Ireland, which carried out a study on various pension deficits.  Admittedly, the deficit was down from over &euro;900 million.  Anyway, Mr. Boucher maintains that the schemes are robust and that the pensioners and staff members who are contributing and so on can rest assured.  Mr. Boucher is not of the belief that there is any great difficulty in the long run.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

I believe older people are more than willing to embrace technology when and where they can.  However, as I outlined earlier, technology does not cover every point on every transaction.  Maybe in the future it will.  Maybe no one will be getting cheques any more.  Maybe no one will be getting foreign dividends.  Maybe no one will need a teller.  I do not know how we will get foreign currency without a teller.  Maybe we will have machines dispensing sterling for when we need it and so on.</p> <p>  It is fair to acknowledge that Bank of Ireland has been either the best performing or the least worst performing of our traditional banks in recent years.  Let us go back 20 years to when Northern Bank became National Irish Bank, which then became Danske Bank.  It has gone.  Permanent TSB has been more or less nationalised, along with AIB, EBS and Irish Nationwide.  Anglo Irish Bank is gone.  It is fair to acknowledge that Bank of Ireland has performed well.  I am keen to acknowledge innovative moves.  For example, we see cash transactions and ATMs in shop and pubs.  Money is being recycled from the shop into the ATM and into the community.  That means fewer cash transfers.</p> <p>  We are saying people like cash.  Mr. Boucher alluded to perverse behaviour.  I do not believe it is in anyone's best interests to have large amounts of cash at home under the floorboards because they would rather not put it in the bank on account of negative interest rates.  Mr. Boucher is effectively saying that it is costing the bank money to keep money on deposit.  Is that what he was suggesting?</p></speech>

We cannot count it and therefore we have to buy Government bonds or put it on deposit with the Central Bank.  That costs us money.  Our model, for our consumer and business customers is to have their money.  Some big things have happened.  They may be related to interest rates but they also show activity in the economy.  One thing we have noticed &ndash; this is disclosed in our accounts &ndash; is that our current account balances have continued to grow.  To us, that is always a sign of activity in the economy.  It represents an early sign that commerce is taking place.</p></speech>

I do not believe other banks are doing that to the same extent.  Does Mr. Boucher see that changing?  Does he see it being eliminated?  It was introduced at a time when the bank may have needed every penny or cent it could find.  Let us suppose a person has three or four accounts for various reasons.  That person could be hit with &euro;100 worth of charges, even if the accounts have thousands sitting in them.  Is there any hope for people, other than golden years customers, to see their way out of that?  Like Deputy Sherlock, I am speaking as someone who is a customer.</p></speech>

We have to be honest.  Nothing in life is free.  Someone can try to tell me that something is free, but I am paying for it somewhere or through some mechanism.  We try to be more transparent about what it is.  It costs us money to have staff doing different things with regard to our investments and branches.  It costs us money and we have to try to recover some of that.</p></speech>

However, it is different to have an account.  It might sit there doing little and transaction charges apply anyway.  A charge of &euro;20 is a significant amount for people simply for having an account in existence.  Perhaps the bank is trying to introduce the charge in order that people will rationalise their accounts or reduce the number of accounts, although I am unsure.</p></speech>

He will speak to us about the human rights implications of Brexit.  He will make an opening statement and then we will have a questions and answers session.  Before doing so, I remind members, guests and people seated in the gallery to please ensure that their mobile phones, iPhones, iPads and anything electronic is switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p><p>I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l) </i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I invite Mr. Gormally to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I refer to the human rights implications of Brexit.</p> <p>  The Committee on the Administration of Justice is an independent human rights NGO that has worked in Belfast since 1981.  The organisation's opinion before and after the vote was that there were potential threats to human rights visible during the referendum campaign.  That is why we unusually and specifically recommended a Remain vote.  After the referendum result I am afraid our predictions were proved correct.  We said: "Those voices leading the Leave campaign majored not on democratic or socio-economic deficits in the EU project but rather on nationalist sentiment, xenophobia and thinly veiled racism.  This result will embolden them and place them in the ascendency."</p> <p>  The first consequence of the vote has been the normalisation of anti-immigrant discourse, a huge boost for racist groups and an increase in racist attacks in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  From the perspective of human rights, this is perhaps the most dangerous scenario.   Racism is the fundamental enemy of human rights.  Human rights are universal as they apply to everyone by virtue of their simple humanity.  Racism is the complete negation of that philosophy.  Furthermore, it is insidious.  Once racism is allowed into the political conversation, it becomes the ready and available put down of any attempt to express human solidarity. </p> <p>  The second area of concern, in terms of human rights, is a retreat from the European Union's protection of workers' rights, data protection, environmental and anti-discrimination legislation.  Exiting the EU would remove a backstop for rights protection and thus make it easier for current or future Governments to erode protections for workers' rights and equality. </p> <p>  The third area that we have identified is the withdrawal of the EU's PEACE funding and structural funds, and the likely increase in austerity policies.</p><p>There is no doubt that the expected ending of peace and structural funds will decimate the voluntary and community sector and remove support from many projects, such as ex-prisoner groups, which are vital for the peace process.  These economic pressures will pose a real threat to the social and economic rights of the most disadvantaged.</p><p> The fourth area is the threat of a so-called hard Border on the island of Ireland and the threat to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.  The last area is that the result may pose a threat to the Human Rights Act.  That is not a direct consequence of Brexit and is nothing to do directly with the European Union but the justice Secretary, Liz Truss, has recently said that the repeal of the Human Rights Act, which is fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement, apart from anything else, is still on the table and there is clear opposition to the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law among certain politicians and journalists. </p><p> We have been involved in several events and discussions, giving evidence and so on.  Much of the material is available on our website if the committee wants more detail.  It may be interested in the process of litigation, CAJ is one of the applicants in one of the Belfast-based cases seeking a judicial review of the Brexit process currently before the High Court in Northern Ireland.  As a human rights organisation, we joined this action to help ensure that the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, and in particular its carefully crafted peace settlement, were fully taken account of in the Brexit process.  Several politicians, individuals and human rights non-governmental organisations, NGOs, have taken a case that concerns the intention of the UK Government to give effect to the exit from the European Union through the use of the royal prerogative.  An individual applicant, Raymond McCord, sought a judicial review on grounds which partly overlapped our case.  Our application argued that the prerogative was not available to trigger an exit from the EU because EU law had been given effect through the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and other provisions and thus required legislation to amend its effect; that in that case a legislative consent motion in the Northern Ireland Assembly would also be required; and, if the prerogative use was lawful there were a number of common law restraints upon its use and that any advice given by the Northern Ireland Office on this matter should be screened according to the equality provisions of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  Our case was lost in the Belfast High Court.  We were allowed to argue only the Northern Ireland aspects but in England a three judge court of the High Court overwhelmingly supported a similar case on the grounds that the prerogative would change domestic UK law and in a principle going back to 1610 at least that is not possible under the UK Constitution.  In spite of the very conservative judgment in Belfast and the judge refusing a so-called leapfrog appeal direct to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General for Northern Ireland has referred the devolved issues to the Supreme Court, which is one of his powers.  While he will go there to argue against our position it is quite useful because that position will therefore be argued in the Supreme Court, in front of 11 judges who have been mobilised for this case.  We are in the process of trying to raise funds but we expect our lawyers to be in London on 7 and 8 December to argue the particular Northern Ireland aspects of the case. </p><p> Part of the Good Friday Agreement, and specifically the British-Irish treaty that underpins it, rests on common membership of the European Union as stated in the preamble: "To develop still further the unique relationship between their peoples and the close co-operation between their countries as friendly neighbours and as partners in the European Union;".  The withdrawal of that has unpredictable implications for the Good Friday Agreement.  CAJ does not take a position on constitutional matters but there is no question that as the effective ending to a 30 year long conflict the Good Friday Agreement is a guarantee of our peaceful future and of human rights.  In our view it has to be defended.  One particular aspect of it is that the North South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council are given specific roles in regard to EU matters.  In respect of the North South Ministerial Council the agreement states: "Arrangements to be made to ensure that the views of the Council are taken into account and represented appropriately at relevant EU meetings."  It is a channel for the particular circumstances of this island to be referred to the EU.  We are aware that the Irish Government is using this mechanism as a forum for discussion with the Stormont Executive.  How that is used will be a major preoccupation for this committee.  It may feel that further research into the actual implications of the UK withdrawal from the EU are for the infrastructure of the Good Friday Agreement. </p><p> I will not deal with the particular protections for human rights within EU law or where it is being invoked or within its scope.  There is extra protection from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which we will presumably lose after Brexit. </p><p> The committee's influence, however, would be very welcome in respect of the so-called great repeal Bill which, whatever happens about triggering Article 50, will be needed in the UK Parliament requiring that it maintain EU law in force unless it is specifically repealed.  It would be a complete train crash if EU law was suddenly withdrawn in respect of domestic UK law never mind anything else.  </p><p> Equivalence of rights across the island is a principle in our view of the Good Friday Agreement.  How will we manage that in circumstances where there will presumably be radically different legal jurisdictions on the island?  We would urge a second look at the role of the Charter of Rights for the island of Ireland, which was never implemented even though advice was given and it is a matter for the two human rights commissions.  The other related question is equality of citizenship.  People in the North have the right to choose to be Irish or British citizens or both.  We believe that the content of the rights accruing to those citizenships should be the same, rather than simply the right to choose between them.</p><p>It is our view that the content of the rights accruing to the citizenships should be the same, rather than simply the right to choose between them.  That will be a complicated mechanism.  That is associated with the threat of a hard Border.  The common travel area predates the EU, but in its modern manifestations to a significant degree it relies on Irish citizens asserting their rights as EU citizens anywhere in the UK and the right to travel in that sense will be under threat in the context of a hard Border.  What concerns us is that even if there are special arrangements for Irish and British citizens, we do not want a situation where a border on this island is the focus of racial profiling, for example, where people who look different are asked to produce passports while people who look like me, perhaps, are not.  It would be intolerable to have a racist border across this island.  I will finish there.  I welcome any discussion.</p></speech>

The European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated into the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and is a central plank of the Agreement in many ways.  Any change in that regard by the British Government would mean a fundamental change in the operation of the Good Friday Agreement.  There seems to be a change in approach by the Twenty-six County Government because initially it was talking about defending the Good Friday Agreement and being foursquare behind it but the Taoiseach is now talking about defending the progress made in the peace process.  They are two different things.  There has been progress but that does not necessarily mean that will continue.  Perhaps that is something that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  If Brexit happens, where does that leave people involved in legacy inquests having access to the European courts?  Will that have a detrimental effect on how such cases progress?  Mr. Gormally mentioned court cases in which the Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, is involved with other parties in the Assembly.  Reference was made to the intervention of the Attorney General.  My understanding is that office is independent of the Assembly.  What impact does Mr. Gormally envisage there will be on the court cases?  He said it is an advantage because it opens up the opportunity to argue the cases before the Supreme Court.  One of the Supreme Court judges spoke recently about the 1972 Act possibly having to be amended or a new Act being introduced before Article 50 could be triggered.  All sorts of opportunities are opened up in terms of how Brexit might or might not continue.</p> <p>  Mr. Gormally referred to workers' rights.  It is interesting that the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, NIPSA - one of the biggest unions in the North - asked its members to vote to leave, which seems a total contradiction in terms of the protection of workers' rights.  Having spoken to people from NIPSA, they have not given a convincing explanation as to why they pursued that line of thought.</p></speech>

It is very good to see him today and helpful to the committee to hear what he had to say about the equality implications for the Good Friday Agreement of Brexit.  He mentioned the choice of citizenship between Irish and UK citizenship for residents of Northern Ireland and that the choice could be affected.  Could we tease out that issue a little more?  It is a situation with which we are not that familiar.  The choice of citizenship is a serious issue in terms of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  What are his views on how the campaign was led?  Perhaps he cannot comment, but it seems to me that most of the political parties in the UK were not really aware of the implications for the Good Friday Agreement and also for human rights and equality.  We must deal with the situation now.  We were a lot more informed on that point on the island of Ireland, which is most unusual, given that it was a decision taken by the United Kingdom.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Gormally" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016111700002#F00400"><p>On the question of the Human Rights Act and the possible repeal and even the possible withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights, although that is probably a little extreme, as they are unlikely to go as far as that, but certainly severing the link with the European Court of Human Rights is clearly not part of Brexit, as such.  We are talking about the Council of Europe not the European Union when we talk about the European court and the European convention.  However, in our view it is part of the same movement.  It is a kind of xenophobic, anti-human rights movement.  In terms of the nature of the campaign, in our view this was not a referendum on membership of the EU, or at least it was not a verdict on how good or bad the EU is.  In practice, it was an expression of certainly disenchantment with the <i>status quo</i>but it was led by people with a racist and xenophobic agenda.  That is the crucial reason we felt we had to intervene and say vote &quot;Remain&quot;, which of course the people of Northern Ireland did, but that is another matter.<br/><br/>In terms of the legacy inquests, that is a real problem at the moment.  The immediate problem is that the Lord Chief Justice's programme for dealing with all the legacy inquests within five years is held up because of some kind of interchange between the UK Government and the First Minister, in that the First Minister will not allow the proposal for the extra money from the UK Treasury to be either tabled at the Executive or the Assembly so the UK Government has not received that request, theoretically, however we believe the obligation is still on the UK Government to provide the funds to deal with it.  Mr. Brady is quite correct in that if there was a withdrawal from the European court's jurisdiction then that final arbiter would be lost, although of course many of the cases that are awaiting inquests were decided by the European court in 2001, some of which the CAJ was involved in.<br/><br/>In terms of the role of the Attorney General, he is an independent law officer, unlike the situation of the UK Attorney General who is a politician, or at least is a member of the Cabinet and a political appointee.  He has his own views on constitutional matters and they differ from ours on this particular matter.  His referral to the Supreme Court jumps beyond the normal appeals process because otherwise we would have had to go to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court and that would have meant that we would not have been able to make the arguments in early December.  Therefore, it is useful, even though it is unfortunate that the Attorney General will be arguing against some of the very important issues that we think are a part of the devolution settlement.</p><p>In the court case, the Scottish and Welsh Governments indicated their intention to intervene.  Coming to Senator Feighan's point, that demonstrates that the Northern Ireland issues have now been taken quite seriously, if somewhat late.  They are certainly taken seriously in the other jurisdictions of the United Kingdom by human rights activists.</p><p> Whenever there is an effort to introduce identity cards in the United Kingdom, it is recognised that Irish citizens cannot be forced to carry British citizenship identification.  The authorities were actually going to give people who identified as Irish in Northern Ireland the same kind of identity card system as would be provided for other EU citizens.  That proposal was dropped but it shows that even the UK Government recognises the importance of not forcing people to choose one way or another to access particular rights.  We do not know what the circumstances will be, however, without the underpinning of EU citizenship.  I cannot state the solution because we do not really know.  Probably nobody knows, least of all the UK Government, what precisely will be argued for with regard to the common travel area and the nature of the Border.  It is a bit up in the air.  In our view, it is equality of citizenship and rights across the island that comprise a crucial underpinning of the peace settlement.</p></speech>

He is very welcome.  From what I can gather, the plan is that we do not have a plan.  We are heading into what appears to be a legal nightmare, certainly for the people of Northern Ireland.  We speak about fundamental human rights, particularly workers' rights.  We have 30,000 workers crossing the Border every day.  Those who cross from Northern Ireland into the Republic to work will be able to avail themselves of all the rights that come with European legislation.  We have no idea what the circumstances will be for those who cross from the Republic into Northern Ireland to work there.  They may be allowed to retain the rights they currently enjoy as EU citizens.  The ideal would be that we would transpose European law directly into British law.  I understand from some of the meetings I have had that there is an intention on the part of Westminster to write its own workers' rights and fundamental human rights.  Whether it will simply transpose European laws seems to be far from certain.</p> <p>  On funding and austerity, we could face terrible circumstances in which Border counties on the Republic side will continue to avail of funding from Brussels under the Good Friday Agreement while counties on the other side of the Border will be in a different position.  Although funding has been guaranteed to 2024 for agriculture, I hear nothing about funding under the Good Friday Agreement or matching funding that would be available in the Republic for citizens of the North.</p> <p>  On the issue of the hard Border, I have been predicting since the Brexit vote that there will be a hard Border.  I can see no other possibility because I do not believe the gift lies in the hands of the Irish Government, or the British Government for that matter, with respect to how the Border will be managed.  Twenty-six other countries will be involved.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. Gormally's view on that.</p> <p>  My last point is on the area of welfare, especially pensions.  At present in Northern Ireland, there is a lady who is unable to avail of her Irish pension because of an anomaly in our laws.  The rules for public service pensions, which used to be 50% of one's salary, or so many 80ths of one's salary, have changed.  One now gets a public service pension comprising 50% from one's Department with the old age contributory pension included in it.  I am sorry for going around the houses on this one but this is a particular case.  What has happened is that an employee from the South who lives in Newry retired under the age of 66, which meant she should be entitled to what we call a supplementary pension to top up her public service pension - the equivalent of quarter of her pre-retirement salary - to bring it up to the full rate.  She is being told that since she does not live in the Republic, she is not entitled to the supplementary pension.  This causes problems on both sides.  There are people in the Republic who worked for no more than a year in the United Kingdom but whose Irish welfare contributions are taken into account when calculating pension entitlements.  They get the British pension based on the fact that they have so many Irish contributions, thus bringing them up to the ten-year mark.  Does that create a huge problem for us also?  The more I see of this, the more complex it becomes.</p></speech>

There is constant confusion between the European Convention on Human Rights and the European courts on membership of the European Union.  My understanding is that they are totally separate.  Britain was responsible for the European Convention on Human Rights after the war, or was at least a driving force for such a convention.  Mr. Gormally refers to this in the submission.</p><p>Is there any suggestion the Brexit vote will have a significant knock-on effect on the European Convention on Human Rights?  That is a bridge much further than just leaving the European Union.  The witness gets the point and I have given the lead.  I have an understanding of the following issue but it may not be accurate.  My understanding is the great repeal Bill will repatriate all European law or issues to Westminster <i>en bloc</i>.  There is a discussion on the variations of what will happen then.  Will Britain hold on to all those laws?  In other words, will they be non-devolved matters or will it devolve some of them to the devolved assemblies?  I am particularly looking in this case to the issues raised around human rights or laws that will affect human rights.  Worse still for me is the suggestion which is about - it is people thinking out loud - that Britain may very well modify those laws before they are devolved.  Am I making sense on that point?  It is that it will take back the laws but hold them for a period to be determined, and in the course of that period it will interfere, as it were, with those laws rather than devolving them <i>en bloc</i>.<br/><br/>These are two questions that may not be as easy to answer as they are to ask.  That is the nub of many of the issues being presented by the witnesses.  Britain may bring these back and modify them significantly before devolution.  My understanding is much of the human rights stuff should be devolved to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales but it may be modified.</p></speech>

We can talk about all the laws we like but the reality is the impact at the farm gate and local shop is what people and communities in particular will feel, especially on the Border.  Will Mr. Gormally comment, for example, on the European Union yesterday launching the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, ETIAS, which will introduce new travel arrangements for non-EU citizens visiting the Schengen area?  Under the proposals, non-EU citizens will still be able to travel without a visa but will have to obtain travel authorisation prior to their visit to the Schengen area.  These proposals have been in the pipeline since 2014 but they have taken on a new importance in light of Brexit.</p> <p>  Ireland and the UK are outside the Schengen area but are currently members of the EU, with both currently enjoying the freedom to travel.  However, Brexit changes this issue entirely so what will happen when the UK leaves the EU and potentially loses freedom of movement?  We need to know whether UK citizens, including those in Northern Ireland, will have to apply for the ETIAS when crossing the Border.  These proposals will also complicate the efforts to ensure, as others have commented on, there is no return to a hard Border.  Senator Craughwell spoke about the 30,000 people travelling back and forth, and this would make things difficult in that common travel area.  These are serious issues that we on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement need to address so as to ensure that regardless of the outcome, people are able to move in either direction without being impeded.</p></speech>

Looking at the Border counties and PEACE funds, there is a real problem as we do not know exactly what will happen.  As far as I understand it, applications and so on are still being processed but the question of matching money, for example, is not clear.  It would be very foolish to assume there will be equivalent money from the UK Treasury to that which went into the various funds that Northern Ireland and the Border regions, in particular, have been able to take advantage of.  I share the members' concerns in that respect.<br/><br/>On the hard Border, it was suggested there are 26 other countries involved with that process.  It is clearly one of the difficulties.  On the one hand we do not know what the British Government is demanding but on the other hand we do not know what the EU as a whole will agree to.  We are in a position of unknown territory in a way.  It seems that whatever the feelings on constitutional matters, the island of Ireland has a common interest in having no hard Border.  Some of the alternatives are equally unappealing, such as having an effective border along the Irish Sea, which would be between two parts of the UK.  It is difficult to know how that is to be done.  I suggest the interests of the people of Ireland and our perspective in supporting the peace agreement and the human rights element of that means there should be free travel across the Border, with no racist border on the island of Ireland.  These are basic demands.  Whether they should be progressed through the North South Ministerial Council is debatable but that is certainly a common interest of the people of Ireland.<br/><br/>None of the laws implementing the Good Friday Agreement will fall <i>per se</i>.  In other words, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was the basic legislative implementation of the agreement and it will not fall.  However, there are references in it to EU law.  The Assembly and the actions of the Ministers and Departments are constrained by EU law and they must obey it.  There is no doubt that a &quot;brick&quot; in the infrastructure has been or will be withdrawn with unpredictable results.  There will not be a direct domino effect in terms of legislation but it really is a problem.  There is a specific problem with respect to citizenship.  What about Irish citizens in the North who were born in Northern Ireland?  Will they have EU citizenship rights in the rest of the EU?  If not, we will see the introduction of two classes of Irish citizen.  That is a real problem when talking about people who are not Irish citizens because they have been naturalised or by heritage in a kinship sense but because it is their birthright, as put in the agreement.  If there are Irish citizens North of the Border whose birthright is to be an Irish citizen, yet they cannot access the same rights as those who are born in this jurisdiction, it seems there will be a big problem.  This may not entirely be in the hands of the Irish Government but it is a serious question.  I am asking it not from a constitutional perspective but because of its underpinning the equality of citizenship as a basic element of the agreement.  It is important.<br/><br/>I do not have knowledge of the pension issue, I am afraid, but it is an example of problems for cross-Border workers and so on.</p><p>For example, at the moment we can access health care as EU citizens when on holiday or if working across the Border.  There are bilateral arrangements between the two jurisdictions in terms of children's heart surgery in Dublin and particular things in Altnagelvin and so forth, but in general access to EU health care results from EU citizenship.  This is a particular issue that may well affect cross-Border workers.  There are arrangements for students, etc., but all of this is in the melting pot and will have to be worked out.</p><p> Dr. Alisdair McDonnell is completely right when he says that the Council of Europe and the European Union are two totally different systems.  They are completely separate except for the fact that EU membership requires a country to be signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights.  The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights incorporates the convention rights, but goes further in many respects.  They are distinct but in a way connected.  Dr. McDonnell is also quite right in that they are also connected in the minds of those who led the Brexit campaign.  Some of them - not all - are among the protagonists in favour of repealing the Human Rights Act, developing a British bill of rights of unknown character and breaking the link between the domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights.  Our fear is that Brexit will embolden those who also want to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p> The question about the great repeal Bill is complicated.  I attended a lecture by Daniel Greenberg, a parliamentary draftsperson who worked with us on the model Bill for the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  He said the more grandiloquent the Title of the Bill, the less that will be in it.  It is now being called the "the Great Repeal Bill", so it is likely to say that everything stays the same.  However, everything will not stay the same because EU law as it exists is of direct application in the UK.  This is not just a matter of EU law being contained in UK legislation; the Treaties and the Commission's Directives have direct effect.  We think the great repeal Bill should say that all existing EU law is to remain in force.  However, such provision would not include the interpretation of EU law by the Court of Justice of the European Union or its modifications.  That is, the way in which laws are living instruments in a sense will be brought to a halt, so that will have a dramatic impact.</p><p> The question of devolution is also important.  Northern Ireland is the only jurisdiction to which employment law is a devolved matter - history of the old Stormont regime.  It is not devolved to Scotland or Wales at the moment.  It would, therefore, fall to Stormont to re-enact employment protections if they were repealed.  The problem is that the whole devolution structure is provided for in law to an extent, but the power of the Westminster Parliament to legislative, even for devolved matters, is only restricted by convention and not law.  Therefore, as stated by Dr. McDonnell, the Westminster Parliament could hold onto employment law and modify it although it is a devolved matter.  Currently, employment law is devolved, so it is not a question of it being held in London to be re-devolved.  However, the UK Parliament could legislate on employment law for Northern Ireland.  It is only constrained by convention, so there is a danger that, even if we had a political consensus in the North to maintain them, all the protections in EU law could be taken away by the UK Parliament.</p><p> On freedom of movement, the Schengen situation is more advanced in that there is more freedom of movement within the Schengen area than there is in the common travel area.  UK citizens are outside the Schengen Agreement and, depending on what is negotiated, will not have the right to free movement because the right that accrues by virtue of EU citizenship will end.  Again, where does that leave Irish citizens who were born North of the Border?  How are we going to deal with that?  This is one of the imponderables to which, I am afraid, we do not have any answers at the minute.  Even if there is a special deal for Irish citizens born North of the Border, where does that leave British citizens born North of the Border who have the right to be Irish citizens?  We do not want a situation where different rights accrue to the two forms of citizenship that are available to the people of Northern Ireland because that is a basic equality aspect, if one likes, to the agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement basically says that there will be no second-class citizens.  Primarily, it is designed to say Irish citizens will not be second-class citizens in the North, but are British citizens to be second-class citizens in the South or are Irish citizens born North of the Border to be second-class citizens in the EU?</p><p> It is a very complicated issue which we cannot solve with a stroke of the pen.  This will take hard negotiation as well as an understanding of how basic these things are to the peace agreement that brought an end to the conflict and will depend on the extent to which the rest of Europe needs to be made aware of it in terms of the negotiations as a whole.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity to update the committee on the development of the EU programmes.  The role of the Special EU Programmes Body is to manage the EU PEACE and INTERREG programme funds in the region.  We are also directly responsible for the grant-making of those programmes.  The EU programmes have been implemented on a cross-border basis for more than 25 years in the case of INTERREG and more than 21 years in the case of the PEACE programme, with &euro;1.1 billion going to the INTERREG programme and &euro;2.2 billion going to the PEACE programme.  That includes the current allocations.</p> <p>  The significant impact of these EU cross-border programmes cannot be underestimated.  The benefits that they have had in the region are far-reaching beyond the financial contributions.  I could not do justice to the impact of those programmes in these few minutes.  Many hundreds of thousands of people have benefited from those programmes directly and indirectly.  Cross-Border co-operation was taking place prior to the Good Friday Agreement and the EU programmes.  However, the establishment within the Good Friday Agreement of the Special EU Programmes Body with an all-island remit enabled a co-ordinated regional approach to cross-Border co-operation within the context of the EU programmes.  The programmes provide financial support for a structured approach to cross-Border activity and establishing cross-Border networks and relationships.  Undoubtedly, that may not have happened because of other pressures on public expenditure environments and competing spending priorities.  When I talk about the region with regard to these programmes, I am referring to Northern Ireland, the six Border counties of Ireland and, in the case of the INTERREG programme, western Scotland, which joined that programme in 2007.</p> <p>  The PEACE programme was established in 1995 and was a direct result of the EU's desire to support the efforts being made on this island to build a peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland.  We have learned many lessons.  The programmes have evolved and changed over the programme period in 21 years, the budgets have reduced and we have learnt some lessons.  In the PEACE III programme, which has just concluded and is in the process of closing, there are some key figures that relate to its benefits.  A total of 200,000 people attended events that addressed sectarianism, racism and conflict resolution workshops; 44,000 attended events to assist victims and survivors; 7,000 people received trauma counselling; and 136,000 have so far enjoyed the very magnificent shared spaces that have been developed to create, build and foster cross-community links.  The committee may be aware of some of those examples, such as the Castle Saunderson scouting project in Cavan, the Peace Link, a cross-Border and cross-community sports complex in County Monaghan, the Peace Bridge in Derry-Londonderry, and the Girdwood project in north Belfast, a new state-of-the-art community centre hub built on an interface area at the side of an old army barracks.  It recently paid host to the president of Colombia on short visit to the UK, who was very interested to hear about the benefits of the PEACE programme.</p> <p>  The INTERREG programmes throughout Europe offer support on a strategic cross-border basis to create a more prosperous and sustainable region.  They have a focus on the well established and recognised needs of border regions.  Some of the projects funded in our last INTERREG programme included the North West Regional Science Park in Derry-Londonderry and also the extension of the Letterkenny IT campus.  Those projects help to form cross-Border networks between local firms.  There was also the refurbishment of the Drogheda viaduct and the upgrading of enterprise.  A sum of &euro;30 million went into a cross-Border health project entitled "Putting Patients, Clients and Families First", which assisted all of the residents in the eligible area to have access to quality health care.</p> <p>  Some of the numbers in INTERREG are also significant, with more than 120,000 benefiting from cross-Border support in areas of health, rural development, enterprise and tourism.  A total of 3,500 businesses were assisted to promote innovation and creative activities, with 1,300 of those SMEs directly collaborating on cross-Border ventures.  A total of 15,000 people have been involved in attending workshops to look at solutions to common problems in the Border area, such as joined-up delivery, improvements to service and access to services available.  We also had a large telecommunications project funded, which linked Northern Ireland and Ireland with Canada, America and parts of Europe, and other projects examining renewable energy and environmental sustainability.</p> <p>  Part of our role in the Special EU Programmes Body is also our statutory role to advise the North South Ministerial Council and finance Departments in negotiations with the EU Commission on future funding rounds.  SEUPB was also asked to develop the 2014-2020 programmes by undertaking consultation with all relevant interest groups and stakeholders, taking account of the policy objectives of the EU and how best to fulfil the policy objectives of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive by complementing but not duplicating those services and reflecting the needs of the target areas.  In line with the Europe 2020 strategy, all programmes will focus on a narrow range of activities to ensure that the funding will bring about significant change in the region.  The content for those programmes, therefore, has been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government, the European Commission and, in the case of INTERREG, the Scottish Government as well.</p> <p>  The result of the UK referendum on 24 June had an impact on the delivery of those programmes.  I know that the committee is well aware of that impact.  Many complex financial and legal issues had to be addressed.  With the substantial assurance received from the UK Treasury in October and the work of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, we are now in a very strong position and are making offers to projects that will last for many years to come.  We have been issuing letters of offer over the past few weeks.  I would like to take this opportunity to put on record our thanks to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, and their officials who have worked so closely with us over these challenging few months.</p> <p>  The INTERREG VA programme, which we are now embarking on, is worth &euro;283 million.  It has four core objectives that we are funding.  In the area of research and innovation, there is &euro;53 million allocated to increase the capacity for cross-Border research within two target areas: health and life sciences, and renewable energy.  There is a further &euro;18.7 million to increase the capacity of 1,400 SMEs and micro-businesses in the region that are engaged in cross-Border research and innovation activity aimed at the development of new products, processes and tradeable services.  Environmental initiatives will benefit from almost &euro;85 million to protect and restore biodiversity and invest in the water sector, promoting cross-Border co-operation to facilitate the recovery of selected protected habitats and species and the development of common approaches to the management of the marine environment.  A sum of &euro;47 million is allocated to sustainable transport in order to provide support for greater connectivity between the three jurisdictions and to promote cross-Border, inter-modal and sustainable mobility in the region.  Health and social care is also a prominent feature of this programme.  A total of &euro;63 million has been allocated to that.  With cross-Border co-operation, we will see 50,000 benefiting from those essential services that we intend to support in the region.</p> <p>  The PEACE IV programme is worth &euro;270 million and provides opportunity for continued EU assistance to help to address the peace and reconciliation needs of the region.  The Irish Government played a pivotal role in securing the PEACE IV programme, which we are now implementing.  It has four core themes, with a strong emphasis on supporting young people to develop their skills to contribute to a more cohesive society.  Shared education has been allocated &euro;35 million.  The majority of schools in the region remain single-identity.  The project will see 144,000 students engaged in direct and sustained curriculum-based contact between pupils and teachers from all backgrounds.</p><p> A sum of &euro;37 million has been allocated to children and young people to form positive and effective relationships with others of different backgrounds.  This will target young people aged between 14 and 24 who are disadvantaged, excluded or marginalised and who have deep social and emotional needs and are at risk of becoming involved in anti-social behaviour.  We plan to fund at least eight capital projects to the value of &euro;53 million, creating a more cohesive society through the increased provision of shared civic spaces and services.  In recognition of the needs of those who have suffered in the trauma of the conflict, we are also allocating &euro;17.6 million to the capacity of services to meet the needs of victims and survivors.  It will add value by investing in cross-Border health and well-being services that develop proven expertise within the region and increase the capacity and the quality of care in the sector for victims and survivors and their families.</p><p> One of the successes of the previous PEACE programme was the involvement of local councils across the region.  Initiatives to address local needs will be directly delivered through them, with almost one third of the programme being delivered in that way.  We have invited local authorities across Northern Ireland and along the Border in the Republic to develop a local action plan for their area.  They will consider specifically local needs in respect of shared services and spaces, children and young people and building positive relations.  Each local authority has been given details of the indicative budget.  For example, Louth County Council has been allocated &euro;3.5 million and Monaghan County Council just over &euro;3 million.</p><p> A sum of &euro;16.4 million has been allocated for the objective of building positive relations at a regional level.  This objective will support groups particularly impacted by the legacy of the conflict.  The support will be used to fund up to 20 regional level projects that will result in meaningful, purposeful and sustained contact between persons from different communities.  Our main priority is to ensure those programmes are allocated in full to good quality projects which will deliver on the objectives we have set out.  There always have been challenges in the Border region and that is why we implement the INTERREG programme, and those challenges will be exacerbated in the context of Brexit in whatever form it may take.  We will monitor that closely in respect of our projects to see if there will be an impact on their delivery because they have been funded for several years.  We are also spending time on proactively undertaking work on future funding post-2020 and what we can do to see if we can remain involved in some EU programmes and minimise the impact of Brexit in the region in the context of EU funds.</p></speech>

She is playing a blinder and I urge her to keep going.  I am hesitant because the body does so much good that it is almost unfair to ask her too many questions.  What are the obstacles?  What help does the body need from us individually or collectively?  Has the referendum result affected its work?  Has it added to the difficulty?  What can be done about that?  Ms McIntyre and her predecessors have done outstanding work, and my biggest fear is that it may come to an end with the current programme.</p></speech>

It has managed significant moneys down through the years.  We could have our difficulties with the body at local authority level trying to get projects across the line, but it is important to have an administration to ensure the moneys are well spent.  I have often said that for many years along the Border we had our backs to each other, and when peace came, we faced each other.  The human aspect of the various programmes the SEUPB has administered has ensured people have got to know each other across communities that did not engage for many years.  This has helped to build on peace, prosperity and progress.</p> <p>  I have two questions which I have raised at the committee previously.  There is an agreement between two states to ensure peace, progress and prosperity continues.  The uncertainty around the planning of projects the body has on it books and various local authorities and communities are seeking to develop is not helpful.  How can we encourage the Chancellor of the Exchequer post-Brexit, if we are serious about peace on this island, to ensure the full moneys are ring-fenced to implement the programmes up to 2020 and beyond?  How can we ensure the model to which Ms McIntyre referred post-2020 and the projects continue in support of peace as opposed to being outside the EU or being inside it?</p> <p>  The Taoiseach indicated in the D&aacute;il last week that 17 projects have been signed off.  We had raised the issue here.  Ms McIntyre said the body has a commitment for funding up to 2020 but that does not seem to have come from the British side.  Will she comment on that?</p></speech>

Over the years, I have had a close working relationship with her predecessor and other colleagues of hers regarding the PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  They have made a huge difference, especially in the most disadvantaged communities, both rural and urban.  At times where public services did not deliver, be it at local authority or central government level, the additional help from these programmes gave these communities the necessary capacity to build projects and to develop facilities.  Ms McIntyre mentioned two on my own doorstep - Castle Saunderson and the Peace Link sports centre in Clones.  They are excellent projects with substantial funding which has been put to good use.  Minister &Oacute; Muilleoir presented us with a worrying commentary a number of weeks ago.  He had not been given a commitment by the Treasury that funding would continue.  In a subsequent conversation I had with him, he was concerned about whether the British Government commitment would remain.  Deputy Breathnach and I had a Topical Issue debate in the D&aacute;il with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>He assured us there would not be any delay in having the necessary approvals issued.</p><p> Ms McIntyre might clarify the point she made about letters of offer because if there is any lacuna, vacuum or interregnum, it will weaken the resolve of communities to do all the homework necessary to prepare an application, never mind implement a project to bring it to fruition.  We all know there is a huge amount of work involved in even trying to get to the starting blocks.  I would be glad if Ms McIntyre could give a clear assurance that she has the commitments from the Northern Ireland Executive, our Government and the British that there will be no delay in having funding provided that is already agreed up to 2020.</p></speech>

In its statement on 3 October, the HM Treasury gave a guarantee that in terms of any project funded between now and the time of a Brexit, whenever that may be, the UK share would be underwritten by the UK Government.  There were a couple of conditions attached to that, in that projects had to be able to demonstrate value for money and they had to be in line with the region's priorities.  Our projects do that.  Seventeen letters of offer have been issued and all of them will be issued by the end of the week.  Some of those projects run until 2021, 2022 and 2023.</p> <p>  In terms of the way we are addressing the projects, with the help of the officials from the Department of Finance here in Dublin and in the Northern Ireland Executive, the programmes are in place.  The EU side of the money is in place for the Irish contribution.  The Irish match-funding is in place.  The Northern Ireland Executive has its match-funding in place and should the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, element not be in place for the UK side, the Treasury will underwrite it.  That has given us the confidence to be able to issue those letters of offer, which include that line to the effect that the UK Treasury will underwrite that.  This is one piece of very good news because we see that funding as being as secure as it could possibly be.  We will keep that situation under review.  We will have to look at the impact on the projects and we intend to undertake evaluations and technical studies.  The impact of Brexit is one aspect but also in regard to the projects delivering outputs for which they were being funded.</p> <p>  As a result of the referendum we have to keep this under review.  We do not know how it will play out.  We do not know what the terms of the Brexit may be but we will continually manage that and look to do whatever we can to mitigate any of the negative aspects that would come with  that.  That will involve talking to the people behind those projects and to the Departments involved in the policy areas to make sure that we do complementary work to them with a view to seeing what we can do to help the projects.</p> <p>  From our point of view, those projects we are funding at present are as secure as they can possibly be.  The programmes are still in place.  We have the necessary assurances in place to be able to issue those letters of offer.  I totally agree with the Deputy that the projects have been delivered in disadvantaged areas with money that has been made available to those projects that would not have been able to be made available previously because of competing priorities.  The EU programmes, and the establishment of our body, give a good regional approach to that.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that those projects have delivered so much more than funding.  I would say the mind border was opened for all those projects.  They were able to face outwards from the region.  We are also involved with other projects in regard to the transnational programmes and we direct organisations in Northern Ireland to engage with those programmes.  The impact of and benefits from those are amazing, and that would be one of the great travesties of a Brexit, should it occur.  Does Mr. Henry want to add anything further on the programmes?</p></speech>

We are implementing the programme as planned now.  We are getting in project applications.  We are using a new abbreviated application process that everyone has signed up to.  The assessments are under way and we are issuing letters of offer, so things are beginning to move apace now.  As Ms McIntyre said, the conditions are now in place to allow us issue those letters of offer.  We see both programmes being implemented on the ground and the evidence of those programmes becoming very visible over the coming weeks and months.  There are no immediate impediments to us moving forward at this stage.</p></speech>

This is something I feel particularly passionate about because essentially it is bringing together children at the point where barriers and predilections in terms of the way they think are often established.  This is vital funding that will address 350 schools in the eligible region of Northern Ireland in the Border counties.</p> <p>  We are taking a call in the steering committee next week based on enhancing the innovation capacity within the area of life and health sciences within the Border region.  We are currently assessing eight applications, which look at solutions in the area of precision medicine, advanced manufacturing for medical engineering and alternative energy.  It is my personal opinion that Northern Ireland and Ireland have made significant steps in their economic development in recent years but there is still the need to continue to invest in those areas, particularly in areas of burgeoning technology.</p> <p>  It is also true that in border regions across Europe and the world, economic development tends to lag behind larger conurbations.  One could say that the effect of a Brexit would be that those disadvantages to the Border region would be further exacerbated by any potential border so these investments become even more important in that context.  The value of those investments will be in the region of &euro;45.3 million. </p> <p>  It is important to mention the health investments that the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, is managing.  They have a value in excess of &euro;50 million that will help 30,000 people in the eligible area of Northern Ireland in the Border regions to access health care in innovative care pathways.</p> <p>  Given the pressure the health systems around the world are under, this is a very important investment area in that the main thrust of these investments is to look at innovative ways to deliver care pathways to people in their homes through e-health interventions and to maximise and produce economies of scale using the scarce resources we would all agree are present in the health care system.</p></speech>

Across the family of the INTERREG cross-border programmes across Europe, be they cross-border, transnational or regional, there are many examples of programmes that have one member in and one member outside, but the member outside brings its own money to the table.  We would need to make sure that we can secure the Northern Ireland share of the money to the table if Ireland were happy to engage in those programmes with us.  We have commissioned some research to look at some examples of those, and we will share that and keep it under review.</p></speech>

The Northern Minister of Finance, Mr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, are very alive to the issue and are working on it.  It is also important for us to ensure the European Commission, when drafting its future programmes, does not put anything in that would rule us out, on whatever terms apply to Brexit.  Given that the INTERREG programmes are flexible in this regard, we are not directly asking for anything in this regard today.</p></speech>

While there are many criteria regarding the selection and assessment of the selection, I wonder about afterwards.  There is an incredible amount of funding going to a variety of places.  Some have tangible results, such as the Peace bridge.  For others in businesses or who are involved with children and youth, for example, is there evaluation and monitoring of value for money to ensure it is having the desired effect?</p> <p>  From my background I know when organisations get funding there is an expectation that it will continue.  Is there space for new groups coming on for funding?  Are there many applications regarding integrating the new communities or requests from new communities in Northern Ireland?  We are considering a visit.  While there are time constraints, it would be good to see one of the children and youth projects that receive funding.</p></speech>

In my constituency, Newry and Armagh, it has been instrumental in providing very welcome funding to many groups in deprived areas.  We are talking about guarantees up to 2020, according to the British Government.  Nobody in my constituency is under any illusions that a Tory Government will provide money to compensate for EU money that will be lost.  We would be very naive to believe it for a moment.  The Government has already cut the Executive budget by &pound;4 billion and will probably cut it by another &pound;4.5 billion in the next five years.  After Brexit, might the SEUPB cease to exist as a body?  Has it had any discussions?  While I do not want to be too pessimistic, according to what we hear, Brexit will be a reality and people are telling us it will be a lose-lose situation for the British.  Has there been any discussion on how the SEUPB, which does extremely good work, will continue after Brexit?  There must be a cut-off point if Brexit is to happen.</p></speech>

Given that we are commissioning this research and examining how Northern Ireland could remain involved in programmes dealing with issues related to the Border in particular, and that we have the regional reach, I personally believe we will be more important than even before.  The issues regarding the Border and cross-Border co-operation will be so exacerbated and significant that we will want to find every possible way.  Given that we are a cross-Border body, I see us as being ideally situated to do it.  This is my personal opinion.  We have not had any official discussion on it.</p> <p>  Our prime purpose over the past four months has been to ensure the current programmes are delivered and to start looking towards the future regarding them.  When we complete the research, we see many opportunities and it is for the Northern Ireland Executive to ask for this money from the UK Treasury over and above the block grant to bolster the programmes.  The programmes have been set with very deliberate outputs under the EU 2020 strategy.  All the programmes are set in that way.  We will undertake a suite of evaluations of value for money and qualitative aspects.  Mr. Henry is in charge of the evaluation programme.</p></speech>

This is built into the programmes.  We are in the process of drawing up a detailed evaluation plan whereby every part of the programme will undergo independent evaluation and we will report on the impacts of the programme at a mid-term point in 2018 and again in 2022.  There is a robust evaluative framework in place.  One of the things we wish to gain from it is to learn how we can maximise the impact of the funding.  We see it as an ongoing evaluative process.</p> <p>  Regarding new organisations, we make it our business to ensure everybody is fully aware of all the funding opportunities that are available within calls.  We try to ensure as broad a base of representation in our programmes as possible.  This morning, I attended a launch of a call around children and young people in Belfast which more than 150 people attended.  While many of the attendees were from organisations we had funded, many were from organisations we had not previously funded.  We are very much open to welcoming organisations that have not previously been in receipt of money.</p></speech>

I firmly believe the Good Friday Agreement is a solemn agreement.  Politicians and Governments come and go.  I request that the information Ms McIntyre has given us be translated and transmitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I did not come here with any of the confidence Ms McIntyre displayed.  From a Southern perspective, my clear understanding was that 17 projects were signed off up to the budget and would not progress further than that with no commitment.</p><p>The North South Ministerial Council enshrined the importance of ensuring the moneys can be committed, certainly over a ten-year period.  Nobody can plan unless there is a solemn agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

They have removed the uncertainty that existed with regard to these programmes.  As I said earlier, the last thing we want is for uncertainty to set into the work of community groups.  Business, commerce and trade interests along the Border have enough uncertainty as it is.  We will have uncertainty until Britain's membership of the EU actually comes to an end.  The lead-in period is going to be difficult for everybody, but it will be particularly difficult for those involved in trade, commerce and business.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Ms McIntyre about the funding of capital projects and revenue projects, which is a distinction that used to be made in central government Departments and at local authority level.  Capital projects involve the provision of new bricks and mortar facilities.  The revenue side involves the funding of ongoing programmes of support in areas like child care, health, education and community endeavour.  Ms McIntyre mentioned that some projects will continue beyond 2020.  Is it expected that such projects are more likely to be on the revenue support side than on the capital side?  Is there an expectation that capital projects will need to be completed before 2019 or whenever Britain leaves the EU?</p> <p>  As a representative of two rural Border counties, I have worked with Ms McIntyre's colleagues since the PEACE and INTERREG programmes were first established.  These programmes have been and continue to be of huge benefit to many urban and rural communities.  They have built capacity in communities and have given communities that were not previously getting assistance from central or local government the confidence to do things.  In many cases, the quantum of money was important but not as important as the assistance to help a community group to get a project moving along.</p> <p>  I am aware of facilities that were developed by great projects in counties Cavan and Monaghan and are being used day and night to a huge extent.  They would not have been developed without the PEACE and INTERREG programmes and the initiative of certain people.  Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach in 1994 worked with other people in the North and the South to get the EU to support these projects.  Mr. Alasdair McDonnell's party was hugely supportive of this very innovative and ambitious initiative in the European Parliament at the time.  Thankfully, there has been a huge return to communities, individuals and families on the work and investment of the Irish and British Governments and the EU, from which most of the investment has come.</p></speech>

We are as positive as we can possibly be in the circumstances of the uncertainty that is facing us at some point, as we all know.  We do not know when it will be.  The conditions that are in place at the moment allow us to provide this funding.  As a result, we have the confidence to allocate letters of offer.  This matter needs to be kept under constant review.  At the end of 2018, we will review whether anything has changed and whether we need to make any specific changes in this respect within the programmes.  We will keep all of this under review.</p> <p>  The positive message is that we are now able to make full allocations to the programmes as a result of the assurances that have been received from the UK Treasury and the commitment of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government to get us to where we are today.  I would say that a mixture of these projects will be left behind after 2020.  Some letters of offer run up to 2021 and 2022.  While they are probably all revenue projects, we envisage that many capital build projects within the PEACE programme will also run past 2020.  All of that is taken into consideration when projects are assessed and when Departments approve funding for those projects.</p> <p>  We share the committee's views regarding the benefits of these programmes over the years.  In the time available, I could not begin to acknowledge those benefits.  I could provide some figures to give an idea of the quantum, but I could not over-emphasise the qualitative impact of the cross-Border work that has been done in these projects as a result of the provision of EU funding in this region.</p> <p>  I would welcome the members of the committee if they were to come and meet those involved in some of our projects at any time.  Some of them probably meet people involved in the great work that happens in these kinds of projects every day.  I thank the committee again.</p></speech>

Will the Minister confirm that this measure will kick in in December next year?  Is it confined to invalidity pensions?  I take it that illness benefit, occupational injury benefit, etc. are not covered by it?   Will the Minister give an indication of the full year cost of the extension of eligibility for invalidity pension?  Does he have any costing for the extension of eligibility to the self-employed if the measure were to encompass illness benefit and occupational injury benefit?</p></speech>

There was crash involving a truck on the M50 and then it started to snow.  Of course, these things never happened when I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, but they do on occasion.</p><p> The Deputy is correct.  This section simply extends access to invalidity pension to self-employed persons and will not take effect until December 2017.  I would prefer if it was to start earlier than that date.  I was hoping it would take effect in March, June or even September, but it requires the Department to gear up to deal with something new administratively.  Given that treatment benefits and other new measures are also being introduced, on this occasion it has to do more with administrative reasons than savings.  It is not true, however, of the changes in weekly rates which it is estimated will cost between &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million in year one and &euro;25 million in a full year.  It is very difficult to know the exact number of self-employed persons who may be eligible for invalidity pension, but that is the estimated cost of the changes in weekly rates.</p><p> The section does not apply to illness benefit.  This is something I will examine in the context of a future Social Welfare Bill or budget.  It is a hard nut to crack because when an employee is out sick, he or she goes to the doctor, receives a certificate and is paid on an hourly, daily or weekly basis.  For a self-employed person, the process is much more complicated.</p><p> The Deputy is correct that the section also does not cover occupational injury benefit, but it is my intention to examine some aspects of the scheme, particularly disablement benefit with a view to including it either in a Bill in the spring or a future budget.</p></speech>

They are long overdue, particularly for councillors who will finally be brought under the scheme.  As a former councillor, like many other members, I know the long hours that are put and the work that goes into the job.  The changes introduced a number of years ago for all local authorities resulted in increased demands on and an increased workload for councillors, with many meetings now taking place during the day.  The changes, however, are welcome.  Councillors had been paying PRSI for many years and getting nothing in return.  This is a welcome first step and I hope the changes can be rolled out across the board and that in return we will see enhanced services.</p> <p>  There is a reference in the Bill to the bereavement grant which, as we all know, was abolished in 2014 by the then Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  There is still a form of grant available but not in the way it was awarded previously in the sense that it is awarded at the discretion of the community welfare officer.  Is it the Minister's intention to reinstate the bereavement grant at its previous level?  It was welcomed by and hugely beneficial to many people who found themselves in very difficult circumstances in arranging the burial of a loved one.  There is a reference to it in the Bill.  Is this an indication that it will be restored fully at some point in the future?  I seek clarity on that issue.</p></speech>

There was the general bereavement grant that almost everyone received and which was abolished by the previous Government.  There is a bereavement payment in cases involving the death of a person in the course of work.  It is PRSI related.  If a person dies in the course of his or her work or even on the way to work, the payment is made.  It remains in place.  There is also a payment that is based on the exceptional needs payment which one requests from the community welfare officer.  It is my intention to extend the bereavement payment scheme to cover self-employed persons killed in the course of or on the way to work.</p> <p>  I agree that it would be nice to restore the general bereavement grant, but it would cost between &euro;20 million and &euro;30 million to do so and the money was not available in the budget to do so on this occasion.</p> <p>  In terms of my priority list of things I would like to do if I had a little more money, at the top of the list is the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  The bereavement grant would be further down the list, but if we continue to enjoy economic recovery and see recovery budgets, the measures I will be looking to have reinstated include the telephone allowance, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the bereavement grant, but it was just not possible to accommodate them in the envelope I had available to me on this occasion.</p></speech>

The bereavement payment is a benefit.  The reference in the section is specific to a grant that was abolished in 2014.  I accept that the Minister would like to reintroduce it, but if the terminology is retained in the Bill, I would like to see the grant restored fully.  Is the specific reference to it in the Bill an indication that he will examine the matter in the context of the budget next year?</p></speech>

References to the bereavement grant remain in the Bill, but it is not a live scheme.  I guess one might say the Bill still makes legislative provision for it, but the payment is zero.

It relates to the timing of payments.  A number of similar amendments have been tabled and all relate to the date on which payments are to be made.  They seek to bring forward the date of payment of the relevant payments to 1 January.  The rationale for changing budget day some years ago was to ensure all payments and taxation measures would run for the entire calendar year from 1 January to 31 December.  It was to give departmental officials time to roll out the taxation measures and changes introduced in the budget from 1 January.  I understand the amendment has been ruled out of order because it would impose an additional cost on the Exchequer, but that does not take from the principle that a commitment was given to run budgets from 1 January to 31 December, a commitment from which we have moved away.  While many other taxation measures will take effect from 1 January, payments for pensioners and people with disabilities are being pushed back to March.  I have now made the point and will not make the same argument on all of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.  Ten amendments were tabled to seek to have all of the relevant payments made from 1 January.  It is unfortunate that old age pensioners and people with disabilities will have to wait until March to receive their increased payments.  It may be a little late in the day, but I urge the Minister to reconsider that decision.</p></speech>

I can understand the rationale but I believe it is time to look at this rule, especially in the context of the changed political situation.  I put it to the Minister that, at a minimum, this regulation preventing Members of the Opposition from putting forward amendments that are a charge on the Exchequer is being very broadly interpreted by the relevant officials.  We have put down amendments in the past which by no stretch of the imagination could be deemed to be a charge on the Exchequer, but they were ruled out of order on the one-in-a-million chance that they might be a charge on the Exchequer.</p> <p>  I recall a situation when I was the Minister.  Certain amendments were put forward by the Opposition that were ruled out of order since they would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  I agreed with those amendments and I did not think they would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  The net result was that I had to bring an amendment on Report Stage because I agreed with the amendments being put forward.  It is high time we looked at that.</p> <p>  There is a more general point about the amendments.  Deputy Brady is right.  Since we introduced the practice of October budgets it has been automatic that increases come into effect from 1 January.  Obviously, this is a departure from that situation.  In my view, it is an unwelcome departure.  If the budget is in October, even late October, pensioners and those reliant on social welfare are entitled to assume that an increase in their social welfare will be an increase for the year beginning 1 January.  I call on the Minister to give an indication that it is his intention to revert to the logical system whereby changes in an October budget will come into effect from 1 January rather than six months later.</p></speech>

In the course of the budget negotiations my efforts were initially aimed at ensuring that there would be a &euro;5 increase in the basic maximum payments for all recipients and that this would be the case across the board.  That was my first priority.  My second priority was that the increase would be &euro;5.  My third priority was that it would be put in place as early as possible.  I got my way on the first two points but I struggled to get my way on the third point.</p> <p>  There was talk of May and June.  We managed to push it back.  With the assistance of the party opposite, we managed to keep bringing it back to an earlier date.  Early March was the date we agreed.  Of course I would have preferred for the date to be 1 January, but I do not have &euro;60 million to do that.  The only way to create the &euro;60 million necessary would be to exclude one group - potentially, jobseekers, and I had no wish to do that - or else pay less than &euro;5, for example, &euro;3.80 or &euro;4, and I had no wish to do that either.</p> <p>  Certainly, I will make the submission for the budget next year on the basis that we will revert to 1 January as the normal day for such payments.  Before that became the norm, it was not the norm.  Throughout the 1990s when we had budgets in October, it was regular for increases not to come into effect until March, April or even May.  These would have included McCreevy budgets, for example.  It is not unprecedented.  In this budget, as in previous budgets, certain measures come in at different times of the year.  The first-time buyer incentive is being backdated to July for a particular reason.  Other measures, such as the child care subsidy, are not coming into effect until September.  It is not unprecedented historically nor is it entirely unusual in the context of this budget and social welfare package.</p></speech>

I urge the Minster to examine this area further, in particular, because there is a serious problem in regard to chiropodists.  There is no scheme to cover people who might have difficulties, for example, people who might have diabetes.  Some people might not have a medical card but having access to a chiropodist could help to identify problems early on.  This would allow them to get the necessary treatment that would ultimately save the State considerable amounts of money in the long term because of the impact in respect of cost of care and hospital treatment, etc.  The Minister should consider extending the scheme to cover chiropody.  This would allow people under a scheme to have problems identified early on.  I urge the Minster to consider this area, if not for this Bill, then perhaps for next year.  Ultimately, it would save the State considerable amounts of money and I urge the Minister to examine the matter.</p></speech>

The intention is that from March self-employed people will have access to the free dental check and eye test for the first time, just as employees do.  Then, from October, everyone, including self-employed and employed, in other words all contributors to PRSI, will once again have access to scale and polish treatment for teeth as well as subsidised eye glasses and hearing aids.  This will be a partial reversal of the cuts made under a previous Government.</p> <p>  I caution the House that this is all subject to an agreement with the people who provide these services.  The dentists are private practitioners, as are opticians.  Those discussions have started already.  I will be meeting the dentists personally on Monday.  I hope they will come along with us on this.  It is always possible for the Government simply to issue a contract and allow those dentists and opticians who want to avail of it to do so, while those who do not want to need not.  My initial effort will be to try to get the associations that represent those groups to agree to it.  I hope they will since some of them have been calling for this for some time.

This is the idea that everyone pays into the system.  Everyone should pay social insurance, even if it is only a small amount.  In return, everyone should benefit.  We run the risk in this society of dividing society into a group of people who pay a lot of taxes and get little in return, because they are excluded due to means tests and so on, and another group who contribute very little, who think they should not contribute anything, but who, at the same time, think they should be entitled to everything, even for free.  That is not the kind of society I want.  The society I want is one that is contributory, one in which everyone who can pay in, pays in, even if it is only a small amount.  In return, people get guaranteed benefits that are not means tested or do not involve waiting lists.  The social insurance benefits we get, such as the contributory pension, maternity benefit, paternity benefit and so on are good examples.  Treatment benefit is one of these.</p> <p>  While this may not be the position of my party, my personal view is that I foresee us in future using the social insurance system in the way that France does, for example, to pay for more things and, perhaps, more treatments.  For example, in France a person can have his doctor fees partially refunded from social insurance.  I am unsure about chiropodists but potentially it could work for them as well.  That is a good system of social insurance and it works.  First of all, it is contributory.  People understand that they have to pay for it and that someone else is not going to pay for it.  They know Apple or someone else will not pay for medical care.  That system also allows us to use private providers effectively.</p><p>There has never been a waiting list for any of these schemes.  The fact they are provided by private providers makes it possible.</p></speech>

The Minister made an alarming statement but perhaps I misheard him.  Did the Minister state that he does not have the opticians or the dental fraternity on board?  Has he had discussions with these sectors in the context of the roll-out?  Perhaps I misheard him, but certainly that is what came across.  If that is the case, it is alarming.  What discussions have taken place if they are not on board?  If the Minister does not have these two sectors on board, it raises very serious questions as to how this will be rolled out in the timeframe mentioned.</p></speech>

Discussions have taken place at official level and I will be involved further discussions in the next week or two.  It is my strong view that before entering negotiations - technically, under competition legislation, they are probably not negotiations - or discussions with a professional body, we should first come to the House and obtains its assent to proceed.  At present, I do not have the legislative power to do it, so how could I possibly agree anything until the Bill is passed?  I do not have the power to agree anything or to even introduce a scheme.  We also need money to do it and that will require the Estimates to be passed.  It is appropriate that I come to the House of the people to ask it to give me the legislative power to do this and, through the Estimates, the money to pay for it.  Then I will talk to the interest groups, professional bodies, unions and the people who represent them.  This is what was done for free GP care for children aged under six and people over 70.  First we provided for it in the Estimates, then we legislated for it and negotiated the contract with the GPs.</p></speech>

At present, councillors pay PRSI at the class K rate of 4% on their income as public officeholders, provided that income exceeds &euro;5,200 per annum.  Payment of class K by councillors is not reckonable towards establishing entitlement to social insurance pensions and benefits.</p><p>Separately, I propose to amend regulations which will, in general, bring the income of members of a local authority into the class S PRSI charge as self-employed contributors.  This will mean that members of a local authority will continue to pay a 4% charge on their income, but will be now be entitled to access the same social insurance benefits available to self-employed people, on the basis of paying class S.</p><p>I propose this amendment having listened carefully to the views of councillors, Senators and Deputies on the matter.  The class K charge was introduced for good reason during the financial crisis.  However, it is now appropriate that the position of local authority members in the years ahead be re-examined.</p><p>I am particularly cognisant of the changing role of councillors, which means that more and more of them are engaged on a full-time basis in their role as public representatives.  Where this is the case, they have no access to social insurance benefits and no contributory pension when they retire. </p><p>Given that other public officeholders, such as members of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary, have access to very generous pension arrangements and severance payments, I am convinced that we need to do something to improve the position of councillors given their important role in the democratic process and uniquely unfair situation where they pay 4% PRSI and receive no benefits.</p><p>The measure will allow councillors to gain access to the social insurance system and thereby build up entitlements to benefits, including entitlement to the contributory State pension, which is payable at retirement age.  Payment of class S contributions will also give entitlement to a range of other benefits, subject to satisfying the contribution conditions for these schemes.  In addition to State pension, councillors will be entitled to access widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension should a councillor die while at working age, guardian's payment, maternity benefit, paternity benefit and adoptive benefit should they need to take time off to look after a child.</p><p>With effect from December 2017, as we discussed earlier, self-employed workers will have access to invalidity pension on the same basis as employees.  Should a local authority member fall sick and have to resign from the council he or she could potentially avail of an invalidity pension.  In addition, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which we mentioned previously.</p></speech>

Unlike other members of the committee, I do not have extensive experience of working as a councillor.  My experience is confined to a brief inglorious period on Limerick Corporation, which, quite frankly, I do not miss.  My understanding is that the K stamp is being converted into an S stamp so councillors will attract the same benefits as anybody else paying S contributions.  Will the Minister tell us when this will commence?  Perhaps he already said that and I missed it.</p></speech>

This is my first time to deal with social welfare legislation and I am trying to deal with all of the amendments.  I jumped in a little bit early on this issue.  We welcome this and what I said already stands.  I am a former councillor, and many councillors throughout the State work seven days a week doing an awful lot of work.  The changes made in 2014 enhancing the powers of local authorities and councillors also increased their workload.  Many are trying to hold down part-time jobs or permanent jobs as well as being a councillor and it is becoming more and more difficult to do this.  More and more councillors are becoming full-time public representatives.  To pay PRSI contributions and get nothing in return is a serious injustice in the context of the work they do.  We welcome this as a first step and, as I stated previously, we hope it can be extended with more benefits extended to councillors who do enormous work in public office and work lengthy hours.  We welcome this as a starting point.</p></speech>

I had Civil Service status when I joined the post office in 1979 and made a class of PRSI contribution that offered no benefits under the social insurance system either.  If any amount is paid, something should be received in return.  Therefore, I support the amendment.</p></speech>

The report shall be conducted on the financial and social effects of the changes to the One-Parent Family Payment since 2015, taking account <i>inter alia</i>of poverty rates among those in receipt of the payment and that the report shall be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection within six months of enactment of this Bill.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>We are aware of the serious difficulties faced by lone parents.  This section of society is far more susceptible to poverty.  This is particularly true in the case of child poverty.  Figures show that 22.1% of children in lone parent families are living in a permanent state of poverty.  Before the Minister starts to give his definition of poverty, many organisations will stand over this statistic.  These difficulties were compounded by the changes introduced by the Government.  We are seeking a report on the social and financial impacts of the changes to the one-parent family payment to be completed within six months and presented to the committee.  It is not a huge ask.  We know the difficulties and have heard from organisations such as SPARK.  The facts are there for anyone to see.  Will the Minister recognise the difficulties experienced by lone parents and the poverty levels encountered by them?  I urge him to support this amendment and report back to the committee within six months.</p></speech>

The deprivation rate is touching on 60%, which is alarming.  The Minister will also be aware that an independent report commissioned by his Department and written by Drs. Crosse and Millar was particularly scathing about the changes made to the current system which the previous Minister stated should not be introduced in the absence of a Scandinavian-type child care system.  She committed to not introducing the changes without such a system being in place, but she went ahead and introduced them anyway.  As I understand it, all the amendment is seeking is a report.  Naturally, I am sympathetically disposed to it because I have tabled an amendment that pretty much seeks the same thing, except that it looks for the report to be presented within three months.  That would allow us to have meaningful discussions on the way forward for lone parents.  Whatever it may be - we received various recommendations on the day the committee met Drs. Crosse and Millar - it is not the way we are proceeding.  The Bill allows for an increase of &euro;20 in the income a lone parent can earn without being affected.  I welcome this, but nevertheless the problem remains and will not go away.  All the flaws, failings and inequities that have manifested themselves in the current system are still there.  The committee will return to this issue and make recommendations to the Minister.  It would, therefore, be good if the Department were to examine it, particularly in the light of the Crosse-Millar report, and report back to the committee to inform our discussions.</p></speech>

It is an important amendment.  I wish to bolster the argument made for it.  Disregarding the Minister's position on poverty levels, organisations such as Bernardos, Social Justice Ireland and SPARK, as well as the Crosse-Millar report, all emphasise that there is a continuum of child poverty rates among children of lone parents.  The figure stands at 22.1%.  It is 7.9% for two-parent families with fewer than four children.  That figure was referred to in another report in 2014.  We are talking about lone parents and a certain number of two-parent families.  The issue has to be dealt with and needs to be reviewed continuously.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to support the amendment.  As stated, the issue has been discussed in committee.  Three groups have attended to date and they have all emphasised the fact that there is no doubt that there is child poverty in this country and that we have to deal with the issue.  While they welcome the increase in the income disregard and the Christmas bonus, the fundamental issues have to be challenged.  I support the amendment and ask the Minister to support it also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#F01300"><p>Lest anything I said in the past has been misconstrued, I do not deny for one second that there is child poverty.  Of course, there is.  I also acknowledge that the rate of poverty among children is higher than it is among adults.  The rate of child poverty in Ireland is significantly higher than the rate of among pensioners.  I acknowledge that the rate of poverty among children in households where someone is parenting alone is higher than it is in households where there are two parents.  While we might disagree on the percentage, I do not deny and totally accept that there is a problem.  How I think we should deal with it may be different.  We should deal with it by having more lone parents in work rather than in receipt of welfare payments and focusing on services such as child care rather than transfers.  Where there are transfers, the best way to deal with child poverty is through having a new system of transfers.  I hope the working family payment will do this.  It will be a targeted payment to reduce child poverty and which will not take much interest in whether a person is married or cohabiting or otherwise or even whether he or she is working.  I would like to see it, if one likes, as a second tier of child benefit for lower income families.  This is probably the best way to deal with child poverty.</p> <p>  On the amendments, the Deputies will be aware that my Department administers more than 65 separate schemes and services which serve a diverse group of clients, including families, employees and employers, jobseekers, people with disabilities, carers and older people.  All of the schemes and services are kept under constant review, with a view to ensuring they continue to meet the needs of my Department's customers.  In line with the programme for Government and the responsibilities of my Department more generally, a number of specific reviews are under way or will commence shortly.  They include a review of the back to work family dividend which will be a focused policy assessment which is being undertaken.  It is examining the rationale underpinning the scheme and its effectiveness in helping families to transition from welfare payments to work.  A formal review of the jobseeker's transition payment will commence in 2017.  It will take the form of a value for money review and examine the payment since its inception in 2013.</p><p>With regard to the working family payment, in line with the programme for Government the effectiveness of the family income supplement scheme is currently being examined along with a range of other supports for jobseekers and those in employment in the context of developing a new working family payment.  On the issue of reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance for young jobseekers, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, is currently undertaking research to examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training and employment programmes and opportunities.  The findings of this research will inform my Department&rsquo;s review of the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers into employment, education or training.  A review of the community employment, CE, scheme has been completed and the findings of that review are now being considered.  The proposed amendments call for the laying of reports before the House following a review of the impact of the increase in the national minimum wage on income thresholds for social welfare, the household benefits package, eligibility criteria for qualifying for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, eligibility criteria for the State contributory pension and changes introduced to the one-parent family payment in 2012, which I know is the matter of most concern to Deputies in the House, given their comments.  As I have indicated when I attended this committee recently, my officials and I will continue to work closely with the Oireachtas joint committee and will continue to regularly appear before the committee to present and respond on matters of interest to the committee, including the reports that I have mentioned, as well as addressing issues such those that affect lone parents and the working family payment.</p><p> From listening to Deputies just now, the obvious major concern is around the changes that were made to the one-parent family welfare entitlements.  The difficulty in doing any review now is that it is still early days and, as with any reform, it may take a number of years before the full impact of the measure is known.  We know already that 3,000 lone parents have moved from a weekly payment to family income supplement and therefore, by definition, have moved out of poverty.  That is positive.  There are a number of measures in the budget to assist lone parents back to education, to allow them to keep more earned income if they are working, and to increase their weekly payments whether they are working or not.  Again, we will not know the impact of those measures for some time.</p><p> Deputies are aware of the Millar and Crosse report on activation.  We had hoped that good advice would come out of the report on what activation measures work.  Unfortunately the report fell short in that regard.  It was not, and does not claim to be, an analysis of the impact of the changes - made by the previous Government - on lone parents.  The report was based on interviews with people from interest groups and with a number of lone parents.  It was not an econometric analysis of how the changes impacted on people across the board, but perhaps that is merited.  I would be open to asking my Department to commission a report from an independent body such as the ESRI, or another body, to actually carry out that assessment and have a look back on the impact of the changes.  For some people the changes have been positive.  For others they have been negative.  Perhaps it is an appropriate time to ask such an independent body to carry out an analysis to be published within six months.  I would prefer to not have that written into the legislation but if Deputies are willing to do that I would be happy to make a commitment that we would commission such an analysis and have it done within six months.  This may help us to inform any decisions we make going in to the budget negotiations in September 2017. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#G00200"><p>I welcome the last couple of lines spoken by the Minister, if he is going to support this amendment.  It is critical that we have a report because we do not need to wait to see the impact on lone parents and their families of the measures introduced.  The Minister is correct - and he acknowledged the fact - that the reality is children in lone-parent families are at a higher poverty level of 22.1%, as opposed to 11% for children in two-parent families.  That is nearly double the State average of child poverty levels.  We do not need to wait to see the impact.  We need a report.  I welcome the Minister's support for this amendment.  The Minister made reference to the report by Dr. Millar.  It is interesting that there has been no formal response by the Minister to the Millar report.  This does not surprise me because the Millar report lays on the table, in black and white, the impact of these changes on lone-parent families.  It may not be the report the Minister wanted.  It may not be the report he was hoping for or was expecting but it is a report that shows the impacts quite graphically and it makes a series of recommendations.  The difficulties and the impacts of these changes on lone parents have been compounded in budget 2017.  For some lone parents it is actually better for them to go back on to a jobseeker's payment, and I assure the Minister this is happening as we speak.  Because of the changes in the budget, lone parents are looking at how much better off they are, either in employment or in receipt of the jobseeker's payment.  Unfortunately the measures that have been introduced - and compounded in this budget - mean it is more financially rewarding for lone parents to stay on a jobseeker's payment.  These are the realities.  I welcome that the Minister is going to agree to the amendment, and I welcome the fact that he chose to throw into the mix a number of the other reports that the Department is going to look at such as the programme for Government commitment around the discriminatory payments for unemployed people who are under the age of 26.  Last week I queried the T&aacute;naiste on the whereabouts of that report, as it was committed to in the programme for Government.  I welcome the fact that the report is coming, albeit a little bit late.  I believe the report with regard to the discriminatory cuts in payments for the under-26s was committed to be delivered in the last quarter of this year.  As the Minister brought these into the discussion here in the Chamber, and we probably will not have another opportunity, perhaps he could give members specific timeframes around the delivery of the reports, especially the report on the cuts in payments for those under 26.  When exactly can we see that report?  As with lone parents, people under 26 who are unemployed have not only been hit with cuts that are discriminatory, there are real hard-hitting consequences for young unemployed people as shown in figures provided by groups such as Focus Ireland which illustrate the increase in youth homelessness.  Could the Minister provide clarity around those measures?</p></speech>

He spoke about an independent report, rather than a slight change to the wording, within six months.  I am concerned by this as the Minister has only recently had an independent report from Millar and Crosse.  The Minister has said that the report was not evidence-based, was not broad enough, it gave too narrow a focus and that it only interviewed particular groups and a few lone parents.  There was another report recently with regard to lone parents in education, which was supposed to have come before the budget to give some ideas around education.  I would like to reiterate to the Minister that lone parents, along with other groups such as disability groups, were really hammered during the austerity years.  In 2015 the one-parent family payment was taken away, the back to work family dividend was brought in at a much lower level and the family income supplement was introduced.  Two years later, a lone parent who works 20 hours per week has an income that is 17% less than before, even though they are in work and trying to earn money.</p><p>If they get sick, they cannot get any support either.  As a society, it will be shameful if we do not examine the effect it is having on child poverty and how we can change payments to support lone parents, families and people aged under 25 years.  As I said, the poverty rate is 7.9% for two-parent families with fewer than four children.  If the Minister does this, I will welcome it.</p></speech>

Is JST exclusive to lone parents?  Perhaps the report could cover a number of the issues we are discussing.  The Minister said the best way out of poverty was to get a job.  The difficulty is that the changes brought about have made it less attractive for many lone parents to go out to work.  I have read the Millar report and it accords exactly with my experience in dealing with my constituents every day.  I could bring several constituency files to the Minister which clearly show how lone parents are losing out as a result of the changes.  Therein lies the difficulty.  The Minister said it was early days to review the system.  However, it has been in operation for more than two years.  Many people, not lone parents who stay at home and collect their social welfare but genuine people who want to better themselves and improve their family circumstances by going out to work, are worse off and continue to be worse off as a result of the changes.  We cannot put it on the long finger or discuss the potential for different schemes in the future.  It is having a real effect on real people as we speak.</p> <p>  I did not take in the Minister's last point.  Does he propose that he will commission the ESRI or some outside body to produce an independent report which would be available to the committee?  That is good and I welcome it.  However, I must be a little sceptical about these things.  I was here when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joan Burton, made a very firm commitment to the House that the changes would not be brought about until the Scandinavian child care system was in place in this country.  All sides of the House can agree that the former Minister's commitment was not honoured.</p></speech>

The Millar report is damning of the policy on lone parents.  If there is an independent report, who will commission it and will the Minister act on the findings?  Had he acted on the Millar report, which would have cost a lot of money, the policy on lone parents would have been rolled back.  It is important who commissions the report.  We do not want to produce a report for the sake of it.</p></speech>

The recent economic crash devastated lone parents but also middle income earners, and there was mass emigration.  The Minister is building year on year and trying to help the most vulnerable through various mechanisms, not only in child care but in back to education allowance, the new allowance for lone parents and the HAP scheme.  People in receipt of rent supplement are prohibited from working more than a certain number of hours, which deters people from returning to work.  Nowhere in the Millar report is it stated, nor did I hear at committee level until I asked the question, what the benefit will be to the families who will avail of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme that will allow them to work more hours than they are working, or the additional child care measures that have been put in place and that will come in for those families who need it the most.  The Minister has focused in on those very heavily.  I would very much welcome a more detailed economic report, not to put percentages over children's heads but to deal with the reality these families have to deal with.  We are building on it, and although we are a long way off where we need to be, we are getting there.</p></speech>

The review will provide a detailed analysis of the activation of JST payment recipients.  On completion of the review, officials will available to discuss its findings with the Oireachtas joint committee.  Given that the majority of JST payment recipients were previously in receipt of the one-parent family payment, OFP, the review will provide my Department with an analysis of former OFP recipients.  It is a very discrete piece of work dealing with those who were in receipt of OFP and changed to JST.</p> <p>  The jobseeker's report is being done externally by NUI Maynooth.  Although I do not know when the final draft will be delivered, I will find out and let the committee know later in the afternoon.  Youth unemployment is falling very rapidly, and faster than unemployment among older adults.  That has to count for something.  There are specific measures regarding young people who are homeless, such as reducing their rent contributions, which I have included in the budget in response to requests from the homeless charities.  While some have said the reduction in jobseeker's allowance for young jobseekers has contributed to the rise in homelessness, I have yet to see any evidence-based paper or analysis that supports this opinion.  While people are entitled to their opinions, it is not a fact.</p> <p>  I do not think my Department commissioned the Millar report, although we funded it through the Irish Research Council.  It was to be a report on activation, what works and how we can get lone parents into employment.  Unfortunately, it was not that.  It turned into something different.  It was an interview-based analysis of the changes made over the years.  Unfortunately, it was not very useful to us.  We can do a formal response to it.  However, it did not give us what we wanted, what we asked for or what it said in its title, namely, Lone Parents and Activation, What Works and Why.  I had hoped what would come out of it would have been a study of, for example, ten different countries and a list of ten actions that succeed in activating lone parents and ten actions that do not.  It did not do this.  It fell down very badly on what it was supposed to give us.  It is disappointing.  However, the Millar report does show the need for us to commission a report into the impact of the changes and the reforms of lone parent payments during recent years.  It must examine several issues, including the impact on incomes, employment and welfare dependency.  Most of us in the House, maybe not all of us, believe reducing welfare dependency is a good thing.  Some academics question this view and believe people are better off on welfare than in certain types of employment.</p><p>I do not believe that.  For reasons of confidence, mental health, self-respect and how they are considered in society, people are always better off working than on welfare, even if they might be a little better off on welfare.  I appreciate that some politicians do not agree with that view.  Many academics certainly do not hold that view, although they never seem to identify where the funds should come from to pay for a contrary view.  With the Deputies' agreement, and if they are willing to withdraw these amendments, I propose to commission such a report and have it carried out by an external body.  I am not sure whether we must tender it but I would have thought a body such as the ESRI or similar would be the kind of body that could carry out the report and consider the matter in the round, namely, the impact on employment, incomes and welfare dependency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#J00200"><p>I will not withdraw the amendment.  The report needs to be carried out.  We need the provision in the legislation, not for the sake of it, because, as Deputy Kenny said, we do not want a report or document to be prepared only to be put on a shelf alongside many other reports that have not been acted on.  It needs to be a factual report that ultimately will be acted on.  I could have tabled a series of other amendments to the Bill asking the Minister to take measures to reverse some of the measures that impact on lone parents but, as I outlined in my opening contribution, my hands are tied as to the type of amendment I can table.  We have seen numerous amendments ruled out of order because of a financial impact on the Exchequer.  Having the measure provided for in this amendment contained in legislation, tying the Government to carrying out the report, is one part of the equation; acting on it is the second part.</p> <p>  I agree with the Minister's comments on welfare dependency.  I and my party strive to end it and to get people back to work, but it is difficult when zero-hour contracts affect many of the people about whom we are talking and when the Government has failed even on the family income supplement.  There has been no increase in the family income supplement to provide assistance to many of the people about whom we are speaking, such as lone parents, etc.  The Minister can come into the Chamber and talk the talk, but problems occur when there is failure to increase the support provided under measures such as the family income supplement.  That is what forces people on zero-hour contracts or in low-pay employment back onto jobseeker's allowance because the latter may be financially more advantageous to them because of the failure of the Minister's Government to provide an increase in the family income supplement.  He outlined that some economists and politicians put forward proposals and suggest increases but fail to show where they will get the money from.  If the Minister took the time to read through Sinn F&eacute;in's pre-budget submission, he would see that my party proposed an increase in the family income supplement and showed where the money for the increase would come from, in line with all the other increases and measures about which we speak.</p> <p>  Finally, regarding youth unemployment, the Minister said that the figures and statistics put out on youth homelessness are only that.  He said there are no figures and no hard or concrete evidence to back up statements on youth homelessness.  However, these are departmental figures that show that youth homelessness is on the increase.  That can only be down to the measures that have been introduced.  I welcome the marginal increase in the amount that young homeless people or young people in receipt of rent supplement must pay out of their pockets, but that will only affect in the region of 500 under-26s, so we are not dealing with huge numbers.</p> <p>  There are many issues in this regard.  I am pressing the amendment.  I will not withdraw it.  The amendment seeking the report within six months is one part of the equation.  We then need action based on the outcome of the report.</p></speech>

He went on to say that he will undertake to commission a separate report along the lines suggested in the amendment.  If the report on the jobseeker's transitional payment covers the issues, why does the Minister feel it necessary to commission a second report?  I want some clarification on that.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Kenny: what is the point in having a huge number of reports on which one cannot necessarily act?  The sense I have from members from all the parties opposite is that they would particularly like a report on one-parent families and lone parents.</p> <p>  Picking up on something Deputy Brady mentioned, I read the Sinn F&eacute;in submission in detail and I acknowledge that the party proposes an increase in the amounts awarded under FIS.  It also proposes a three-year increase for the carer's allowance, which is less than I hope Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies will vote for when they vote on this Bill.  The party proposed no increase to many weekly payments.  Any budget is about choices.</p></speech>

However, it still proposed to give carers less than we propose to give them, and it still proposed to give some people nothing when we propose to give people &euro;5 extra per week.  We can come back to the matter later if the Deputy so wishes.</p> <p>  I seek a solution.  A load of amendments seeking reports on different matters have been tabled.  Amendments are tabled on Report Stage so they can be discussed, and we can discuss them in this forum and then discuss them again.  What I do not want to do is commit to doing seven or eight reports on seven or eight different issues.  It is too much to do and too much to handle.  However, if all parties were to agree, and if we were to decide to do one report, the one I would be willing to agree to commission, to do within six months and to do independently is the one on the one-parent family payment and the impacts and the changes in this regard since 2015.  The JST payment is discrete to those in that situation.  I would commit to a new report considering comprehensively the changes to the one-parent family, not just the JST payment.</p></speech>

The point in seeking these reports is that the Committee on Social Protection reviews policy on an ongoing basis.  It is there to help the Minister, not to thwart him and trip him up.  It is there to help him to get the best possible value for the huge amount of money this State spends, rightly, on social protection.  We want to make sure that, as Deputy Brady says, the money is targeted and spent in the most efficient possible way.  The Minister said that he has singled out one report, and I appreciate this.  There is another issue in my amendment which warrants a separate report, but I will agree in this regard to accept the Minister's commitment to prepare a report on it rather than putting it into legislation.  However, regarding lone parents, if the report will be done anyway - the Minister is making a commitment now - why not just write it into the legislation?</p><p>That would not do any violence to the legislation.  It does not involve a charge on the Exchequer.  It does not affect anything else in the Bill.  What great insurmountable difficulty is there with writing it in?  My proposal is for a report to be presented within three months.  The proposal currently before the House is for this to happen within six months.  I do not care which proposal the Minister accepts.  I am not proud.  I do not care whether the Minister accepts my proposal, the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal or the proposal in the name of Deputy Joan Collins.  However, I certainly think this should be written into the legislation.  I am not reflecting on the Minister in any way, or questioning his bona fides for one second, when I say that a previous Minister gave us a firm commitment to do something that patently was not done.  The failure to do it caused a great deal of anguish to many people.  As I have said, the acceptance of this amendment would not harm the legislation in any way.  It would not be a bad precedent for the Government write its commitments into legislation.  Surely there is no great objection in principle to that.</p></speech>

I did not intend to come in until we considered section 23 later in the debate.  The Minister suggested in his most recent intervention that he will select or recommend one of the reports.  I come from a part of the country that has a very high rate of unemployment and where many people depend on part-time work in the fisheries, agriculture and hospitality sectors.  As the Minister will be well aware, the legislation that is in place at present acts as a disincentive to those people to go to work.  The Minister knows how I feel about the grossly unfair daily payment of &euro;12.70 and the requirement to have 39 contributions.  When I discussed this with my party spokesperson, we were aware that there could be a charge on the Exchequer.  I would nearly offer to pay the cost of having this report carried out myself.  There is no real charge on the Exchequer.  We will seek to address this in subsection (7) of amendment No. 32.  I hope to discuss this later.  I put it to the Minister that he is pre-empting the debate on later sections of the Bill by saying he is recommending one amendment now.  I ask the Minister and the other members of the committee not to decide now that a report should not be carried out in respect of this extremely serious issue.  I do not think the cost of such a report would be very much, regardless of whether it were drawn up by his officials or by an independent body.  It is well worth doing.  I implore the Minister and the other members of the committee to support our later amendment in this regard when it is reached.</p></speech>

This effectively happened with the Irish aviation superannuation scheme, IASS.  The OECD has recommended that no scheme should be permitted to wind down unless it is 90% funded.  That type of funding level makes some allowance for decent benefits to be paid out to members.  That must be examined along with abolishing single insolvencies.  We will table amendments on it on Report Stage.  I mention it now because there is nowhere else to mention it.</p> <p>  On section 12, FLAC, the free legal advice centres, contacted most of the members about a few amendments it wished to propose.  It made the point that the explanatory memorandum states that in order to facilitate reviews of entitlement where child benefit is payable in accordance with EU regulations, section 12 provides for an amendment to require employers to provide information relating to child benefit claims.  In effect, according to FLAC, section 12 proposes to provide wide powers to the Minister for Social Protection to enact regulations to compel all employers to provide information on employees for the purpose of determining entitlement to child benefit claims.  Child benefit is classified as a family benefit for the purpose of EU regulations.  Accordingly, EU nationals who come to Ireland to work but whose family resides in other EU member states have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under EU regulations.  This means that EU migrants can access child benefit in Ireland even if their children live in another EU member state.  FLAC and Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation, CLM, have a number of concerns about this proposed provision and how it will operate in practice.  In particular, they are unclear as to the necessity for such a provision.</p> <p>  First, section 12 as currently drafted does not fulfil its stated aim of applying solely to child benefit claims payable in accordance with EU regulations.  The proposed wording is extremely broad and goes beyond its stated intended scope to relate to any child benefit claims.  Given that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim, it is likely that the Department will only contact employers for information regarding non-Irish nationals if the provision is maintained in its current form.</p> <p>  Second, FLAC says the need for such a measure is questionable in light of the responsibility on all social welfare applicants to prove to the Department that they qualify for the payment they are applying for, including child benefit payments payable in accordance with EU regulations.  It is not clear why the Department is seeking to place legal obligations on employers to provide information regarding child benefit claims for EU migrant workers when the onus is already on those workers to establish their eligibility for the payment.</p> <p>  Third, information confirming the employment status of an EU migrant worker in Ireland will often be available to the Department of Social Protection through social insurance contribution records.  To be considered an EU migrant worker, a person must have been in genuine employment since coming to Ireland.  Casual work does not count.  Where an EU migrant worker is engaged in genuine employment in Ireland, they and their employer will be making social insurance contributions to the Department of Social Protection, thus the need for this measure is unclear.</p><p>Finally, there are also privacy concerns about this proposal.  Employers will be required to provide information in respect of child benefit and may become privy to personal information regarding the family situation of their employees which is of no relevance to the employment relationship.  </p><p> Is this really the right place to include an amendment of this sort?  I would like to hear the view of the Department on these issues and to tease them out further with the Minister.</p></speech>

I am concerned with the definition of a "qualified child" and seek some clarity from the Minister with regard to this section of the Bill.  In terms of child benefit, a child is deemed to be no longer a child once he or she reaches 18.  In terms of a qualified child payment to a parent in receipt of social welfare, an 18 year old is deemed to be an adult.  There seems to be a serious anomaly there that the Minister must address.  We cannot have two different definitions of a child, one relating to child benefit and the other relating to the qualified child payment.  I ask the Minister to clarify that.</p> <p>  I refer to the proposed removal of the words, "who is ordinarily resident in the State".  Does that mean that a person living in this State is entitled to receive child benefit for a child or children who do not live within the State?  </p> <p>  Deputy Joan Collins made reference to direct provision earlier, about which I have serious concerns.  I wish to focus on child benefit in particular.  Does the aforementioned change include the payment of child benefit to the parents of children who were born in direct provision?  </p> <p>  Would the Minister consider increasing the qualified child payment as opposed to applying a universal increase to child benefit, as a more targeted approach in the effort to eradicate child poverty?  In the context of the earlier debate about Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals for more targeted measures, we believe that the qualified child payment is a means of directing financial support to specific groups in order to lift children out of poverty.  </p> <p>  I ask the Minister to provide clarity on these issues.</p></speech>

On section 11 as opposed to section 12, the provision does not relate to child benefit but to the supplementary welfare allowance.  The proposed amendment will amend the definition of a qualified child under the supplementary allowance scheme to ensure that the qualified child allowance payment is only paid in respect of children who are ordinarily resident in the State.  This measure will bring the conditionality of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme into line with other Department of Social Protection schemes.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is a safety net within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people who are in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  The basic supplementary welfare allowance is a weekly allowance paid to eligible people who do not have enough income to meet their needs and those of their families and may be payable while such people are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment.  It does not affect child benefit.  It is simply a restating of the fact that people cannot receive the qualified child allowance for a child who is not living in the country.</p><p>On section 12, I have a lengthy reply for the committee because the Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC has also been in touch with my Department about this section.  This reply gives me the opportunity to put on the record the answers to some of the questions posed by Deputy Joan Collins.</p><p>The purpose of section 12 of the Bill is to underpin the process whereby my Department contacts employers to verify continuing employment specifically for child benefit purposes.  The provision is modelled on existing provisions for other social welfare schemes such as the family income supplement, FIS, and the back-to-work family dividend, BTWFD.  My Department is empowered by these provisions to contact employers to verify employment details in order to establish entitlement, new or ongoing, to benefits.  European Union, EU, European Economic Area, EEA, citizens and Swiss nationals working in Ireland qualify for child benefit under EU regulations.  Their children may be resident either here or in their home countries.  The child does not have to be resident in the country but the parent does.  Where the children are resident abroad, customers are required to confirm their continued entitlement to child benefit every six months.  The confirmation includes a statement from the customer's employer or their spouse or partner&rsquo;s employer confirming that the employment is expected to continue.  </p><p>While it is absolutely correct to say that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim, all child benefit customers claiming under domestic legislation must satisfy the habitual residence condition.<b></b>One factor to be taken into consideration in determining habitual residence is the nature and pattern of a person&rsquo;s employment.  Persons are exempt from satisfying the habitual residence condition if they or their spouse or partner are currently employed.  So, by establishing that they are employed, they do not have to go through the process of verifying habitual residence because, by definition if they are employed here they are habitually resident.  For these reasons, it is sometimes necessary for my Department to have access to information on the employment of the customer or his or her spouse or partner.  </p><p>In general, the onus is on customers themselves to prove to my Department that they qualify for any social welfare payment they are applying for, including child benefit payments.  However, situations can arise where it is less problematic for the customer if my Department contacts employers directly in order to confirm employment.  For example, difficulties can arise in the case of child benefit when information on employment is required and where the information does not refer to the customer but to the spouse or partner of the customer.  This is particularly difficult in separation or divorce cases where the customer may not have the co-operation of the spouse, partner or former partner in terms of supplying the required information.  This can lead to a situation where there is an entitlement to child benefit but where the processing of the claim can be impeded.  Contacting employers directly removes this difficulty for customers in that situation.<font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>My Department has access to social insurance contribution records.  However, these records only become available at the end of the tax year and are not available to the Department in real time.  This means that they can only be updated in arrears but while my Department routinely requires employment information for benefit purposes in real time, to await updated social insurance records would delay payment to customers.  The practical thing to do, and the most customer-focused solution, is to contact employers directly where the customer is not in a position to easily provide the necessary information him or herself.  These inquiries with employers are not made on a routine basis and there are no plans to change that.  Having this provision in place will ensure that my Department has a robust legislative basis to make these inquiries where the need arises.  </p><p>I will sign the necessary regulations if this section of the Bill is enacted.  These regulations will set out the elements of the information which will be sought from employers for child benefit purposes. </p><p>I will now turn to the specific questions raised by FLAC.  On the first question, it is correct to stay that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim.  However, all child benefit customers must satisfy the habitual residence condition and one of the qualifying factors for that condition is the nature and pattern of their employment.  For that reason, it is necessary for the child benefit section in Letterkenny to have access to information on the employment status of one or both parents or partners.  </p><p>On the second question, while it is correct to say that the onus is on customers themselves to prove to the Department that they qualify, difficulties do arise in the case of child benefit, as I have already outlined.  I have also already addressed the third question posed by FLAC.  The fourth question relates to casual work.  FLAC has expressed the opinion that such work does not count but this is not entirely correct.  EU Regulation No. 883/2004, Article 1, subsection (a) reads as follows: </p><blockquote>&quot;activity as an employed person&quot; means any activity or equivalent situation treated as such for the purposes of the social security legislation of the Member State in which such activity or equivalent situation exists.</blockquote><p>Confirmation of such employment is required to establish an entitlement to child benefit.</p><p> Regarding privacy, the Department is aware of the obligations of the data controller and makes every effort to avoid breaching these obligations.  The provisions contained in the proposed legislation already exist in terms of most schemes operated by the Department and have been successfully implemented over the years.</p><p> I hope that clarifies the matter.  To cut a long story short, it is not a provision designed in any way to take child benefit from people who are legally here and habitually resident.  Rather, it allows us the legislative basis to contact employers.  Once we know that people are here and in employment in Ireland, we do not need to go through the rigmarole of working out whether they are habitually resident.</p></speech>

FLAC will be in contact with him and I will contact it as well.  The Minister is saying that, under the EU regulation, customers who are non-nationals must verify their eligibility for child benefit every six months.  If that happens anyway, why is he introducing legislation allowing their employers to be contacted as well?  In how many cases has the Department had difficulty dealing with an issue because it has been legislatively unable to contact an employer?  Does the Minister understand what I am asking?  How large of an issue is this for the Department?</p></speech>

I did not receive it, or if I did, I do not recall.  If I understand the Minister, he is saying that this procedure happens regularly anyway under various schemes, including this one, and that he is introducing legislation to underpin that.  There seems to be a discrepancy between the explanatory memorandum and the legislation.  According to the memorandum, the Minister is providing an amendment to require employers to provide information whereas the legislation only gives to the Minister the power to make regulations.  I take it that the regulations will deal with such matters if the employer is not being co-operative, is not replying within a reasonable time to the request or so on.  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

It is done anyway, but not frequently.  Some 408,000 reviews are undertaken every year, but this is done infrequently.  I do not have the exact figures, though.  It is being put into law so that we have a legislative basis to underpin what is done already, namely, to require employers to give us certain information.  This makes it more convenient than potentially having to do a large number of reviews to establish whether someone is still habitually resident.</p> <p>  As provided in this legislation, I will have to set out in detail in the regulations exactly what information will be sought from employers for child benefit purposes.  If the D&aacute;il or Seanad is not happy with those regulations, they can be revoked.</p></speech>

The proposed amendment calls for an annual analysis of child poverty rates and an independent report thereon to be issued to the Minister and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection.  There is already independent annual reporting of child poverty rates through the Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions, SILC, which is carried out as part of an EU-wide survey overseen by EUROSTAT.  SILC forms the basis for further extensive official reporting on child poverty rates through the publication of the Department's annual social inclusion monitor, SIM.   The purpose of this monitor is to report officially on progress towards the national social targets for poverty reduction, including the child-specific poverty rate.</p> <p>  The SIM 2014 is the latest monitor and was published in April 2016.  It includes a specific section that reports on the child social target and related indicators for children and young people.  The findings from the monitor are used to report on progress towards the national social targets for poverty reduction in the national reform programme.  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures contains the child-specific poverty target and commitments on improving economic security and opportunity outcomes for children and young people.</p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has published two annual reports on progress with implementing commitments to date.  These reports are published in May of each year as part of the monitoring and reporting mechanisms set up for the framework.  There is also independent annual commentary on child poverty from the Children's Rights Alliance and other social monitoring by groups, such as TASC.</p> <p>  Given the extensive reporting on child poverty that already exists through a number of different channels, one of which is independent of my Department, namely, the CSO, there does not appear to be a need for additional reporting of the same data by my Department.</p></speech>

I am asking for a report on the specific targeted measures to lift 90,000 children out of poverty and on how the Minister will achieve it in the run up to 2020, which is the timeframe he has signed up to.  The Minister has committed to lifting 90,000 children out of poverty.  Having a specific report on an annual basis outlining the measures, statistics and all of that would be very useful.</p></speech>

It does not ask for any of the measures Deputy Brady refers to.  It is quite specific.  I want to be fair to everyone.  The Deputy is asking for a report to be published annually and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the State's child poverty rates.  It is a statistical report on child poverty rates.  That is the amendment the Deputy has tabled.  The Minister is indicating that these figures are already being published.  The question comes back to the Deputy.

Separate from that, the Department is carrying out a focused policy assessment of the back to work family dividend scheme.  This assessment is focusing on the rationale underpinning the scheme and examining its effectiveness in helping families transition from welfare to work.  The back to work family dividend was designed with the explicit aim of improving the financial work incentives of families in Ireland.  It is designed as an in-work income support to assist families when exiting welfare.  The scheme provides a targeted additional incentive for families to move from welfare to work as employees or self-employed by allowing families to retain payments for children to ensure they are better off in work.  The back to work family dividend scheme allows jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients who have been jobseekers for 12 months or more or recipients of the one parent family payment to retain their full increase for qualified children for the first year in employment, tapering to 50% in the second year.  The dividend is payable at a maximum rate of &euro;29.80 per relevant child up to a maximum of &euro;119.20 for four children.  The number of recipients of the back to work family dividend at the end of September 2016 was just over 12,000 with more than 21,200 beneficiaries.  This includes almost 7,200 former one parent family payment recipients.  The dividend is payable in addition to the family income supplement and has no impact on a family's FIS entitlement.  Combined with the main in-work support, which is FIS, the dividend provides families with a significant financial incentive to make the transition from welfare to employment.  The ESRI also reached the same conclusion after undertaking detailed analysis of it.  Its findings were published in their budget perspectives 2016 paper, Making Work Pay More.</p></speech>

When does the Minister expect that study to be completed?  Will it be referred to the committee for discussion?  Where does that leave the family income supplement?  Is it intended that this particular back to work dividend will exist side by side with the family income supplement or is the reformed back to work dividend going to subsume the FIS payment?</p></speech>

At that stage, it can be referred to the committee for its deliberations.  To answer the Deputy's bigger question, we will need to have a good session at the committee sometime next year on where we are going with the working family payment.  The working family payment can be anything from an additional top-up on top of everything else that exists or it could become a whole new thing that replaces FIS and the back to work family dividend and which is there to lift the incomes of low income families and does not bother itself too much with the recipient's marital status, who they live with or the rest of it.  When I have an options paper ready on it, we will need to have a proper, detailed discussion about it in this committee because it could potentially be a big feature of budget 2018 and also a potentially expensive one.  I am keen to do that.</p></speech>

There is a report already being compiled but this proposed amendment is concerned with where that report is going, on what basis it is being compiled and what is being looked at in the report that is being undertaken.  This amendment is quite specific.  It proposes a report on the effects of the back to work family dividend to include the poverty rates among those in receipt of it.  While the Minister's report might look at specific areas, the report I am looking for is not a million miles away from what is being undertaken but it hones in on those specific areas.  I do not see why the Minister could not agree to this amendment.  Having it in the Bill will ensure the report is carried out and produced in a timely manner with these areas specifically being focused on.</p></speech>

&lsquo;Act of 2015&rsquo; means the International Protection Act 2015;&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>The legislation governing the application of the habitual residence provisions is contained in section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  The amendments now being introduced arise from a recent change in secondary legislation and the pending commencement of certain sections of primary legislation enacted by the Department of Justice and Equality, both of which require that the habitual residence provisions of social welfare law be updated.  I emphasise that there is no change to the habitual residence policy resulting from these amendments.  They relate to the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 and the International Protection Act 2015, both of which were introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>The European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 give further effect to the EU directive on the rights of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within member states.  The regulations came into force on 1 February 2016.  They replaced the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 which are currently referenced in the habitual residence provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  The amendment is necessary to continue to provide that a person who is in the State in accordance with EU law is among those regarded as having a right to reside in the State for the habitual residence provisions.</p><p>The International Protection Act 2015 restates and modifies certain aspects of the law relating to the entry into and presence in the State of persons in need of international protection.  Under the Act, certain legislation, including the Refugee Act 1996, the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and the European (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 are revoked.  They are currently referenced in the habitual residence provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  The proposed amendments will replace these provisions with the relevant provisions of the new International Protection Act.</p><p>I emphasise that the amendments will continue to ensure that, once protection such as refugee status, is granted to a person, that person has a right to access social welfare supports in Ireland on the same basis as an Irish citizen.  Such persons are entitled to apply for any social welfare payment appropriate to their circumstances, subject to satisfying the eligibility criteria of the particular scheme.  The amendments provide that any person who has a refugee declaration or a subsidiary protection declaration under the International Protection Act will have a right to reside for social welfare purposes.  They also include similar provisions for family members of such persons who have permission to reside in the State and persons who are in the State as programme refugees in accordance with the International Protection Act.</p><p>While the amendments in respect of the International Protection Act primarily update the current habitual residence provisions, they also provide that persons who have been granted temporary protection as part of a group of displaced persons under that Act, are regarded as having a right to reside under the habitual residence provisions.  The amendments continue to provide that persons granted protection cannot be regarded as habitually resident in the State for any period before the date protection was granted to them.  They maintain the policy that certain persons such as applicants for or those refused protection, or in respect of whom a deportation order has been made, cannot be considered to be habitually resident in the State for social welfare purposes.  However, while applicants for international protection, mainly asylum seekers, cannot access the schemes to which the habitual residence provisions apply, the Department of Social Protection provides certain supports for them while they are awaiting a decision on their international protection applications.  Such supports include the payment of the direct provision allowance and, as appropriate, exceptional needs payments.  Such persons may also qualify for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.</p><p>It is intended that the provisions relating to the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 will take effect on the enactment of the Bill.  The amendments arising from the International Protection Act 2015 will come into force on the commencement of the relevant provisions of that Act.  This is expected to occur before the end of the year.  To cut a long story short, the International Protection Act which has been passed by the Oireachtas, is replacing a number of pieces of legislation, including the old Refugee Act 1996, the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 and the European (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013.  We need to update social welfare law by taking them out and inserting the provisions of the new legislation in order that everything will be aligned.</p></speech>

I understand the regulations of 2016 are replacing the regulations of 2005.  Is the Minister satisfied that the changes being made do not in any way diminish the right of the people concerned to claim social welfare payments?  Section 246 of the Act, to which the Minister refers, makes it a condition of receiving social welfare payments that a person must be present in the State or another part of the common travel area which includes Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, for a continuous period of at least two years.  It is my experience that this condition is being interpreted very rigidly by social welfare officers.  Many of the people concerned come here in circumstances where, even after two years, they are not able to provide telephone or other bills to prove that they are living here.  I have come across cases of injustice arising directly from the fact that the condition is being interpreted very strictly.</p> <p>  The Minister is incorporating a new category.  The permission applies to a person entering the State as part of a group of displaced persons following a decision of the European Council.  Will the people in question be regarded as continuously resident from the time they arrive here or will they have to wait for a formal decision?</p></speech>

I am not talking about welfare tourists or anything like that; I am referring to someone who is coming back having spent a number of years in Australia, America or wherever else on foot of a job offer.  Perhaps after six months  or one year that job will come to an end and the person concerned will then try to sign on.  There are difficulties with the requirement for such persons to have lived in the State for two years.  While I am not asking for it to be covered in the Bill, I am flagging it as an issue.  I have come across Irish citizens who emigrated, came back, were in a job for a year and then sought entitlements.  It is difficult to prove they have been here for two years to qualify.

What used to be the two-year rule is no more.  I only discovered this in my studies in the past couple of months.  The two-year rule was overturned by the European Court of Justice in favour of a new provision, whereby a person's habitual residence is established according to consideration of five tests or factors to work out his or her centre of economic interest.  It concerns where he or she works and where his or her family and savings are.  That is, of course, much trickier to interpret than having something very straightforward such as a two-year rule.  That is what my officials have to look at in determining whether somebody is habitually resident.  It probably is interpreted strictly, which is not necessarily bad.  We do not want people to arrive in Ireland and claim under our welfare system if they are not habitually resident and do not have a centre of interest here.  I am sure most people do not want that to be the case.</p> <p>  Deputy John Brady made a very valid point about the downside of all of this in referring to returning emigrants who are Irish citizens.  I have come across this in the case of missionaries returning from missions having not been habitually resident in Ireland for a very long time.  We are looking to find some solutions to that dilemma.  However, obviously under European law we have to treat all European citizens the same.  There are many Irish citizens who have never lived in Ireland.  If we were to say they or somebody who has been out of the country for 40 years could avail of the welfare system straightaway, we would have to give the same right to 500 million EU citizens.</p><p>That is one of the consequences of the freedom of movement and the four freedoms that people are so attached to for various reasons.</p><p> With regard to returning emigrants specifically, arrangements are in place with Safe Home, a registered charity, to assist with the difficulties experienced by some returning Irish emigrants in demonstrating their intentions to live here permanently for the purpose of satisfying the habitual residence condition.  To assist such persons, Safe Home has arranged a checklist of a range of documents that will help show that a person has returned to Ireland permanently.  Safe Home has also designed a declaration which will confirm that a person is engaging with it as part of the person's repatriation.  The declaration is associated with any social assistance claim the person might make.  These measures help to expedite the decision-making process in these cases as it can be accepted as proof that the person has returned to reside in the State on a permanent basis.  This is very much for the case of the Irish person who retires back to Ireland after being gone for a very long time.</p><p> With regard to displaced persons, while the amendments in this subsection primarily update the current provisions to ensure all those categories of persons who were previously recognised in the habitual residence provision as having a right to reside retain that position.  It is also intended that an additional permission to reside in the State is included in the section.  This is for people who have been granted temporary protection in accordance with the International Protection Act 2015.  The Act provides for EU laws for immediate and temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons who are unable to return to their country of origin.  If this is invoked, this measure would provide a balance of efforts between member states in receiving such displaced third country nationals.  The section provides for a displaced person to be given permission by the Minister for Justice and Equality to enter and remain in the State, for temporary protection, as part of this group of persons.  If there was a mass influx, it would allow us to do that.</p></speech>

They have raised serious concerns around the allowance rates for asylum seekers in direct provision.  The Bill does not mention any increase whatever in this area.  An adult is expected to live on &euro;19.10 and a child on &euro;15.60 per week.  There has been an awful lot of talk about fivers being thrown all over the place but there is no talk around the issue of direct provision.  I know that the McMahon report on direct provision in Ireland put forward a series of recommendations and there has been no action at all in this regard.  The UN has also asked that the Government address this.  I know we are dealing with increases and we are dealing with timelines, but I want it on the record that there are serious concerns about this.  Contrary to the mantra that all payments are going up by &euro;5, there is a serious problem with this particular allowance.  I also raised the issue with regard to child benefit in that many of the children in the direct provision system are born within the State and theoretically they are Irish citizens.  We have had the discussion around the timeframe for the payments and I will not go through all that again, but it is a complex issue and I want it on the record.</p></speech>

Deputy Smith's amendment proposes to have an open-ended provision of up to a maximum of 20 years disregarded instead of the current provision which only allows for the years 1994 to date to be disregarded.

We held a referendum on that and people voted overwhelmingly to remove that provision.  I have noted the Deputy's comments on direct provision and he is correct to say there is no increase provided in the Bill for people in receipt of a direct provision payment.  My Department administers the direct provision allowance on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality, so it is not provided for at all in social welfare legislation.  It would be a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality to decide on whether it wants to make an increase in any of those allowances.  My Department provides the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the exceptional needs payments for such items as adult clothing, children's clothing, a pram, buggy or double buggy and various other things for which people can get a grant from the Department.</p></speech>

The substantive issue here is to do with a major glitch in the system of pay and pensions that particularly affects women.  In the perceived attempt to normalise the contributions in the State pension for women, a measure was introduced in 2012 that would take the average contributions over a woman's working life.  I should not just say woman, I should say a person's working life because some men are homemakers, and this is more frequently the case now than in the 1960s and 1970s, but there is a cohort of homemakers who are not being advantaged but are being penalised by the measure brought in during 2012.</p><p>When the average number of contributions is calculated over a person's working life, it means that even if they worked 30, 31 or 32 years from the mid-1980s up to 2015-16 when they retired, they will have got a much reduced State pension benefit.  I met some women this morning, and the cohort of people - there is one man involved - in contact with us on this issue is growing.  If these people started their working lives in the late 1960s or early 1970s, left the workplace to rear their children and be homemakers and then returned to work in the mid-1980s when their families were able to stand on their own two feet, the calculation based on the average contributions figure is pulling their State benefit qualification down to the lowest level.  The State contributory pension payment is &euro;230 per week based on the maximum contributions.  If the women I met this morning had their pension benefit qualification measured on the contributions they made over the large chunk of their working life, which was the period after they had reared their families from the mid-1980s until recently, they would have gained a contributory pension payment &euro;230 a week.  Instead their average contributions were measured over a prolonged period going back to the 1960s or 1970s where, to use the term those women used, they sold their contribution benefits back to the State; they both remember going down to Victoria Street and getting a fiver for the benefits they had paid in.  The whole stretch of benefits is averaged over that period, which means that these people are getting a contributory pension payment of &euro;209 per week instead of &euro;230 per week.  That shortfall amounts to a considerable amount of money in a year for any family.  Many people are affected by this and they have been contacting us.</p></speech>

I want to know the ongoing position of the Department on these matters.  That would help us to conduct our discussions in the full knowledge of all the particular circumstances.  I understand that subsection (5) of my proposed amendment dealing with the one-parent family payment has already been dealt with. Did I understand the Minister to say that he or the Department is carrying out a review or study of the jobseeker's benefit scheme regarding the different rates? </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#GG02400"><p>On the jobseeker's transitional payment, the three-day rule is a disincentive to people to take up employment.  A person can earn X amount over three days and get social welfare benefit for the remainder of the week.  A person who earns exactly the same amount but does so over four or five days is not entitled to any social welfare payment.  That is an anomaly.  It constitutes a disincentive to a person who is working three days a week to take up more hours unless they can take them up within the three days.  It can create a disincentive to take up a job for four days a week because the person will lose their social welfare payment.  There are technical difficulties in moving from that system, which is a relatively simple system, to a hours worked based system.  I am seeking a report on that to see if it would be possible to advance something along those lines.</p> <p>  I am also seeking a report on the matter referred to by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith in her amendment concerning the change in the rules brought in by the previous Minister for Social Protection regarding qualification for  the State contributory pension.  Under the current system, a person who pays 520 contributions can, in some circumstances, be entitled to the full pension while a person who pays double that number of contributions might be entitled to a smaller pension.  Obviously, that is unjust.  That cannot be right.   We have received many complaints on this issue.  People are contacting me on a weekly basis asking what is happening about this.  It is a grave injustice.  People believe that the contribution of their payments have not been properly awarded on the basis that they know people who have paid fewer contributions who are in receipt of a higher pension.  I understood the Minister to say, and he can correct me if I am wrong, that some work is being done on that within the Department.  Is that correct?  I take it we will discuss the family income payment in conjunction with the report on the working family dividend when it comes before this committee.</p> <p>  Subsection (7) of my amendment deals with part-time and seasonal workers.  As my colleague, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, said this morning in the D&aacute;il, this has particular relevance in Donegal and certain coastal counties.  The method of, and regulations for, paying social welfare to seasonal and part-time workers has changed in recent years.  In order to qualify for benefit, a person is now required to have 117 contributions over a three-year period.  That equates to 39 contributions per annum.  It is pretty difficult for people in seasonal and part-time work to make that number of contributions in that space of time.  In addition to that, the subsidiary income threshold is &euro;12.70 per day.  That seems grossly unfair.  That is &euro;63 a week.  If a seasonal worker earns that from farming, he or she is not entitled to unemployment benefit.  People are told that they can depend on an income of &euro;3,302 per annum, which in these times seems somewhat unreal.</p> <p>  There is also a new requirement that when a social welfare claim ceases, a person has to make 13 contributions in order to transfer on to the next claim.  That does not make any allowance for the unique nature of seasonal work.  Some Deputies from coastal counties have told me that they have been dealing with these people for up to 20 years and it is only in the past two or three years that they have had difficulty accessing the social welfare system.  I am also advised that the current regulations are giving rise to skill shortages in seasonal and part-time work in businesses and that they urgently need to be addressed.  If I were to propose an amendment to change the system, it would be ruled out of order on the basis that it would pose a charge on the Exchequer.</p><p>I am trying to put some focus on this problem because it affects a number of people, especially in coastal counties.  On the face of it, it seems to be rather unfair.  The system appears to me to warrant close examination.  This is why I have proposed that we write into the Bill that the Department should carry out a report and then report back to the committee.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#HH00200"><p>The Deputy has raised several different issues.  I will try and go through them sequentially, if I can, with the exception of the lone-parent issue.  That is something we already discussed in detail.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the review of the impact on the national minimum wage to income thresholds.  We figure we can do a report on that quickly.  It is quite straightforward and we could easily have it to the committee in less than three months.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the household benefits package.  Essentially, I think the Deputy is referring to cases where someone moves back to the house.  That person might be a grandson or daughter who has moved back to the house.  The household benefits package is worth approximately &euro;11.50 per week.  If a young person is not working, the household benefits package would not be lost.  If the person has come back and is working, he must be earning &euro;400 per week.  For that person to make a contribution of &euro;11.50 to the cost of running the house is not a great deal to ask.  I would expect a person who moves back to live with his parents to cough up &euro;70, &euro;80, &euro;100 or &euro;200 to help to cover the costs.  I do not see why it would make sense for us to continue to pay the household benefits package to a household that has someone in it who is working and earning.  It would be extraordinarily expensive and I do not think it would be right.  It is entirely reasonable that a younger person who moves back to live with his parents to save for a house or whatever should contribute &euro;12 per week to the running of the house.  In fact, that person should contribute more, in my view.  Certainly, I did when I was living with my parents.  The figure was far more than &euro;11.50.  I see no role for the welfare system in that scenario.</p> <p>  Certainly, we can undertake some work on the eligibility criteria for jobseeker's benefit.  The three-day rule is tricky and it is difficult to find a solution to it.  Like many things, when I first got this job I thought this would be a no-brainer.  However, it gets tricky because if we change the criteria from three days to a certain number of hours, we would then open up jobseeker's to a large number of people who do not currently claim it.  That would represent a significant cost.  The way of avoiding that is to reduce the level to a smaller number of hours.  This would mean many people who now work three days would lose out.  It is like many of these things in that it is often only when we realise why the rules are what they are that we realise why it might not be so wise to change them.  That said, I have no difficulty in giving the committee some figures and numbers as part of a report.</p> <p>  The question of the averaging system in the State contributory pension was raised by Deputy Smith and Deputy O'Dea.  Again, this area is far more complicated than people may think.  The State contributory pension works based on contributions.  People put money into the fund and at the end, when they retire, money comes out of the fund.  The fundamental difficulty in recognising anything that is not a financial contribution to the fund is that it devalues the pensions of those who have made a financial contribution to the fund.  Effectively, it would represent a tax on the financial contribution made by others.  It is done, in part, already with the homemaker's credit, but it is not cost free.  It imposes a cost on the taxpayer and it also devalues the contributions of those who have paid in.  The whole point of the contributory principle and the Social Insurance Fund is that people pay in and then the cash comes out when people retire.  If people start to put in credits and non-financial contributions, it is not going to work because people do not want to be paid their pensions in credits.</p></speech>

Let us suppose a person has worked from 1984 to 2015 and that person made a home and left a job in 1969 or 1970 to rear children.  Finally, let us suppose the person went back to the workforce and worked for 32 or 33 years until 2015.  That person would have paid more than a sufficient number of contributions to get a full pension.  However, the figure is not calculated based on the past 33 or 34 years of full employment.  In the cases of the people I have met, wages were decent and so their contributions would have been decent.  However, when it came to measuring what they were entitled to, the reckoning went right back to 1969 and produced an average figure.  That put these people on a lower grade of pension, at &euro;209 instead of &euro;230 per week.  There are thousands of people in that predicament, and they are mostly women.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#HH00400"><p>I was coming to that.  I was also coming to the issue around most of them being women.  Deputy Smith is referring to a system we call averaging.  Under averaging, it is not the number of contributions a person has made during the course of her working life that counts, but when she has made them.  That is a negative for people who have a gap in employment.  This is often, but not always, for caring and it usually, but not always, involves women.  If a woman works for some years, leaves employment for any reason and goes back to work again, she loses out because the calculation is averaged over a long period, including the gap in the middle.  The people who benefit from that system are those who are here and who perhaps never worked for a long time or who started work for the first time later in life.  Even though these people have paid fewer contributions overall, they get the full pension.  That is unfair.  We can equalise that, but by equalising it, this group is going to lose out.  This means there may be one group of tens of thousands of people who benefit, but we will also have tens of thousands of people who lose.</p> <p>  The way we intend to go - it is in the pensions framework already and we have committed to doing it by 2020 - is to move towards a total contributions approach.  This will get rid of averaging altogether.  This would amount to moving to a point whereby the total number of contributions a person makes is what counts.  However, that figure would have to be set at a higher level of contributions than a person currently has to make for things to work out.  It is not what it may seem, and there will be significant winners and losers.  At the moment we are trying to go through all the pension records and look at all the different types of cases and scenarios that might arise to get some clue of what the total number of winners and losers might be in each scenario.  I hope my officials will come to me at some point with an options paper.  I will share it with the committee members when I have it.  Every time we change the rules, there are winners and losers unless we are willing to drop hundreds of millions of euro to ensure there are no losers.  Before I make any decision or ask the committee to agree to any decision I want to have before me the options and the numbers of winners and losers in each case, as well as the cost.</p> <p>  Deputy Smith is absolutely right to say that when it comes to this particular aspect of State contributory pensions, most of the people who have a gap in their employment are women.  Therefore, when we meet these groups, they are mostly female.  That is true.  However, committee members should bear some points in mind when considering the Social Insurance Fund overall.  Women gain more from it.  They live longer and get paid their pensions for longer.  They gain far more from the maternity benefit system, for example, than men do from the paternity benefit system, and they pay less in for fewer years.  This is not my opinion.  An actuarial review was undertaken of the fund and it showed that women benefit more from the social insurance system than men.  Therefore, if we are going to go down a gender equalisation route, it would require a shift in benefits from women to men.</p></speech>

The amendment asks precisely that question.  The idea is that the average would apply to everyone, not only homemakers after 1994.  I do not understand why previous Governments brought this measure in after 1994.  It seems there is a disregard for the average after 1994 but not for the years beforehand.  Women my age and older women who are coming up to retirement are going to be penalised heavily for something that is utterly wrong.  I am not suggesting that we should take it from Paul to pay Peter.  I am saying active discrimination is taking place here and that is clear.</p></speech>

Subsection (3) of the amendment deals with the jobseeker's allowance and the three-day rule.  That rule is causing enormous difficulties as the Minister will be aware.  It is very problematic in the context of zero-hour and low-hour contracts in the workplace.  There have been some very high-profile examples of this in recent times, including at Dunnes Stores.  The staff of that company went to court over the issue.  Many employees were working very low numbers of hours over the course of a week and because they were only working a three-day week, they were not entitled to jobseeker's payments.  I support this amendment and ask the Minister to ensure that a comprehensive report on the issue be provided.  This is a matter to which we must return in the future.  The way to deal with it is to enact legislation on zero-hour contracts but, unfortunately, the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill on the matter that was put before the House was opposed by a number of the parties.  That Bill would have gone a long way towards addressing the issue.  That said, I support the amendment and ask that a report is provided on qualifying criteria.</p></speech>

On the pensions issue, I want and intend to make a change in this area to bring in a system that is fair.  However, I am not entirely sure that the solution is only about recognising gaps where somebody was a home-maker.  There may be other legitimate reasons for people having gaps in their contributions records.  For example, they may have been profoundly ill for a period and not in a position to make contributions.  I have often heard it argued by family carers that the time they spend as carers should be recognised too.  There are seven or eight different issues involved here.</p></speech>

It deals with cases of unfair dismissal and proposes that the employer, if found to have unfairly dismissed an employee, would pay back any social welfare payments issued to the employee from the date of his or her unfair dismissal.  This would realise a saving for the State.  The amendment is reasonable and I urge the Minister to accept it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#JJ02300"><p>The unfair dismissals legislation provides that any social welfare payments which the employee may have received after the date of dismissal are not taken into account in calculating the financial loss that the person suffered as a result of the dismissal.  This ensures that the person is not penalised for having been in receipt of a social welfare payment following his or her dismissal.  Recouping the cost of welfare benefits arising from unfair dismissals would require a change in this position on the principle of no double compensation.  That is, a person cannot be compensated twice, both by his or her employer and by the Department of Social Protection.  This could reduce or even eliminate the award for the person who was unfairly dismissed where he or she is also in receipt of a social welfare payment because that payment would have to be taken into account in calculating the financial loss to the individual.</p> <p>  The reference to social welfare payments is a catch-all term which could include benefits directly linked to unemployment and those relating to other contingencies such as illness, lone parenthood, old age or caring responsibilities.  The linking of a broad range of welfare contingencies to unfair dismissals would be difficult to justify.</p> <p>  The time period envisaged in the amendment, that is, between the date of dismissal and the date on which the finding is made, is potentially open-ended and disproportionate.  What is proposed would also give rise to significant additional costs to employers and businesses.  For example, one year of jobseeker's benefit for a person with an adult dependent and two children would be &euro;20,000.  In turn, these losses could result in other losses of employment at the business.</p> <p>  There are several other reasons why I cannot accept the amendment which I will not go into now.  To be straight with the Deputy, when I first looked at this amendment, I thought it seemed like a good idea.  Why should the Department not recoup the money if an employer has dismissed an employee unfairly?  Indeed, that money should not have had to be paid out because the employee should not have been dismissed in the first instance.  However, what made me change my mind is the principle of double compensation, namely, that somebody cannot be compensated twice.  Essentially, what would happen is that any money paid to the employee from the Department of Social Protection would have to be deduced from his or her compensation award from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The WRC would then have to pay the difference to the Department.  Therefore, the individual employee would be no better off and the State would be no better off because we would just be making a circular payment.</p></speech>

I do not know when that was changed.  If a person who was unfairly dismissed received social welfare payments while awaiting a hearing and that must be taken into account in the context of the level of compensation to be awarded, then he or she is being unfairly treated twice.</p><p>In many cases while they are waiting for the hearing, which could be for two or three years, they must stay on social welfare benefits because it can be difficult to get another job if there is a question mark over why they were sacked from their previous job.  However, when it is proved an employer breached legislation and unfairly dismissed a person, because an employer must breach legislation to be guilty of unfair dismissal, it is the person who was unfairly dismissed who bears the brunt rather than the employer who committed the breach of legislation in the first place.  I do not get it.  It is unfair.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is a double whammy for a person who has been treated appallingly by an employer found guilty of unfairly dismissing the person.  Such people are penalised a second time.  The Minister is speaking about a severe financial responsibility on the employer, perhaps up to &euro;20,000, and so be it.  The employer will have been found to have acted illegally in unfairly dismissing an individual.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is right.  It is very difficult for people who have been unfairly dismissed, or have that cloud hanging over their heads, to find alternative employment.  It can go on for a lengthy period of time.  I do not take on board what the Minister is saying.</p></speech>

In an unfair dismissal case, the employer must be made to pay the State and then pay the person who has been unfairly dismissed, but surely the person who was unfairly dismissed and left in limbo for a period of time should not bear the brunt of any unintended consequences.  I support the amendment, but if the Minister is stating he cannot do it this way something should be included whereby if an employer is deemed to have unfairly dismissed somebody he or she must pay back the State the social welfare payments and then pay the individual the award due.</p></speech>

If we were to change this, presumably the person would have to get a lower award from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and we would have to go after the employer for the difference.  We would then probably be challenged.  Employers would certainly challenge this and they would state the person may well have been unfairly dismissed but this is not to state the person could not have taken up other employment.  I accept it makes it more difficult to take up other employment if someone is unfairly dismissed, but it is certainly not an impossibility.  If challenged, how would we prove the person could not get another job because he or she had been unfairly dismissed and not because of another reason?</p></speech>

It is perfectly legitimate for the amendment to state the money should be taken from the employer who breached the legislation, because he or she has been found guilty in an unfair dismissals tribunal, or the WRC as it is now.  This is all the amendment states.  It is quite sensible.</p></speech>

One is double compensation.  If somebody were to get an award of &euro;100,000, that person could only receive &euro;80,000.  The person cannot be compensated twice by receiving &euro;20,000 in welfare and &euro;100,000 from the WRC.  The person would have to receive a lower reward, as I understand it.  We would also have to go after the employer and we may have difficulty recouping the money on the basis that employers will challenge it.

There seems to be much consensus that an effort should be made to recoup the funds from the employer.  The unintended consequence might be a loss to the person unfairly dismissed, and I do not think anybody wants that.  Would it be possible for the Minister to review this with a view to having a look at it on Report and Final Stages?  I do not think anybody wants the unintended consequence of somebody being worse off.  I am listening to the debate and everybody, the Minister included, agrees if the money could be got from the employer for unfair dismissal it is one element, but there is consideration of the other side, which is the unintended consequence, and I am mindful of this.</p></speech>

Where is the double compensation?  As far as I can see, what is being proposed is that if people are unfairly dismissed they go to the tribunal and get appropriate compensation, but while they are waiting to get that compensation they will not have a job and they will get paid social welfare.  The amendment requires the employers who unfairly dismissed them to repay the social welfare payments to the Department and the taxpayers of the country, who paid out the money because the employers acted unfairly in the first place.  I do not understand the double compensation.  At present, social welfare is not taken into account in calculating an award and why would the Minister want to change this?</p></speech>

I am not sure we can do it by Report Stage.  It might need to be something we consider for the second social welfare Bill we will have in the spring.  One issue, for example, is that very often these cases can take a long time to conclude.  They can take two years to conclude on some occasions and some even go on to court.  The employer could justifiably argue the reason the delay went on so long in making a decision was not the employer's fault.  We cannot reclaim money from people who could reasonably argue a decision made after two years could have been sorted and made in six weeks or six months, and ask why they are paying 18 months' compensation for an administrative delay by State bodies.  Another issue is that some of the awards are very small.  They can be as little as four weeks' salary.  How could we reclaim tens of thousands of euro in social welfare payments based on an award that was very small?</p> <p>  I do not think it is a crazy idea, I just think we need to think about it properly.</p></speech>

It will not be done by next week, but by the spring Bill.  We can recoup money.  We recouped &euro;20 million from insurance companies last year.  If we can recoup money from employers legitimately, I am totally up for doing it.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 34 and 35, although they have largely been discussed already, are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#LL00400"><p>I move amendment No. 34:</p><blockquote>In page 12, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;23. </b>Three months from the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the D&aacute;il on the matter of extending the Homemaker Scheme contribution years that can be disregarded for the purposes of determining the yearly average of claimants who raised families in the years prior to April 1994.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>I want to add to everything that was said earlier.  This is a grey area because it affects those like me who have lots of grey hair, not to put too fine a pun on it.  It should be re-examined.  As the Minister said himself, we may need to look at mechanisms to balance this out.  I emphasise that at no point do I or any other Deputy intend, by putting down amendments, to come out with a scheme that penalises one group of workers over another or that the load of this should be passed to another group of pension recipients.  In other words, extra money will have to be forked out but that is not extra money the State had not received in contributions from these people.  This is provably a cohort of people who went back to work in the mid-1980s, worked until now and paid a lot of pension contributions but who are now being penalised because of the time they left.  It is worth reminding ourselves that a lot of people in their 60s and 70s left school quite young and started working at age 14 or 15.  It would be unusual to do that nowadays but in those days it was normal to go into a factory or shop work having left school early due to the absence of free secondary education.  There were a lot of social and economic reasons for it but they are being severely penalised and that is wrong.  If it does not get sorted out at departmental level, it will go elsewhere and probably end up being more of a rigmarole and expense to the State.  As the amendment will not be accepted, I ask that a report be laid out very soon.</p></speech>

I support Deputy Smith's position.  This was raised before with the last Minister and at the time we were told it would be too costly to bring in the homemaker's scheme.  There is a huge cohort of women in particular who are affected by this and it must be dealt with.  I would appreciate the Minister bringing the report to us so that we can have a detailed examination of the whole process.  To be a woman in the pre-1994 scenario and told one is not going to get a full pension is not on.</p></speech>

That will involve the Minister and the Department.  The work will be done as a committee and the Minister and the officials have committed to supporting and working with us.  We acknowledge the issue as the Deputy presents it, in particular as the percentage of women who qualify for the full rate contributory pension is significantly lower.  We understand the issue.</p></speech>

I want to look at all the anomalies, not just the homemaker's scheme and the whole issue of averaging.  My key official in charge of this area says we will have the work done and a report prepared in the first quarter.  I cannot swear to that but it is intended that we will have the report in the first quarter.  It is part of the committee's work programme already and I would like to come here in the first or second quarter of next year with that report and all of the issues, options, costs, numbers, winners, losers and consequences laid out.  We can then come to a decision as to whether we do something about it in the 2018 budget.  Let us be honest, however, that this relates to the Social Insurance Fund and that PRSI contributions come in and payments go out.  If we are going to do something that costs hundreds of millions of euro, it will impact either on those who already get benefits from the Social Insurance Fund already or those who pay PRSI and are ordinary workers and employers.  Let us not pretend that a problem which could be very expensive to resolve will be paid for by some faceless bondholder somewhere.  It will be paid for by those who contribute PRSI.  We need to know how much it is going to be and how much it is going to cost and whether we want to impose that on people.</p></speech>

The scheme was introduced in the context of the recession, particularly for people who may fall very ill for short periods, and it was taken away.  This has had an impact on people who are being put into difficult situations and has prompted concern among FLAC and Community Law and Mediation, which are seeking the restoration of the scheme for short-term mortgage arrears problems.  Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, also raised the issue with us at a committee meeting.  SPARK also raised its particular concern about the risk of homelessness caused by the cessation of the mortgage interest supplement scheme for one-parent families.  If a lone parent is absent from work for a long period due to illness and cannot access other mortgage relief, mortgage interest supplement plays a very important role.  Obviously, the supplement does not apply to the capital.  These are the reasons I tabled the amendment and sought that report from the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#MM00400"><p>The original purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was to provide short-term support to eligible people who were unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which was their sole place of residence.  The most appropriate pathway for customers experiencing mortgage difficulties is through ongoing engagement with their lender, exploring sustainable solutions detailed within the mortgage arrears resolution process under the Central Bank of Ireland's code of mortgage arrears.  Section 11 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 amended section 198 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to provide for the closure of the mortgage interest supplement scheme to new entrants from January 2014 and the cessation of the scheme by the end of January 2017.  Customers availing of this support prior to 1 January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1 January 2018.  Approximately 2,200 people are still in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, with an estimated expenditure of &euro;6 million for the scheme in 2016.  It is expected that over the remaining period, existing recipients will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, such as the mortgage-to-rent scheme.</p> <p>  A review of all current mortgage interest rate supplement cases is currently being finalised by the Department, which is gathering information on property types and lending institutions involved.  As part of the process, the cases will be profiled in order to consider appropriate exit strategies for these customers, with a particular emphasis on activation, where appropriate.  Engagement with the dedicated mortgage arrears Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, will also be considered.  MABS assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes and people living on social welfare payments.  In addition to its traditional core business, MABS has been developed to provide more targeted services to support mortgage holders in arrears.  Since 2015, a dedicated mortgage arrears MABS service has been established across the MABS network of services.  The service is focusing on post-mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, cases and empowers mortgage holders to assess the extent to which the option on offer from the lender is the best and most sustainable one for them and helps them in negotiating an alternative payment arrangement with their lender.  There are 30 specialist advisers in place in 25 locations across the country, and almost 2,500 people have benefitted from the service.  MABS also has a network of court mentors.  More recently, with the T&aacute;naiste, I launched Abhaile, which is a scheme of aids and advice to borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  It provides people with vouchers for independent financial and legal advice if they need it.  The scheme has only recently got under way.</p> <p>  The difficulty I have with any proposal to reintroduce mortgage interest supplement is that it never really worked.  The Department of Social Protection, that is, the taxpayer, paid people's mortgage interest for months and years, which suited the banks down to the ground because they were getting the interest paid on the asset.  It would suit them even more now, by the way, because the asset, namely, property, is accumulating in value.  The Government pays the interest forever, the banks still own the asset and it creates a trap for the borrower because he or she has no incentive to deal with the problem, namely, the fact that he or she cannot afford the mortgage any more.  Other than for the reason of saving money, that is why the scheme was closed down.  What we should do, instead of "extend and pretend" at the expense of the taxpayer for ever, is deal with people who will never be able to pay their mortgage again through such measures as mortgage-to-rent, which I know is not working, but it needs to start working, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and other housing solutions.</p></speech>

However, I knew people who were absent from work due to sickness or injury - maybe they had broken an ankle or whatever - for six, nine or ten months and who availed of the mortgage interest supplement scheme to get them over that hump.  When they got back to work, they were able to go back to paying the full amount of the mortgage interest.  In some cases it went on for a very long period - say, since 2000.  Even in the case of lone parents on short-term sick leave, if they break an ankle or are temporarily out of work for six or ten months after an operation, are they expected to go into the mortgage process at that stage?  They do not normally do so, apart from in the first quarter, if they have problems, they go into the bank or approach MABS or something and may then have to fill out a form with the bank and so on.  However, I am speaking of a form of mortgage interest supplement for a short period to cover people who would only be out sick from work and could not afford mortgage payments over that period.  Mortgage interest supplement helped get over the interest payments.</p></speech>

I know there is currently an awareness campaign about it.  I reiterate that the level of advice and experience available to people in short-term or long-term mortgage distress includes free legal aid and personal insolvency practitioners.  The biggest problem is people not engaging with their lender for various reasons.  They may be scared or embarrassed - there are numerous reasons - but the Abhaile scheme that has been put in place is a very positive one.  The Minister alluded to the number of people facilitated and helped by the scheme throughout the country.  It replaces the supports about which Deputy Collins spoke in a more sustainable and productive manner.  For that reason, the Abhaile scheme is the better way to go.</p></speech>

One has a mortgage for 20 or 30 years, maybe 40 years.  Say one cannot make repayments for six months or a year for whatever reason, whether because one is sick, loses one's job or has gone back to college or overseas for a year or two.  Other taxpayers should not have to pick up the bill.  Why not add six months to the end of the mortgage?  The first port of call should be the bank to either increase the repayments when the borrower is back repaying or add an extra year at the end.  I do not see why the taxpayer should have to pick up the bill for a borrower's temporary inability to pay a mortgage for a short period.</p></speech>

It would have seen all of these benefits and measures come into effect on 1 January.  I do not wish to repeat the points I have made about our hands being tied, but, unfortunately, the Minister not giving any timeframe for implementation of these benefits and measures.  It comes back to a point that came up earlier that there has been no engagement by the Minister with either dentists or opticians on the rolling-out of these measures.  That raises serious concerns.  I alluded to some of these points earlier.  The Minister spoke about the rolling out of free GP care services for children under the age of six years, but we know about the serious difficulties and the backlash from doctors in the roll-out of that scheme, with which there are still issues.  I am not sure whether it was Deputy Leo Varadkar as Minister for Health or his predecessor as Minister for Social Protection who rolled it out, but the same <i>modus operandi</i>is being used in this instance in that the Government is looking to put the legislation in place before beginning negotiations.  It failed with the doctors from whom there was a serious backlash.  We are now being told that we are going down the same track with the dentists and opticians.  That is why the Minister has drafted the amendment so as to put it on the long finger and start the negotiations after the introduction of the legislation.  This is a dangerous practice and it failed previously.  I have alluded to my concerns.  This certainly makes it clear why the Minister is bringing forward the amendment, as opposed to giving us a timeframe and a specific date for when the benefits will be rolled out.  It is alarming and concerning, to say the least.  Will the Minister expand on the matter?  Are these the reasons, or have I called it wrong?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-17a.2575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002#NN00500"><p>To answer Deputy John Brady's first question, it was me who provided for the introduction of free GP care for children under six and adults over 70.  Alongside my Minister of State at the time, former Deputy Kathleen Lynch, I was very proud to be able to provide GP care without fees for 350,000 children under six years and adults over 70.  I anticipate that the Government will go further and extend free GP care to other age groups.  However, it was not without difficulty and resistance from my own profession, although none of them it seems wants to roll it back at this stage.  In terms of dates, the extension of benefits to the self-employed will begin in March, while the extension of other dental benefits for everyone else will take place from October.  That is what we have been funded to do and it is included in the Estimates.</p> <p>  The reason I want to do it by commencement order is I want to have talks and negotiations with the relevant bodies.  There have been meetings with officials and an exchange of correspondence.  However, as Deputy Maria Bailey pointed out, there is no way I can conclude them until the Bill is passed.  That will give me the legislative authority to come to an agreement.  Until the Estimates are passed, I will not have the money to pay for it.  Neither of these things has happened.  That is what it all boils down to.  March is not that far away and it is an ambitious enough timeline, assuming the Bill is passed by Christmas and not delayed in the Seanad.  If it is, there is no way it can be done by March because that House can delay legislation for 90 days.  That is why a commencement order is needed, not a date that it might not be possible to meet.</p></speech>

Even when the lone parent's allowance was cut, that did not happen.  I know that Seanad Members are now a different mix, but I do not think they would delay the Bill.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that I intend to begin the extension of benefits to the self-employed in March and to others in October.  I am meeting representatives of the dentists on Monday.  I believe I can get this done, but I am not going to insert something into legislation that might go awry.  That is the reality in dealing with legislation.</p></speech>

On the extension of benefits to the self-employed, he is not tying himself to a date, rather he is saying it will be done by way of a commencement order.  Why not commit to a date?  I know that he is saying he wants it to take effect in March, but that is not contained in the legislation.  Why not give a specific date for the commencement of the measures included in the Bill?</p></speech>

Is the Department concerned about some measure or the possibility that something could go wrong?</p></speech>

Of course, there will be.  Anytime one discusses anything with any professional body or interest group, it is going to try to maximise the fees its members receive from the taxpayer.  Having a definite commencement date in law would strengthen its hand.  It would be able to state there was a date laid down in law by which it would have to be done.  The fact that I will have a commencement order means that I will be able to say to it that I am being funded to introduce the measure in March and that if it is unreasonable, I can wait until it comes up with a fee that will be more affordable to the taxpayer.</p></speech>
