I call the meeting into public session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have a quorum, the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session.  Can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  We begin today's session, and series of sessions and public hearings, with Mr. Tony Grimes, former director general of the Central Bank of Ireland.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 29th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with witnesses from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. Tony Grimes, former director general at the Central Bank.  Mr. Tony Grimes held senior management positions in the Central Bank in the area of economics, international relations, markets and payments.  He was appointed assistant director general in 2004 and oversaw the financial markets and payments of securities, settlements divisions.  In August 2007, he was appointed to the role of director general at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, a position he held until his retirement in 2011.  During his time as director general, he was also appointed acting Governor from 19 July 2008 until 19 September 2008, in the absence of Governor Hurley due to illness.  Mr. Grimes, you are very welcome before the committee this morning.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness today, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, so that individual institutions will not be identified.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  </p>  <p>               For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p> <p> The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.</p> <p> So, with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Grimes this morning.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?</p></speech>

So, just to inform as well that the opening statement will be published on the committee website also today.  So, with that said, if I can begin with the first questioner this morning and invite Deputy Joe Higgins.  Deputy, you've 25 minutes.</p></speech>

Thanks, Mr. Grimes.  Mr. Grimes, can I ask you, in, say, the second half of 2007 and then into 2008, up to and including September 2008, were there concerns at senior levels of the Central Bank that one or more Irish financial institutions might be insolvent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Grimes" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#C00700"><p>Deputy, yes.  At that time there were concerns.  Obviously, we read the papers; we were in receipt of reports from various sources; there was interaction with the markets; obviously we looked at share prices and so on, so it's absolutely true to say that we had concerns.  Now, it's not the same thing as saying the concerns extended into us having a clear view of the insolvency of particular institutions but certainly I would say, from the spring onwards, you know, of 2008, there were concerns, but they were just concerns at that stage, as I said.</p></speech>

So, Vol. 2, page 3 of the core documents and we have an e-mail here in which you are included, Mr. Grimes.  This should come up shortly-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#C01200"><p>In your booklet then, Vol. 2, page 3, you see ... you see an e-mail there towards the end of 2007 in which you are included and the subject is a list of issues for the domestic standing group, again a meeting that's to be held very shortly, and if I just quote from the e-mail, it says, &quot;Please find attached a list of issues that need further examination / clarification in order to facilitate actions the Dept or the [Central Bank] may need to take should a financial institution in Ireland find itself in difficulties, or systemic problems arise in the financial system&quot;, and this list has been prepared for a discussion at the domestic standing group.</p><p>So then, if we just turn the page to page 4, Mr. Grimes and, under &quot;Ministerial and CBFSAI powers&quot;, which is the Central Bank and regulatory authority powers, and down one, two, three, the fourth bullet point: </p><blockquote>The legal position regarding a number of potential policy options for the State to provide support to financial institutions in difficulty requires further examination.  These include:<br /><br />- the legal scope for a &quot;letter of comfort&quot; to be given to the Central Bank in an emergency situation confirming the Minister's intention to approach D&aacute;il Eireann for legislative authority to enable the issuance of a financial guarantee to the Central Bank.</blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>               And if you turn to page, just once more Mr. Grimes, to page 7.  We have, "Three scenarios for institutions having difficulties: 1) illiquid but solvent; 2) nearing insolvency; and 3) insolvent."  You're following me there, yes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Grimes" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#D00200"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#D00300"><p>And then to quote that paragraph 3:</p><blockquote>Once an institution is insolvent the Central Bank cannot provide ELA [emergency liquidity assistance] to the institution.  In order for the institution to be assisted the CB [Central Bank] would required (sic) some form of guarantee from the Government eg a letter of comfort.  This would allow the CB [Central Bank] to treat the institution as illiquid, but solvent.</blockquote>  <p>So, can I ask you to maybe comment on that?  What's this all about?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Grimes" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#D00400"><p>Yes, if we go back to the date of this, it is October 2007.  I suppose it was the very start of the contingency planning that was taking place both within the bank and as part of SG.  And ... I think this would have been one of the first documents to have been used in the committee.  And what it's actually trying to do is set out the options.  At that stage, it was no more than setting out the options.  But just the context of course is, it was following on the Northern Rock episode which occurred in September 2007.  So, authorities everywhere were on I think higher alert I think following that incident.  So, this is the contingency planning episode that followed that.  So, it's setting out the options which were there.  I think it shows that contingency planning by the authorities begun as early as, you know, autumn of 2007.</p></speech>

I'll put it to you Mr. Grimes, that any observer would see a situation being set up here by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance for a clear situation where a bank or a financial institution might be declared insolvent.  Could you comment then on the emphasis that is given and I'll just give one more quote Chair ... going forward Vol. 1, page 101 and scoping paper from the Department.  I just quote the Central Bank role in-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#D00800"><p>What page, Deputy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#D00900"><p>Vol. 1, page 101.  I'll just quote as clearly as I can:</p><blockquote>It is very important to note that the CBFSAI [the Central Bank] is prohibited from providing ELA [emergency liquidity assistance] to an insolvent institution.  Therefore if there is any concern that a financial institution seeking ELA as insolvent, the CBFSAI [Central Bank] would not be in a position to provide liquidity support without the question of some guarantee arising from the Exchequer.</blockquote>  <p>A theme that keeps coming up, Mr. Grimes, is emergency liquidity for an institution that might be insolvent but legally could not be funded by the Central Bank unless there was a Government guarantee.  Why does this theme keep recurring?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Grimes" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#D01000"><p>Well, it's absolutely clear that if the institution is insolvent the Central Bank could not lend without a formal guarantee of the Government.  Now ... and yes ... that's absolutely clear.  In the situation in which the authorities think that the institution is solvent but illiquid, it has been the practice also to require a guarantee of the Government, even if the institution is not formerly insolvent.  But ... and that's the way it has been in practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#E00200"><p>Yes, I mean, that's clear ... that funding can be given to an institution that has liquidity problems but it's absolutely prohibited that funding would be given to an institution that's deemed to be insolvent.</p></speech>

But the question I put to you is: why does this theme keep emerging?  Is ... would you ... is there a preparation here for a suspected insolvency that might be looming or might be seen to be in the pipeline?</p></speech>

I mean, when we're talking about the time period here, which is the autumn of 2007, it is purely contingency planning.  Even in the marketplace, I think, there were not many doubts about solvency of any institution at that time.  So I'll get back to what I say.  We certainly, in my experience, had no particular institution in mind at that stage.  It was contingency planning, as was being done elsewhere in Europe and globally, I guess, at the same time.</p></speech>

My recollection is that it was a stock-taking meeting.  I mean, it was clear, even in the days before the guarantee, that we were facing, you know, important issues, and very serious issues as regards the liquidity of the banking system.  It was one of a series of meetings at the end of the previous week.  I think the date of the meeting in question is the 26th, which, I think, is the Thursday or Friday of the weekend before the guarantee.  It was one, you know, of a series to discuss options, to hear the latest information that we all had on the state of the banking system and on the state of individual banks.  So, that was the purpose of the meeting.</p></speech>

Would that be true?</p></speech>

I don't think it was at the core of the meeting; I think the real purpose of the meeting was contingency planning for what we felt might be coming down the road in the following few days.  So, it wasn't a meeting called to discuss solvency of particular institutions, but, as you see from the minutes, there is a reference there to a possible solvency situation-----</p></speech>

Now, it may not have been the same meeting precisely at which the Taoiseach, you know, attended because the meetings at that time over that particular weekend tended to merge, and it was very hard to know which was which, but ... over the same day, if my memory is right, the extent of Merrill Lynch report, which was commissioned by the Department, was discussed in some detail.  And I think the date of that was around that period as well.  I might be wrong about the particular date but just to reiterate, I have a strong memory that the purpose of the meeting that the minute refers to was not just about the possible solvency situation of one or two institutions.</p></speech>

In fact, the entire minute that we have, which was written by a very high level official, is entirely on the question of insolvency.  Can I quote Chair from this minute?</p></speech>

Then you see paragraph 4, Mr. Grimes, there was a discussion of various forms of State intervention.  Then the regulator said, there is no evidence to suggest that a particular institution which is named is insolvent on the going concern basis, it is simply unable to continue on the current basis from a liquidity point of view.  He felt another institution was in a similar situation.  Now a very high level official in the Department then, noted that Government would need a good idea of the potential loss exposure within, and those two financial institutions are named.  On some assumptions one of them could be &euro;2 billion after capital, and the other one could be &euro;8.5 billion after capital.  What's the meaning of that minute?  Does it mean, to put it clearly from an interpretation that I drew  which I just put out to you, that after its capital and resources were used up, the first institution would be &euro;2 billion ... insolvent to the tune of &euro;2 billion, and the second insolvent to the tune of &euro;8.5 billion?</p></speech>

On the particular reference, I don't recall the interpretation you're putting on that, Deputy ... that the figures refer to the possible insolvency of those two institutions.  There is some doubt about the reference to capital there, and whether the possible losses are before or after capital; and certainly my recollection, you know, from having attended the meeting, was that virtually nobody who was present at the meeting concluded after the meeting that ... that the two institutions which are referred to here, were, or were likely to be, insolvent at that time.</p></speech>

Mr. Grimes, why did the very high-level official in the Department of Finance specifically refer to the Government needing a good idea of the potential loss exposures within these two institutions and then, what seems to me goes on to put a scenario, which was being mooted, that both of them were seriously insolvent?</p></speech>

If you read the following paragraph, it actually refers to the various options in terms of resolution of the crisis that were also being discussed at the meeting, which was in fact the real purpose of the meeting.

Now, can I put to you as well, because my time is running short, that we had evidence from senior bankers - from Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland - that the Government on the night of the guarantee, night-early morning, proposed to put out a statement which ... which referred to the solvency of all the banks and the bankers advised against that particular statement and it was taken out.

It was clear, to me at least, that as we entered the meetings on the 29th, we were not talking about anything like certainty about the solvency ... about the insolvency of two institutions.  The working assumption was they were under stress but solvent.</p></speech>

We'll come to Deputy Higgins later on in the wrap-up again.  And I just want to bring up a document.  It's a memorandum from Merrill Lynch, it's Sunday 28 September, it's from Vol. 1, 12 May, it's TG ... it's TGR that that is ... but it'll come on your screen now in a moment, Mr Grimes.  This is ... the overall situation here, as we understand from the 28th, is that the one party that was to have the fullest picture of each financial institution in the marketplace was the CBFSAI ... was your agency.  And, if you ... what I'm asking you here to do is to comment from the Central Bank's collation and analysis and scrutiny of Irish financial institutions' advices on the liquidity and solvency of Irish financial institutions prior to the issue of the guarantee.  Now, this document is the Sunday before the guarantee ... and it's the Merrill Lynch briefing document, and if you look at paragraph four, the very last sentence actually in it says "The liquidity issues facing Irish banks are compounded by investor concerns with regard to the high concentration of commercial property risk in their [prospective] portfolios."  Now, this would show that there are major liquidity concerns developing there ... that the ... Merrill Lynch are saying that there are very big problems coming down the line.  Would you care to comment upon what ... what was the Central Bank's reading and your own interpretation of that Merrill Lynch memorandum?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Grimes" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#H00900"><p>I think it was clear that it echoed a lot of the concerns and the knowledge that we had about the liquidity situation of the system, as a whole, and individual banks in that period.  I mean, we had been tracking very carefully - I suppose for more than one year - the liquidity developments, you know, which affected every single bank.  The Central Bank effectively organises the provision of liquidity to the individual banks on behalf of the euro system.  So we were ... we could track very well the deterioration in the liquidity situation of each bank over those months.  This was no surprise.  </p>  <p>               But what has been said in the Merrill Lynch document here, Mr. Grimes, is that it's not just a liquidity issue, but there are particular concerns with regard to the concentration of commercial property, so it's the type of loan exposure, the concentration risks.  So it's not just liquidity, that there's a whole load of other stuff here as well with regard to the type of lending model that was actually in place.</p> <p>  So, was the exposure to the property market actually on your radar at that time along with the liquidity issue?</p></speech>

I mean the markets had been talking for, you know, nine months about the exposure to property, you know, of the major banks here.  It, you know, had been subject to various reports in the market; indeed, it had been highlighted in financial stability reports for many years that there was, you know, a major exposure here, so it was no surprise.  If you look at the movement of the share prices of the Irish banks over the previous six months or so, it was clear that market commentary tended to focus a lot on the banks' exposure to property.  So this was saying no more than what, you know, everybody knew.</p></speech>

So do you believe that a financial stability report took sufficient note of the concerns of the supervision during the period, we'll say, in which, which is the critical period in '08?  So you were, you were Director General of the Central Bank, but you were a member of the regularity board, which, obviously, was over supervision.  So do you feel that, I suppose, in particular, that the financial, we'll say, stability report, particularly for '07 and '08, took account of the level of supervision and the concerns of the supervisory authority?</p></speech>

It was published in the middle of November 2007, so I was involved in that to some extent.   I think I set out in the written statement that we acknowledge now, of course, that that FSR did not fully anticipate the sort of crisis that occurred in the autumn of 2008.</p></speech>

And, Chairman, I'd like to quote from Vol. 1, page 97, which is the Governor of the Central Bank at the time, John Hurley's, foreword to the financial stability report, and I quote, and he's speaking about, he says:</p><blockquote>However, the Irish banks have negligible exposure [it's the third paragraph down] to the sub-prime sector, and they maintain relatively healthy by the standard measures of capital profitability and [the] asset quality.  This has been confirmed by the stress testing exercises we have carried with the banks.</blockquote>  <p>So the two questions, I suppose, I want to ask there is that were those stress tests ... do you believe that they reflected the concerns, we'll say, that were being expressed at the regularity board level of which you were a member of at the time?  Did it come up for discussion in terms of the stress test of the banks with the Financial Regulator at the time and that board, that they'd concerns about the loan portfolios of the banks, stress tests, liquidity, profitability?</p></speech>

I think, though, I need to talk about the timing here.  I was appointed to the board of the Financial Regulator authority on 1 May.  The first meeting I attended was at the very end of May 2008.  The last FSR to be published was done in November 2007.  </p>  <p>         So, it wouldn't have been that current, of course, at the time I was appointed to the regulatory board.  But I mean the issues that were identified in the FSR were the usual ones that, you know ... high rates of increase in credit, indebtedness and so on.</p></speech>

But it would have been implicit, to some extent in some of the messages, you know, contained in the reports.

I mean we, in the Central Bank had sight of what was happening.  We had sight of the tensions in the liquidity markets, which occurred right up from the beginning in Northern Rock and more especially about the ... around the year-end 2007, they abated somewhat at the beginning of 2008 and ... but were still there and they were apparent from the increase in the, in the volume of funding that the domestic banks were taking from the ECB.</p></speech>

And I suppose, the things I want to discuss on are the type of representations, views or advices that were provided by the Central Bank to the Government or the other advisers regarding the bank guarantee and the extent of the discussions with Government.  And you might also discuss your interaction with officials of the ECB, including the ... Jean-Claude Trichet on the options being discussed.

I can really only talk in general terms about this.  But there would have been concern in Frankfurt, I think, about what was ... what was happening in the global markets.  But at the same time, there was a view in Frankfurt I think that ... or should I say, you know, there was no view in Frankfurt that we were heading into the spiral that we all headed into in September.  But there was increasing concern as we moved from August into September, about what was, what was happening.  </p>  <p>         In September, in particular, and starting in September but moving on from there, there were a lot of issues in the markets-----</p></speech>

Finish up on one point.  The big issue around the night of the guarantee is clear around the issue of solvency versus liquidity.

One of them would have been the assurances from the regulator that there was not a solvency issue, but I think that we would probably also have taken, somewhat into account, some of the issues in the marketplace that were out there, and ... but, formally speaking, we had no indications that any of the banks were insolvent.  They were meeting all of their regulatory requirements and so on.  If you took a forward looking view I ... I contend that it still wasn't obvious that there was a serious insolvency issue at that time, because to think that a bank is actually insolvent, you really have to understand the loan book.  If we're ... if we're operating on the commercial property side you have to, you know, evaluate the collateral, you have to evaluate the loan-to-value ratios, you have to evaluate whether the size of any capital losses are likely to eat through what would be the buffers of capital in place, and it's important to bear in mind, I think, that many of the ... of the catastrophic falls in the ... in the value, particularly of commercial property at the time, occurred subsequent to the introduction of ... of the guarantee.  I mean, the fall in ... in the commercial property market, if my figures are right, were what was about 3% in quarter 1 of 2008, but the rate of ... of decline increased to about 15% in quarter 3, 2008, and about 19% in quarter 4, 2008.  So, I think a lot of the destruction in value occurred subsequent to the introduction of the guarantee, and reflected, I think, in many respects, the meltdown, okay, in the financial markets as a whole.  But they're also the read across to conditions in our local markets and in the economy here.</p></speech>

But you have to recall it would have been in general terms, you would not expect very specific reactions from individual banks there in light of the fact that their competitors were sitting around the table in the same room.  So their reactions tended also to be in general terms.</p></speech>

But was this seen as a concern or was it seen as something that needed to be attended to, or was it something that was seen that required an action, either by your side of the house or by the banks themselves?</p></speech>

But it would have been referred to in the presentation, the fact that the concentration in property was still high, at the time we were speaking there were just the first signs, I think, of a decline in the commercial property market.  So it would have been a concern certainly of the bank in its presentation.</p></speech>

Certainly there were no strong views expressed at the round table that recognised this as a major threat at the time.</p></speech>

What we were doing all the time, in the background of course, was working on the contingency arrangements and they had been in place since the beginning of 2008, in fairly serious terms, in terms of what the authorities would actually do.</p></speech>

You had identified this to the bank.  Did the bank take any action itself in this regard specifically?</p></speech>

I mean, yes the messages that we were putting out there were probably the same messages as had been espoused to the banks over the years and the meeting occurred also at a time when liquidity tended to be the major issue.</p></speech>

It is clear I think that what was set out, what the risks were, were understated to some extent.  There were issues on the methodologies employed and I think even though the people at the time felt they were in line with, you know, international standards, there were clearly some issues that arose in terms of the lack of second-round effects and so on.</p></speech>

I am talking here between August 2007 and September 2008.  As you were going in and out of work every day, did you think at the time that the Central Bank was responding in a timely fashion to the local dilemmas that were facing you and the international environment that was all around you?</p></speech>

What were you thinking?</p></speech>

That was the start of Northern Rock.  From the very beginning of that time, we were really involved in crisis management issues.  That absorbed a huge amount of the attention of the bank, as well as the interaction with the ECB in Frankfurt on similar issues.  Were we doing a good job?  We were certainly trying to prepare as well as we could, in case the contingency arose, that we had to respond to the sorts of issues which subsequently actually emerged.</p></speech>

I mean, there would have been some internal discussion to which I was not a party, because I was not a party other than the second half of the 2007 report, but from my knowledge I think there would have been some debate about the tone.  But the tone was really reflected I think more in the Governor's introduction than in the substance of, you know, of the reports.  I would be very surprised if the text of the report was, you know, affected in any way.</p></speech>

I mean, it's a normal state of things, so the fact, you know, that some individual institutions are constantly accessing funds is, in itself, in no way remarkable.  It's not ... I mean, what would be remarkable is probably a very significant increase, okay, in the amount of funding taken from the ECB.</p></speech>

At that meeting, there's evidence given by Mr. Boucher over several pages, but he says:</p><blockquote>We looked at, from memory, a quantum of around &euro;4 billion and we fed back to the regulator that we weren't comfortable.  That wasn't an accurate picture of what was needed.</blockquote>  <p>And then he went on to say:</p><blockquote>To be honest, I felt we should get out of the building.  We can't support these people.  We don't have enough information to enable us.</blockquote>  <p>That figure of around &euro;4 billion, if we go back then to the Vol. 2, the one ... page 45, the minute that we discussed earlier, that this institution could be &euro;2 billion after capital.  This meeting had taken place some weeks before this one so, again, there's obviously something going on, that lots of people are saying, &quot;There are big problems here.&quot;  This is what I can only conclude from reading these.</p></speech>

But then, in your opening statement, you say that, from early 2008, the domestic standing group was increasingly active in crisis management preparations, especially in discussions on the legislative changes necessary for nationalising a bank and on the circumstances in which a guarantee of all bank liabilities would be appropriate.  So, the possibility of a system-wide guarantee was already there, regardless of what might happen to Lehman Brothers, or a bank of such a size?</p></speech>

And is it fair to say then that, having those discussions in February 2008, that crisis management is at an advanced stage, or is it just preparation?  Are we in discussions, or are we actually actively working to manage a crisis that could be coming?</p></speech>

I mean, we already had the Northern Rock episode in September 2007.  We had the liquidity issues at the end of 2007 also, over the end of the year, so we'd moved beyond the stage of thinking it could never happen.  It was into, I think, a realisation that we'd better be prepared in case and that a lot of the discussions around that time had that in mind.  So I think we felt it wasn't a purely academic exercise at that stage and there was ... there was a possibility that at some stage we would have to make a call.</p></speech>

Okay, he regulate ... or ... he reported directly to the authority of the regulator and via that to the Minister, I think.  Now, there was this overarching role of the CBFSAI, which was a very unusual construct, but it meant that the chair and the CEO of the regulator ... yes, they also sat on the board of the bank, but there was no reporting structure as such, okay, between the regulator's office and the Governor.</p></speech>

Did ... in evidence last week with Mr. Hurley, reference was made to the memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator in terms of responsibilities, and it emerged that responsibility for overall financial stability rested with the Central Bank.  In that capacity were there any decisions taken or discussions had in the year, we'll say, the 12-month period in the run up to September 2008 with regard to financial stability and overall responsibility for that?</p></speech>

I said earlier, I think, also that we in the Central Bank are responsible for the provision of liquidity to domestic institutions on behalf of the ECB.  So that involved, you know, auctions of liquidity in normal times every week and every month.  As the crisis enveloped it was much more frequent in practice.  So the people in what we call our financial markets department, of which I was head at one stage, they would have been in constant touch with each of the banks.

The decline in the value of commercial property; again, until the summer of 2008, was modest enough.  It was really in that period in the second half of 2008 that the decline occurred, and I think reflecting the deterioration in the domestic economy here, but also the global economy.</p></speech>

I think one of the faults of the system that we had in place was the splitting of responsibility between the two parts of the organisation.  The information flows between the two sides, it did exist, but probably required one or the other to sort of initiate the information request.  And the structure didn't really lend itself, I think, to very efficient management.</p></speech>

Firstly, I'd ask you do you agree with that statement from Mr. Hurley?  And then, if you had access to much more information, how is it that you didn't appear to recognise the dangers that lay ahead at the end of 2008?</p></speech>

The first part is we had a lot of information on the liquidity requirements of banks from interacting with them every week and every day, sometimes even hourly, on their requirements.  So when I heard from other witnesses to the inquiry saying that we really didn't know the situation in terms of liquidity, in my view that's absolutely false.  We did know.  We had very precise information.  But the second part of the question is: we had information on the liquidity requirements of banks.  We did not have the information on how the funding they received from the ECB was part of their overall funding strategy.  </p>  <p>         In other words, we would not have known in terms of individual institutions what share of their funding was coming from ECB as opposed to from depositing institutions or from the markets, because that is a type of overview that came from the people who looked after the individual institutions and not from the point of view of the markets operations desk of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

I think the issue of special regime was further discussed around the summer of 2008, and there was a relatively clear and strong view from the Department, I think on the advice of the lawyers there that, 1) there were technical and constitutional issues which made it not feasible to introduce such a regime-----</p></speech>

And so the question that I think a lot of people would want to know is why the Central Bank and the Department of Finance were not more prepared with legislation on the books that would have given them the option of taking banks into custody, for example, separating good assets from bad assets.</p></speech>

I mean, I don't think that we saw ourselves as having any other direct role, you know, in that period.  I think that we regarded it mainly as a regulatory issue.</p></speech>

However, it was very difficult to predict how the situation would be likely to unfold.</blockquote>  <p>So, there was a high degree of knowledge at the Central Bank at this stage about the potential risks to the bank and indeed, the wider system as a result of the contracts for difference built up by Mr. Quinn and I'm asking you what actions were being taken at that stage to address the risks and the concerns which were clearly evident?</p></speech>

I mean, we felt it was actually outside our role but certainly we were aware of the fallout from anything that happened for the liquidity and for the stability of the system as a whole.  So, it was more a sort of indirect concern than a direct concern and I think at that stage we felt that we, as a central bank, did not have any direct intervention mechanisms.</p></speech>

Mr. Grimes, thank you for coming.  Can I, first of all, clarify with you, please, because it is still a little bit unclear and Mr. Patrick Neary is in tomorrow, can you define exactly what is guidance in the definition of guidance that the CB ... Central Bank could provide for the Financial Regulator, in terms of financial stability?  Is it instruction, is it direction, or what exactly is guidance, please?</p></speech>

I mean, the intensity of interaction between all, you know, of the authorities, was extremely high at that time.  The DSG came into effect, I think, some time formally in either 2006 or in 2007 and from that time there was a lot of interaction between all the authorities, not just at the level of the DSG principals but, you know, down a layer or two, and I would have thought that between the formal communication as part of the DSG but also the very frequent informal contacts that there should have been no doubt at all at the level of the departments about the information that we had and the concerns that we had.</p></speech>

I think, first of all, any direct intervention ... restriction of money and capital flows would have been entirely at odds with the single capital market and single money market that was set up in 1999 as part of monetary union.  I'm ... in fact, it would have been entirely contrary to the ethos of that.  So, no is the answer ... no direct intervention.  If there was concern - as there was, because it was raised at the time in the FSRs about the degree to which some of the banks were funding externally - I think, if there was concern, it would have to have been addressed by restrictions addressed to the individual banks in terms of their funding ratios.  But ... but that would be at a level of individual banks.  It could not have been a general banning of capital flows.</p></speech>

So ... so there was no pre-commitment here.  It ... it was always entirely at the discretion of the local central bank.  So, constructive ambiguity referred to that.

Can I ask you in ... you've mentioned ... in your opening statement, on page 4, you mention the problems surrounding ELA.  If I quote from your statement it says one of the ... one of the ... with the use of ELA, one of the issues with the "use of ELA is that its use required a floating charge on banks' assets that needed to be registered at the Companies Office.  New legal instruments were introduced in 2007 to avoid this issue."  So, what were those legal instruments and were they used?</p></speech>

Often they would be ... it would be non-marketable instruments so you're ... so to take good title for those you required a particular legal structure and we had worked on that structure and, you know, they were extensively used over the following years.</p></speech>

Sure.  I mean, at one stage the liquidity extended to Irish banks was only a share of the total liquidity that the Central Bank extended to, you know ... to the system here.  Often the share would've been 20%-25% of the total, reflecting the importance of the foreign banks operating here who would use, yes, the Central Bank here as they source of their liquidity.</p></speech>

That share would have varied of course as the crisis hit here ... and the non-Irish banks.  But we had also issues with foreign banks who would not have been eligible to access ECB, you know, funding in their own jurisdictions, who might have had subsidiaries operating in Ireland, accessing funds through the subsidiaries here.  And we were concerned about that because the impact of that was to raise the overall figure that had a profile and we were concerned about that.</p></speech>

I didn't say the information that's here, so I've no way of knowing the source of this.  But my conclusion was, from having attended the meeting, that ... I mean, if this had been said at the meeting I think it would have been a very notable piece of information for the meeting to absorb, and would undoubtedly have conditioned some of the policy reactions taken afterwards, in the light of that information, if that was our conclusion.  It was not my understanding.</p></speech>

So that's the point.  I appreciate that it's not your minute.

We were having so many meetings around that period.  I'm ... I really have to rely on the minute that's here.  But, as I say, in substance I did not take from the conclusion of the meeting that there was a clear and definitive outcome that this was, you know ... a conclusion that said, you know, two of the institutions which are mentioned here, were insolvent.</p></speech>

Chairman, I am talking to yourself; I am not asking anybody.  Okay.  What we are asking here is that at a time that Mr. Grimes had a dual role with both the regulator and the Central Bank, he made reference earlier on to actions being taken, when asked directly by Deputy McGrath what actions were taken, he answered, "Well, it was a regulatory issue."  So I have asked what regulatory actions were taken in that regard, and he's saying, "Well, I don't know whether you want to get into it."  Now I'd like to get into it.

So there was a refocusing, I think, under the principles-based regulation.  There was process, maybe at the expense of substance.</p></speech>

I think there was a lot of contact between, you know, the senior management of both sides of the organisation.  So in general, you know, it was sufficient but we were still operating within the divisions of labour that had flowed from the 2003 Act, which meant that each side regarded its focus as rather exclusive: one side on the prudential regulation of financial institutions and the Central Bank side of the broader financial stability issues</p></speech>

When questioning last week Mr. Hurley, it was somewhat frustrating in the sense that it was difficult to ascertain who said this, at what point did somebody make the determination, and in what office of authority they may have been.  Mr. Hurley wasn't in a position to provide that clarity and I wonder are you in a position to say who first mentioned it to you, or like so many others, was it something that just happened?</p></speech>

I am going to move towards wrapping matters up.  I just want to deal with just one item and that's going back to the minutes that we were...  A number of matters I will take them in the wrap-up after I bring in the leads.  On that minute that we discussed earlier and following the line of questioning from Deputy McGrath and from Senator MacSharry as well, there would be one consistent issue or maybe I can put it to you - is there a consistent issue with regard to the content of both those documents that relate to the stability of the Irish State?  These are not regulatory matters but are actually stability issues.  </p>  <p>               Would you see them, or accept them, as being stability issues?</p></speech>

I mean, all around us it was ... and at the end of a period after Lehman's when so many banks, globally, had failed, there was a huge amount of tension.  So, when that meeting was held, it was definitely in the context of, you know, a financial stability issue and, you know, the minute refers, in the final paragraph, I think, to the various options that were on the table, so that's the context in which the meeting was held and that's the context in which my memory of the meeting was formulated.</p></speech>

Certainly, if you judge by the resources which are now actually made available, both in the reconstituted bank but also globally, I think that, if you have a handful of people looking after the two or three major banks in the country, it clearly was not sufficient.  It might have been in a very principles-based environment but even then I doubt it, it wasn't-----</p></speech>

Considering that the auditors of those banks told us that, in one case, there was up to 200 staff working on the audit of Allied Irish Bank, was that, or not, just a question of a shortage of resources, or was it a pathetic inadequacy of resources?</p></speech>

I was certainly at the initial meeting where all the parties were around the table and there was an initial exchange of views on options, which included the guarantee and nationalisation, and it was an exchange of views around the table on that.

Mr. Grimes, you said to Senator O'Keeffe that there was no evidence that the banks were insolvent on the night of the guarantee.  Can I ask you by which ... which definition of "insolvency" were you ... had you in mind when you made that statement?</p></speech>

It's clear that they didn't.  A wider look at insolvency would be much more forward looking and ... but even then, as I said earlier, it was unclear.  There were certainly risks there of insolvency for one or two institutions but you had to take into account, I think, a lot of factors in making a judgment on insolvency, including collateral, including the buffers available for the banks, including the declines in asset prices, which actually occurred in a very serious way subsequent to that meeting, so it's a very delicate judgment to make and the judgment that I made was that they're probably not insolvent at that stage.</p></speech>

Could I refer again, Chairman, to Vol. 1, page 57?  It's a domestic standing group committee meeting of 8 July '08 which, Mr. Grimes, you attended on behalf of the Central Bank and it relates to the Quinn Group.  It says:</p><blockquote>Consideration was also required given the exposure of the Irish banking system and the Irish economy to the Quinn Group and the impact on investor sentiment towards Ireland of any deterioration in its financial position of the possible need to refinance its bond holding.  The current bond holders were largely US insurance firms and had no domestic interest.</blockquote>  <p>And it looks ... the company were due to post a loss published the end of October.  So, the question I suppose I wanted to ask you was, on the night of the guarantee, was the Quinn Group a factor in guaranteeing Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

At time ... at that time, because of the institution concerned, it would not have had the same ... the same range of other assets as other banks.  And, of course, the haircut was dependent.

I wasn't aware of that particular instance because sometimes, the collateral they bring to market can vary, as they get more collateral into ECB-conformable styles.  So the fact that they wouldn't have enough collateral at a point in time doesn't mean that, a few weeks down the road, they couldn't convert other assets into a format that would become ECB-compatible.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We now commence with session 2 of today's public hearings with Ms Mary Burke, Central Bank of Ireland IFSRA.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session.  Can I remind members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  Today we continue our hearings with the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.  At our first session this afternoon we will hear from Ms Mary Burke, a senior official at the Central Bank IFSRA.  Later this afternoon we will here from another Central Bank IFSRA witness, Mr. Con Horan.</p><p>Mary Burke joined the Central Bank in Ireland in 1984 and has worked in financial services regulation and supervision since 1998 across various industry sectors.  In May 2006, she was appointed to the position of head of banking supervision at the Financial Regulator.  She is currently head of credential policy at the Central Bank, a position she has held since 2010.  Ms. Burke, you're very welcome and I would also like to acknowledge that you are accompanied today by your legal representative, Mr. Niall Michelle. </p><p>Before I hear from you this afternoon and the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry and, therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can lawfully be given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only such that individual institutions will not be identified.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.</p><p>So, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the affirmation to you.</p></speech>

And good afternoon to members of the joint committee.  I have, as requested, submitted a written statement to the inquiry under two broad categories of themes on which I have been directed to give evidence: regulatory, supervisory and Government; and banking.<br/><br/>For the purposes of this statement and in the interest on time, therefore, I propose to focus on particular aspects of my commentary on the regulatory and supervisory themes.  It may also assist the committee if I clarify again that my personal knowledge of, and involvement with, those themes dates from my appointment to the head of banking supervision department in May 2006.  It may further save time if I reiterate that while I make take issue with some of the fine detail of the respective Honohan and Nyberg reports, I accept generally the thrust of the findings contained in them.  As with the commentary I have already provided to the inquiry in writing, the commentary I will now give is necessarily generalised, given the constraints already mentioned by you, Chairman, and, in particular, the strict non-disclosure requirements to which I am subject by virtue of 33AK of the Central Bank Acts. <br/><br/>My opening commentary briefly centres on five issues which are as follows: IFSRA's regulatory approach and philosophy; the regulatory and supervisory toolkit; effectiveness of regulation and supervision; any relationship between macroeconomic policy and prudential policy; and prudential policy itself. <br/><br/>In terms of regulatory approach and philosophy, the regulatory regime implemented by IFSRA was positioned as principles-based.  The approach to regulation appeared to me to be broadly similar to that previously applied by the Central Bank and did not represent a significant shift in prudential regulation or supervision.  From my perspective, the focus on defining it as principles-based seemed driven by a desire to brand the organisation and its strategy rather than any fundamental change in approach <i>per se</i>, beyond the changes associated with consumer protection.  As articulated at the time, principles-based regulation placed an emphasis on seeking to require regulated entities themselves to abide by good governance and on the responsibilities of the boards in management of such institutions to have, and maintain in place, appropriate governance as well as controls and risk management measures in order to appropriately manage their institutions.<br/><br/>However, principles-based regulation was not without rules.  The cornerstones of banking regulation in May 2006, the point at which I was transferred to BSD, were the Capital Adequacy Directive, the Central Bank Acts and the building societies Acts.  A key document supporting the regulatory regime was the licensing and supervision standards.  However, it should be noted that these standards were non-statutory and not enforceable as such.  EU legislative initiatives also changed the regulatory landscape.  The Capital Requirements Directive became fully effective in on 1 January 2008.  This was a complex framework which, amongst other things, facilitated the use of banks' internal models for the calculation of regulatory capital and mandated supervisory co-operation through colleges of supervisors, particularly in the context of capital decisions for EU banks and banking groups.  </p>  <p>         Since the emergence of the crisis in 2007, and given the scale of changes to the regulatory framework at international, EU and domestic level, it is only reasonable to accept, albeit with the benefit of hindsight, that the pre-existing regulatory regime, both domestically and internationally, was not fully appropriate in terms of the areas covered, the detail prescribed and the regulatory tools available.  However, in my view, revision of the regulatory framework in and of itself is not, and would not, have been a panacea.  In fact, given the nature of the issues we now know to have arisen in Irish banks, I would suggest that the regulatory powers available to IFSRA and the bank before it, were broadly sufficient, aside from those with respect to crisis management and resolution.</p> <p> In my view, the issues were the strategic approach, and the willingness or otherwise, as well as the logistical wherewithal, or lack thereof, to use those powers to prescribe detailed rules or to challenge and intervene in a manner which would impact banks' business models.  The strategy was, I believe, influenced by external factors, including international approaches to regulation and supervision, Government policy and its better regulation agenda, the promotion of Ireland as a financial services centre, industry influence and costs.  The effectiveness of the regulatory regime is directly linked to the culture of the supervisory authority and the resources allocated to supervision.  Unlike the regulatory framework, which is set out in legislation and published requirements, these are tangible aspects which are not necessarily visible and can be lost in statistics and in the prose of formal strategy documents and annual reports.</p> <p> However, importantly in my view, a more onerous or prescriptive regulatory framework would, in and of itself, not necessarily have delivered a significantly different outcome if, as was the case, the supervisory resources, both in terms of staff numbers and specialist expertise, were not in place to monitor, challenge and enforce where compliance was not delivered.  If there are insufficient people to do the work, the work simply cannot be done.  In that regard, in 2006, BSD had an approved staff complement of only 53.5, with actual numbers averaging around 50, to supervise approximately 80 banks, 50 Irish-licensed and 30 EU branches.  The level of resources, and the available specialist expertise, was not such as to be capable of delivering intrusive supervision, even in a business-as-usual mode of operation.  Added to that, during my tenure in BSD, a business-as-usual scenario never in fact applied.  Initially, there was the additional burden of implementing the CRD, and from August 2007, the crisis mounted with ever-increasing issues and problems heaped upon an already under-resourced and over-stretched department.</p> <p> While an additional complement of three staff was agreed in 2007, my request for additional staff in May 2008, in the face of the financial crisis and the demands being placed upon the department, was effectively refused.  A subsequent oral request that staff who had previously worked in BSD be re-assigned to the department was also rejected.  It is difficult to convey the sheer scale of pressures management and staff in BSD were working under, particularly from autumn 2007 onwards.  It was not a question of somehow multi-tasking: it was a question of dealing with an unrelenting onslaught of demands, with staff working unreasonably and unsustainably long days, and ultimately weeks, with no let-up.  Resource constraints were such that IFSRA was unable, although required by the CRD, to conclude on ICAAP assessments for banks by the end of 2007.  Throughout 2008, staff were, on an almost daily basis, being assigned additional responsibilities.  Every new issue or new request was a priority on top of existing priorities, and issues with one institution were dealt with at the expense of issues with others.  It was only immediately following the introduction of the Government guarantee that an increase of 20 in staff complement was agreed, and a separate department dealing with the Government-guaranteed banks was established.  Over the following years, BSD was restructured on a number of occasions, with overall staff numbers for banking supervision increasing to approximately 140 approved in 2010.  From 2010 onwards, supervision was also supported by the newly-established policy enforcement directorates.</p> <p> In terms of the use of powers, even where regulations were sanctionable under the administrative sanctions process, in the period 2003 to the end of 2008, no prudential enforcement cases were pursued against credit institutions.  I consider there were a number of factors in this: strategically, the authorities saw the sanctioning process as being primarily a tool in consumer protection; there were concerns regarding market reaction as the crisis mounted; and BSD did not have the resources to mount and pursue such cases.  It was only as the resources issue started to be addressed, from 2009 onwards, that prudential enforcement cases became more routine.</p> <p> In assessing the effectiveness of the supervisory regime, it is also important to understand the culture of the organisation, and the different levels of industry engagement.  IFSRA's relationship with banks appeared to me to operate at two levels: at a frontline level with BSD and at a senior executive level.  Senior banking executives had direct contact with senior executives in IFSRA, often without the knowledge of, not to say engagement with, supervisory staff.  Staff were regularly requested by senior IFSRA executives to review decisions or issues based on these discussions, or were told by contacts in banks that the issues had been or would be discussed with our senior executives.  To me, at its most benign, this indicated a disconnect between BSD and senior IFSRA executives.  I believe it also signalled a manifest lack of support for staff, undermining them in their dealings with banks.  </p> <p> In terms of any linkage between macro-economic and prudential policy, when working in BSD, I saw no evidence of a strong link in that regard.  Given the demands placed on resources, as a result of the implementation of CRD, at some time prior to my arrival in BSD, a decision was taken that the department would cease to be actively involved in work relating to the financial stability review.  However, this would have been in the knowledge that the relevant economic department within the Bank had access to data regarding individual banks.  The financial stability committee was a formal structure for co-operation between IFSRA and the bank on financial stability-related issues.  However, the main focus of meetings tended to be on drafting of economic articles and publications.</p> <p>  In terms of prudential policy, IFSRA took a number of policy measures aimed at strengthening the regulatory framework, including the introduction of liquidity requirements.  In implementing options and discretions, under the CRD, it took a conservative approach to the exercise of discretions in relation to property-related lending.  The proposals on all options and discretions were subject to a public consultation in October 2006.  In addition, the Governor of the Central Bank confirmed that the proposals represented the best that could be achieved in the circumstances.  While these interventions can now be seen to have been insufficient, it is worth noting that IFSRA was the only public authority which took measures to try and cool the property-related lending.</p> <p> Further detail on these and other lines of inquiry is provided in my written statement.  In addition, I have not dealt with the specifics of the regulatory framework and supervisory arrangements as I am aware the Central Bank has provided significant detail on these to the inquiry.  Again, thank you for the opportunity to make this opening statement, I hope it is useful in providing additional background and context on the wider issues under consideration by the inquiry.</p></speech>

We had introduced new liquidity requirements which took effect on 1 July, the first reporting date for that would have been at the end of September, it was quarterly reporting as we originally implemented it, but the concern was such regarding market reaction of circumstances of the time that from, I think it was 14 September, we required them to report to us weekly.  So there were concerns at that point that we needed to be aware of what was happening in terms of bank liquidity, but there was no immediate urgent concern, it was just an escalation of monitoring.</p></speech>

Is that a long time or a short time, that many months?  Because it's very hard, I think, for members of the public, when we talk about millions and billions and loans, to know ... you know, if I have a crisis in my own bank, I know in an afternoon, I need some more money to pay my bills, but it seems, people might construe that as a long period of time.  But perhaps it's not, perhaps it's short.</p></speech>

In terms of my feeling, it was more urgent.  I mean, we had had Northern Rock, we'd had Sachs and we'd had Bear Stearns ... so, we were monitoring it, marketing conditions were certainly more erratic, might be a good phrase.  </p>  <p>         I wasn't at that stage conscious or thinking, you know, we were going to run out of liquidity, but the possibility for ... more so for an individual bank, I think, than ... I certainly never saw the system seizing up at that point.</p></speech>

I think it depends on the circumstances that would give rise to the liquidity.  It is possible that those circumstances might be something relatively short-lived or something unexpected happens.  The very fact that central banks around the globe provide a facility for emergency liquidity certainly implies that there is an expectation that it might happen and not that it was something that would ... obviously a central bank can't give emergency liquidity if the bank is insolvent, so the two are not necessarily one following from the other.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.884" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#JJ00500"><p>I don't recall that at that time we were talking about solvency.  I certainly don't recall that I was talking about solvency or that people in banking supervision were talking about solvency.  We were very much focused on liquidity.  The weekly reporting had come in, as I said, late in the previous year.  We were moving to ... we had started with daily calls with banks, we were now at intra ... you know, intra-day calls, talking through the position with their treasury teams.  So our focus was very much on liquidity.  Now, there was also some work being done in inspecting banks and looking at property-related lending, but ... and there were contingency plans being developed, given Northern Rock had collapsed.  But I can't say that I was particularly engaged on that.  Now, I will say, in terms of the meetings and the planning that was going on at the time, it was particularly chaotic and, from where I sat, it felt chaotic in terms of the amount of work we were trying to do.  I was conscious that there were meetings on the seventh floor.  Sorry for my use of the vernacular, that's our executive floor.  I tended to be ... occasionally I get parachuted into a meeting because they need a second person there.  You wouldn't be seeing that issue through.  So, the extent to which I can create a sort of a narrative as to what was happening is influenced by the fact that I was sort of parachuted in and out of meetings.  But at BSD level I was not particularly focused on solvency at that point.</p></speech>

Or not?</p></speech>

I ... when I came into BSD we were very focused ... I mean, obviously you have to do a sort of getting to know what the remit of what job you've been handed is.  But we were very focused on trying to bring in the capital requirements directive.  So we were quite forward looking, I suppose.  I did not set about, at that point, to start revising all the current procedures, I was more in terms of developing procedures for the regime that was coming.  But, no, I can't say that I say systemic risks building up at that time, nor can I say that anybody else that I was dealing with in the bank, either reporting to me or that I was reporting to, was indicating concerns about systemic risks.</p></speech>

It means people who are experts in lending, in treasury, in risk management being able to sit across the table from the banks and deal with them on their own level, on their terms, on the issues.  We simply didn't have that sort of support system in place.  Most, I think, regulatory authorities probably would have.  I think the FSA at the time had a specialist support team, and we do have that sort of a team now.  It's the sort of ... as banking ... it's an extremely complicated industry.  It's not something that you can have a general knowledge of all of these things.  You can have that knowledge but I don't think you can expect a supervisor with that level of general knowledge to argue the issue with the director of lending of an institution and tell him why you believe his policies and his decisions were the right ones or the wrong ones.</p></speech>

The manpower planning in the Central Bank was such that some time around the first quarter you got an e-mail saying, you know, "Please fill up these various templates, setting out the staff you need and why".  You would have had to submit that to the next level.  You would have had to get the approval of your director and your director would have to endorse it.  In this particular occasion, in fairness, my director did endorse that decision.  That request, however, was made in the face of being told, while we were being asked to complete the forms, that there would be no increase in staff that year.  Nonetheless, it didn't preclude the possibility, of course, that the staff could be reassigned.  I certainly didn't believe that I could go through that year without asking for additional staff.  I should say that in May '08 you would have been projecting staff for the next year because that's how early the budget process started.  I did self-centre ... or self-censor, I beg your pardon, somewhat in what I asked for because, having worked in the organisation as long as I did, I knew the reaction to looking for large numbers.  We were also in the throes of a review by Mazars and I felt very confident they would flag we were under-resourced.  We'd also had Northern Rock and the FSA had produced a report, the name escapes me, but The Collapse of the Rock, or something to that effect, where they indicated that they had three staff supervising Northern Rock, supported by, as I said earlier, a specialist team, and they considered that inadequate for the supervision of a bank that required close and continuous scrutiny.  So those were the sort of details I put into my supporting memo.</p></speech>

We would have been at that stage, I think, probably ringing each bank and talking to them a number of times during the course of the day as to what sort of access they had in the market, etc., and conscious that all banks ... we were trying to ensure they maximised their collateral for ECB purposes as well.

What you would have been recognising, however, was that they needed to have, to the maximum extent possible, access to the ECB if they needed it.  So you would have been encouraging banks to make sure that they had eligible collateral for Central Bank purposes, but I don't think any regulator would be saying if you have an alternative, you know, access to liquidity that you should be going to a central bank ... that wouldn't have been ... but at that point, we would have been looking for liquidity for banks wherever they could get it, to be quite honest.</p></speech>

They were described as a guide.  I knew they were unenforceable under the administrative sanctions procedure.  When I came to the department, in terms of the banks this committee is looking at, any of them that breached those limits were already in breach of the limits at that point.  In the case of one institution, it had exceeded the limits for almost a decade.  In inquiring into the history to those limits, I understood that they had been, in effect, disapplied, in the sense of the particular sectors that the Central Bank had set out.  If you look back ... I mean I obviously can't give you all of the details on this but there is a Central Bank board paper from 2003 that acknowledges that in the case of a particular institution, and, more generally, mortgage lending institutions, that the Central Bank had accepted the argument that there was diversification within sectors.  That was ... I think that's an April '03 paper, which predates the establishment of the regulator, so it was very much a Central Bank position.</p>  <p>   So, as I understood it, the Central Bank and the regulator, subsequently, was accepting the argument that there were ... was diversification within sectors.  So if you take property, there's a difference between, I don't know, an office block in London and a semi-d in Midleton, to pick somewhere, so, you know, those ... that diversification was there.  The sectors themselves were not prescribed in the licensing standards.  We didn't say what we counted as a sector.  What was used was ESCB, which ... sorry, European System of Central Banks statistical return, and various categories were the sectors that were used.  Interestingly, personal lending, which would have included lending for residential mortgages, so if I bought a house, even to let as opposed to rent, or let as opposed to live in, that lending was excluded; that wasn't considered in looking at the sectoral limits.</p></speech>

From my perspective, I was clear.  I know there has been quite an emphasis on perhaps ... it was, it was maybe a cumbersome arrangement.  I will accept that, certainly not the most elegant arrangement one could have come up with.  It was, however, the arrangement that was put in place.  I felt I was clear.  I certainly didn't feel there was any lack of clarity at that point.</p></speech>

So there were no new people.  So it's kind of strange that, to the outsider, that people who'd been doing the job suddenly saw themselves as different and the ...

I mean, come 1 May 2003, if you want to call it D-day or whatever you want to call, I was in the same office that day as I was the previous day.  I was not conscious of some radical change.  I amn't in a position to say, because I don't have the details nor do I recall whether there was any increase in staff.  The one difference there would have been was, I think, there was more focus on the consumer protection aspect.</p></speech>

The Central Bank, rather than the regulator was dealing with the system-wide stress test, so I presume there were replies but I just can't speak to them.  In terms of the February '07 letter, which was our policy review of sectoral concentration limits, my understanding is there were replies received by us.  I think something like nine banks replied.  I haven't gone to check whether that was a reply to every single ... from every single bank.  When you come to page 57, that is a letter from me, it's a standard letter.  It would have issued to all mortgage lending institutions, and yes, I appreciate it refers to stress testing in there but that should not be confused with the system-wide stress test that I referred to earlier that was run by the Central Bank.  This was guidance that we had in place where we expected banks to ... it was in the context of the affordability of a mortgage that a customer might take on, so every mortgage should have been stress test and the applicant assessed as to whether or not they could handle a 2% increase in the interest rate.   So again, those are three separate issues and in the context of that letter on page 57, I would have expected no more than a reply to say yes, they were aware of it and they would comply. </p></speech>

So in that context, perhaps the language they used as to whether they were comfortable or not might not be the language you would use normally but they were trying to explain to us the policy they had to inform our thinking on the policy we would develop.

It was not imposed as a condition, for example, on banks' licences nor was it issued under any statutory power.

The Central Bank ... Act 2013 has given us a more flexible framework for engaging with auditors regarding what they may uncover during their audit but I think banking regulation has moved on very significantly since the period that I was reviewing in my statement or commenting on in my statement.  So, we have a more intrusive regime of supervision.  The SSM is a game-changer, frankly, in terms of supervision of systemically important banks within the euro area, so I don't, personally, at this point see a need to change the role of auditors, certainly in the context of supervision if you wish to their role in some other respect, that is-----</p></speech>

I think all directorates, both prudential and consumer, need to be adequately resourced.  There was a particular focus in IFSRA post its establishment on the consumer protection area.  I think, even in the documents you've given me, I chose to look back at the agendas of various authority meetings ... and, yes, there probably was a greater focus at that level at that time on consumer protection.  But I think it needs to be borne in mind that IFSRA was a new authority, so there was a lot of agenda items to do with establishing that authority and budgeting, etc.  And, perhaps, not unsurprisingly there was a particular focus on consumer protection at the time.  But we do have to remember why IFSRA was set up.  I suppose, it was in response to consumer protection issues.</p></speech>

Each department dealt with the particular industry sectors and they supervised within the framework they were given.  To the extent that there was a pressure, if that's what you are looking at, to have principles-based regulation, I think that probably came from industry.  You have the Clearing House Group, the Government's better regulation agenda ... the industry panel was another part of the architecture of the IFSRA regime.  And all of those would have pushed for principles-based regulation.  But, in fairness, it was also an international theme of, you know, lesser regulation, for the want of a better term.</p></speech>

I was clear in my communication that I didn't believe it was the right number but I knew I had to get over various hurdles, including the process, the fact that Mazars were in reviewing, etc.  So six was by no means the sort of numbers that would have made any ... I don't believe it would have made any fundamental difference to the outcome.  What I had hoped to do was to establish dedicated two-person teams for each of the main banks.  Now, given what we now know, that would still have been inadequate.  And, as I say, I wasn't saying it was adequate.  I ... at that point, I don't think it would have made any fundamental difference.  My vision was that people would not be distracted from one bank to ...  issues with another bank.  But it still wouldn't have given us the resources to do intrusive supervision.  And, I suppose, to the extent that I can take any comfort from things, I think Governor Honohan said in his own report that even if you had a brilliant idea at the end of '06, it was probably too late.  I don't think my request for six staff was a brilliant idea but even, I think, if we had put in an army at that point, an awful lot of the damage was already done.</p></speech>

At the very end of that paragraph, this is the response that you give to your request:</p>  <p>To me, at its most benign, this indicated a disconnect between the [banking supervisory ... supervision division ... or department] and senior IFSRA executives which, in practice, banks used to their advantage.  I believe that [this is signalled or this} ... also signalled a manifest lack of support for staff, undermining them in their dealings with bank ...".</p>  <p>Could you talk to us some more about how maybe this gave the banks ... banks an advantage and also how you see that this may have been undermining them in their dealing with the banks.</p></speech>

I don't have an issue with the fact that institutions might choose to escalate something.  And if they choose to do so, I think the executive in the regulatory authority should engage with the supervisory staff and they should be part of informing that discussion.  Personally, I believe they probably should be at the meetings or certainly some of them should be at the meetings.  And that's very much the framework we have now.  We have more directors, in fairness, so the responsibility at the executive level is more widely spread.  And for want of a better term they are very much "embedded" in the supervisory regimen.  And that's my view as to how it should work.  In terms of undermining staff - and I have had personal experience of this - if you are talking to a bank and they say to you, ''Oh well, we discussed that issue on the seventh floor'', you're immediately wrong footed.  You're in a position where, one, you don't know whether they did discuss it, you don't know what they discussed, you don't know what the outcome is.  And you're already very much already seen, from the bank's perspective, as somebody who's not in the loop.</p></speech>

I think that probably applied to the Central Bank but we obviously had to be conscious of any Central Bank objectives in the manner in which we went about our work.  Yes, I think it did.  I think it put a huge emphasis ... or a disproportionate emphasis is probably a better way of putting it ... on competitiveness ... on the level playing field.  We had the added complications in two respects ... one, we had an International Financial Services Centre, where we were trying to attract in industry.  We very much wanted to keep them on the same regulatory regime.  There was one regime for banking in Ireland.  We also had the difficulty that, under the European provisions regarding freedom of services, certain institutions operated here on a branch basis.  And, therefore, in terms of prudential regulation, they were supervised by a different regulator.  They were supervised by us for conduct of business but not for prudential.  So, if we imposed particular rules or regulations on Irish licensed banks that weren't imposed on the passport ... the branches, then the issue of level playing field and competitiveness immediately raised its head.  But it was a ... from looking back at documents - and I have had the dubious pleasure of doing so for coming in here in terms of my research - the term ''competitiveness'' and ''level playing field'' comes up repeatedly.  It comes up in IFSRA's own strategy statements, it comes up in industry panel, it comes up in ... even the Minister, when he announced the consolidation ... proposals to consolidate financial services legislation - I think that was in '06 sometime - even that press release talks about how it is important to do so for competitiveness and recognising the ... we have such a large international banking presence here.  So it was a repeated theme.</p></speech>

What did you do, as head of banking supervision?</p></speech>

It was also escalated both through the executive and to the authority and my recollection is the CEO report to the authority in early '08 flagged that there were issues across the system and one of the issues in particular that I recall was the issue of net worth statements and the extent to which they were validated by third parties.  So it was escalated internally and the standard procedure for issuing letters to banks was followed.</p></speech>

I mean if the action you're considering is something like an administrative sanction procedure, for example, in terms of inadequate internal controls, I've already said in my statement that we didn't have the resources to do that.  The approach to administrative sanctions had been established in, I think it was probably '05, following the Act that was brought in.  Each department went through the rules requirements, whatever ... that were sanctionable, and identified the priority they attached to them.  I did it for the department I was in at the time, you graded them either one to five or A to D, something like that.  In fairness, in banking supervision, that assessment was done.  What was interesting was that even in '05 the opening paragraph of that policy noted that BSD was not in a position to have the resources to pursue an ASP case.  That was the case in '05 Deputy, it was even more the case in '08.</p></speech>

I want to go to, again Vol. 2 of the documents and it's page 86 and it's actually from ... it's from the &quot;Misjudging Risk: Causes of the Systemic Banking Crises in Ireland&quot;, and then paragraph 4.3.5.  It says however, it talks about:</p><blockquote>In the same vein, inspection reports on Anglo during the Period (both in 2004 and 2007) correctly identified a number of more important problems in the bank at the time.  However, there is no indication that these internal reports led to either a reconsideration of supervisory practices or serious consideration of regulatory action.  Had the FR [Financial Regulator] rigorously enforced its recommendation to improve structures and processes, it is possible that Anglo would have grown its property lending in a more prudent manner.</blockquote>  <p>And it goes on to say that that could also have had an impact on other banks' lending.  Do you subscribe to this view that because the Financial Regulator, and the division which you were head of, did not follow up on these issues, that Anglo was allowed to - and I'm paraphrasing here in my view, I'm asking you for a view on this - that Anglo was allowed to continue to grow in a more imprudent manner?</p></speech>

In terms of the 2007 inspection, yes issues were identified.  I have already explained why we didn't take administrative sanctions procedures.  I can't tell you whether, you know, that would have resulted in the outcome.  It is clearly the view of, and I presume this is Mr. Nyberg's report, that it is a possible outcome.  I'll accept it as a possible outcome.  There are other possible outcomes.  I mean if things had been different, Deputy, things would have been different but I can't tell you precisely in terms of a systemic failure, which particular levers, if we pulled them differently or did things differently, would have resulted in a fundamentally different outcome.</p></speech>

My recollection of the discussion is that it did note that there was areas for improvement.  I think the IMF commented that there had been some improvement but there were more areas for improvement, and there were certainly caveats to the extent that we should acknowledge the limitations of the stress test.  I think the regime for stress testing has moved on in leaps and bounds, if you look at, you know, the PCAR and the PLAR that were done subsequently, and the more recent SSM as a quality review, they were very different animals in terms of stress tests.</p></speech>

I can't speak for how the scenarios were developed in 2006 because it was before my time.  The overall responsibility for running the stress test had moved from banking supervision, which seemed to be taking the lead - again, I can only deduce this from the documentation provided to me - in '04; the correspondence was issuing from banking supervision.  By the time we got to '06, that responsibility was with the Central Bank.  The extent to which they engaged with the then management in banking supervision as to the scenarios and the stresses, I can't speak to.  I am, however, aware that the IMF also had input, but I can't speak to you as to how much input BSD had.</p></speech>

I'm just curious, as head of banking supervision, that you weren't involved in the domestic standing group as an active member, or regular member.  You weren't in the room for the crisis simulation exercise, you didn't have a direct role in the scoping paper prepare, looking at the nationalisation or liquidisation ... or liquidation, excuse me, or guaranteeing of a banks, and you weren't aware that the Governor was approaching the banks directly to ask them to lend to each other.  Can I ask why that is?</p></speech>

You would need to ask some of the people that didn't approach me on various things.  In fairness to people at that time, it was very fast moving.  There was a lot of issues being dealt with my impression was, strategically, at the level of the 7th floor.  The more issues came, the more BSD became operational, and much less strategic.  We were literally fire-fighting and there were constant demands for information, be it why we didn't regulate conduits, to what the liquidity position on a particular bank was, etc., and I think, given the resource constraints within the wider organisation, the 7th floor and our executives became far more involved in those sort of strategic discussions where, in a more calm, business as usual mode, perhaps you might have expected the head of banking supervision to be involved.  I can only tell you my evidence is I was not involved.</p></speech>

I don't believe we could have delivered ... we didn't deliver intrusive supervision.  If you are a team of three people and you have two of the major banks in the country and you are trying to supervise them through the worst financial crisis since nineteen twenty whatever, there was only so much those people could do, and it was not intrusive supervision, and, in fairness to those people in BSD, I think I should say that they went above and beyond in terms of the effort they put in.</p></speech>

Can I go very quickly to your written statement, page 3, and this relates to the International Financial Services Centre and I quote, which you did already, some of it:</p><blockquote>Other factors which I consider influenced the approach to regulation and supervision were [the Financial Regulator's] mandate to promote the financial services industry and the existence of the International Financial Services Centre ... The desire to portray Ireland as business friendly led, I believe, to a reluctance to introduce prescriptive rules and a particular focus on keeping costs down [and then continue a little while on] ... In addition, the strategic decision that there should not be two different regulatory regimes - one for domestic firms and another for those in the IFSC - meant that a different approach was not taken to the domestic financial services sector.  This decision was driven by a concern that the IFSC might otherwise be categorised as an off-shore centre with associated negative connotations.</blockquote>  <p>Could I ask you, Ms. Burke, would it be fair or unfair to interpret that statement as meaning something like this, that in order that the IFSC was not seen as an offshore island-type financial centre with a more lax regime than normal domestic banking and an unsavoury reputation, perhaps, that regulatory standards for the domestic banking sector as a whole were significantly lowered to avoid making what was happening in the IFSC look bad?</p></speech>

It's more eloquent and colourful, perhaps, than mine but, perhaps, being from the Central Bank I tend to play it more low key.  Yes, the wild west reference did ... was something people had in mind.  It certainly was something people felt defensive about.  I don't know that the standards were lowered for domestic banks by virtue of the IFSC but there was very much a view that we needed to have one regime and sell the regulatory regime in the context of the promotion of industry as being a one regime for supervising banks.</p></speech>

Okay, let me sum up so, Chairman.  In page 7 of Ms. Burke's written statement again - and the Chairman alluded to this - and you are speaking about the relationship between what I would call perhaps rank and file members ... workers in the IFSRA and more senior executives.  Could I put it to you, Ms. Burke, that what you portray there to an ordinary person might seem as an extraordinarily dysfunctional relationship ... that it would seem that hard work by rank and file - or whatever you would refer to - I've no doubt hard-working members of the regulator were undermined by a cosy relationship between regulators at the top and the banks?  And, just the last thing, you say at its most benign this indicated a disconnect between the banking supervision department ... or division and the senior regulator executives.  If that was benign, what would a malign explanation be do you think?</p></speech>

I have not talked of a cosy relationship ... it's your phrase that it was dysfunctional.  I would say it was frustrating for people at an operational level to feel they had to not only argue the issues with the banks they supervised but also have to argue... some of them, not all of them ... it wasn't every decision we ever made just to be clear on that ... but if you're already arguing with the banks, to have to argue with the people that you feel should be on your side was frustrating.  I think people felt undermined by the fact that you would see the CEO of a bank in at reception.  It was a bank you supervised and you would come to me and say "Do you know why they're in?"and I would go "No, I have no idea."  I think that did undermine people.  Whether ... I don't... it wasn't ... it didn't feel ... and perhaps you just become used to the system you're trying to work within.  It didn't feel, you know, hugely dysfunctioning ... dysfunctional, I beg your pardon, it felt frustrating.  I'm not suggesting there was anything inappropriate in the relationship.  I've already explained that I don't have an issue with senior executives escalating matters internally within the bank or within the regulator, but I do feel that the people at the front line dealing with it should have been involved in any subsequent discussions with those senior executives.</p></speech>

There's the Financial Services Centre, there's the Central Bank, there's the auditors, there's the regulators, the boards and all the rest of it.  But, as a supervisor, you would have ... you would be gathering an intelligence and an awareness and a cognisance of things from a broad observation.  Now, one observation ... or things that could have been observed during the time was loan-to-value ratios were tightening, we saw income ratios and borrowers increasing, going from two or three times' an income up to seven or eight times and beyond that, we saw schedule extensions from 20 years out to 35 and 40 years on mortgages and we saw 100% mortgage products and all the rest of it coming on the line.  Did that in any way find its way into the thinking of your role and travel up the line in terms of that we need to do something about this?</p></speech>

I mean, some of the things like the 100% mortgages actually would probably also have been discussed with ... the consumer context.  So there were general discussions around those issues.  In terms of banking supervision, other than doing the various inspections that we did, etc., I'm not conscious that we were ... and we were very busy, as I said earlier, dealing with operational issues - much less so strategic as time went on - and that really was probably from the end of '07 onwards.  So they would have been considered, and probably discussed also at the financial stability committee, but I don't recall that any definitive particular courses of action were agreed as a result.</p></speech>

Okay, that's fine.  In the period - and I know some of it predates yourself - records of the Financial Regulator indicate that no enforcement action was taken on any institution for regulatory breaches from 2003 to 2008.  I know you only came along post-2006.  Why was that?</p></speech>

We didn't then, I beg your pardon, have a separate enforcement directorate as we have now.  We actually have a directorate with two enforcement departments who in fairness carry ... do Trojan work and carry the lion's share of responsibility in terms of taking a sanction and pushing it through.  Sanctions ... you know, the initiation and the pursuit and the successful conclusion of sanctions, which is a very time-consuming process, was left with the supervision departments.  It wasn't peculiar to banking supervision.  </p>  <p>         It was the same if you had investment firms, or funds, or whatever, insurance, it was the same and we didn't have, in either of the two departments I was in, the resources to divert people that ... from doing the day job of supervision to, say, take time out, which would have been a number of people, for weeks on end, to pursue a sanctions case and, as I said to Deputy Doherty earlier, in as early as '05, the banking supervision department - that was before my time - in its policy had indicated it did not have the resources to pursue a sanctions case.</p></speech>

Can I just go to ... it's ... I don't known what page.  It's the second-last place of your statement where you speak about ... that &quot;Senior banking executives [and I'm assuming seventh floor executives] had regular direct contact with senior executives of IFSRA, often without the knowledge of, not to say engagement with, supervisory staff.&quot;  Now, you took it upon yourself, in October 2006, to ask that the support staff would advise us of the agendas, of whether briefings were required and whether the supervision staff were to be present.  &quot;In practice&quot;, you said, &quot;this resulted in marginal if any difference, particularly as the crisis escalated&quot; and then you spoke about, saying that:</p><blockquote>Staff were regularly requested by senior IFSRA executives to review decisions/issues based on their discussions, or told by contacts in banks that issues had been, or would be, discussed with [other] senior executives.  To me, at its most benign, this indicated a disconnect between [the supervision staff] and the senior [seventh floor] IFSRA executives which, in practice, banks used to their advantage.  I believe that it also signalled a manifest lack of support for staff, undermining them in their dealings with banks.</blockquote>  <p>Can you expand on that, please, Ms Burke?</p></speech>

In terms of one of the many ... many analogies that have been put with me today, I am happy to agree with the David and Goliath analogy that you've put.

The extent to which and how you would have gone about doing that I&rsquo;d have to think imaginatively as to the wording of any particular rule or requirement but I presume ... those are fairly broad powers and it certainly allows for the scope to do something.

At the time, there was a central unit dealing with it.  My recollection is that it was brought in in the IFSRA Act - and I can't remember what the full title is - modelled on proposals from the company law review group.  There were less onerous provisions, I think, ultimately imposed in company law.  Those provisions in company law allowed it for ... allowed for a sort of a comply and explain mechanism.  They had materiality thresholds.  It was very much in terms of were the directors satisfied that they had procedures and processes.

I am paraphrasing here slightly.  My recollection is that the industry had serious issues with the way the compliance statement from the Financial Regulator was structured based on what was in the legislation and not on some theory we had developed ourselves.  And my recollection is also that the Department of Finance also had issues with it when it realised the consequences.  I think industry, at one point, questioned the constitutionality of what was being proposed and ultimately, I think, it was agreed that the whole issue would be dealt with in the context of the consolidation of legislation project, which was launched by the Department of Finance in '06.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, the former chief ... or the chief executive of Ulster Bank, in evidence to the inquiry said, "There was a sense that [the sectoral limits were] honoured more in the breach than in the observance."

It wasn't peculiar, to be clear, to property-related lending in the domestic institutions.  If you were a bank in the IFSC, you would have ... and many of them would have had issues with the financial intermediation sector and it was known that if certain banks, even when you authorised them, they were inevitably going to hit an issue with these sectoral limits.  So, you know, they were ... there were issues with them, Deputy, and that's as much as I can say.</p></speech>

You seem to be consistent in your answering this afternoon that by 2006, regardless of the number of staff and other resources that might've been available to you ... that it may have been too late at that stage.  Could you maybe indicate to us as to when would have been the optimum period to actually have made an intervention and what would have been the interventions that you would have put foremost to your mind at that time?</p></speech>

I think the time to do something would have been in the early 2000s.  You might've been able to do something up to 2005 but even then, I think, it probably would have been late in the day.  In terms of ... as a regulatory regime, leaving aside what we might have done, as country, in tax policy or promotion of building ... I think we could've probably imposed more rigorous standards in terms of lending ... but even ... and possibly LTVs, LTIs along the lines we have.  The ... we were working within a European framework that set out limits for large exposures, etc., to individuals and we were endeavouring not to be super equivalent to that.  I haven't sat down and thought through, Deputy - in terms of my recollections and ifs, buts and maybes on what might have happened over my time there ... I haven't sat down to think through, in detail, what I might have done.  I can only deal with the reality of what was there.</p></speech>

And maybe just a final question on this before I bring in the leads ... maybe if you could offer us your view on the different business models being adopted by the banks in the run-up to the crisis and also the products ... some of the products I mentioned earlier.  So, both the business model and the products that were available.</p></speech>

I can't say that I focused particularly on the products in terms of prudential regulation.  Looking at the business models of the banks, a number of them were particularly aggressive in terms of commercial property lending.  In some cases it certainly was outside of their original reason for being, I suppose, I will put it that way.  Sorry, I've lost my train of thought Deputy, can you say the question again?</p></speech>

I think some of the main retail banks aggressively pursued business looking at what competitors were doing and, by their own admission in terms of evidence here, I think they accepted that some of that lending was not entirely appropriate.  I think that some institutions should have stuck to plain, vanilla, residential lending and certainly not dabbled to the extent they did in commercial property.  But one bank in particular was seen as a property bank and that authorisation ... when it was authorised, it was recognised that it would have problems with the sectoral limits.  </p>  <p>         The fact that that was also in what other banks saw as a competitive space with them, caused problems.  I think now we would intervene more assertively in terms of the business models, in terms of whether or not we think they are viable and appropriate, but at the time we didn't do that.</p></speech>

My recollection is it was also mentioned in the CEO report, which was a report the CEO made to the authority.  In the context of those reports, the executives on the regulatory side were always given detailed briefings so that they could deal with any issues.  My understanding of the procedure for the circulation of documents from authority meetings is, and I think you'd have to refer to the authority members' handbook in that regard, is that all authority papers were circulated to two senior executives in the Central Bank.  So, assuming that procedure was followed, they would have had those papers.</p></speech>

On various, on a few occasions when people would have asked for briefing, they might give us some feedback.  I don't believe, I rarely if ever saw what one would call a minute.  You might get feedback, particularly if there was an issue they wanted you to look at again, so you would get a feel for what the discussion was, but, and certainly as the crisis moved on, and I know the bank, in terms of the bespoke pieces it prepared for the committee, has done an analysis of all the various meetings.  The sheer number of those meetings I certainly wouldn't have been aware of what was discussed at most of them.</p></speech>

I was not involved in any substantive discussions on the guarantee.  At that point we were not questioning solvency, and I would say, I suppose, as a regulator you have to work based on the information that you have, regulatory returns, accounts, etc.  You can't, based on some sort of feeling, decide that, or you know, an instinct or whatever, that somebody or some bank may or may not be solvent, that's not how it operates.  That being said, I amn't conscious that I had that particular feeling on that evening.</p></speech>

I certainly would not favour that sort of a system.  I think we ... because you'd never know the contagion effects by the free range, as you've described them yourself, and where the connections may come with industry.  I think that was probably part of the problem with securitisations etc., in the lead-up to the crisis.  I do think, however, we do, to some degree, have various levels of oversight now in terms of banks.  I wouldn't describe it as two tiers, but you do have the SSM in Frankfurt supervising the systemically important banks in each jurisdiction, and what are called the LSIs ... the less significant banks, actually, sorry, is the terminology, are supervised at a more local level, with oversight by the ECB.  And so long as Ireland is within the EU, and more particularly with the euro, that regime will continue to apply.</p></speech>

Yes, there was a guidance we had imposed on mortgage lenders that in the case of individual applications for mortgages they should stress test them for a 2% increase in interest rate, and assess whether or not the applicant was in a position to afford that.  That was implemented by the prudential department.  It is now actually housed on the consumer side, in the context of affordability, and it is built into our consumer protection code.</p></speech>

And we'll now deal with session 3 of our hearings today with Mr. Con Honan ... Horan, Central Bank of Ireland IFSRA, and the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis now resuming in public session and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  This afternoon, we will continue our hearings with witnesses from the Central Bank of Ireland Financial Regulator.  At our next session, we will hear from Mr. Con Horan, the senior official from the Central Bank of Ireland IFSRA.</p><p>Mr. Con Horan joined the Central Bank in 1979, where he held a number of roles.  In 2003, he became head of banking supervision at the Financial Regulator and was appointed as prudential director in February 2006.  Mr. Horan was appointed in February 2011 to the position of special adviser to the head of financial supervision, Matthew Elderfield.  He was since seconded to the European Banking Authority in April 2011.  Mr. Horan, you're very welcome before the committee this evening.  </p><p>Before I hear from the witness, I wish to advise Mr. Horan that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has the obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on screens here in the committee room.  </p>  <p>               For those sitting in the gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screen to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witness has been directed to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, which will be relied on in question and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So I now ask the clerk to administer the oath.</p></speech>

It provides me with the opportunity to assist the inquiry in its work into what has been the most catastrophic, financial and economic crisis in the history of the state.  The crisis has left many indelible marks, the system of oversight of the Irish banking sector clearly failed.  The lessons learned from these events, as well as those in European banking over the recent years, have and will continue to drive major changes so as to avoid a repeat of what occurred.  Commentators have implied that I personally did nothing to prevent the problems of 2008.  Nothing could be further than the truth.  Four years have passed since the report of the commission of investigation.  Accordingly I very much welcome this opportunity to have my voice heard and communicate the actions I took in seeking to avert the collapse.</p>  <p>  When the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, spoke to you in January this year, he advised that the people who took corrective action had been vilified in the media.  He was speaking about my situation.   When the commission of investigation report spoke about the lack of professional scepticism in the Financial Regulator, it also identified that there were exceptions at the level of the regulatory authority.  I believe that exception was me.  I can however assure the inquiry that this does not alleviate the sense of deep regret I feel, as a member of the senior management team in a registered authority that was not more intrusive and did not prevent the collapse of the financial system.</p>  <p>  Before going into the events leading up to the crisis, it is important to distinguish between the roles of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  Briefly, the Financial Regulator was primarily responsible for supervising the safety and soundness of individual banks and their compliance with prudential requirements.  The Central Bank on the other hand monitors stability of the overall banking system and the threats to the financial system.  The Central Bank's views of market ... of the market inform the Financial Regulator in its supervision of the banks.  The Financial Regulator in turn, contributes to the analysis of the stability of the overall system by communicating what it was observing in individual institutions.</p>  <p>  I joined the Financial Regulator in mid-2003 as head of banking supervision.  I reported to Mr. Patrick Neary, who was the prudential director.  In this role I was not a member of the senior management team and only occasionally attended meetings of the authority.  I was required to implement the strategic principles-based approach to regulation adopted by the authority prior to my appointment.  As it would be expected, I acted at all times within the structure and the approach set down by the authority.</p>  <p>  However, I believe the records demonstrate that I continually pushed the boundaries seeking to make the regulations of banks more intrusive and assertive.  During this time, I proposed interventions in the property market to address high-risk mortgages.  I proposed the imposition of formal corporate governance requirements on banks, including specific proposals to address the most difficult cases.  I advocated for the establishment of a dedicated unit of specialists to pursue administrative sanctions.  I also took on the role of head of banking supervision at a time when the international approach to the regulation of banks was undergoing the most radical change in decades.  The Basel II accord was published in 2004, it was designed by central banks and regulators from major countries in the world.  It established the key prudential ratios the banks needed to comply with and how these ratios should be calculated.  The approach containing the accord was, in effect, the continuation of the deregulation of the industry which had been happening for more than a decade.  While not fully responsible for the crisis, it provided poor incentives and moved supervision towards a greater recognition of banks' own methods for managing risk and calculating capital.  The system of regulation supervision contained in this accord has proven to be grossly deficient and I will revert to this point.  While I cannot be specific as to the dates, I believe it was around the end of 2004 or early 2005 that I grew increasingly concerned about the way property-based lending was developing in Ireland.  </p>  <p>         My concerns were supported by my research of international banking crises and in particular what had happened in Scandinavia in the 1990s.  In mid-2005, I made a written proposal to increase the bank's capital requirements on high loan-to-value mortgages.  This sought to put more capital aside in the event of a downturn and to establish a standard in the market for prudent lending.  However, the proposal was not accepted.  My understanding was that senior management in the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank had considered the matter but did not believe the action was necessary.  Macro-prudential analysis on mortgage growth conducted around this time suggested that the developments could be explained by economic fundamentals.<br/><br/>In 2006, Mr. Patrick Neary became the CEO, following the retirement of Dr. Liam O'Reilly, and I was appointed prudential director.  <i>The Irish Times</i>quoted in an article as follows: &quot;Shortly after Neary became the regulator's chief executive in 2006, Con Horan, who replaced him as prudential director, knocked on his door and warned that something had to be done to restrain property speculators as house prices reached new highs on spiralling land values and the market was awash with 100 per cent mortgage offers.&quot;  Reflecting these concerns, my first week as prudential director, I presented proposals to the authority for capital measures to address high loan-to-value lending ... mortgage lending.  This was the first time in almost a decade of an exceptional property market that the regulatory intervention was instigated.  Prior to this, moral suasion was the tool used to try to persuade banks to rein in the practices.  Therefore, the taking of direct action represented a significant change and met with internal resistance.  There was concern that such action would jeopardise the stability of the Irish financial system.  There were concerns that such intervention was inconsistent with principles-based supervision.  However, it was approved, after what Governor Honohan has described as long and agonised debate.<br/><br/>I wish to point out that I took these actions immediately on my appointment because it was imperative to signal to the banking industry that the approach of property-based lending was changing under the new senior management regime.  The speed and level of consultation in the introduction of the measures led to me being rebuked by the statutory financial services consultative industry panel.  The panel considered the lack of consultation with its members in the preparation of the measures as regrettable and retrogressive.  The chairman of the panel wrote to me reflecting those concerns.  <br/><br/>Later in 2006, I followed up these mortgage measures with the introduction of the most stringent capital requirements in Europe for speculative commercial property lending and additional requirements for buy-to-let mortgages.  There was also resistance to these measures.  Clearly the majority view at the time was that the property market was going to have a soft landing as interest rates increased.  There was fear about the message that regulatory intervention would communicate in terms of the property market in Ireland and how it might affect the competitiveness of the banking system.  It is important to point out that a public consultation undertaken on the introduction of the measures did not produce support for these regulatory actions.  The responses received to the consultation were largely critical, with the banks and their representative body expressing the belief that such action was unwarranted and raised the prospect of international investors reacting negatively to the Irish market.  It took a lot of persuasion and a number of board meetings to get agreement on these actions.<br/><br/>I would highlight that had the actions been the catalyst for a sharp correction, as many had feared, it would have raised very serious consequences.  However, I did not leave matters there.  In July 2007, revised prudential stress testing guidelines were issued to credit institutions to address loosening underwriting standards.  In effect, my first ten months as prudential director were spent pursuing this agenda of change, culminating in the most stringent regulatory regime in Europe for the key areas of property risk.  Initiating such changes met a lot of internal and external resistance and an absence of public support.  <br/><br/>The following slides demonstrate how the market slowed after the measures were introduced.  Okay, I'll be very brief on this.  The first slide deals with residential mortgage lending, and I just really tried to show the sequence of events, that in February 2006 I was appointed prudential director.  I immediately proposed the change and the new rule was introduced on 1 May 2006.  </p>  <p>         I think the committee can see that thereafter there's a very clear and consistent decrease in the level of mortgage lending.</p> <p> And if I can have the other slide please?  This relates to non-mortgage credit, and again it's from October 2005, and again just appointed prudential director February 2006; I proposed the measures in around September '06 with the capital requirements directive coming in.  The measures came into effect on the 31 December 2006, and again I think you can see in general how the mortgage market, or the non-mortgage credit, went thereafter. </p> <p> In all my research and in making my recommendations I was conscious of the views of external contrarians and used their arguments to support the positions I was putting forward.  However, I was also conscious of other views as it would have been entirely wrong and counterproductive to ignore what the domestic mainstream authorities including the ESRI and the Department of Finance were saying.  You must also remember that private sector professionals such as rating agencies, stockbrokers, investment managers and analysts were broadly supportive of the way markets were performing.  The IMF has also acknowledged that it provided few clear warnings about the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the impending crisis.  From its on-site reviews it was supportive of the approach of supervision that was being taken.  In 2006 it proposed that the prudential director should be appointed to the authority so the position would be on a par with the consumer director.  </p> <p> Other international bodies such as the OECD were also supportive of the macro-economic analysis of the domestic Irish authorities.  And the ECB, with its financial stability mandate, was not advocating macroprudential action.  It was positive towards the strength of the EU banking sector prior to the crisis.  It is of some comfort to me that the Basel II accord and the capital requirements directive which provided the foundation of the regulatory regime in Ireland have in recent years been acknowledged to be grossly deficient.  In addition to permitting grossly excessive levels of leverage, Basel II encourage pro-cyclicality, failed to provide for systemic risks and allowed banks to operate on extremely low levels of capital, resulting in buffers that were far too low prior to the collapse.  The weakness of the regime has now been identified by many authoritative sources, including parliamentary committees in other jurisdictions.  The process of correcting the deficiencies has been ongoing since 2008, but even now, seven years on, the reforms are not complete.</p> <p> To conclude, I wish to repeat that as a member of the senior management team in the Financial Regulator from 2006, I deeply regret and I'm sorry that the system of supervision did not prevent the collapse in the banking system.  I do hope the inquiry will recognise that I took risks to address key problems by introducing stricter regulations in a difficult environment of groupthink.  It was of course my duty as prudential director to do so.  While the ten years as prudential director I saw the introduction of some of the most stringent capital and liquidity rules in Europe, regrettably, however, these measures were too late and were not sufficient to reverse the excesses of the previous decade and save the financial system when the global financial crisis struck.</p> <p> Thank you for your attention members.  Can I also add one additional point if I can Chairman?  I do want to correct a point on my earlier statement ... just a brief correction on page 4 ... the third paragraph down under macro-prudential supervision.  There is a reference there to the IFSRA board, that reference ... the IFSRA should be removed it should just be the board.  It's the Central Bank board I was referring to there.</p></speech>

In your written statement you mention your proposals for regulatory intervention were put forward in 2006.  You also say that concerns at the Central Bank senior management levels about the impact, the potential impact of it.  And it also mentions the desire to temper what was perceived as the appetite for heavy intervention, that's a quote from page 4 of the statement.  Your proposal for regulatory intervention was met with significant concerns, you say, from the senior management of the Central Bank.

I did that directly up my own reporting line at the time to the prudential director, and ... who took to bring it forward and address it.  And the feedback I got at that time ... I tried to set out a fairly good argument in terms of why we should take measures at that point in time, but the feedback that I got was that the matter had been considered by senior management in the Financial Regulator, and the Central Bank, and the view was that the measures were not necessary at that time.</p></speech>

It was a normal round of stress testing, albeit with the IMF involved.  And the outcome of that process was that the belief was that in an adverse scenario, the banking system was going to still hold up strong.  I would say around the same time, obviously, Deputy, the ... I was also proposing the measures towards September '06 to increase the capital requirements on the commercial real estate lending activity.  So that was also another solvency measure that was being put in place to try to address the problems at the time.</p></speech>

In 2006, February 2006, they were accepted.  And towards the end of 2006, when the capital requirements directive was coming in we implemented another set of additional requirements on commercial real estate and ended speculative commercial real estate lending, which in effect gave us the most stringent capital regime in Europe for that type of activity.  So that was all being conducted around the time of the stress tests, but the stress tests were generally coming out in 2006 as broadly positive in terms of the capacity of the banks to deal with a downturn.</p></speech>

If I recall ... I'm not sure there was a request for additional resources in 2006, I may be wrong here, but one of the problems that was faced in 2006 was we had a huge number of vacancies in the organisation and the organisation was not capable of filling those vacancies.  So I don't think there was a request to the senior ... to the budget and remuneration committee in 2006.  There may ... there would have been one in 2007, which was a large request for, I think, over 70 staff and I think we got 25 in that particular situation.

Well, certainly, yes, Deputy, I mean, I had come, I had been head of banking supervision, so I had a particular sympathy for that department in terms of its resourcing, and was supportive of the additional staff in it.  One of the problems that was faced ... I mean, the process worked in whereby each individual department put forward their requests for resources and then that proposal was made into the budget and remuneration committee of the bank.  My recollection is that the budget and remuneration committee did not fully endorse the request from management for the additional staff, for a number of reasons.  I think they felt that the ... there could be savings gained from some of our work.  I think there was a broad belief that, from a technology perspective, we were very weak and we needed to improve in that area, to be more efficient and cost-effective.</p></speech>

It had been set up, and my understanding was left the regulation of the ... prudential regulation was a key factor in the decision to leave supervision within the Central Bank structure.  And the approach to supervision at that time was one of dialogue and interactive engagement.  It was not an enforcement driven approach.  And that approach was deemed to be suitable because there was a long record of safety within the banking system and it was also suitable to the development of the International Financial Services Centre.</p></speech>

And then you actually did implement them yourself in 2006.  I mean, was that not against a backdrop that far from being safe, this was a situation that had a culture of regulatory breach?</p></speech>

I think just to get again the sequencing right.  I think, again, I provided some documents to the inquiry.  In advance, in 2004, I was making the case that we were structuring the organisation in the wrong way in that we hadn't set up dedicated inspection units to pursue administrative sanctions.  I think that's a matter of record and I was very much in favour of setting up dedicated units at that time.  And in preparation for moving ahead I had proposed corporate governance requirements in May 2005 to be imposed as a requirement on the licence of banks to enable us to take administrative sanctions, actions, against the banks, and some of the more difficult cases I was dealing with.</p></speech>

I put it to your colleague earlier on, and I used a somewhat unfortunate football analogy, so I'll adjust it slightly for you today and say is it a case that the principles-based regulation that was being employed by yourselves at the time, when it came to prudential regulation was a bit like a football match and the FAI with no referees?</p></speech>

The institution involved appealed that but-----</p></speech>

So the level of regulatory capital they had to keep was increased which kind of reduced the buffer that they had for other activities.  And there were other things that could be done at that stage including sending in, you know, consultants to carry out work, etc., which was often very expensive and not something that the banks enjoyed.  I think in another case we reduced the level of joint venture activity they could get involved in.  So there were some measures within the structure that could be used but, as I say, that was in advance of the administrative sanctions regime which didn't come in ... I just make the point again ... I think until July 2005 and the guidelines were only issued in October 2005.  So that explains a lot of that earlier period, I think.</p></speech>

Just to clarify two issues there on Senator MacSharry's questioning to you, there was two items: there was your comment on page 4 of your witness statement about your proposals for regulatory intervention being put forward in 2006 and then later in page 6 of your statement about holding contrarian views to the groupthink on property lending and so forth.  And you elaborated to some extent on those two questions, Mr. Horan.  But maybe what I'd like you to do now is elaborate on the influence or the role of the Central Bank in terms of how they responded separately from that of the regulator's office.</p></speech>

They weren't involved before that to best to my recollection in the, kind of, early days of the domestic standing group.</p></speech>

Being absolutely frank, I've been involved in these at a European level and I've been involved in them at a domestic level.  And they are largely simulations around a small group of facts that are conducted over an afternoon or a full day with papers prepared and people able to read documents in advance of that.  So, the reality is they do ... you do learn lessons and you do pick up issues in relation to how it would happen in reality, but, in effect, having experienced crises in Ireland and in Europe in recent years, the reality is always an awful lot more complicated and different.</p></speech>

So was that in the exercise or does that reflect the reality?</p></speech>

And the Department of Finance were not involved until very late in that process.  So that was one of our lessons from that exercise.</p></speech>

There was clearly a lot of work needed to be done to gather information.

But if we can look at the scoping paper that was prepared by the Department of Finance at the end of 2007 - were you involved in the preparation of that scoping paper?  It looked at possible powers to be given to the Minister for Finance to guarantee the banks, to liquidate a bank, it talked about a possible guarantee for all liabilities in the Irish financial system.</p></speech>

I became a lot more involved in the legislation around September 2008.

We were aware that this was happening in other jurisdictions as well and it happened right across the board where interbank lending reverted to national borders and that continued for a considerable length of time afterwards.  So it was relatively consistent with what was going on, that lending began.  And people were probably more familiar anyway with some of the local operations.</p></speech>

You know, at that stage I think certainly liquidity was running short.  I think it might have been better if the ECB or someone had announced measures in terms of providing additional liquidity to the system at that stage, as they did in 2011-12.  But it's not clear to me, when you put your question, what that measure would have been around March 2008.</p></speech>

It was already looking at legislation to potentially nationalise a bank, liquidate one.  </p>  <p>               So these concerns would have been there at the time, before then we had this extraordinary event in March 2008.</p></speech>

I don't think that we went in to check that at that time, in July 2008, but it would have also been the case that around that time, rating agencies etc. were looking at the Irish institutions and, you know, in most cases, I think, affirming their ratings in terms of their strength and their capacity to ride out the problems.  So, there would have been a ... a view at that time, I think, even from international rating agencies, that the Irish banks were able to ride out the problems at the time.</p></speech>

And it was an open forum for engagement, so the Central Bank would bring information that it would pick up, say, from the ECB, we would bring information that we were picking up, the Department of Finance would bring in information.  It wasn't an effort to overrule, it was just feeding into the system of what we understood at the time.</p></speech>

I think ... the famous St. Patrick's Day massacre, I think, it was known.  So it was clear that there were institutions under significant pressure at that time and, I think, one of the contingencies that was being considered was preparing legislation in the event of it being necessary.</p></speech>

Just ... on earlier comments as well ... reports ... comments from known reports were quite agreeable that in the measure ... that the measures taken, you were talking about the measures for 2006 ... specially the measures you were talking about today, such as increased weightings and high LTVs, loans and later on speculative commercial loans ... that these may have been too little too late.  Ms Burke, in her engagement with the committee this evening, said really hat after 2006 it ... any measure or any number of staff may have not actually been possible to actually avert the crisis.  So could I put it to you or maybe ask you, Mr. Horan, that the measures taken maybe were showing the right way, but why was not more done to alert the banks more strongly and were you satisfied with the relativity moderate measures that were being taken?</p></speech>

My view was that we needed to do more than that and directly intervene with some capital measures to show we were willing to act.  That's what I proposed in 2005.  I think it would've been better if it had been introduced then.  I think it would've been even better maybe if it was introduced earlier.  But my concerns formed in early 2005-late 2004 and those concerns were based on my reading of what happened in the Scandinavian economies when ... researching that, they were saying that their growth rates were above 20% and that was indicative of problems.  In Ireland we were growing higher than 20% - 25%-30% - and that's what was causing me concern and that's why I believed we needed intervention.</p></speech>

From February 2006 onwards we began the process of intervening in the market.  So it would have been very clear and we would've communicated that to all parties.  People like the IMF supported those measures, etc., and the DSG would have known that we were proposing additional measures in September 2006.  I had made it known to the industry in May 2006, which was three months after my appointment, that we were going to look at the commercial real estate sector at that point.  So I was trying to send out a very clear signal that the process and the approach was changing.</p></speech>

We would have been actively involved with them at that time.  With the introduction of Basel, we hadn't got the resources to spend a lot of time on the stress-testing exercises, so we provided direct access to the economic people to our data so that they could extract information and then we were available to help.  Our role was less at that time in the stress-testing exercise but we were still making ourselves available to assist.</p></speech>

As part of that exercise, they did the stress testing.  They also analysed the system of supervision and they were directly involved in the process as well, so ... and they would have issued their report and commented in the financial services action plan assessment of Ireland.  So, quite frankly, I'd no reason to believe that that ... that that wasn't conducted in a diligent way because, if I recall correctly, the IMF actually said that there was a richer level of information in 2006 than there had been previously, primarily because banks were developing their own risk models under the Basel process.</p></speech>

Mr. Horan, following the legislation of 2003 in relation to the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the regulator dealt with the responsibilities of both sectors, if you will.

I think I ... it was one of the first points I tried to address in my opening statement.  I think the memorandum of understanding, if I recall correctly, the headings on it were the Central Bank had responsibility for financial stability.  And the Financial Regulator heading is the Financial Regulator's contribution to financial stability.  So the Central Bank was in lead on financial stability issues, and the Financial Regulator fed into that via the information it had from individual institutions.</p></speech>

I ... Certainly, again, I go from the memorandum of understanding and my practices in there.  I think the headings in the memorandum of understanding are very clear.  One is responsible for the financial stability and one is responsible for contributing to it, so I think that it is clear.  I would add, for instance, that the financial stability department was located within the Central Bank; it wasn't within the Financial Regulator.  And I think that's pretty indicative of where the primary responsibility lay.</p></speech>

Do you believe that there were effective instruments available to deal with excessive credit growth and sector risk concentration?</p></speech>

I'm not saying it was entirely responsible for it.  There were also interest rates, etc., that were effective at the time but if you look at mortgages, for instance, the speed of decline on the Irish growth rates was quicker than any European country after we introduced the measures.  In relation to sectoral concentrations, clearly they would have been beneficial, but I think, again, I'd make the point that at a European level, issues like central ... sectoral concentrations were not part of the Basel process.  While the Basel process did have specific limits on individual exposures, it didn't have anything on the sectoral front.</p></speech>

So we'd gone through our internal processes internally, and we went to consultation and received back in the responses.  And, certainly, the representative body of the banks believed very strongly that the measures were unwarranted, that they risked bringing negative attention to Ireland and jeopardising the property market.  </p>  <p>         And that view was also reflected in the comments of the individual banks, so they were clearly not happy because we were at least 50% more than most other jurisdictions, all other jurisdictions, and, in many cases, the level of capital being demanded in Ireland was three times the European level.</p></speech>

What you say that banks were woefully under capitalised and what would they need to do to bring themselves up to the capitalisation of Google, say, for example?</p></speech>

And I think this is one of the key problems that we faced was that simply the Basel accord completely underestimated the amount of capital that banks needed to have.  If you compare 2007 with now, banks are holding probably in the region, to use his numbers, seven times more capital than they were at that time.  If you can imagine the Irish banking system in 2007 or 2008 having seven times more capital at that point than it did, then the situation was obviously entirely different.  So that's, that's the scale of the weaknesses in the Basel process from my perspective.</p></speech>

Mr. Horan, on page 11 of your statement you say from a supervisory perspective these two issues are considered to be very closely related as liquidity issues in banks can quickly give rise to solvency problems and <i>vice versa</i>.  I mean, in the context of this, every time we raise the word &quot;solvency&quot;, everybody runs off into the distance, but when we talk about liquidity, we're all fine.  So, you're putting them right beside each other there.  So can you just tell us whether or not in those conversations about liquidity at the time, was solvency also being discussed?  Or were you alone in this consideration?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1658" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Con Horan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#SSS00900"><p>No, no, I mean, I think the issues of solvency and liquidity are very closely related in banking.  If a bank has not got sufficient, to put it at its most simple, cash to do its day-to-day business, the assets it hold will, you know, will not be sufficient to enable it and it may have to dispose of assets, etc., impacting on its solvency.  Equally, if a bank has not got enough capital and enough solvency, then the markets won't lend it liquidity on a day.  So the two things are very closely related.  A bank that runs out of liquidity will probably fail; a bank that has not got enough capital will probably struggle to get liquidity from the market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#SSS01000"><p>So at the time as it closed in through July, August, September and it was clear that there were serious liquidity issues with many of the banks, and some more acutely than others, is it fair to ask then whether discussions that were being had with all levels, among all different groups of people, yourself included, I'm sure, were also considering the solvency of those institutions and whether they were ... that was at stake?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1660" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Con Horan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052700002#SSS01100"><p>Yes. Again just to be clear, I'd say the dominant issue at the time was the liquidity issue.  We had literally had the crisis from August '07 and there was a struggle almost on a daily basis to make sure the banks had sufficient liquidity and they were putting in place the proper measures.  That was definitely the dominant discussion.  But equally important in that discussion was, you know, their audited accounts, etc., coming out, their own views, you know, of the ... their management statements, etc., were they sufficiently capitalised?  And at that ... certainly '07, etc., I don't think there was any problems being mentioned at that time.  All their rating agencies were holding them up very strongly in terms of their capital and their international ratings.</p></speech>

I mean, does the length and depth of a crisis of that kind not escalate the fear of insolvency?  I mean a liquidity crisis of a week you might say, "yes, yes that's fine", but this is a year?</p></speech>

I mean, I think that's a fair comment, I mean ... as the Chairman pointed out, even in March 2008, you know, contingency planning was going on in case a bank ran into a solvency problem.  So, you know, clearly ... I think the macroeconomic view that I was getting at that time was that the Irish economy was still relatively robust, commercial property sector was still holding up, vacancy rates, etc., were still good so there wasn't huge concern ... sorry, there was concern, but there was also belief that the overall economic situation was still enough that we weren't seeing solvency problems.</p></speech>

Personally, I didn't subscribe to that; I believed it was appropriate that we would intervene, and I think one of the important things I tried to achieve in 2006 was to establish the principle, very early in my term as prudential director, that intervening in the market didn't necessarily mean we were going to have horrendous problems.  And I think that was one of the benefits of the intervention in early 2006.</p></speech>

Can I ask you, Mr. Horan, in relation to a discussion we were having at this committee with another witness in relation to a letter that you signed in March 2008, to a financial institution, which talked about ... an institution having no access to ECB monetary operations, not having access to wholesale markets for funding in recent months, and were relying on retail and corporate deposits initiatives for liquidity?  </p>  <p>               This was in, as I said, 2008.  Would that not be a very serious issue if there was ... if it was an institution obviously ... there was, given your letter, of that nature, and what was the response by the office at that time?</p></speech>

I don't think I've seen the letter in my pack.  I may have missed it, but I don't think it's in my pack.  But, I mean, I can maybe imagine who the institution, or one of two institutions that it would have been.  I mean, clearly that would have been a concern about access to liquidity but that was not unique to one institution.  I mean, the markets in March 2008 had gone very, very bad.  There was severe shortages and concern at that stage right across the board.  So, you know, I talked about the St. Patrick's Day massacre, that was a really difficult time, and markets were going extremely frightened at that point.</p></speech>

So the fact that somebody was out of that at that point in time, I can't recall the specific, but would have certainly added to the problems.</p></speech>

Mr. Horan, I want to refer to the core document booklet, Vol. 2, page 134.  It's a short reference anyway, but the document references the fact that towards the end of 2007, Irish banks had already lost between 30% and 50% of their value since the start of the year and that this was due to the exposure of Irish banks to the Irish property market.  Would you agree or disagree with this analysis at the time that the banks' exposure to property and the knowledge within the investor circle was having a negative effect on the share price?</p></speech>

I mean, I think there were a number, there would be a number of drivers to that point in time, such as the liquidity strains, the size of the Irish banks etc., they weren't able to compete in the same way as major globally systemically important banks would.  So being a small jurisdiction with small banks would also have played on the pressures, but I'm not taking from your point in terms of the property market; it was the issue that was relevant and would have been commented on at the time.</p></speech>

I wouldn't agree with that.  I wouldn't fully agree with that.  I mean, I think it's fair to say that right across the board at that stage, internationally, banking share prices were under huge pressure.  I mean, we'd already had the ECB intervention on 9 August, and they were not ... that was not related to Irish banks, that was related to the banks in another jurisdiction who run into liquidity problems.  So, you know, there was a lot of problems across the market.  This was the feature of the Irish market.  There were different features in other markets in terms of exposure to US securitisations etc.  Clearly the US banks were in serious trouble at that stage as well.

And not to suggest that there was any unethical behaviour, but the comments that are in the public domain, and not to kill the golden goose of the guarantee.

You know, the adverse scenarios that developed in no way reflected the events that occurred in 2008.  And quite frankly, if you had put those scenarios out in 2006 nobody would believe them.  I mean, we have to recall that this was the period that the economists had coined as the great moderation.  This was a period of stable interest rates, stable inflation, stable banking that had been going on for a decade.  What actually happened in 2008 was simply not on the radar screen.  If you had tested for that, the scenario that occurred if you had tested for it, I suspect would have shown failures of the banks, but I just think the scenario was not contemplated.</p></speech>

So there was the general guidance coming from the authority at that stage was ... literally the administrative sanctions was coming on stream, and taking over a year to get developed and develop the systems.  What each department was asked to do at that stage was to go through all the legislation that applied to their particular area and try and rank the issues in terms of actions where sanctions might be contemplated.  But at that point, as I said earlier I think, was that the decision of the authority at that stage was we would focus on the consumer issues.  The chief executive would prepare a plan as to how eventually things would be rolled out, but the prudential was not given the same prominence at that point.</p></speech>

I want to turn to your statement on the issue of corporate governance and proposals that you made in 2005, and I want to quote directly again, and you referenced it I think in some of the previous answers that you've given.  You state:</p><blockquote>In May 2005, I propose to the Authority a corporate governance regime for banks and building societies.  This proposal was to impose a formal condition on the licences of all credit institutions, thereby laying a strong foundation for the taking of enforcement actions under the administrative sanction regime that was being developed at the time.  </blockquote>  <p>If you could briefly maybe elaborate a little bit more on that particular proposal, and also elaborate as to why you believe that it didn't come to fruition?</p></speech>

I mean the origin of the proposal was ... well, one, I thought it was the proper thing to do in terms of the principles-based approach to regulation, corporate governance was at the core of what we needed to do.  </p>  <p>         And there was no real articulation of what the best practices were and I thought it was appropriate to put in a floor or a standard of corporate governance.  I think the second point ... the second driver for me was that there were significant challenges with particular institutions in terms of their corporate governance and I wanted to put in measures that would enable administrative sanctions to be taken in the future against those particular ... circumstances.  It was around May 2005,  I made the proposal and administrative sanctions were literally coming on stream very soon after that.  I did go the authority, I think, on two occasions that year with this particular paper.  There was consultations with the industry in between but I think I've set out there my understanding of the ... the view was that the markets ... the institutions were overburdened with regulatory burden at that stage.  The financial services action plan had just been going on a for a long time ... we had come out ... statements had been made that we weren't going to overburden the industry with additional rules at that point in time and it was just seen as a step too far, I think, is my opinion as to why it wasn't accepted. </p></speech>

I mean, the IMF was, you know, it's a hugely influential organisation in the context of supervision and the approach that's been taken.  And, being honest with you, I, you know, I took great comfort from the fact that they had seen significant improvements in 2006 in the regulatory regime and the fact that they were recommending that the prudential director would be put on the board of the authority.  I think ... so that was important and clearly the OECD's views on the market were also vitally important and influenced a lot of people.</p></speech>

There may be a view that the approach of principles-based regulation arose from the new structure in 2003 but you state in your opening statement "The core strategy of IFSRA was a 'principles-based' approach.  It was a continuation of the approach to supervision, previously adopted by the Central Bank."  So, can you clarify, in your view, since when - in Ireland - was there a principles-based approach to regulation of banks?</p></speech>

I mean ... when I became ... just to briefly recap again, I clearly made my proposals in 2005 for the increase in capital when I was head of banking supervision.  I hadn't got it through.  When I became prudential director, I spoke to the chief executive to say that this was the issue that I felt was the biggest risk we were facing in banking supervision and I really felt that we needed to do something to intervene into the market at that point in time because I ... I'd looked at other international cases and that was the driving force behind my desire to commence action immediately.  And I spoke to him because I would have needed his support.</p></speech>

The immediate issue that we needed to deal with I felt was the residential ... the high loan-to-value ratio loan, but in the paper I put forward in February 2006, I also signalled to the authority at that stage that we were going to look at the commercial property sector as well.</p></speech>

I mean, I think that at the end of 2004, I would have been arguing for the establishment of specialist units to pursue administrative sanctions.  I didn't believe at the time the way we were structured was correct.  I didn't believe it was really feasible for accountants and people who were trying to understand the Basel process to also convert themselves into people who could take sanctions cases maybe up as far as the High Court.  I believe that was a specialist area and I argued for that in writing and I think that's one of the areas that we maybe looking back ... I think when the new regulator, when the new environment was established, we have now two enforcement departments and I think that's probably the right way of approaching that-----</p></speech>

I mean, the answer is "No".  It was a transitional period.  Obviously '04, the Basel Accord was published.  </p>  <p>         It moved a lot more flexibility to the banks in terms of how they did things rather than to the supervisory authorities.  That was the forerunner to the capital requirements directive which began to be put in place then.  I think ... I don't think anyone will doubt that that was not a robust system and I think the fact that I made there - that seven years on we're still correcting those errors in the regulatory regime and trying to improve and strengthen it, is testament to how poor it was at the time.</p></speech>

So we lost a lot of the staff and, I think, what I identified in 2004 was that the key risk that we had was developing expertise in basic supervision and we put a lot of effort, etc., into training and getting staff up and running.

You know, I know that our head of Basel left just before the accord because it was ... you know, there was better opportunities in ... in the sector.  So that was a constant problem of retaining the skills and being ... being honest with you, even now I'd say, looking back, we probably needed some additional skills that we hadn't got at that time that we didn't really think about.  We were kind of prudentially focused in terms of the Basel accord but I think regulators are better ... better ... more efficient now with the credit experts and market experts and treasury experts - the people who've actually traded in the markets.  So, I would say, yes, the construction and the ... the way you would set up a department now would be different, I think, to 2003 and '4.</p></speech>

The decrease in value of Irish bank shares has been greater than in other countries.

My own perspective at the time would have been it was largely liquidity-driven but as I mentioned earlier on, liquidity and solvency are two fairly closely related issues.  So to the extent that the international market was extremely nervous at the time and was wondering where it would invest its money, clearly one of the issues of concern to them would have been ... sorry, the major issue of concern to them would have been property, the Irish banks' exposure to property.</p></speech>

I suppose what I am saying is the liquidity crisis, this is almost a year, it is ten months before the guarantee.  The liquidity crisis, while there was contingency planning for events, this was the November 7th report from a major player in the international markets stating quite clearly a negative perspective on the Irish banking sector because of property exposures, almost a year before it, before the guarantee.  Which was the bigger issue?  There was liquidity for other institutions at this stage.  What I am trying to ask is, had the international brokers decided that the Irish banks were in trouble at this stage, as early as this and as a result of the losses, 30% to 50% of their share value in ten, 11-month period?  Did one lead to the other?</p></speech>

November 2007 was a very difficult time in terms of ... they may have been rolling over liquidity but it would have been extremely short term, so that was a very difficult liquidity period in the run up to the year end.  I won't, I can't overstate that.  That was a huge issue.</p></speech>

Additionally, on top of that what was the big issue they were looking at in the Irish institutions was they were exposed to the property market so I'm not taking from your ... that was the issue that was added on top of that to cause the concern and walk away and sell shares.</p></speech>

And I'll go on to a question in regard to the auditors later, but I think this kind of is an auditing related question anyway.  Were there clear guidelines about the different sector definitions issued by the banking supervisors and, for instance, in property; everything seemed to be in the property basket, whether it was a buy-to-let, a mortgage for oneself, a residential mortgage, or somebody was developing a big shopping centre?</p></speech>

I mean, it was categorised under "Property" depending on, you know ... that was the allocation, so people were put into buckets at that stage.  The reality was, underneath that, then there were all sorts of different risk exposures and I'll go back to my earlier comment about what was the common predominant risk factor.  A property in, I think, Sligo was the example I used, versus one in London, are not subject to the same common ... at least they wouldn't have been pre-crisis, common predominant risk factor.  So it did require an analysis of the book to see where the exposures were at that time.</p></speech>

I think it would have been extremely difficult to have a clear definition around that.

Predefining that I think would have been difficult without banks being able to ... and I think Governor Honohan has acknowledged this in his report, that this sort of structure was too easily evaded and, quite frankly, if you did it, it would have impacted significantly on the IFSC, etc.  As I say, internationally I don't believe anybody has that structure currently.</p></speech>

It was vitally important to the management of the crisis and was, therefore, subject to ongoing consideration within the CBFSAI.  The various audits and other forms of analysis undertaken at that time were suggesting that the banks were meeting their solvency obligations.</blockquote>  <p>So, in that regard we had auditors in here last ... they didn't pick up the crisis that was coming down the tracks.  In fact, all the banks that they were auditing each and every one of them were on record as saying that it came as a huge surprise to them.  None of them saw it.</p></speech>

Rating agencies right up to mid 2008 were commenting on, going back to your earlier point, that the banks were reasonably well diversified to be able to handle the problems.</p></speech>

And when you have massive withdrawals of liquidity out of the entire global banking sector, all asset values dropped far more significantly than you could ever have imagined before.</p></speech>

I'm aware of the rating agencies and all the rest of it.  But kind of in analogist terms, they're living down the road.  You were in the house.  You weren't living next door, you were meeting with these institutions.  You were engaging with them on a day-to-day basis.  You weren't abstractly removed or you weren't kind of taking a macro overview from a distance.  You know that somebody up the road everything looks okay because there's a reasonably new car outside the door, the children are going out to school every morning.

But let me just put some perspective on that, you know.  The directors of the individual banks where primary responsibility lay, were even closer to those institutions.  The risk managers in those institutions with you know large staffs etc., the internal audit functions, they didn't see those problems coming ... or certainly they didn't come to us to identify that there were problems.  So those who are actually ... yes, we had a perspective and we saw what was going on across the board, but that perspective is always going to rely, to some extent, on the institutions and the control systems that they have.  Its always going to rely, to some extent, on the audits and what's being produced from there.  And I can only go on those facts as presented to me and the facts at that stage, together with the macro-economic analysis, was that it wasn't as significant as it clearly turned out to be.</p></speech>

Okay.  And just on the second last paragraph on that page, it says, "On a blanket guarantee for all banks - ML felt could be a mistake and hit national rating and allow poorer banks to continue."

I think ... my recollection - and it's a long time ago at a very difficult time - is that that was their initial reaction.

I ... I'm ... being honest with you, I cannot actually remember the meetings themselves, so what happened ... I remember there was a meeting in the NTMA the following morning, that Merrill Lynch came in and gave their views, if I recall correctly, on what they'd seen in individual banks.  </p>  <p>         So there was an elaboration on the work they were doing but, to the best of my knowledge, we didn't get into specifics on guarantees and things like that. </p></speech>

So, you don't participate in the follow-up meetings on a Monday and a Monday evening in terms of being in the room, as you were then, so have you briefed Mr. Neary in the interim as to what is happening?  And do you ... did you brief him with the recommendation?</p></speech>

These were clearly important meetings at the time.  My role would have been to participate in them, because I had knowledge of the banks, and then report in to the principals in terms of what was being discussed.</p></speech>

So there was a whole set of liquidity requirements came into effect, I think it was 1 July 2007.  When I read this, my view was that this was teething issues with the reporting system around that at the time.  It was a new set of regulations and this was ... problems with the reporting to the regulator at that time.</p></speech>

And we were just advising them at that stage was that the liquidity requirements were statutory requirements that had been imposed as a condition of their licence.  So it doesn't read to me that it was indicative of stresses in that bank's book at that time.</p></speech>

In your opinion, what steps could have been taken to avert a crisis, and what would it have been, and at what time would you have made those interventions?</p></speech>

My view, looking back on it now, is that from the early ... from the mid-1990s right up to 2001, 2002, the market was very active at that stage, the lending was very high, and that continued obviously into 2003 to 2006.  My view is probably at that stage, at the earlier stages, before the system became dependent, almost, on the property market, that the interventions, maybe regulatory interventions, from an earlier stage would have curtailed it, and we should have had some targets in our mind as to what was acceptable levels of growth right throughout the period.  So, I think it was a ten-year property bubble, and I think it's ... we left it too late in terms of the intervention.</p></speech>

Accompanying me today is Mr. Brendan Flood, head of international sales and partnering, Mr. Conor Fahy, and Mr. David Byrne, both also of that division.  Our chief executive, Ms Julie Sinnamon, unfortunately is unavailable to attend as she is on a trade mission to South Africa.  She asked me to convey her apologies to the committee.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s vision is that Irish enterprise will be a powerhouse of economic growth and job creation.  Enterprise Ireland works with manufacturing and internationally traded services companies across the country.  Our supports are tailored to reflect companies&rsquo; stages of development from early-stage entrepreneurs and start-ups to middle-sized companies, ensuring they can access the appropriate supports to help them to create and build their businesses and, most importantly, sustain jobs.  In January, Enterprise Ireland reported that its client companies had created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  These companies continue to see year-on-year jobs growth.  This employment growth demonstrates the real impact that the increase in exports has had on jobs in Ireland.  Enterprise-Ireland-supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.</p> <p>  Looking at the overall contribution to the economy, Enterprise Ireland clients support more than 300,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, which represents approximately 16% of the total workforce.  In terms of scale and economic impact, those client companies spend in excess of &euro;22.8 billion annually in the economy.  In 2014, total exports from these companies exceeded &euro;18.6 billion, more than at any time in the history of the State.  This covered a wide range of sectors including food, construction, internationally traded services and life sciences, with a growth rate last year of 9.9%.</p> <p>  Priority markets continue to be the UK, the US and Europe.  While those core markets account for the majority of our clients&rsquo; exports - 69% - high-growth markets such as Asia-Pacific and the Gulf countries, as well as South Africa, Russia and Brazil, will be an increasing source of future exports.  It is Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition that these markets will account for over &euro;3 billion by 2016, a 50% increase on the export figures for 2013.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland clients saw exports to ASEAN markets grow by 17% last year, reaching &euro;296 million.  Singapore and Malaysia are the two most important markets in the region.  Supporting this impressive export growth in 2014, Enterprise Ireland assisted clients secured more than 1,300 new customers and significant contracts.  We also brought 907 international buyers into Ireland to encourage them to source from Irish companies.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s international office network is a vital resource for our clients.  Our network of 33 international offices helps our clients win business.  In August 2013, the Government approved our recruitment of 20 additional staff in high-growth markets.  We have added nine additional staff to the Asia-Pacific region since 2013, including an additional two full-time staff members supporting ASEAN markets from our Singapore office.  These overseas offices provide a range of services, from helping clients gain market knowledge to identifying how to win business and secure customers.  Enterprise Ireland has eight offices in the Asia-Pacific region with 36 full-time staff, six of whom are in our office in Singapore.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland deploys what we call a hub-spoke and pathfinder network.  We have central offices and also support pathfinders, which are effectively specialist trade consultants, and there are 14 of them based in ASEAN markets.  Our dedicated high-growth markets team, based in Dublin and managed by my colleague Mr. David Byrne, which works in conjunction with our offices in the marketplace, helping local companies in Ireland to prepare for those markets.  While over 90% of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities are one-to-one company work, we have taken wider initiatives over the past year.  More than 1,000 client companies took part in 18 Minister-led trade missions in 2014, with a further 67 international events in major target markets in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.  This week, in addition to a trade mission to South Africa led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, there is a trade mission to the US, led by the Minister for Education and Skills, and an event in the aerospace area.</p><p>It did a specific joint trade mission with UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment and Invest NI at the beginning of 2014 to the ASEAN region, to Singapore.  It was the first such mission of its type.  It is very important to say that Enterprise Ireland also has very strong working relationships with other Departments and agencies.  Without them we would not be able to do our job overseas.  We are, in fact, co-located with embassies and consulates or with other agencies wherever possible.  As I have mentioned, in the case of the Asia-Pacific region, we have eight offices, six of which are co-located with an embassy or consulate.</p><p> Finally, I would like to convey that Enterprise Ireland is wholly focused on supporting and servicing the needs of our clients.  We have ambitious targets which are yielding results and delivering and sustaining jobs here in Ireland.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and would be delighted to take any questions.</p></speech>

It may not be a directly relevant question but I will ask in any case.  In his briefing to us, Mr. Lidington seemed to imply that Britain was being to some degree strangled by regulations and Commission and treaty obligations from Europe and that it needed to break free and get out of some of the treaties.  Britain is fearful that it cannot compete with the evolution of world blocs and powers.  The ASEAN countries have a market of 960 million where we have 500 million in Europe.  Mr. Lidington seemed to argue that Britain needs greater freedom and flexibility to go into this market and expand.  Does Mr. Sherry think there is any analysis that would back that up?  Is Europe lagging behind because its regulations are so cumbersome they are strangling a country like Britain?  Is the ASEAN market going to surpass the economic might and power of Europe?  This may be a political question but if Mr. Sherry has any observations I would be delighted to hear them.</p></speech>

I am going to bank the question and we will take a number together.  I call Senator Jim Walsh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1982" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#C00400"><p>I welcome the delegation.  Our job is to probe to see, in measured terms, what the effect of its work is.  I thank Mr. Sherry for his submission.  It is light on targets, I think, so I would like to concentrate on that area.</p> <p>  Indigenous industry is something we have talked about for some considerable time.  I note that Mr. Sherry says there are 300,000 jobs among client companies of Enterprise Ireland in this sector.  Would Enterprise Ireland have all indigenous companies under its remit or only those with an export focus?  Mr. Sherry mentioned that this figure represents approximately 16% of the total workforce.  In recent years, economic commentators would have said that indigenous industry is where the growth in employment must come from.  That seems a small percentage.  Would Mr. Sherry have a comparison with ten years ago?  What targets does Enterprise Ireland have for that sector in job numbers and percentage terms?</p> <p>  With regard to the ASEAN countries, Enterprise Ireland has eight offices and 36 staff, six of which are in Singapore.  As Deputy Byrne said, it is a huge marketplace, and that seems a very small number of staff and offices.  I know resources are an issue in everything we do, but ideally, to be really effective, what does Mr. Sherry think that figure needs to become?</p> <p>  What targets has Enterprise Ireland set for each of those ASEAN countries for growth in exports by indigenous companies here?  Mr. Sherry has mentioned some sectors.  Are there others in which we are not involved and which we should be trying to develop to enhance the export sector and contribute positively to job creation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1983" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#C00500"><p>I have to leave in about 20 minutes but hopefully I will be able to hear the answers before then.  I noted that Mr. Sherry mentioned 16% of the total workforce here in Ireland.  Although we know employment is increasing, there are concerns that this increase is not happening at the sort of wages or salaries that allow people to live with dignity.  We have had a lot of debate about zero-hour contracts etc.  My first question, therefore, concerns that 16%.</p> <p>  My second question is about the overseas markets.  Recently, I chaired the launch of a report Tr&oacute;caire had commissioned, Where aid meets trade.  We have had various debates about "aid for trade", discussion of which seems to be gathering momentum.  If aid is going into a developing country, situations can arise where there has to be a corresponding pay-off for the donor country.  There are serious concerns around human rights, due diligence and tax issues.  I had questions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last week, and he certainly seemed supportive that our trade missions would have to involve ethical engagement.</p> <p>  Irish companies going into other countries should be aware of the labour laws and social laws in those countries.  Not one Irish company has been convicted of corruption, even though there have been cases, yet they could be charged in this country because of legislation we have.  Such matters particularly concern women in the developing world.  We know they are the worst off when it comes to working conditions.  There are also serious concerns around Qatar and what is happening there.  There are frightening statistics of the number of workers who may suffer injuries and fatalities before a ball is kicked in the World Cup and there are Irish companies working there.  I know the Chairman was there recently and I was asking him whether he had addressed these issues.  He said there was some open and frank discussion.</p> <p>  Are there any concerns about the ongoing discussions regarding the transatlantic trade and investment partnership?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1984" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#C00600"><p>I welcome the work Enterprise Ireland is doing to increase exports from Ireland and to create jobs and commercial investment.  I note that Enterprise Ireland client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014, but the net new job figures were half of this, at 8,476.  This is the highest net gain in the history of the agency.  Enterprise Ireland's end-of-year statement notes that its supported companies now directly and indirectly account for 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy.  As the previous speaker said, this is 16% of the total workforce.  The total direct employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies, full and part-time, stood at 18,072 at the end of 2014.</p> <p>  To contextualise the new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland, there are currently 349,500 people on the live register.  This brings us back to the question from earlier about the targets for the next five years.</p><p>What are the agency's specific targets in this area for the next five years?  The highest increase in sales and exports in the past ten years was recorded in 2014.<br/><br/>The number of net new jobs created is small when we consider the big picture.  It works out at just over 2%.  We need ambitious targets where significant increases in sales and exports deliver significant new job increases. <br/><br/>An issue of concern, which was not mentioned by the previous speakers but which has been raised on numerous occasions, is the regional imbalance in job creation.  Has the agency specific plans to tackle that?  The Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2015 refers to funding of &euro;100 million to support and encourage regional stakeholders.  It would be good to know what the job creation target is to match that additional funding by Government for 2015.  It would be helpful if Mr. Sherry could shed light on that for the committee. <b></b><br/><br/>Some of the ASEAN, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, countries have questionable human and workers' rights legislation in place.  They are wide open to abuse.  Some of us were at the meeting with Ban Ki-moon and he spoke about some of the difficulties in some of the countries.  How does the agency ensure that Irish trade with these countries is focused on enhancing human rights protections?  It is a very delicate area.  Is it partially based on fair trade provisions?  Are there any obligations on companies to export and invest responsibly?  That was one of the questions we asked the representatives of IDA Ireland when they appeared before the committee recently.  <br/><br/>We have a weakness in our language skills.  Many of our young people do not speak a foreign language and that is the position for a variety of reasons.  English is widely spoken in many ASEAN countries.  Are there supports available to improve language skills?  What is the agency's relationship with the Department of Education and Skills?  Does it make recommendations, particularly with respect to the universities, on a regular basis?  Concern was expressed that some of the courses provided in one of the universities related to language supports and supports in the area of cultural norms would be closed.  Is Mr. Sherry aware of that?  How does the agency feed into that system?</p></speech>

I compliment them on the work Enterprise Ireland is doing and on its level of job creation.  We are all anxious that job creation would be spread throughout the regions and I say that as someone who comes from a town in the west that has suffered greatly from unemployment during the past decade.  We wish the agency success and we would be anxious to see it expand, grow jobs throughout the regions and continue the good work it is doing with companies in finding new markets.</p> <p>  I have a few brief questions.  Mr. Sherry indicated that in 2014, 1,000 companies partook in 18 ministerial led missions.  What are the agency's plans for 2015 in terms of the level of ministerial missions and the number of companies that will be involved?</p> <p>  What are the greatest challenges companies face in doing business in the ASEAN region?  Previous speakers referred to human rights and workers' rights.  Given that in many instances the agency is colocated with the embassies and consulates, what is the level of engagement on and how high on its agenda is the area of human rights in terms of doing business with companies and encouraging business with organisations that might not have a good human rights track record?</p></speech>

Mr. Sherry pointed to the growth potential in that region.  Is it intended to increase the number of offices and operate something like what Ireland House has done in other jurisdictions?  What has been the effect of closing the office in Malaysia?  Has that featured in the agency's assessment of its impact in that area at present?  How does Enterprise Ireland engage with the new embassies in Thailand and Indonesia, which are also huge growth areas?  Has the agency assessed the potential for maximising the opportunities for Irish industry in that area?</p> <p>  The Irish Exporters Association said that there is scope for better leverage of resources of the local Irish chambers of commerce to grow Ireland's trading relationship in that region.  Does the agency see itself linking directly with the chambers of commerce here and in the region with a view to maximising the advantage from Ireland's point of view?</p> <p>  The potential for the education sector in this area has come up in submissions made to this committee previously.  I raise the issue of the potential for the education sector in this area and the extent to which Mr. Sherry sees the potential for the  sale of our educational facilities abroad, thereby creating two opportunities, one in enhancing the reputation of our education sector and the other in establishing vital contacts and links with trade and business interests in the ASEAN region.</p> <p>  Other members referred to the growth potential and I also want to emphasise that.  How does the agency propose to address the challenges of the diverse cultures, which was mentioned by previous speakers?  I refer to languages, religious backgrounds and so on, all of which need to be assessed in the context of the degree to which we can benefit from accessing those markets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1990" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Sherry" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#D00600"><p>I will cover some of the issues and I will call on some of my colleagues to address the other issues.  I will start by responding to the question raised by Deputy Eric Byrne on the ease of doing business and business regulations.  First, I would say that Ireland ranks very highly on the table of ease of doing business.  In terms of Ireland as a location from which to operate, it is a very attractive location.  It is one of the compelling factors that the IDA would promote overseas in terms of multinational companies locating here and likewise it is one that Enterprise Ireland would promote because we have responsibility for foreign direct investment into the country in the food area.</p> <p>  In terms of doing business with companies in the Asia-Pacific region and the ASEAN region, it is quite a diverse region.  If we compare two locations such as Singapore and Indonesia, they are very different.  The ease of doing business in Singapore and the ease at which companies can operate there ranks very highly.  However, in the likes of Indonesia it is a quite a different situation.  The ease for companies to do business both within the country and for Irish exporters seeking to export to that country would be very different.  In many cases when we  talk to Irish companies about trading with other countries it is not so much a question of any barriers associated with regulations within Ireland, it is the accessibility of the countries they are trying to target to sell their goods or services.  Within Ireland the ease with which companies can do business is important.</p><p>The importance of low regulation - I do not mean ineffective regulation but in terms of ease of doing business in the country - is very important because they are operating on the international stage and competing with global players.  The fact that the Irish companies have been competing and winning and we have seen the results on the export side across multiple markets is evidence that at the moment Ireland is an effective location for doing business and we need that to continue.</p><p> In response to Senator Walsh, on the export side, Enterprise Ireland as an organisation produces and publishes a three-year plan where we set out our targets very clearly.  There are employment and export targets.  In our most recent plan, completed in 2013, we exceeded all of the targets.  Our plan is to exceed our targets in the current 2014-16 business plan.  We got off to a strong start in 2014 with exports increasing by 9.9% and employment substantially above the initial target set. </p><p> In exports to high growth markets, companies are starting from a lower base but as a result we have put more resources into those markets and have set a higher target, to increase from a little over &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion within that three-year period.  It is an ambitious target but we believe we can achieve it.  It is one of the reasons why we have put proportionately increased resources into those markets and why we had extensive discussions with Government about the need to deploy more resources in those markets because it does require more feet on the ground.  We work company by company and going into those markets we focus on specific sectors, which we believe provide accessible opportunities to Irish companies and where we believe those companies have the capability and the resilience to go after them.  It is noticeable that in the ASEAN and Asia-Pacific region a longer-term commitment is required to secure and win business than in many other markets.  In respect of the culture of that market it is necessary to develop long-term relationships and that means companies putting feet on the ground in those markets.  As a prelude to companies&rsquo; winning business in those markets they must commit and put boots on the ground.  There are 171 Irish companies present in the ASEAN region.  It is more like a marathon than a spring winning business in those markets.</p><p> I was asked about the number of staff and offices.  We cannot have substantial resources in every market, we do not have the resources for that.  We need to be flexible.  We need people to be able to move resources as clients demand.  We have our own resources and we leverage off other resources.  I mentioned pathfinders, which are trade consultants in different markets.  These are people we have identified who have specific expertise in a particular sector, for example, telecommunications and we would link companies we operate and support in that sector with this individual and work across markets.</p><p> Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan asked about the workforce, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Byrne to expand on my answer.  In terms of salary levels in Enterprise Ireland clients, in addition to exports an important factor for us is the spend within Ireland and the amount of money Irish companies spend on wages and on goods and services in Ireland.  They need to be competitive and are constantly focused on that.  For us as an organisation, we have increasingly focused on competitiveness and lean practices.  We do substantial work with hundreds of companies in helping them improve their productivity and competitiveness.  That is a very important factor in ensuring that companies have operations that are efficient but can and do pay wages appropriate to the country in which we operate.  Ireland is not a low-cost economy and never will be.  The type of business we assist companies in supporting is to try to develop companies that have strong intellectual property, are investing in research and development, have strong operations and have resources and capabilities in Ireland that are not based solely on cost but on other competitive factors. </p><p> The Deputy also asked about corruption and ethical issues.  Enterprise Ireland focuses on  business.  We work very closely with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We are co-located with them in most locations.  We work closely with our clients in identifying potential customers and assessing their bona fides and the way they operate.  We also, as part of our supports for companies, have what we call a net international programme or excel at selling programme, one module of which is focused on developing capability within companies on cultural understanding of how to operate in business.  Irish companies operating in international markets have their own reputation to protect.  Companies operating perhaps in the Asia region and the Gulf region also do business in the US and Europe and they would be acutely aware that if they do not pursue appropriate business practices and adhere to proper procedures their reputation will be at risk in other locations.  There is a fundamental, compelling business argument for those companies to ensure they operate effectively.  In terms of TTIP, the US is a very important market for Irish companies and we do believe there are substantial opportunities assuming the successful completion of the negotiations.</p><p> From the point of view of women in the developing world, Enterprise Ireland has focused on women in business and many other countries are watching Ireland and what we do in this area.  We have focused on this in the start-up area because there was a very low level of participation by females in start-up companies and we focused on increasing that over the past three years.  The percentage of their involvement in high potential start-ups and early stage start-ups that we have supported has gone from single digits to 23%.  We believe that by focusing on a particular area it is possible to achieve results.  Our focus on female entrepreneurship has proved that. </p><p> I will ask my colleague, Mr. Byrne, to respond to Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s question about regional balance in jobs.</p></speech>

We have 180,000 plus directly employed by Enterprise Ireland clients.  In the break-down of full-time job allocation across the regions, Dublin mid-east is the dominant region by virtue of size and scale, but 25% of the full-time jobs in our client base are located in the south region, 12% in the west region, 12% in the mid-west and 18% in the border regions.  We are conscious of our region development.  In order to keep the focus on job creation in the regions  we are engaged in regional strategy development with our parent department.  We also engage in entrepreneurial support activities across all regions.  We run eight to ten workshops across the regions annually to generate export awareness and export capabilities in companies.  We are highly linked in to the local enterprise offices now, providing a seamless transition for companies as they go on a growth curve, regionally based, from the local enterprise office, LEO, straight through to Enterprise Ireland's full service offering support for growth and exports.</p></speech>

Deputy Crowe raised the question of the importance of languages.  In these markets languages are critically important.  There are a number of elements to that, not least of which is leveraging the new diaspora - students that have come to Ireland for third level education and then return to their countries.  These, along with the current international students studying here, are links for us to build on.  We encourage Irish companies to build links with them as part of that languages link.  I now ask my colleague Mr. Brendan Flood to expand on the languages issue.</p></speech>

I understand some companies work through the local chamber, but is there any way of putting structure on those links, those people who were in Ireland.  I am aware that trade delegations can invite people to dinners etc., but is there any way of making it more structured? Does Enterprise Ireland have plans to do this or is that outside its remit?</p></speech>

A number of measures have been taken.  We have an effective website that connects us in to that wider alumni, which is heavily visited.  Some of those international students in Ireland operate as ambassadors on the website, sharing experiences of how they are doing.  It is part of our promotional activity, promoting Ireland as a location for international education.  There is a series of alumni with that group and also with the individual universities.  Through our links and our activities in promoting international education, we do have strong links with colleges in Ireland and internationally, and we leverage those links.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1997" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Flood" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#F00500"><p>I will separate the education from the language side.  In 2013 Enterprise Ireland established a dedicated client skills unit to collaborate with the Department and with Government agencies about specific skills gaps faced by Irish companies in the short and long term.  The domestic supply of foreign language skills is something that should be acted upon, not just in relation to Europe but also in the markets we are talking about.  Foreign language capability and cultural awareness, as suggested by the committee, are essential for enterprises to compete in an increasingly global market.  Having language capabilities is a major boost to companies in achieving their export goals.  It also offers them opportunities to diversify away from English speaking markets.  While we do prefer the skill-set of language capability to be brought in to the companies, it can be met in the short-term - for the Asian markets - in different ways including recruitment, up-skilling employees, use of professional translators and interpreters and hiring native speaking channel partners or agents.  There is no doubt the development of business, technical and professional language capabilities within companies will enable them to pursue opportunities that may arise in any of those markets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1998" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Sherry" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#F00600"><p>Senator Mullins asked about the greatest challenges facing companies in the ASEAN region and about Enterprise Ireland's plans for trade missions in 2015.  I will ask Mr. Conor Fahy to expand on that.  There are a series of challenges.  We have spoken about cultural challenges, it is different doing business in the region and we understand that.  One important element that Enterprise Ireland brings to that party is that it has the experience of doing business in these regions.  It also connects companies with other companies doing business in the region so they can learn while connected to those networks.  Culturally it is quite different.  Timescale was mentioned - companies doing business in Asia require patience.  From initial contact to placing an order tends to be a longer life-cycle than in other markets such as Europe and the US, so companies have be resilient and patient in that large market.</p> <p>  Companies also require an understanding of the way business is done.  The importance of relationships was mentioned earlier.  In these markets companies need to develop the relationship first and the business comes after.  In some other markets a higher priority is not placed on the relationship element.  Companies are also required to put boots on the ground which is important.  Enterprise Ireland encourages people to put sales people on the ground and helps companies with this by access to the Enterprise Ireland offices and to incubation centres.</p> <p>  Mr. David Byrne has highlighted that most of the Enterprise Ireland staff overseas are local hires and that is important to us.  Typically one person in each office is someone who is placed from Ireland.  The rest of the teams are local hires.  It is important therefore for Irish companies, when going in to the market place that they do have local capability.  It needs to be a mix of people from the company in Ireland and also locally recruited people who understand the market.  There are substantial opportunities in those markets where growth rates are high.  The Enterprise Ireland message to companies is to look at the success of the companies that have committed to the markets and the business is there to be won.  Irish companies can compete, and win, against the best in the world.  Enterprise Ireland is very confident about that - it is one of the things we are proud of when working overseas - the expertise and capabilities and Irish companies bring.  Another important factor, innate in Irish companies, is their ability to build relationships and their ability to get on with people.  The committee asked about plans for trade missions. There are plans for 22 trade missions in 2015.  I now ask my colleague Mr. Conor Fahy to expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.1999" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Fahy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#F00700"><p>I thank Mr. Sherry.  Trade missions are an integral part of the overseas promotional programme.  The outcome for companies is to foster business relationships and prospective customers.  In last year's trade mission programme, companies announced over &euro;200 million in contracts signed.  There is an ambitious programme again for 2015.  Last week I returned from a trade mission to central Europe with Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash.  We had 42 companies announcing &euro;30 million in contracts in the course of a two city trade mission to Warsaw and Prague.</p><p>Our programme for the year ahead will focus significantly, as Mr. Sherry has said, on high growth markets.  If one contrasts 2010 with the year ahead, one will see that we have increased the level of focus on high growth markets by over 40% in relation to our activity in those regions.  As the leading sponsor of ID 2015, Enterprise Ireland supports Irish companies in celebrating world class design skills through a range of programmes and events which have been incorporated into our trade missions across the world.   Such skills will be a feature of the programmes that Ministers will participate in and will be a key message in the speeches delivered to the audiences who will participate on our programmes internationally.</p></speech>

We regularly review the location of our overseas offices and the way that we operate.  It is important for us that when we operate in an overseas market we are able to respond to the specific needs of clients.  Most of the companies that we work with target the ASEAN region as a region as opposed to targeting individual countries.  They are also focused on specific sectors, such as financial services, telecommunications, and international education.  The food area is the responsibility of our colleagues in Bord Bia.</p> <p>  The majority of Enterprise Ireland's client's business in Malaysia is in international education.  We used to have a one-person office in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and we also had one person in Singapore.  We decided to consolidate our resources in Singapore with an office of six people, so we expanded our resources there.  In Malaysia, there is one person working full-time in the international education area.  In the other cases, we have aligned our staff in those offices to have specific sector expertise.  With the exception of the manager of the office, all of the staff are locally recruited and have specific domain expertise.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Indonesia and Thailand.  One member of our team in the Singapore office is an Indonesian national and she, in fact, spends some of her time in Indonesia and provides advice and expertise to clients on the market in Indonesia.  The level of business and client demand for Indonesia and Thailand at the moment does not justify Enterprise Ireland having a full-time office in either of those countries.  We work very closely with the embassies and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but co-located with them in Singapore.  We work very closely with the teams there.  It is something that we keep under constant review.  In the last couple of years, we have opened new offices and have realigned some of our resources and changed the way that we operate.  We have expanded our pathfinder trade consultant network substantially.  In recent times we have opened new offices in Austin in Texas, Perth, and Abu Dhabi.  That is a constantly changing environment and we have to operate like that in order to respond to the changing needs of our clients.  In the case of the Asia Pacific and ASEAN regions we have deployed more resources there proportionally than the exports currently justify and that is in recognition of the fact that we need to deploy more resources in order to assist companies to build for the future.  </p> <p>  There are two tracks for us.  The first is to help companies sustain and build exports in markets where they currently have a footprint, such as in more developed markets, and the other aspect is to build and develop exports in those more developing high growth markets, which is why we set a higher target for those markets.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the importance of Malaysia to the education sector abroad.  I have also mentioned the new diaspora.  We have two agendas in terms of the international education area.  The first is that it is obviously a very important business.  There are over 32,000 international students studying full-time in Ireland, so it is a very important part of the third level sector in Ireland.  The people who come to Ireland to be educated are, effectively, the ambassadors of the future for Ireland in the countries they come from and are important commercial links for us.  That is why it is so important, as Deputy Crowe has asked, that we build and continue to build links with those individuals in the marketplace.</p> <p>  We work closely with the Irish Exporters Association.  We are part of and have part funded their Asia Trade Forum.  We have close links with the chambers of commerce in those international markets, the strongest of which is the chamber of commerce in Singapore.  Does Mr. Byrne wish to explain that?</p></speech>

We participate in the Dublin and Ireland chambers.  We also participate in the Irish China Association, the Irish Russia Association, and central European associations, so we are aware of the opportunity to leverage the networks, contacts, and expertise that are available to our clients through engagement with chambers here and abroad.  On most trade events and missions we aim to leverage power and establish contacts in the market, either through the Global Irish Network and other sources or through local chambers, and we try to bring in that expertise and make it available to our client companies.</p></speech>

Have there been many companies that did not listen to the advice of Enterprise Ireland, that went out on their own without the knowledge that was needed in that country, and maybe did not look at a local partner and have failed abroad?  Are there many such companies that feel let down by what they thought would be the golden egg for them?</p></speech>

There are companies that try and do not succeed.  Sometimes it is because of the actions they have taken and sometimes it is because the market has changed.  While it is painful, one of the best forms of learning for those companies is failure.  What Enterprise Ireland tries to do with those companies is to help them to be successful next time around.  They are a very important part of our network in terms of connecting with other companies that want to go abroad because it is as important to learn from failure as it is to learn from success.  Other companies that want to go out into the marketplace can learn a lot from the advice from those companies about what they tried and what did or did not work.  For the companies that we work with, one of the key things is that they are prepared when they go out into the marketplace.  That is why we have a high growth markets team here in Dublin so they can get direct market advice from people here in Ireland about what they can expect in the marketplace.  We have Japanese, Chinese and Russian nationals in that team in Ireland who have been working with us for many years and who can talk directly about their experience, not just of operating in the market but also the culture within the market.</p></speech>

We have what we call a first flight programme which leans on the experiences of those who have gone and succeeded as well as those who have gone and failed.  It is a programme on which we like to bring people who are considering exporting for the first time.  We have one relating to the Asia-Pac area.</p></speech>

The question has been asked before and I have seen it in operation when we were engaging in a twining arrangement with China.  There would be an argument that the colleges are very competitive; that Trinity College, UCD, the Institute of Technology Tallaght or DIT have their individual stands; and that they do not co-operate.  I am very conscious of the 32,000 students who are being attracted to Ireland, particularly at the higher levels of education.  Is there a single Irish authority?  The Saudis would send their children here under the King Abdullah scholarships and the Iranians would send their students to UCD under their state-funded educational schemes.  This presumably is replicated across the board.  I know there are many Libyan students here among others.  There are batches of students from different countries but I find it hard to get my head around who in Ireland is the single authority if there is one or if one is needed to deal with these students on the world scene.</p> <p>  There was a relatively recent trade mission to India.  We all know that India has a terribly difficult problem with energy.  A third of the country could nearly go out overnight because of problems with energy supply.  I am very conscious that the ESB does fantastic work in the international field.  How is our relationship with India going?  </p> <p>  This committee broke the ice only 15 months ago in establishing relations with Iran.  How proactive is Enterprise Ireland in the Iranian market given the consensus view that the nuclear talks will reach a conclusion possibly in June and that we are very conscious that in 15 months, Ireland has engaged in about four visits?  The Ceann Comhairle has visited Iran.  The speaker of the Iranian parliament might visit here next month.  There has been phenomenal contact in a very short period of time.  When we visit Iran, we are very conscious that the Korean trade missions are there.  The witnesses mentioned South Africa.  When I was out there recently, nearly every government ministry was involved.  I think there was a delegation of about 42.  The world is looking at Iran.  How do we look at a market like that where one can anticipate changes occurring?</p></speech>

The witnesses say that they see the Asian countries as a region.  A request was made that we open more embassies in that area.  How important is that in respect of trade?  People say it is key but if one was talking in terms of recommendations relating to countries where we do not have embassies, which countries would the witnesses recommend opening embassies in?  Is there a direct link between opening an embassy and trade?</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland is heavily involved in international education.  We have responsibility for promoting it overseas.  It is true to say that in some areas, the colleges and institutes of technology compete.  However, by and large, they collaborate and work very well together.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the Minister for Education and Skills is in the US this week on an education trade mission.  NAFSA is the main international education trade fair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2010" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015052700002#H00600"><p>Under Ireland's international education strategy 2010-2015, Enterprise Ireland manages the Education in Ireland brand.  The brand was established in 2011 as an overarching brand for all of the colleges and institutes of technology.  They travel on our education-related missions and various trade missions under that brand.  They work collaboratively.  There is a difference in terms of contribution to the brand by way of marketing, marketing collateral and support.  It is fair to say that the colleges are more adept at undertaking that marketing.  They are better resourced generally than the institutes of technology and that is reflected in the level of traction they achieve.<br/><br/>That said, there are institutes of technology that secure significant business in terms of overseas students from not only the Asia-Pac region but ASEAN countries in particular.  Enterprise Ireland has the responsibility under that strategy and the Education in Ireland brand for the development of the international offering, the international strategic partnership arrangements and the promotion and collaboration for the development of sales and marketing capabilities for the education offering.<br/><br/>We have a comprehensive offer.  There is a single unified website - <i>educationinireland.com</i>- which is a stand-alone facility that provides access and support for current students, future student enrolments, agents and other service providers to the education services in and from Ireland.  We work across a number of fairs, particularly in the Asian and ASEAN region across the Star Education Fairs.  We recently returned from a Star Education Fair in Malaysia and will participate for the first time in the Star Education in Fair in Indonesia later this year.  If we compare the 2013 results to those of 2010, we can see that there has been a 36% growth in revenue from overseas students from the Asia-Pac region.</p></speech>

How does it blend that?  If one is attracting students, one must be conscious of accommodation needs.  How are they balanced?</p></speech>

Deputy Byrne may be aware of the significant amount of accommodation for students that has been developed across the country by the colleges and in terms of PPP operations.  There have been some very innovative developments in that space by both the public and private sectors.  Athlone Institute of Technology has managed to find significant separate accommodation in the immediate Athlone area for its student base from the Gulf region.  Another example is UCD's expansion of its on-site accommodation in Belfield.  Those facilities enhance the wider education ecosystem and strengthen the offer for Ireland.  The Education in Ireland brand provides not only immediate education needs but it looks to provide guidance on living in Ireland, quality of life in Ireland and other wider benefits to a student than simply the core education element.  It is important that people who come here not only have some cultural awareness but enjoy the experience as well as achieve a top-class education.</p></speech>

India is one of the markets that are seeing substantial growth in the number of international students coming to Ireland following a substantial effort.  A number of our most recent trade missions in India have focused on international students.  It is one of the more difficult countries in which to do business both in terms of ease of doing business and Irish companies identifying areas of opportunity where they can not only compete but win business and win profitable business because the cost base in some sectors in India is obviously a challenge.  Companies looking to do business in India are very much focused on intellectual property-intensive businesses where they have something that is cannot be easily found in the marketplace in India.</p><p>That also extends to design skills in terms of construction services and telecommunications.  India, in terms of the scale of its population and growth, is a market to which we are committed for the long term, as is, as I am sure members are aware, the IDA and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is a market into which we continue to encourage companies.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, visited India recently.</p><p> On Iran, we have been looking at the market there and have some previous experience in that regard, which my colleague, Conor Fahy, will expand on.</p></speech>

As mentioned, many countries have been looking at the re-opening of the Iranian market.  In January, my colleague, Mr. John McNamara, who is our regional director in the region and my colleague from Dubai held a series of meetings in Iran as part of a preliminary assessment phase.  In this regard, we are looking at how we can match the opportunity with companies who have the capability to develop a market and customers in Iran.  This will be undertaken in conjunction with our clients who are experienced in this area.  The key aspect of any company selling into an emerging market like Iran is whether its offer is compelling, whether it has the capability to service it and whether it has the commitment to develop the necessary relationships to see the business contracts through.  We are actively monitoring Iran as a prospective market for us in terms of our activities across the Middle East.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, we work very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, particularly the trade promotion division in Dublin, and with each of the embassies and ambassadors overseas.  We discuss with them in some detail our assessment of the market opportunities and they, in turn, give us their view in that regard.  We have been involved with them on the trade, tourism and investment strategy and had lengthy discussions with them during the development of that strategy and the most recent review of it, including on what are the most appropriate markets, what is the market assessment of the opportunity in those markets and in what sectors, and timing in that regard.  As we have had discussions with them on their thinking in terms of opportunities, they would be fully aware of our plans.</p> <p>  In practical terms, we work hand-in-glove with companies.  During trade missions we work hand-in-glove with people at a senior level, as we do with our colleagues in IDA Ireland or Tourism Ireland.  In the case of the ASEAN and Asia Pacific regions, as government access is vital we work with companies on a daily basis in leveraging contacts at a senior level.</p></speech>

As the witnesses will be aware we have opened a number of embassies in new ASEAN countries in recent times, including Bangkok and Jakarta.  Obviously, Indonesia, which has a population of 240 million, is a huge and diverse market.  Such is the size of that market there it stretches a distance similar to that between New York and California.  There is also huge potential in Thailand.</p> <p>  Current focus is on the Chinese market.  Prime Minister Li Keqiang recently visited Ireland and there have been a huge amount of trade missions into China in recent times, with almost every member of the Cabinet having visited there at this stage.  I would like to discuss the Ireland House concept, which operates in New York, Tokyo and so on.  Enterprise Ireland has an office in only one of the five ASEAN countries.  Would it be possible in the context of the resources currently available to Enterprise Ireland for it to link up more frequently with the embassies in the other countries?  It must be difficult for one office to engage with all of the countries.  I acknowledge the resource issue mentioned by Mr. Sherry but everybody has a resource issue, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We would like to see further embassies in other countries.  Could additional resources be allocated to address of that issue in the context of the ASEAN countries?  Vietnam is an emerging economy.  We have had a great deal of success in this region, including in China in terms of our infant milk formula and the Kerry Group research and development in Singapore, which we visited last year.  We now have an embassy in Indonesia.  While this embassy was originally an aid embassy it has now also become a trade embassy.  Is Enterprise Ireland giving serious consideration to development of the Ireland House concept in this region?  I know that it works closely with the embassies but has consideration been given to the provision of additional resources to promote Ireland in this region, particularly in the food and IT sector?</p></speech>

As mentioned by Mr. Fahy, we recently did a market study visit in Vietnam and we are planning one for Thailand later in the year.  This is done in conjunction with the ambassador.  In the case of Indonesia, the vast majority of our exports to Indonesia are in the food area, which is the responsibility of our colleagues in Bord Bia.  Enterprise Ireland does not have responsibility for the overseas trade promotion of food.  While we are currently encouraging companies to look at Indonesia as a market this does not justify our putting a person there full time.  I mentioned earlier that one of the team in our office in Singapore is an Indonesian national who spends time in the marketplace, which is very important.  We purposely sought to recruit somebody with that expertise.  As in the case of many other markets, we will continue to try to encourage and develop companies' interest in the Indonesian and Vietnamese markets.  One of the things we need to do is to bring companies with us.  We have to encourage their commitment without over-extending them.  Many Irish companies are on a journey within the Asia Pacific region.  Many are at the stage of looking at putting feet on the ground in the region.  Once they get established in the region they than seek to expand beyond one location.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, when responding to Deputy Byrne's question in regard to ease of doing business, Indonesia is a market that is up there in terms of difficulty in doing business.  It is a market in reality where there are issues associated with the ease of doing business.  As corruption is a factor in Indonesia companies must be much more prepared and much more resilient when going into that particular market.  It is not as easy a market in which to do business as is Singapore.  That said, there are opportunities and we are exploring them.  In the context of resource allocation, as in the case of other locations where we co-locate with the embassies, it is an obvious choice.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland was one of the sponsors of the Asia Pacific Irish Business Forum right from the outset, and in terms of even the Asian games that take place in the region with which there is a strong business angle associated.  There is a review underway of its focus.  We would strongly encourage the leveraging of those strong connections.  As the committee will be well aware, the GAA plays an important role in those connections in the region.  It is very much part of our agenda.</p></speech>

As I said, I am sorry I was not here for the beginning of it.  The representatives are to be congratulated on the work they do in Enterprise Ireland, particularly overseas and given the resources.  In the end it will always be about resources and prioritising areas, but I suppose that is the reason we are preparing this report.  We see significant potential in ASEAN countries which is reflected in the fact that we opened new embassies in these areas.  We would like to see more growth in the business being done from those areas, both inward and outward investment.  Obviously, it is important in both ways.</p> <p>  We are aware Enterprise Ireland is competing with powerful agencies in those countries.  For example, there is KOTRA in Korea and JETRO in Japan.  These organisations have significant resources and considerable manpower, as well as the foreign embassies of these countries.  Where our embassies have only three or four personnel, they have maybe 40 or 50 in embassies.  That is a real challenge for us.  At the same, it is important to have a presence.  I would encourage Enterprise Ireland to have a greater presence, if at all possible.  It is something, I presume, Enterprise Ireland will be looking at in future.</p> <p>  I thank all of Enterprise Ireland's representatives for coming here this morning.  We had an interesting debate.  They enlightened us on Enterprise Ireland activities abroad.  It is good for us, as a committee, to talk to representatives of Enterprise Ireland from time to time about its activities and to see the important role it plays in our economic recovery.  Trade is part of our economic recovery and has played a major role there.  We look forward to having Enterprise Ireland's input into our report when we complete it later on this year.</p></speech>

I remind members and witnesses to ensure that all mobile phones are switched off.  The purpose of this meeting is to engage with the chairman of Bord na M&oacute;na on the cessation of peat briquette production at two Bord Na M&oacute;na factories, Littleton, County Tipperary, and Derrinlough, County Offaly.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. John Horgan, chairman, Mr. Mike Quinn, managing director, Ms Geraldine Lynch, head of supply chain, and Mr. Gerry Ryan, company secretary, of Bord na M&oacute;na.</p><p> I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also remind witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website following the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I understand that the temporary closures of the plants in question have been referred to the Labour Relations Commission by SIPTU and that management has agreed to participate.  It is likely that Bord na M&oacute;na representatives may be precluded from discussing certain issues.  Obviously, they can clarify that.  I call on Mr. Horgan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to be here.  I want to explain to the committee what is happening in Littleton and Derrinlough, where we have two briquette factories.  These produce the traditionally well known Bord na M&oacute;na peat briquettes.  Each year there is a production plan decided for each factory.  This year, however, the closing stock, that is, the amount of briquettes that we have in stock at the end of March each year which is the end of our financial year, is exceptionally high.  In March 2013, closing stock was 1,500 tonnes and in March 2014, it was 44,000 tonnes.  We would normally aim to have in the region of 30,000 tonnes at the end of each year.  This year we have twice that amount.  To put it in perspective, that is roughly the equivalent of 11 weeks' production.  We have never had such a high level of stocks.</p> <p>  Why do we need to do what we are doing?  The factories normally stop operations every year in June or July.  This year, because of the very high level of stock to which I referred, the production of briquettes at those factories stopped earlier, at the end of March.  Typically, when the stoppages occur, there is other work, such as maintenance, to be done.  In a typical year, an employee would be on basic rates of pay for approximately five weeks and that is normally managed on a voluntary basis.  In effect, that normally means that rather than earning in the region of &euro;800 or &euro;900 per week, employees would drop back to maybe &euro;550 or &euro;600 a week because they would not be shift-working and they would not be in receipt of an element of pay that is related to the amount of briquettes produced in any particular week.  In a normal year, they would suffer a loss of earnings.</p> <p>  This year that stoppage has had to be increased.  The stoppage this year is for eight weeks - three weeks longer than usual - and there will be reduced earnings due to short-time working this year.  Normally, we would not have short-time working, that is, employees working a short week.  Some employees for some weeks will only work some of the days of that week.  That is what is different this year as opposed to other years.  Ms Lynch, who is in charge of the operations at these factories, will be able to go into much greater detail on that.</p> <p>  I will give our estimate of the reasons our sales were so negatively impacted last year.  There is a growing problem of unregulated fuel imports from Northern Ireland.  We estimate that 50,000 tonnes or 60,000 tonnes, or 10% to 15%, of the domestic fuel market in Ireland is now being supplied by unregulated imports from Northern Ireland and that is impacting on us.</p> <p>  Carbon tax is another factor that has reduced the sales of briquettes.  It appears to us that there may not be a level playing field here.  Bord na M&oacute;na paid over &euro;8.7 million of the total of &euro;17 million that was received in carbon tax.  We are paying 50% of the total tax but we do not have 50% of the market.  We think we may have 30% of the market.</p> <p>  Private fuels are a serious source of competition for us.  We believe that a lot of the private fuel sales are not paying the carbon tax - they are subject to it but it is not being paid - and that the VAT on a large proportion of those sales is not being paid either.  There is a question of a level playing field in that regard.  That is increasingly undermining our business.</p> <p>  There is also the weather.  We are a weather dependent business on two scores - we need good weather in the summer to harvest the peat and we need a cold winter for the demand for briquettes.  Last year we had a reasonably good harvest but the winter was not as cold as normal.  The winter was reasonably mild and the sales of all domestic fuels dropped and, of course, there was increased competition from home heating oil because its price fell.  Those are the reasons we think the sales of briquettes last year were so disappointing and, therefore, the build-up of stock occurred.</p> <p>  As for what we have done, it became apparent to us in December 2014 that there would be a problem and we informed our employees.  The employees themselves would be attuned to this anyway.  They can see the stock levels.  At that stage, we started to draft a contingency plan.  From February of this year onwards, we had a detailed engagement with staff and the union representatives about the impending issues.  We had ongoing meetings with the unions.  At local level, we held five collective meetings where we brought the representatives of both factories together with their union representatives.  We assessed with the staff all the redeployment opportunities and we brought forward a capital work plan.  We increased by 30% the amount we are spending on capital works this year, from &euro;1.4 million to &euro;1.8 million, and that, of course, provides additional employment in the briquette factories during the current period.</p> <p>  With all those steps and various mitigation measures, we got very close to the stage where this could have been achieved on a voluntary basis.  If the weather had been kinder over the past few weeks, it may have been possible to redeploy staff on peat production.</p><p>We were very close to being able to achieve this on a voluntary basis this summer.  It does not now appear that we will be, because the peat harvest has not started yet, effectively, because we have not had dry enough weather for it, although we hope to be able to start it in the next couple of weeks.  Unfortunately, there probably will be times when we will not be able to provide employment for some people who want to continue in employment.  However, at this stage we think every employee will be able to be employed at some stage of every week, but not for the full week every week.  I am just trying to give the scale of it.  That is not yet definite, because we are still in negotiations with the trade unions on the matter.</p><p> Production is scheduled to resume on 10 September, as planned, and by that stage everybody will be back in full-time employment and on shift.  We are actively reviewing new product developments and opportunities because we want to grow new markets for the briquette business and in order to provide long-term sustainable employment and keep both these factories open and secure, we are working hard to develop new sustainable fuels.  We are talking there about a biomass briquette, which is currently in development.  This week we have been invited to attend the Labour Relations Commission on the issue.  We are looking forward to engaging with the trade unions through that process and hopefully we can get agreement there.  If we cannot get agreement on these issues at the Labour Relations Commission, we will, of course, agree to have the matter referred to a full hearing of the Labour Court, if that is what the trade unions want.  </p><p> We have very serious plans in Bord na M&oacute;na up to 2030 and beyond.  Mr. Quinn, who is with us, has recently joined us as our new managing director.  He joined at the beginning of this year.  He has brought to the board a very ambitious investment plan for the future of Bord na M&oacute;na and the board has accepted that plan in principle.  We have shown that plan to NewERA and to our Department and the response has been very positive.  Each element of the plan will be subject to further board approval as to commercial viability and sensitivity.  As part of that, there is now an agreement between Mr. Mike Quinn, as managing director of Bord na M&oacute;na, and the chief executive of the ESB to keep the peat-fired power stations open.  We have one peat-fired power station and the ESB has two.  There has been a question mark over their viability in the future.  We now have an agreement in principle to keep all three of them open beyond 2019 and to co-fire them with biomass.  We are also developing a large-scale indigenous biomass industry.</p><p> The Chairman and members will be aware that the Government decided there should be a partial merger of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte and that as part of that a new company should be established, BioEnergy Ireland.  We are taking a strong lead in the establishment of that and in the development of the biomass industry in Ireland.  That will secure the power stations and peat production into the future.  We also have in progress a transformation programme.  This is a company-wide programme to reduce the costs of production and improve the general efficiency of the company.  It is a major programme.  We are in negotiations with the union and have been for over a year now on that issue.  That matter is also in the Labour Relations Commission, but in a separate set of negotiations.  Those negotiations will continue today - they have started again this morning.  I am happy to report that good progress is being made there.  We believe it will be possible in a matter of weeks or months to reach an agreement with the trade unions on all those matters.  Very difficult decisions have to be taken because we must reduce the price at which we supply peat internally to ourselves and to the ESB.  The price of peat must be reduced by a considerable amount.  We recognise, and always have recognised, that this is a very difficult process to go through, but it is necessary to secure the future of the company.  We now believe the unions are seriously engaged and recognise the necessity of those cost-cutting measures.  Overall, the primary objective of our long-term strategy is to keep Bord na M&oacute;na as a major employer in the midlands through 2030 and beyond.</p></speech>

I am glad that when Mr. Horgan moved to the last chapter of his presentation, towards 2030, he mentioned other issues that are very pertinent to the development and ongoing viability of Bord na M&oacute;na.  As the chairman rightly said, we know only too well that the future viability of Bord na M&oacute;na is paramount to the economic activities of the midlands region and always has been.  There has been much change since it was initiated, in respect of the power plants and other changes in work practices, development and so forth.  All of that, thankfully, was done by consensus and with the agreement of the workforce and the communities in which they are located.  That is why it is in place today and has a chance of survival into the future.</p> <p>  I might break up into three sections the issues Mr. Horgan raised.  Before doing so, I am conscious of his role as chair of Bord na M&oacute;na.  He was appointed by Government, by the former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  The Government is representative of the people, so he is, by association, a conduit of the shareholders, namely, the public.  He acts as that conduit in the best interests of the shareholder.  He said when he was appointed and came before this committee in September 2012 that "The board will be collectively responsible for promoting the success of the company by leading and directing its activities".  He said it would "provide strategic guidance and monitor the activities and effectiveness of management".  I know he was well qualified for the role.  He has an MA in industrial relations from the University of Warwick and was a member of the Labour Court for close on 12 years, first as vice-chair and then as chair for five years.  Is that right, that it was from 1979 to 1984?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2036" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horgan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015052700002#G00400"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2037" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015052700002#G00500"><p>There was great anticipation of his effectiveness as chair and as that conduit.  With the knowledge and expertise he had, especially in industrial relations, one would have expected that any change, diversification, alteration in work practices or cost-cutting exercise that might ensue would be well-managed, closely monitored by him and the board in dealing with management to ensure smoothness.  One would also have expected morale to be maintained among the workforce and that those amendments would be well-met and well-intentioned and would, in so far as possible, meet with the approval of the workforce.</p><p> I want to raise three issues in the first instance.  When I say that the operation of the briquette factories was the primary issue raised by Mr. Horgan, I do not intend to demean or diminish many of the other activities that take place across Bord na M&oacute;na.  The briquettes meet the fuel market.  Peat is supplied to the horticultural sector and to power plants.  Many people are involved in the servicing and maintenance of machinery and equipment.  Everyone is familiar with the workshops and with the apprenticeship model that previously existed.  We are aware that seasonal work supplemented the incomes of many farmers and others in the region.  Mr. Horgan mentioned diversification.  I say all of this to highlight what happened across various areas over many years.  I am particularly conscious that the natural lives of many of the power plants mentioned by Mr. Horgan ended in the 1980s and 1990s.  A huge effort and commitment on the part of all stakeholders was required to ensure that the lifespan of the peat extraction industry was extended and that this activity continued to play a role in power generation.  It continues to do so by virtue of what happens at Edenderry, Shannonbridge and Lanesborough.  We are now at a juncture at which those very plants are finding themselves at a crossroads.  Mr. Horgan's role and that of the board and management is quite precarious.  There is a huge responsibility on them.</p><p> I welcome the issues mentioned by Mr. Horgan in relation to biomass.  I would like to see more progress on that.  He mentioned that there may be developments in the coming weeks.  It is essential for the alliance with Coillte in this area to crystallise quickly.  Thereafter, there needs to be an effective means by which the biomass industry can be improved upon so that it can take off and be part of the co-fuelling that was mentioned earlier.  Those who had foresight back in the 1980s and 1990s were aware that there was potential for co-fuelling in the knowledge that peat extraction would come to an end at some stage.  Anyway, I will get back to the briquette factories.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2040" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015052700002#H00300"><p>I have three questions.  We have been waiting for three or four weeks to discuss this very important issue.  I might add that this is the Aer Lingus of the midlands.  We are aware that plenty of time and effort is going into that area.  I want to make sure the questions that are being asked during the course of that debate do not arise in this context at any future juncture.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. Horgan about a significant issue that relates to briquettes.  I know there are seasonal elements to that sector of the business.  We are all aware this has historically been the case.  We have had good summers in recent years, particularly last year.  The company has suggested that the stockpile which now exists is sufficient to meet the demand the market is placing on it.  That is why there have been closures.  The big thing here is the carbon tax.  When that tax was introduced, the previous Government gave a derogation to Bord na M&oacute;na and the briquette factories.  I do not have to name names.  It was given and it ensured the viability of this sector.  It allowed the sector to compete competitively, especially with the market forces in the North.  It was reinstated and doubled by this Government.  That may be political.  It is a political charge on my part.  As I have said, the company has a responsibility to the shareholders.  What negotiation or consultation takes place at governmental or ministerial level between the company and whoever holds that office at any given time?  What consultation did Mr. Horgan have with the Minister on foot of this as it arose?  Did he fight the implementation?  Did he fight the doubling of it?  Has Mr. Horgan spoken to them since?  Has he highlighted the effect this has had on Bord na M&oacute;na's potential to compete in that marketplace?  That and that alone is the kernel of the question as regards the future of that sector.  That is my first question.  I will try to speed up if I can.</p> <p>  Mr. Horgan raised some broader issues when he spoke about moving towards 2030.  He and his management colleagues have sought cuts of up to &euro;24 million per annum in relation to Bord na M&oacute;na activities.  They have said that such cuts are necessary if the company is to be able to continue in existence beyond 2019.  The ESB has said in recent weeks that it is committed to continuing the partnership between its plants and Bord na M&oacute;na plants for the supply of peat, regardless of whether it involves 100% peat fuel or some kind of co-fuel arrangement.  Is it not strange that Mr. Horgan and his colleagues did not seek to meet, engage with and ultimately agree terms, conditions, contracts and the associated costs with the ESB?  If they had reached some indication of what the price might be beyond 2019 and the public service obligation, perhaps they would be in a position to look at the costs and the sorts of reductions that might be necessary thereafter.  I think they have put the cart before the horse.  Mr. Horgan seems confused as he looks at me.  I am saying that he has decided, before meeting ESB or agreeing a contract or a price, that cuts of &euro;24 million are necessary.  He does not yet know what the company's deal with the ESB will be.  He does not know how long that contract will be, how much it will be worth or what effect it will have on the company's costs.  I find that strange.</p> <p>  I will conclude by speaking about the mechanisms that were used after that decision was made to seek its implementation.  As I said earlier, Mr. Horgan has much more experience and expertise in the industrial relations area than I have.  He has much more knowledge than I have of the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and all the other mechanisms that are available to resolve issues.  I know, as do the people and communities I represent, that every effort made by the Government and the board over the years to effect change, meet the demands of market change, diversify and alter was done in consultation and consensus with the workforce.  They very seldom went to the Labour Court.  I would have expected that to be the case in this instance and in this period of the company's development, especially with somebody of Mr. Horgan's calibre in the position he is in.  I understand there are nine or ten issues before the Labour Court.  Believe it or not, morale is at an all-time low among the workforce regarding issues of pay and conditions.  I hear a great deal of talk around the country about Dunnes Stores, zero-hour contracts and the difficulty being experienced by workforces in assuring their futures in that company and others.  Many people have been asked or told to reapply for their jobs.  When they have done so, they have found the pay and conditions within Bord na M&oacute;na vastly different from what they were before they reapplied.  Pay cuts of 30% have been applied in some instances.  I find it unbelievable that this has been allowed to evolve.  I ask Mr. Horgan to explain to me, considering the role that he is expected to carry out in the interest of shareholders and as the Government's representative, how it is that almost every question asked of management and staff is ending up in the Labour Court.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Horgan for a response.  I do not want it to get into an over-and-back situation.  I am conscious that other members of the committee want to get in here as well.  If Deputy Cowen wants to come back at the end of Mr. Horgan's response, that is fine.  I want to move on after the response if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2042" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horgan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015052700002#H00500"><p>As I understand it, Deputy Cowen is asking whether we fought the Government policy on carbon tax.  The answer is "no, we did not".  We are required to have regard to Government policy and to comply with it.  Having said that, we let the Minister and the Department know on a continual basis of the effects of carbon tax on our business.  They are continually updated on that.  It is not something we are in a position to take a stance on.  The Government has wider issues to consider with regard to carbon tax than its simple effect on Bord na M&oacute;na.  I assure the committee that the departmental officials and the Minister are continually kept informed of the effect carbon tax has on us.  We work closely with Departments on a continual basis to let them know what the effects of prospective and existing Government policies might be.</p> <p>  I was also asked to explain why we are cutting our costs now when we do not know what they will be in 2019.</p><p>The answer to that question is that we operate a peat-fired power station.  We know the economics of it.  The two power stations that the ESB operate are broadly similar to our own.  We know what it takes to make our plant competitive and stay in business.  Because we lose the PSO this year, we know what the price of peat has to be from next year going into our power station to make it economic.  In other words, we have a demonstration project.  If we cannot show to the ESB that we can make our project operate commercially, the ESB will not be interested in operating its project on a non-commercial basis.  We have never said that we will ask anyone to operate a power station on a non-commercial basis.  Our job is to make our plant work next year on an economic basis.  When we can demonstrate that to the ESB, then we are in a strong position to say to the ESB that we have done it with ours and therefore the ESB can do it with its project.  We know from our internal analysis what the costs would be; therefore, we know the extent of the cost cutting that has to take place.</p><p> The third point raised by Deputy Barry Cowen was about industrial relations practices.  During my time as chairman - it was probably the first time ever - the board asked the management of Bord na M&oacute;na to reach an agreement, a protocol, a broad framework as to how the trade unions and the company would interact.  A protocol was agreed and approved by the trade unions and approved at board level and signed off by the board.  I am not sure if that had ever been done in the history of Bord na M&oacute;na.  The management of the company has been operating in accordance with that protocol ever since.  It is an agreed protocol.  The difficulties that the company and the unions face and the difficulties that face employees are, perhaps, unprecedented, but they have to be tackled.  We cannot just pretend that hard decisions do not have to be taken.  We have honestly and openly put those proposals to our trade unions in accordance with our protocol.  While a number of issues have been through the Labour Court in respect of these changes, I would point out that on every single occasion the Labour Court has found that the company acted in accordance with the protocol agreed and in accordance with good industrial relations practice and has recommended that the employees implement the various changes.  It is not unusual for a company that is going through such a difficult period in readjustment to have difficulties in negotiation and for both parties to use the services provided by the State to help resolve those difficulties.  That is what we have done, and we will continue to do that.  </p><p> There was a mention of a 30% cut in pay.  I want to say that no basic pay rates in Bord na M&oacute;na are being cut or proposed to be cut.  Some elements of other allowances and so on are being cut and some people are taking other jobs that are of a lower total remuneration.  That is true.  All of that is being managed carefully through the established procedures and in accordance with the protocol that has been agreed with the trade unions.</p></speech>

He cannot be present but I have no doubt he will be buzzing my ear on it when we meet again tomorrow.  Please forgive me if some of my questions appear to show a lack of knowledge of the industry.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to have this conversation in the absence of information on the overall financial standing of the company.  How many staff are currently employed and how many former employees are on pensions?  Perhaps somebody can provide me with that information.  I was surprised to hear Mr. Horgan say there is annual planning in terms of Derrinlough and Littleton.  Of course there has to be annual planning, but I would have expected it particularly in terms of the joint merger or the joint working between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte and the establishment of BioEnergy Ireland.  I would have viewed that as a hugely exciting opportunity which the company would have been planning for the next decade or decades-----</p></speech>

I understand that if the weather is bad it can impact peat production.  I also understand that if the weather is good, demand for the product decreases.  There are other opportunities.  Mr. Horgan talked about unregulated fuel imports from Northern Ireland, which seems to imply there is something wrong with this.  What is meant by unregulated fuel imports and what is the impact on Bord na M&oacute;na?  Is there an opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na to export?I understand the issue of carbon tax.  Mr. Horgan said Bord na M&oacute;na pays 50% of the carbon tax levy on 30% of the market.  That is a startling figure.  What is the basis for that figure, and has it been discussed with anybody?  If I had a business and was paying 50% of a levy when I thought I should be paying 30% I would be asking hard questions.  I am not sure I get the point about private fuels.  People are entitled to private fuel; they always have been and always will be.</p><p>Mr. Horgan mentioned that a capital work plan had been introduced.  He stated that this amount had been increased from &euro;1.4 million to &euro;1.8 million in the briquette factories alone.  What is the purpose of the investment plan?  Is it to develop new lines?  Is it to produce more?  Is it to do more with less human input?  What problem is being resolved or what opportunity is being grasped with the increase in capital investment in the briquette factories?</p><p>The final issue is one I have been asked to raise at this forum.  I understand that pensioners in the company have recently been informed that there is a shortage in the pension fund and that a levy will be placed on them.</p><p>Can Mr. Horgan tell us about the state of health of the pension fund?  How much is going to be levied from the pensioners?  One pensioner to whom I was speaking before the meeting said there appeared to be a lot of management consultants around the place.  What are they doing and how much are they being paid?  If the management consultants were not being paid so much the burden of the levy would not have to be placed on the shoulders of the pensioners.  The same pensioner told me that morale was quite low among workers and pensioners in Bord na M&oacute;na and that it is actually disimproving.  I understand the stresses of industrial relations.  When things are going flyingly well people tend to be happy, while they are unhappy when things are tight.  There used to be a very good process for liaison between management and staff and between management and pensioners, and the welfare of workers and pensioners was always taken into account, but this seems to have dropped off the agenda of the company now.</p></speech>

The financial state of the company is very sound and it has been profitable in the last number of years, as it needs to be in order to be able to borrow and invest in new projects, particularly wind farms.  The results for this year have not yet been finalised, but when they are published in July they will be favourable and in line with last year.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Mike Quinn to talk about unregulated imports.  The problem with private fuels is not that they are there; it is that it is not a level playing field, as a lot of the private fuel business is not subject to VAT and carbon tax is not collected, for whatever reason.  I am not talking about people cutting down their own trees or harvesting their own peat but about stuff that is sold.</p> <p>  I do not have all the details required to answer the question about the pension scheme.  However, the trustees of the pension scheme and the company have been in negotiations in the past few years and this year a scheme was submitted to the Pensions Authority, which has now been approved.  It has the approval of the Department and the Minister, so the changes will be put into effect.  It took a long time and it was very difficult to get the agreement of the trustees to it, but we have succeeded.  All of the company's pension schemes now have in place funding schemes approved by the Pensions Authority.</p> <p>  I did not prepare to answer questions on pensions but, as far as I know, there is no levy on pensioners.</p></speech>

We have a significant opportunity to maintain employment in the midlands by using the workforce and equipment with which we currently harvest peat to harvest the private forestry sector.  The establishment of a willow crop industry within 100 km of power stations is economical, and we are working very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that.  BioEnergy Ireland will be a very significant part of Bord na M&oacute;na's business into the next decade.</p></speech>

Am I right in saying that Bord na M&oacute;na's peat prices have to come from &euro;35 down to &euro;23 or &euro;25 after the levy has gone?  The witnesses spoke about biomass, but I have talked to people in Bord na M&oacute;na who have looked at the ESB plant in Lanesborough.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na not clutching at straws in this area?  People from Bord na M&oacute;na have told me that to feed the plant in Lanesborough one would need all of the county of Roscommon to be planted with willow.  The same applies to Shannonbridge.  I believe willow does not grow well in bogs - good land is needed - so let us be realistic about this.</p> <p>  Is it correct that the company made &euro;54 million in profit last year?  I have been contacted by numerous people who work with Bord na M&oacute;na and it seems a hatchet job is being done on workers at the moment.  As Deputy Cowen said, the management has been insisting on 30% and is saying, "Sign this or no contract."  The company has been using a strong-handed manner, which surprises me, because it is a company I had good regard for.  Given the experience Mr. Horgan has in industrial relations, I am surprised that a company that has made a profit of &euro;54 million is doing this.</p> <p>  Am I correct in saying that Bord na M&oacute;na bought an oil company a few years ago and also had a coal business?  How profitable or unprofitable were they?  Can the witnesses give me the figures?  Was the oil business, in particular, a bad experience?</p> <p>  I understand carbon tax is not paid on peat but only on peat briquettes.  Am I correct in stating that tax is not paid on the peat that goes to the ESB?</p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na has aspirations about biomass but I have done research on willow and know the amount of area one needs as compared with the amount available.  I also know about the quality of land which will be required if Bord na M&oacute;na teams up with Coillte for spruce or the other trees it grows.  We are importing timber from Scotland, manufacturing goods with it and exporting them to England.  The competitiveness of the timber market means there is not enough timber.  The sawmills can go for 24 hours and we have the contracts but we cannot keep it going.  It is lovely dreaming a dream of where we might be but we need to have realism and if the sawmills and the people who are exporting manufactured timber, which is very important in creating employment, get their chunk, I do not think, given the figures I have seen, there is enough to match what Bord na M&oacute;na would need.</p></speech>

It is true we have a problem with biomass and we will have to import large quantities of biomass.  The Drax power station in central England is converting to biomass and is building its own facilities in the United States to harvest biomass, where they are also building dedicated shipping facilities to bring it over.  One has to think big in this business.  The biomass business is the future and we must be part of it.  We need to have a biomass industry that will trade and import large quantities of biomass.</p></speech>

Today in Edenderry we are successfully bringing in 330,000 tonnes of biomass, of which 130,000 tonnes are sourced domestically.  The Deputy is absolutely right that there is not enough biomass in the country to supply the power stations or the biomass briquettes we need to produce.  We also need 90,000 tonnes of green waste for our compost in the Kilberry facility.  Given that smokeless coal needs 50,000 tonnes of biomass and that there are some CHP projects on which we are working, in 2020 we will need in the region of 2 million tonnes.  Add to that the two Coillte board factories, which need 800,000 tonnes, we are looking at needing approximately 3 million tonnes in 2020.  However, that should be seen as an opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na and for this country.  We can develop an international supply chain to deliver that.  The private forestry sector will be bigger than Coillte by 2030 as successive Governments have invested significantly in grants for the private forestry sector, for which we are getting nothing at the moment.  These trees will only come to maturity over the next decade.  We are considering how we can mobilise the private forestry sector and have set ourselves a target whereby 500,000 tonnes of the required 3 million tonnes will come from the domestic private forestry sector.</p> <p>  Today we have 650 acres of farmland under willow.  The yields from those 650 acres are surpassing our original expectations and we have a target of 5,000 acres over the next three to four years.  We are working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc on that and are confident we will be able to do it.  The vast bulk of supply will come from international sources while the private forestry sector is coming on stream.  The Drax station in the UK, about which Mr. Horgan spoke, imports 6 million tonnes of biomass per annum and supplies it successfully to power stations, supplying 8% of the UK power industry.  It has had a successful conversion on three of its six power stations already.  The scale has been demonstrated internationally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2097" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/962" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015052700002#L02700"><p>I welcome the chairman and management of the company and thank them for their presentation.  I want to address three issues but will start with the two principal issues, as I see them, relating to carbon tax and PSO.  Then I want to talk about the relationship between the management of the company and its workforce.  The constituency I represent contains Littleton and Templetuohy, both of which have been very productive and are central to the economic and social life of our area.  Local communities have developed around Bord na M&oacute;na, which is a traditional industry, and relations between the company, the community and its workforce have been very good.</p> <p>  According to the presentation the carbon tax is a major influencer of the downturn in the activity of Bord na M&oacute;na.  The public service obligation requirement on the ESB and the financial contribution it makes are also an issue.  These are the two key issues.   Carbon tax was introduced at the insistence of the Green Party during the course of the last Government.  I supported that Government and when the carbon tax was brought in I was approached by the unions and management in Littleton, including the manager at the time, Mr. Ray Yates.</p><p>There is a man who is about to retire from the company and who has given fantastic service.  I worked with him over the years as a public representative and he is a big loss to the company.  He enjoyed the confidence of his workforce and is what I would call a proper manager.  I want to put that on the record.  When that issue came up, I raised it directly with the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, before going to the Taoiseach of the time, Brian Cowen, who was intimately aware of the consequences of the imposition of carbon tax on briquettes.  It was agreed in that budget that there would be a derogation, and that there would be no carbon tax on briquette products.  We moved on then and the current Government has twice slapped a carbon tax on these products, which has made them uncompetitive and is creating a serious problem.</p><p> The second issue concerns the public service obligation levy, PSO.  It is not a coincidence that the reduction in the PSO equates to &euro;24 million, while the savings Bord na M&oacute;na is expecting from staff are also approximately &euro;24 million.  What I cannot understand is, the ESB is a very strong company, financially.</p><p> We have recently heard - I welcome this publicly because I think it is a good move - the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, announce to much fanfare that the Government was going to invest heavily in initiatives to maximise employment and revitalise local economies in rural areas.  This announcement came after much pressure from rural Deputies like myself, particularly from the Minister's own rural backbench Deputies.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a typical example of a rural-based company.  It is the only opportunity for employment in the areas in which it functions.  Mr. Horgan is appointed by the Government and has a direct link to his line Minister.  I am surprised to hear him say that he has not really got anywhere with carbon tax, apart from the normal submissions he would make to the Minister.  There is a budget coming up again and every lobby group in the country will be making submissions to the Minister.  Mr. Horgan should go through his line Minister to inform the Government of the consequences of its action.  The opportunity exists for him to do so now in advance of this budget, and he should avail of it and put his case very strongly.  He will not just be representing his board, he will be representing the views of the workforce.  Two issues I feel have to be addressed are the PSO and biomass.</p><p> We are told biomass briquettes are the way forward and Bord na M&oacute;na has its biomass project.  Will the biomass be available for the production of briquettes or will it be directed to the peat power plants?  Has Bord na M&oacute;na got a five-year plan for the Littleton briquette factory?  I come from a place called Thurles, and over the years we have suffered in that we have lost all our manufacturing industry in that area.  One time we had four sugar factories, but Thurles lost out and eventually all four closed.  We have two briquette factories now, Derrinlough and Littleton, and there is a concern that there is a hidden agenda.  The two may become one and eventually, the one may not exist.  I would like an assurance today on the future of Littleton briquette factory.</p><p> Mr. Horgan used what I would consider to be labour commission lingo on how Bord na M&oacute;na is managing the transition and savage cuts that are taking place.  He says a framework and a protocol have been put in place and that the company is carefully managing this exercise.  I am not one to exaggerate and am normally quite calm and measured in what I say.  Although I do not go seeking to meet with the workforce in Littleton, they have come to me.  I have received letters addressed to myself and copied to the chief executive, Ms Lynch and others within the company.  I have no intention of putting that correspondence into the public domain but I hope Bord na M&oacute;na has a mechanism within the company to deal with it adequately.  Some of the content of those letters and messages is frightening and I sincerely hope that not even an element of it is true or accurate.</p><p> I would describe Bord na M&oacute;na's situation as being in crisis.  In a time of crisis, resolute action and a plan are needed.  Having met practically all of the membership of the Bord na M&oacute;na workforce in the Littleton-Templetuohy area, either collectively or individually, some of them in my office without the knowledge of their colleagues, there is disillusionment, frustration, anger and huge resentment building up against the management.  People feel the management's method of implementing cuts and cost saving measures is harsh and inhuman - this is why I am talking about this lingo of "framework" and "protocols".  What we are looking for here is basic decency in terms of how the management deals with people who are working with Bord na M&oacute;na for 25 years.  The workforce of Bord na M&oacute;na has been dedicated, committed and loyal to the company.  We never had this kind of difficulty with industrial disputes; I have never seen such a reaction in my 28 years in politics from the company's workforce.  The management needs to face up to the reality that it, starting with the chairman, has lost the confidence of its workforce.  It needs to address this as a matter of urgency.  </p><p> Part of the reason this confidence has been lost is that the workforce does not trust management to have a plan that is achievable, has proper objectives and can deliver sustainable jobs and safeguard the future in these plants.</p><p> There is a perception among the workforce that management has squandered money in many of its investments.  Its core business has always been the peat plants.  It has taken its eye off the ball.  The buzzword is diversification and I understand as a commercial person and a businessman why people have to diversify.  However, management must hold sight of what its core business is.  It is still making &euro;50 million profit out of its core business at a time when it has squandered millions on waste management, made bad investments and lost out heavily, spent a fortune on wind farms for which I am not sure what the dividend will be.  From my understanding, Bord na M&oacute;na has also spent tens of millions on consultancy fees and reports, the end product of which nobody seems to know.  Showing its lack of political astuteness, it spent a fortune bidding for Irish Water franchise, lost out on it and dug a big hole in its balance sheet in preparing for it.  I would have thought somebody in the Government or in Bord na M&oacute;na would have realised halfway through that process that the company was not going to get it and that it should desist from it.  That is the perception among the company's workforce at the moment.  The management has lost touch in respect of the kind of expenditure it has in seeking diversification projects that have been expensive.  </p><p> I have no problem supporting a management with a difficult job to do and I will support the management of the company.  However, it needs to communicate its message a lot better.  I do not believe that communicating through the Labour Relations Commission is the way to do it.  Why do we have to step away from the old procedures that always worked within Bord na M&oacute;na?  The company now has ten issues at the LRC, of which Mr. Horgan is a former chairman.</p><p>I am sure Mr. Horgan, when he was chairman of the Labour Court, did not like having his door opened every other day to deal with spurious claims and issues that should have been resolved locally.  One would expect many issues to be resolved long before they reach the Labour Court.  The majority of the issues arising in Bord na M&oacute;na should have been dealt with by the company's management.  I apologise to the Chairman for taking such a long time but we have reached a crossroads in respect of the future direction of Bord na M&oacute;na.  We need some satisfactory answers and the company needs a solid plan for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015052700002#N00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to ask questions.  I will focus on the final slide in the presentation which has the title, Towards 2030.  I propose to address specifically the area of transformation and the work of the organisation in the period until 2030.</p> <p>  When Mr. Horgan appeared before the joint committee in September 2012, he stated he was proud to be the chairman of the board of a company that had a management team of exceptional individuals who had the capacity to lead the company to continued success in the years ahead.  Why, in an organisation with a senior management team of exceptional individuals who have a capacity to lead the company, is it necessary to pay such high consultancy costs?  I understand &euro;14 million was wasted on consultancy fees last year.  Precisely how much has been spent on consultants since Mr. Horgan's appointment as chairman three years ago?</p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na staff are facing lay-offs and being bullied into accepting new contracts.  They are being told that if they do not surrender their current contracts and sign new contracts, they will be left with nothing.  The new contracts provide for salary reductions of up to 30%.  Are senior managers in the company also facing reductions in salary of 30%? </p> <p>  At our meeting in September 2012, Mr. Horgan also stated that one of the key roles of a chairman is to organise discussion and ensure board members are informed.  Why has he prevented the managing director from meeting the four directors elected by employees, especially given the challenges facing the company and the key role these directors have in facilitating solutions to these challenges?  Why has Mr. Horgan imposed such restrictions on the elected directors engaging with employees, thereby preventing the necessary feedback to the board?</p> <p>  At the meeting on 20 September 2012 at which Mr. Horgan described his key role as being one of organising discussion and ensuring board members were informed, he was also asked about staff morale in Bord na M&oacute;na.  Like Deputy Lowry, I have been contacted by a number of Bord na M&oacute;na employees living in Lanesboro, Rochfortbridge and further afield.  If what they tell me is correct, it is nothing short of disgraceful that such events are occurring in a semi-State company.  When asked about staff morale in 2012, Mr. Horgan stated he was aware of issues but did not necessarily agree with them.  I am informed that up to 300 cases of alleged bullying are in process.  If that is not a serious indication of morale in Bord na M&oacute;na, I do not know what is. </p> <p>  I was asked a question about a specific investigation involving an employee that involves serious deficiencies, including lack of due procedure and courtesy.  As previous speakers noted, these types of cases were not the norm in Bord na M&oacute;na.  People whose families worked in the company for generations speak of family members who always had great pride in the company.  However, speaking to workers nowadays, it is clear that pride is the furthest thing from their minds when they think of the company.</p></speech>

That is not true.</p> <p>  The Deputy alleged that I prevented board members from meeting the managing director.  That is not true.  Such a meeting took place yesterday.  All board members are treated equally and it has never been alleged to me by any board member that he or she was not treated equally.  The law requires that all board members have exactly the same duties and responsibilities and that requirement has been scrupulously observed in Bord na M&oacute;na. </p> <p>  There are not 300 bullying cases in process or anything like that figure.  I do not know the actual number that are in process at the moment.  Procedures are in place for dealing with employees' grievances and there are many different ways of doing so, including through the trade unions and grievance procedures.  There is also an employee assistance programme.  These procedures are standard or better than in most of Irish industry and are operated fairly and impartially.  </p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Lowry, as the Deputy stated, most of his points were political.  As such, it would not be appropriate for me to comment them.  I do not have a note of any specific question he raised that I can answer.  If I inadvertently missed a factual question, I will be pleased to answer it.  If it is an opinion, I respect the Deputy's opinion but-----</p></speech>

However, it is not our business to oppose them, as such.  We make our views known on them and indicate as best we can what would be their effect on the business.  That is as far as we go.  We do not adopt a political stance on any Government decision.</p><p>We are required to have regard to all Government policy and we do that.

They will be 50% biomass and 50% peat.  We are in the process of installing a trial plant in the Littleton facility, which will start in August and will produce approximately 20,000 tonnes of biomass briquettes over the winter.  Those 20,000 tonnes will be rolled out to various seed customers to see how the briquettes perform.  Our intention and strong belief, because we have put a great deal of research and development into this, is that those briquettes will be successful and we will begin over the next 24 months to convert the briquette factories to a biomass briquette.  Each factory will require an investment of approximately &euro;10 million to convert it to allow it process the 50% peat and 50% biomass.  That is a long-term project.</p> <p>  Another member asked whether the biomass would go to the power plants or to the briquette factories.  Only one of our power plants, Edenderry Power Limited, EPL, in Edenderry, buys biomass.  The ESB plants will not need large-scale biomass until 2019.  We have a biomass stream separate from the briquette factories that will be dedicated to them and that will have no bearing whatsoever on the power plants.</p></speech>

Can he confirm that he is heading for a higher figure this year, based on initial figures?  In what year was the protocol he mentioned agreed and against what background?  Was that prior to the present and continuing round of transformation?  As I and other Deputies have said, the issue at hand for many members of staff is that they are being asked to reapply for their jobs and the pay and conditions in the contract associated with that job are very different from those they had the day before they applied.  Pay is greatly diminished, the location is further away and the costs associated with getting to work are such that it is not viable for the people involved.  Will the staff discommoded in such fashion be offered voluntary redundancy?  Can Mr. Horgan give that commitment?  With Mr. Horgan&rsquo;s background and expertise in industrial relations, it is a poor vindication of the mechanisms, whatever they are, that every form of negotiation or consultation is taking place in the Labour Court.</p> <p>  The region and constituency I come from would not exist were it not for Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  We would not have won all-Ireland matches, nor would we have the Kilcormacs, the Cloghans or the Bracknaghs in my region.  There would be no life or hope for those towns and villages.  There is little hope as it is.  If I get too political, of course I will be stopped, but there is a crisis.  Huge changes have to take place but huge change has taken place.  All the stakeholders have sat around the table, come to an agreement, moved forward and progressed.  We have survived and moved on and Bord na M&oacute;na has diversified, some good, some poor.  The current situation and the manner in which changes are taking place will leave us further decimated because there is no future based on the sort of prerogative employed.  What is the protocol?  When was it agreed and against what background?  It was not against a background in which the employees were being asked to have their work practices turned upside down soon.</p></speech>

I do not want to go any further than to say we expect them to show a profit, roughly in line with performance last year.  I have seen the management accounts.  I would prefer not to go any further.  The full results will be announced in due course.</p> <p>  As far as I can remember, the protocol was agreed some time in 2012 or 2013.  It was negotiated between the management and the company.  It is right that the board is responsible and takes ownership of the overall framework within which negotiations take place but I as chairman do not get involved in the detailed nitty gritty of negotiation.  That is a matter for the company negotiators.  It would be entirely inappropriate for me as chairman to ask whether they can offer a bit here or there.  I do not do that and will not do it.</p> <p>  I do not agree that the company has operated outside the agreed protocol.  This is a fully unionised company.  The trade unions represent the employees fully and we have people who engage full time with the trade unions on all these issues.  I know the negotiations are done in a proper way with the trade unions.  The issue is put forward to them.  Of course sometimes a company proposes something and is prepared to concede on aspects of it and that is what bargaining is about.  One listens to what the other side says and withdraws some of the harsher measures and trades them for others because that is the way negotiations operate.  I am not going to comment on whether there was a proposal to reduce anyone&rsquo;s pay by 30%.  If there was it may have been part of a negotiating proposal.  I would not be aware, and neither should I be expected to be aware, of the details of what takes place in those negotiations.  The trade unions are very careful to ensure this does not spill over.  They do not want negotiations in the public domain.  I am being as open as I can in respect of what is taking place in those negotiations.</p></speech>

Would he not say that it would be incumbent on him, as that conduit, to say whatever protocol they have is not working?  Would he not ask them to renegotiate a protocol that will work and keep them out of the Labour Court, he knowing full well how wrapped up those issues become in the Labour Court, having served on it for 12 years and been chair of it for five years?</p></speech>

Very few - a tiny proportion - of the issues raised go to the Labour Court.  The unions are at this very moment working hard and have committed to doing their utmost to ensure the issues that stand between us, which are difficult issues and there is no denying that, can be resolved at the Labour Relations Commission and not at the Labour Court.  They have told us they are determined to do that.  It is simply untrue.</p></speech>

I think there is a difference between the expectation and the actual.  Workers were entitled to expect, when all the publicity was there about diversification, that job security, the standards and the hours they work would be protected.</p><p>That was one of the reasons put forward in terms of merger and diversification.  The industry employed approximately 4,000 people in the 1980s and currently employs approximately 2,000.  On the one hand we are talking about diversification and securing employment while on the other hand we have seen a dramatic reduction in employment and the consequential impact on the communities in which those jobs were held.  There is also a major impact on the income of people working in those industries.  We can all empathise with the problem that creates.  If someone has a fixed income coming in every week or every month, he or she depends on it, and a reduction would have a big impact.  Surely some way could have been found to look at the issue under the heading of diversification or whatever else to find alternative employment in the event of the weather being bad and not conducive to saving turf or if sales are not as good as projected.</p><p> It is interesting to note that there was no reference in today's discussion about the potential for exports.  We complain about imports from Northern Ireland but no mention at all was made of potential for exports.  Have we given up on peat?</p></speech>

It is for the hobby market.</p> <p>  One of the first things I looked at when I came in was that industry because it has a huge potential for Bord na M&oacute;na.  We have between 40 years and 50 years of stock raw material available to us.  Three weeks ago I spent a week in Holland, Belgium and Germany visiting customers and other potential avenues for peat.  I see that as a major growth area for Bord na M&oacute;na going forward.  The UK is another very strong market for us.  We have the B&amp;Q account, which is our largest account, and we probably have about 30% of the UK market, but that leaves another 70% to go after.  That is key for Bord na M&oacute;na.  When our energy peat runs out, that horticulture business will survive for decades to come.</p></speech>

Will the briquette be dearer than the current peat briquette?  Bord na M&oacute;na sells peat currently for &euro;23 a tonne or &euro;25 a tonne, and it makes briquettes from some of its stock, and so it can produce a briquette much more cheaply.  How much will profits be reduced by the purchase of biomass material, which will make up 50% of the new briquette?</p> <p>  I also have a question for Mr. Horgan.  I asked whether senior management had taken a 30% pay cut.  He said that it was outside the matters under discussion.  However, Bord na M&oacute;na will be an employer up to 2030.  We have all met delegations of workers who have come before the Oireachtas and spoken about a reduction of 30%.  Is the cut being implemented across the board in the company?</p> <p>  Could Mr. Quinn indicate whether it is true that Bord na M&oacute;na does sod peat for percolating areas, be it in Holland, Italy or Germany and how much is the business worth?</p></speech>

I have asked Mr. Quinn if he has any objection to my saying this and he does not.  It is that his salary is in the region of 30% less than the salary that was offered to his predecessor when he joined the company.  To be clear, his predecessor had his pay cut during his term of office, but Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s starting salary has been cut again and is now in the region of 30% less than the starting salary that was offered to his predecessor.</p></speech>

That has to be our goal.  If we achieve a similar price for the peat and the biomass, the briquettes will not be more expensive.</p></speech>

I would be the first to say that they may not be of the same quality.  If the price of the biomass briquette increases, which will be the case until Bord na M&oacute;na can refine the product and get more of it, will market share be lost?  In addition, does Bord na M&oacute;na envisage losing market share in the next few years in the horticulture business in England where there is a huge drive against the use of peat?  Mr. Quinn said Bord na M&oacute;na is seeking to capture some of the additional 70% of market share in the UK.  From what I am aware, there is a huge clampdown on peat in England.  Am I correct in that regard?</p></speech>

Government policy in the UK in the past three to four years has been to move to a peat-free product by 2020.  That has been unsuccessful.  Now the policy is for a voluntary exit from the use of peat.  None of our main customers has exited from peat and there is no drive from government policy to do that.  In fact, some of the peat-free products to replace ours have failed miserably.  Growers want peat.  Until the government convinces the growers, there will be no exit from peat.  Currently, there is not a viable commercial alternative to peat.</p></speech>

I urge the witnesses to maximise the employment potential of the Littleton briquette factory.</p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na should document its position on the public service obligation and carbon tax and the impact they will have on the finances and revenue of the company.  That should be circulated to every Member of the Oireachtas and, in turn, each Member should make their feelings known to the appropriate Minister, in this case the Minister for Finance.  We need to know in precise numbers the cost of the decisions to Bord na M&oacute;na and how will it impact in the future, in particular in terms of employment.</p> <p>  The ongoing negotiations involve very difficult times for the workforce of Bord na M&oacute;na, many of whom are very long-serving employees of the company.

Quite frankly, staff do not feel they are being treated in such a manner currently.  I repeat the question about the number of ongoing cases of bullying and harassment within Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am told the number is very high.  I suggested there were 300 cases but I was told that was not right, but at the same time the number of cases was not quantified.</p> <p>  I also asked about the money spent on consultants.  Could the witnesses confirm that &euro;14 million was spent on consultants last year?</p><p>Can Mr. Horgan quantify how much has been spent on consultants in the past three years since he assumed his role within the organisation?  When I asked a question about preventing board members from engaging with employees, Mr. Horgan said that was no longer the case and that the chief executive officer had had a meeting with employees yesterday.  Is Mr. Horgan satisfied that his board members, particularly worker director board members - Mr. Horgan stated there was no difference between any members - are engaging with the employees?  My colleague Deputy Cowen alluded to the high percentage of disputes ending up in arbitration in the Labour Court, but Mr. Horgan said this was not the case.  I have a letter from one of the unions which states that its shop stewards and local management had not resolved any local issue in the past 14 months and very little has been resolved with the involvement of HR and union officials.  I ask Mr. Horgan to quantify what percentage of disputes have ended up in the Labour Court.</p></speech>

I am from Offaly, so Derrinlough is my main interest, but both Littleton and Derrinlough are very big employers in their respective areas.  In a rural area, 61 employees is a lot, and the same applies in Littleton.</p> <p>  Has the company decided how it will clear the stock, which amounts to 44,000 tonnes?  Will it consider a discounting policy in order to sell the stock?</p> <p>  What efforts is Bord na M&oacute;na making to encourage farmers in the locality to provide biomass to the best possible extent?  A large quantity of biomass is being imported and the use of local supplies would be preferable and very helpful.  I am receiving representations from workers and their unions who are concerned about certain issues that may have been raised by other members.  I appreciate that we cannot discuss ongoing negotiations.  The feeling I have got is that change is happening and it might be useful if the company entered into greater engagement with the workforce about the type of change involved.  The workers are fearful for their future.  Many of them have been good decent and loyal workers.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a highly respected company in the midlands and it has a tremendous reputation.  However, the workers are the ones who contribute so much to that reputation and they are the people we politicians are concerned about, because Bord na M&oacute;na employs so many people.  We want to ensure that the workers are happy and contented in their employment and that there are no fears or concerns for their future.  What kind of engagement has the company had with the employees in order to alleviate the concerns I hear from them, such as reductions in salaries and forced redundancies?  We need to be 100% clear in that regard.</p></speech>

I referred to a meeting between worker directors, the chief executive and myself.  That meeting took place yesterday, but it was a once-off.  All members of the board are treated equally and are required by law to be treated equally.  I have made it clear to the worker directors that it is not appropriate that some directors operate in a different fashion or that any directors have direct access to employees.  All directors have exactly the same duties and responsibilities.  That has been made clear.  Worker directors are not representatives of the employees on the board; they are the same as every other member of the board and are treated accordingly.  I have made that clear since I became chairman, and that will remain the position because that is what is required by good governance.  I do not need to emphasise to any joint committee of the Oireachtas the importance of good governance.  I am determined to ensure that all directors are treated equally, that they exercise the same duties and responsibilities and that there is no special treatment for any particular group of employees by directors.  I wish to make that clear.</p></speech>

It is my job and it continues to be my job to ensure that all directors are fully informed equally so that they can undertake their onerous duties.  That was made clear in a letter I sent to every employee of the company last year prior to the election of the current group of worker directors.

The field has changed for Bord na M&oacute;na in the past two to three weeks because we have received confirmation from the chief executive officer of the ESB that we will keep the three power stations open post-2019.  That allows us to provide 15-year contracts to farmers out to 2030 if they wish to convert to willow.  We have had several meetings with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and his team to put together a package for the next budget round, which is a grant package for the establishment of willow along the lines of the forestry grants in the past.  We must await the outcome of the budget, but we have made a very strong case and submission on that ground, which will make it attractive to the farmers to sign up for long-term deals.  The willow industry has the potential to become a significant employer in the midlands.  I will deal with that aspect in more detail tomorrow with Offaly County Council.</p></speech>

I understand his point about good governance, meaning that everyone on the board is equal.  However, I think he needs to clarify that it is entirely in accordance with good governance and sound governance that worker representatives on a board have a responsibility during and between board meetings to protect and promote the workers' interests as well as the interests of the company.</p></speech>

I also asked about the money that has been spent on consultants since Mr. Horgan assumed his role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-27a.2171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horgan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015052700002#R02200"><p>The proportion of disputes is a very difficult one to pin down because there is the question of what is a dispute.  If we include something that is resolved at local level at first instance, as most disputes are, then maybe 1% of issues go to the Labour Court.  When does an issue become a dispute?  If I have a disagreement with my manager, and I talk to him about it and we resolve it, that is a dispute that has been resolved locally.  If we include that in the proportion, then I would say maybe 1% of disputes get raised to the highest level.</p> <p>  If we include the proportion of issues that are discussed nationally with the trade unions and then go further, I do not know, but it is probably something like 20%.  However, I would not have that kind of intimate knowledge of how those things are resolved.  Lots of things get resolved in the corridor, presumably, between the union official, the negotiators and the HR department.  Most things are done in that sort of way, although there is also a formal process.</p> <p>  If the Deputy's question is related to the proposals the company made as part of the transformation process, in some areas, some of those have been entirely.  For example, the financial shared services issue has been resolved and that is operating with, as far as I am aware, no outstanding issues on that side.</p> <p>  In regard to the transformation process on the peat production side, as I understand it, the unions have adopted the position, which we are quite happy to go along with, that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  There is a large number of issues - up to 20 or 30, depending on how one defines them.  We have been through the first round of discussion with the unions and our proposals have been put to the unions on all of those on the basis that nothing would be agreed until everything is agreed.  The unions then asked us for time to consider those and asked that they would employ consultants - which we paid for, of course - to have a look at and help them with the proposals.  Those consultants took some time and produced a report for the trade unions.  On the basis of that and other information, the unions then asked us for a further extension of the time they had agreed in order to prepare an alternative plan.  We said we were happy to listen to their alternative plan.</p> <p>  This morning, at this very moment, the trade unions are presenting their alternative plan to us in the Labour Relations Commission, as agreed.  We will look at all of those alternative proposals to see whether they can be accommodated.  If they can be accommodated, we will be happy to do that.  However, the unions have agreed with us that the bottom line is the savings must be made.  They are proposing alternative ways of arriving at the savings and we have said to them we will be happy to accept their alternatives, provided they are real savings and will add up to what we want to do.</p> <p>  That is the proper strategy for the company to have adopted.  I fully accept that other Deputies would say another approach ought to have been adopted.  The proposal we have adopted is in accordance with the protocol and with good industrial relations practice.  In so far as the detail is concerned, I am happy that it is correct but I have not been, and will not be, involved in the nitty-gritty of it.  On the broad picture, I think we are doing what we intended to do.  I want to emphasise that every step taken in the Labour Relations Commission has been agreed at the Labour Relations Commission, except that the unions have asked us on two occasions to extend a deadline they had agreed to, and we agreed to extend the deadline twice in the interests of hearing their point of view.</p> <p>  I have no problem in defending the company's position in regard to that strategy.  I think it is the right one for us to have adopted and if other Deputies think that another strategy should have been adopted that the unions did not agree to, they are free to put that forward, but it is not one that has been agreed.  I want to emphasise this point.  We have moved at every stage throughout this negotiation with the agreement of the trade unions as to the stages that we would go through.</p></speech>

People have been told that their job is disappearing.  For example, in financial shared services, we have had a huge investment in IT, which means that a lot of jobs are no longer necessary.  The people there have been told this.  Some have decided to leave the company, others have been re-employed in other jobs and some people have taken jobs at lower salaries - that is true.  We cannot give a guarantee that once a person has a particular job, they will maintain it forever, nor can we say that if we have another job that warrants a lower rate of pay, we will give an employee the higher rate of pay just because he or she happens to have it.  We cannot incur that kind of cost.</p> <p>  Everybody's job is being priced at the market rate for the job.  It is true that in certain areas in Bord na M&oacute;na, salaries were above the market rate.  We are moving as swiftly as we can, by agreement, towards a situation where everyone is paid the market rate for the job rather than above it.  In some instances, of course, that means there are increases but in quite a number of instances in certain areas of the company, we are paying above the market rate and in the current environment, we cannot continue to do that.</p></speech>
