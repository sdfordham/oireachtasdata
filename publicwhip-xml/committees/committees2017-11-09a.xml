    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#B00200"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Georgina O'Mahony, deputy director of audit.  We have received apologies from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings of 24 and 26 October.  Are they agreed t?  Agreed.  As any matter that may arise from the minutes will arise in the course of our work this morning, we will move straightaway to the third item on the agenda, which is correspondence.  </p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A is correspondence specific to this meeting.  Items Nos. 869A and 876A are the briefing document and opening statement from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will note and publish them.  </p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and Ministers in a follow-up on previous meetings, with other items for publication.  Item No. 839B( i-ii) is correspondence, dated 24 October 2017, received from Mr. Gordon Bond in the remuneration, industrial relations and pensions division of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is in response to the committee&rsquo;s request for information on the terms and conditions of employment of certain State employees.  It appears from the information provided that there are approximately 230,000 people who are paid by and entitled to pensions from the State but who are not employees of it.</p><p>The same applies to work in agencies funded by the HSE and the schools and universities in the country.</p><p> The committee followed up the matter, which was raised by an individual, in respect of teachers in particular.  The individual has copied us with other correspondence, which we will deal with later.  The individual raised the question of how teachers can be in receipt of State salaries if they are employed by the local school boards of management.  It is an interesting question.</p><p> From previous correspondence, I understand that the relationship of the State and schools is derived from the provisions of the Constitution.  The State has a constitutional obligation to provide for free primary education.  The Department says that the State discharges its obligations by paying teachers in national schools owned by the churches; making grants available for renovation, repairs and, at times, building of new national schools; and paying for heating in schools, books and the provision of proper curriculum and appropriate supervision.  In accordance with the provisions of the Education Acts, the board of a school manages the school on behalf of the patron.  The Minister for Education and Skills operates a payroll service in respect of teachers and special needs assistants on behalf of the boards of management.  The Minister has statutory functions in terms of setting terms and conditions of employment for teachers and special needs assistants.</p><p> I am unsure whether this is clear in legislation and I would like to receive a note from the Department on the matter.  I note the correspondence did not deal with secondary schools or third level institutions.  We will seek specific further information on the legal position.  The Department has outlined the general position.  Can we agree to get a further note on that before we consider it further?  Agreed.</p><p> The next item is 840B, correspondence dated 24 October, from Barry O'Connor, president of Cork Institute of Technology, providing details, as requested by the committee, regarding a retirement function for the previous president of the college.  The retirement function cost a little under &euro;13,000 and was signed off by the outgoing president himself.  That is an issue we specifically asked about and I imagine many people will have trouble with it.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  The details include &euro;4,892 spent on catering and &euro;5,000 spent on tables, frames, drapes, carpets and audio-visual set-up.  A total of &euro;1,840 was spent on senior staff invitees at the president's dinner.  There were cleaning costs and caretaker overtime costs.  A music quartet played as well.</p><p> The account has been paid in full but I believe some element of control within the finance section of Cork Institute of Technology must not have been followed.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  We will ask the Higher Education Authority to examine the controls that were in place and whether it could happen again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00200"><p>I propose that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00300"><p>That is grand.  You are happy with that, Deputy.  We will proceed on that basis.  I thank the Deputy.  We will get further information on it.  Although that particular horse has bolted, we have no wish for another to bolt.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 841, dated 24 October, from Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  As requested by the committee, the correspondence follows up on the transfer of properties as part of the redress scheme and costs of the child abuse inquiry.  The Department says that it will continue to provide regular updates to the committee in respect of the progress.</p> <p>  I have a proposal in this regard.  Some of this is 15 years old.  If someone said the Department of Education and Skills was to start something today in respect of the transfer of properties and that in 15 years' time the Committee of Public Accounts was still being told that the matter had not been finalised, it would be outrageous.</p> <p>  Representatives of the Department of Education and Skills will be before the committee next Thursday in any event to discuss educational and training boards.  I propose that we allocate the first 15 minutes of the meeting specifically to this matter.  It is 15 years on and it has not been dealt with.  We might allow two speakers five minutes each.  We will not all get in but we cannot let this pass.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00400"><p>This is a matter that I have followed up and raised repeatedly.  Certainly, if representatives of the Department are appearing before the committee to answer questions, I would like to ask some questions.  This would have gone completely under the carpet only for the Committee of Public Accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That report set out the total cost of the redress board, the commission of inquiry and so on.</p> <p>  I zoned in on one building in Galway, which has remained empty since 2009.  It was offered in 2009.  I see from the latest clarification that the Government considered offers in 2011.  It went from 2009 to 2011.  The Government considered it again in July 2013.  At that point, the Department took over.  That is only one example.  That building has remained empty all this time.  It has an upsetting history, which I know intimately.  The council in Galway called by motion for the building to be given over but it was refused.  Rather than give it over and be used, it remained empty.</p> <p>  I am keen to go through all these buildings to discern precisely the position.  First, this is a waste of money.  Second, the deterioration in the building from that time is remarkable.  That is only one example.  It has now been handed over with a contribution of &euro;750,000.  That has been hailed as a donation to the city.  In reality, it is part of a redress scheme.  Certainly, it is the second part of the voluntary redress scheme.</p> <p>  I am dwelling on the matter because it has taken this much time to highlight the matter.  At the same time, a different narrative was being shared with the people of Galway in respect of the matter.  There are all sorts of narratives going on, but really the only narrative is that this building has been scandalously empty.  The money that has now been handed over will not even come close to dealing with the deterioration of the building.  Perhaps 15 minutes is not enough but certainly I welcome the opportunity to put questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00500"><p>Do you want us to put the Secretary General on notice to have specific details in respect of the Galway property?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00600"><p>Yes.  He has given more detail now and we know some details from the local radio, but I wish to discuss all the buildings, including Galway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00700"><p>We will put the Secretary General on notice.  We will allocate 15 minutes to that.  Since it is not the main business of our meeting we should limit it to those members who have a particular interest in it.  We will want to move on to the main business of the meeting.  Given that the man will be here and we have a letter from him today, I believe we should have a short discussion on the matter while he is before the committee prior to getting in to the main business.  That is agreed.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  Next item is correspondence 844B, dating from 24 October, from Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, providing information, as requested, on projects funded by the Department that are processed via the Transport Infrastructure Ireland payment management system.  At our last meeting we asked for funding directly from the Department for various road projects.  The correspondence refers to road restoration, maintenance, road improvement grants, discretionary grants, bridge rehabilitation, safety improvement, works training grants, special grants and strategic projects, various bypasses in Sallins, Adamstown, Portlaoise, Shannon, Laytown and Bettystown, Garavogue, Dingle and the Athy southern distributor road.  However, not one item of money was attached to any of the projects.  It is extraordinary to get a letter in reply when the Committee of Public Accounts asks for specific information in respect of the projects under 20 headings.  The Department has not put one figure on anything.</p> <p>  We are sending the letter back and asking the Department to give us a proper reply with the appropriate money.  We will publish the letter but we are sending it back.  We do not accept that letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00800"><p>In respect of the previous matter, there was one outstanding piece of information from the Comptroller and Auditor General report.  I am sorry for going back to this.  Under the 2002 agreement, outstanding moneys remain unpaid.  Perhaps we could have an update on that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#C00900"><p>That will be communicated to the Department of Education and Skills after today's meeting in advance of next week.</p> <p>  That is the reply from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is being returned to the Department and we will ask for a comprehensive detailed reply.</p> <p>  The next item is 860B, correspondence dated 27 October from Ray Mitchell, parliamentary affairs division of the Health Services Executive, on the membership of the audit committee.  There is a new addition to the committee.  The committee has sent the details to us.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  Next item is correspondence dated 27 October from Martin Shannon, chief executive of IDA Ireland, providing follow-up matters in respect of the meeting on 5 October.  The matters covered include the accommodation costs of IDA Ireland centres abroad, grant aid on a county-by-county basis and a note on the independent assessment carried out by the IDA Ireland and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 864, dated 27 October, from Michael Nolan, chief executive of Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  The correspondence provides a briefing note to the committee, as requested, regarding safety benefit appraisal of the national road scheme.  We will note and publish that.  It was requested at an earlier meeting.</p> <p>  Correspondence Nos. 865B1 and 865B2 are from Si&uacute;n Hanrahan and Professor Alex Middleton, co-acting directors of the National College of Art and Design.</p><p>The correspondence provides an explanatory note on the status of the financial statements for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 as well as progress in relation to meeting the requirement to publish financial statements in a timely manner.  We will only accept this letter when we receive the accounts.  We are still awaiting some of these accounts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#D00200"><p>That is correct, Chairman.  To put it in context, obviously there has been a long running problem with the NCAD producing financial statements.  We have had a difficulty with its accounting records for a number of years.  Three sets of financial statements have been completed in the past 12 months and there are two further sets that require completion.  We are working as hard as we can with NCAD to get those completed and to try to bring them forward for delivery within some kind of reasonable timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#D00300"><p>We will note that and keep it under control.  We will be coming to the issue of financial reporting in the public service separately in a few minutes.  The next item is correspondence No. 866B from Mr. Marty Whelan of HIQA providing follow-up information to the committee arising from the meeting on 28 September.  Matters covered include risk profiling in HIQA and the lease for HIQA's office in Smithfield.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 875B, dated 7 November.  This is also from Mr. Marty Whelan of HIQA providing a note on interactions between Mr. Brian McEnery on the establishment of Letsbuyhealthcare scheme as a partner in BDO and a copy of the invitation of Nursing Homes Ireland to Mr. Brian McEnery to attend a Nursing Homes Ireland meeting on October 2015, as requested at the committee meeting on 19 October 2017.  We will note and publish that.  For the record, we discussed yesterday in private session correspondence that the committee received, namely, the note of the meeting from Eversheds to Nursing Homes Ireland.  The committee decided in private session that it will not be circulating that document and will not be referring to it in public session because the owner of that document, Nursing Homes Ireland, has claimed legal privilege.  By and large, however, the contents of that document are already in the public arena and have been well publicised.  Any discussion we will have will be in relation to the information that is already in the public arena but not in relation to that specific document.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 879B, dated 7 November 2017, from Mr. Marty Whelan of HIQA providing a note on the appeals mechanism for bodies which do not accept HIQA decisions.  This is important given the issues raised by a particular nursing home discussed at our meeting two weeks ago.  HIQA also includes an explanatory note, as requested, on the role and function of the chief inspector and delegation of that function.  This is an issue to which we will return.  We received correspondence from a particular nursing home last week and further information from that nursing home is on its way to us.  We will consider that information when we receive it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#D00400"><p>Is it the same nursing home as the one we discussed yesterday?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#D00500"><p>Yes, it is the same one.  Further information is to come and we will consider it when we get it.  That may happen next week.</p><p>The next item is No. 880B<b>, </b>correspondence dated 7 November 2017 from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. S&eacute;amus McCarthy, attaching two notes on non-standard accounting processes in bodies audited by his office and accounts which are operated outside the Central Fund.  It is good to get that note although I have not had an opportunity to consider it in detail.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General want to speak on it now?We will be returning to it as part of-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#D00600"><p>I think it is probably best to leave it over until people have had an opportunity to study it.  There were two requests made by the committee around special purpose accounts operated by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  There was also a request around the accounting frameworks that were being used and exceptions to standard accounting.  We have tried to provide an overview of the situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017110900002#D00700"><p>We will note and publish it but will hold over the discussion on it.  I ask members to keep it to hand because it is a valuable source of information for us in terms of our work.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for that document.</p><p>Category C is correspondence from or in relation to private individuals and any other correspondence.<b></b>Item No. 827C was held over from our last meeting.<b></b>It is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, providing information sought by the committee on the foal levy and impediments to basing the levy on the actual amount paid by the breeder rather than a standard nomination fee.  We will note and publish that and provide a copy to the person who wrote to the committee on the matter.  </p><p>Nos. 833C and 858C are items of correspondence from the last few weeks from the individual who raised the issue of teachers who are not State employees but who are being paid by the public purse.  The items in question are copies of correspondence with the Taoiseach on the matter.  Given the repetitive nature of the correspondence, I propose we direct the clerk not to circulate further items on which we are copied in relation to this matter.  Documents are being supplied to this committee which are also being sent to the Taoiseach and others.  We are not being asked to do anything with those documents.  It amounts to a lot of correspondence and the issue has been raised with other people.  It is not an issue that we can deal with directly so we will direct the clerk not to circulate any further correspondence from this individual on this particular issue.  </p><p>Item No. 837C (i) (ii) and (iii) is correspondence, dated 23 October 2017, from an individual who made a disclosure to the committee in relation to the appointment of a person to receive protected disclosures in the Department of Employment and Social Protection.  I understand that there have been other communications from the individual.  I propose that we hold over all of these communications and that we consider them all together in coming weeks.  This person has sent a lot of documentation to us.</p><p>Correspondence No. 843C, dated 25 October 2017, is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine providing an update, as requested by the committee, on the case of a particular individual and his herd.  The matter remains <i>sub judice </i>and has not been progressed by the individual in question.  I propose that we send the individual a copy of the correspondence and advise him that it is up to him to progress the matter further through the legal process that has been initiated.  If the individual has initiated legal proceedings he cannot come to us and ask us to operate in parallel to such proceedings.  It is one or the other and given that the legal process is still in existence, I propose that we write to him accordingly on that matter.</p><p>The next item, No. 846C, is correspondence dated 25 October from Mr. Hubert Loftus of the Department of Education and Skills providing a clarification in relation to the Education and Training Board Ireland, ETBI.  The Department provides funding to the tune of &euro;168,000 to ETBI for which it has a service level agreement.  We will note that.  We thought that ETBI was not funded by the State but that is not the case.  It gets a small proportion of its funding from the State.  </p><p>The next item, No. 848C, is correspondence dated 25 October 2017 from Deputy David Cullinane in respect of Connect Ireland and IDA Ireland and the criteria used for assessing job creation.  The Deputy raised this matter last week and asked that the secretariat follow it up with a letter to IDA Ireland.  Does he wish to comment on this now?</p></speech>

We will note that and hold it over until next week.</p><p>Nos.<b></b>850C and 868C are items of correspondence, dated 19 October 2017 and 1 November 2017, from myself with responses to two parliamentary questions on the costs associated with the opening of Stepaside Garda station in 2016 and 2017.  The replies state that no costs have been incurred in 2016 or 2017 to date.  We will note these answers.  We had a lot of discussion on this issue and I understand that a further parliamentary question has recently been replied to by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The aforementioned two parliamentary questions were replied to by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relate to the role of the OPW in connection with the building itself.  There is a reply on its way from the Minister for Justice and Equality on the same topic.  We will note that.  Representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are scheduled to appear before us again at a later date and I am sure that the matter will be raised by someone at that point.  </p><p>The next item, No. 851C, is correspondence dated 26 October 2017 from Dr. Anne Taheny, President of St. Angela&rsquo;s College, providing a note as requested by the committee on corporate governance at the college, the legal costs of an ongoing contractual dispute, the impact on services and the financial position of the college.  We have also received correspondence, No. 859C, from the Secretary General at the Department of Education and Skills, Mr. S&eacute;an &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, providing a note on the legal costs and impact on services of the contractual dispute at St. Angela&rsquo;s College.  The other party in the contractual dispute had written to the committee on the matter.  Both notes are quite comprehensive.  I do not believe it is appropriate for the committee to involve itself in such a contractual dispute, especially one that has been subject to High Court consideration.  I propose that we write to the individual enclosing copies of the correspondence received and relaying the message that it is not the committee's intention to pursue the matter any further.  Is that agreed? Agreed. </p></speech>

NUIG and St. Angela's College have formally merged now but to advance that in terms of the taking over of the property NUIG's legal people are taking one interpretation of the implications of this case and the owners of St. Angela's, namely, the nuns, are taking another interpretation and that is holding up progress.  I suggest that we would invite them in, even if it is after Christmas, just to see if a public airing of some of the issues could advance matters.  I think it would be worthwhile.  In the event that the committee decides not to proceed, given the person who made contact with the committee sought that I should recuse myself from these matters, I would like any letter going back to him recording that the committee decided not to proceed noting that I was a dissenter on the matter because I would prefer that we would have a public airing of it.</p></speech>

The two organisations involved have two different interpretations of it.  At this stage I think it is a matter for the Higher Education Authority, HEA, which is responsible for those organisations.  We should pass the matter on to the HEA and ask it to follow up on it.  It is more appropriate for the HEA.

It obviously relates to matters from some years ago and the court case involved was some years ago as well.  It became a stumbling block to the amalgamation of St. Angela's and NUIG but the notes that are provided now suggest that agreement has been reached and that stumbling block has been gotten over.  That was really why it became a live issue again in recent times.  It is expected, according to the correspondence that is here, that matters will be resolved with NUIG and that the amalgamation will proceed.  If that happens then I would consider it is a matter in the past.</p></speech>

We will send the matter to the HEA for it to deal with it and to keep us updated on progress.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence dated 9 November, No. 853C, from Ian Carter, chief executive of Beaumont Hospital, in regard to compliance with procurement requirements.  Details are provided of breaches of the requirements and the CEO points out that there is ongoing work to formalise what had been historical relationships and to reduce the level of non-compliant expenditure in the future.  There is a detailed letter which emerged from us noting breaches of procurement rules in its annual accounts.  I will just refer to one sentence in regard to Noel Recruitment and the sum of &euro;365,000.  It was pointed out that this recruitment is not fully subject to the procurement regulations as it is an Annex II B service under the Directive 2014/18/ EC and an Article 74 service under the Directive 2014/24/EU.  It is not considered a cross-border interest and that is why it probably did not advertise it on that basis, but it anticipates that it will bring such matters into line.  There seems to be a significant amount of technical issues involved but we will note it and we will keep after all those organisations in regard to non-compliance with procurement issues in the future.  We will note that.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 855C, correspondence dated 24 October 2017 from Deputy Brendan Smith, forwarding a resolution from Monaghan County Council for the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate Eirgrid's financial expenditure for the past 16 years.  We received a similar resolution from Monaghan County Council in January.  Eirgrid does not come within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts as it is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is a commercial semi-State operation.  At the time we requested a note from the Minister on the matter and forwarded the reply to Monaghan County Council.  We also wrote to the sectoral committee which I believe had an engagement with Eirgrid in May of this year.  I also understand from the clerk that that committee has received further correspondence from Monaghan County Council in the past month.  I propose that we write to Monaghan County Council and include Deputy Brendan Smith in the correspondence, enclosing copies of previous correspondence, pointing out that the sectoral committee has more latitude than the PAC in this area.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 854C, correspondence dated 24 October 2017 from the Rehab group, in regard to the funding of section 39 organisations to pay staff in line with public sector increases.  Rehab claims that funding has not been provided to restore pay to their employees even though the employees took the same cuts as public sector employees during the austerity years and that its ability to retain staff is affected.  This was a matter which was discussed at our recent meeting with the HSE.  That exact point was well discussed with the HSE and it is an issue for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and nursing homes as well.  The costs for some organisations are increasing but that is not being matched by an increase in funding from the State body.  Can we note the item because we did discuss it on the previous occasion with the HSE?</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy's point is correct.  We will send the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Health.  I think we should also send it to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform because the issue is a difficult one.</p><p>When the minimum wage rises as a result of Government legislation, those who are employing people on the minimum wage expect that the same Government would provide funding to meet that increase.  The argument is that the Government is not doing so and that this is making staff retention difficult.  It is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and this committee will highlight the impact this is having.  We will send it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health but also directly to the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform for his consideration.<br/><br/>Item 856C is correspondence dated 23 October from an individual relating to the alleged waste of &euro;50,000 by Dublin City Council on the digging of bore holes on the individual&rsquo;s property.  I propose that we write to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/>Item No. 857C(i) to (vi) is correspondence dated 22 October 2017 from an individual relating to the value of a land on which two schools are to be built.  The individual suggests that the price paid was excessive and that the site remains unsuitable.  An article from a magazine plus documents obtained through a freedom of information request are attached.  The individual was in contact with the committee previously and we received a note from the Department explaining the purchase process and rationale.  With the agreement of the individual, I propose that we forward this correspondence to the Department to address any further issues raised.  Just to refresh everyone's memory, this is about a school in Wicklow.  The matter came before the committee a few months ago as an issue arose with regard to the location of a new school.  We have already dealt with it but there are still outstanding issues.  We will now pass it over to the Department and ask that it deal with the individual directly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/><b></b>Item No. 861C is correspondence dated 20 October 2017 from a group which calls itself FLAME, or Former Local Authority Members &Eacute;ire, in relation to the winding up of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.  The winding up is related to a policy decision to abolish town and borough councils.  The group has reported matters to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I propose that we write to the group stating that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be allowed to carry out its investigation.  The Committee of Public Accounts will not carry out an investigation of the alleged criminal matters referred to in the letter because such matters are the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/>Item No. 862C is correspondence dated 25 October 2017 from an individual, which was copied to several others, entitled &ldquo;Ongoing Revenue fraud by the Office and the DPP&rdquo;.  The purpose of the email is not clear.  We will note it and move on.  <br/><br/>The next item, No. 867C, is correspondence dated 2 November 2017 from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing information requested by the committee on insurance arrangements for local authorities, including Dublin City Council.  We will note this.  I am sure committee members will want to read that correspondence and possibly refer back to it at a later date.</p></speech>

It receives very little funding and is just an umbrella group.  It has no function in terms of funding.  It is simply an association of the ETBs.  It provides some information and training courses but it has no governance role.  The HEA and the Department are the ones with a direct role in this area.  We considered this matter previously but realised that ETBI is not even funded directly by the Department.  It is just an association of the ETBs.  It would be like bringing in one of the local government-----</p></speech>

Yesterday, the HEA issued a statement on Dr. Richard Thorn's independent review of certain matters and allegations relating to the University of Limerick.  We received the letter too late to circulate.  In any event it was publicised in the media yesterday and we will just note two or three points.  We will come back and discuss it in more detail.  From the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts this issue was raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and we raised it here.  The review looked at eight packages and severance packages totally &euro;1.7 million.  There are several key points in the report but the report does not deal with what the university had told key stakeholders and that includes us.  This report did not deal with the issue of the evidence that came to us and over which there is a question mark.  The report recommended that the University of Limerick prepare a comprehensive and accurate account of the circumstances of each of the severance payments to be sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The report is coming back to us.  That is as much information as I have on it at the moment.</p></speech>

The pensions were handled by local authorities in relevant areas.  In 2015, there were to the statutory changes to the pension scheme.  Anybody who was on a pension scheme in the institutes of technology pre-2013 was brought into a new pension scheme.  The legislation that set that up provided for the institutes to be liable.  However, in their financial statements, they have not recognised those liabilities.  The pensions are being paid by the pensions section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as the agent of the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a question as to where the liability should be recognised.  I am just drawing attention to it because it is not compliant with the framework for accounting that the institutes of technology are following.  I am obliged to do that.  It is a technical matter as to where the liability exists.  Nobody is suggesting that the pensions will not be paid but there are different accounting arrangements and nobody is recognising the liability that has already accrued and continues to accrue.</p></speech>

I refer to the baselines in respect of the distribution of local property tax and it was in recognition of the pension change.  That was the exclusive reason for it.  The local authorities became not liable but the liability was at national level.  It is an accounting matter.  Perhaps it is just a policy matter.  However, since they were linked to the local authorities, why was that change not made?  The two were originally linked.</p></speech>

It is an economic issue rather than purely an accounting issue.  However, it has accounting implications.  From 2013 onwards, people who join a public body are in the single public sector pension scheme.  In that situation, the employee contributions have to be remitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because that Department will be on the hook for paying the pensions in due course.  Anybody who is a pre-2013 employee is on an existing scheme for which there are many different kinds of accounting arrangements.  I am not sure all the employee contributions for pre-2013 employees are going to the centre.  It is a very complex matter.  Those in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are probably the best people to address any concerns the Deputy may have.  They own the policy in relation to all these matters.</p></speech>

It has done so.  What I am doing here is drawing attention to a situation that has persisted for five years now.  It has an accumulated deficit and it is not the only institute of technology in that situation.  There are about five or six of them in a similar situation.  They are required by the HEA to present a plan that will allow them to move into a surplus situation, to stabilise and ensure that they are going concerns into the future.</p></speech>

This week, the Comptroller and Auditor General published his special report No. 99 on public sector financial reporting for 2015.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his work.  Briefly, there are 224 semi-State, health, education, and North-South agencies with a turnover of &euro;43.7 billion.  We are not talking about Government Departments here, rather we are talking about all the other agencies.  Of these, 60% failed to produce their financial accounts for audit within the required three-month period.  This is unacceptable and we have already indicated that the Committee of Public Accounts will not be prepared to tolerate this any longer.  Primarily these organisations have received public funding and they have not produced financial statements to account for that.</p><p>The job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hold these organisations to account, and we would not be doing our job.  There is far too lax an approach right across Irish public life, where people are not being held to account.  We will be coming back to this report but I am asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to assist us. Specifically, prior to our next meeting, I want him to give us the list of those organisations who have still not presented their 2015 accounts to him for audit.  It is only a small number at this stage.  We will write to them, to the chairperson specifically as well as perhaps the chief executive, demanding that they account for their failure, not for any-----</p></speech>

I expect it will be that there were complications.   However, despite all the excuses up to now, we consider that they have failed to meet their duties and we want them to account for their failures regarding the 2015 accounts, and not with some soft explanation.  We will be writing to them saying that we want them carried out immediately.  Next week, we will draft a letter to that group saying that we want the 2016 accounts completed by the end of this year, and that they are to have the 2017 accounts completed by the end of March 2018.  We are not tolerating receiving accounts for this year in two years' time.  We would not be doing our job.  It is time the public sector was made accountable.  That concerns 2015 accounts.  That is the letter that will address that.</p> <p>  I am also asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to give me a list of those organisations that have still not presented their 2016 accounts to you for audit.  There will be a number on that list, but I do not have the number.  We will write to tell them to account for their failure to meet their obligations, to have the 2016 accounts issued immediately to him, and to have their 2017 accounts issued by the 31 March 2018.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General might not have the third list I want for next week but if he has, well and good; if not, we will have it the following week.  I want a list of those organisations which have submitted their 2016 account for audit, but did not do so by the end of March in 2017 - in other words, the accounts came in in six, seven or eight months after the year's end, more than three months late.  We will write to those, acknowledging that their accounts have been received, but saying that with their 2017 accounts they must meet the deadline of the end of March 2018.  There are three different groups.  We are going to have this list in front of us in future.  There will have to be accountability.  If they are lax in their work, we will not be lax in ours.  I will call Deputy Cullinane and then Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

I have not read the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report.  I would imagine, and perhaps I am wrong, that it would give us a glimpse of some of the reasons some public bodies are not up to date with their accounts.  Perhaps at the next meeting we should have ten or 15 minutes, or less, for the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us an overview of the main issues.  That would inform how we approach those organisations so that we can be fair.  In some organisations, there could be perhaps not a good reason, but a reason.  Also, concerning process, I would imagine that there is commonality.  There is probably an overlap in some of them.  If there are issues that need to be improved in the area of process, then that is what we need to examine.</p></speech>

However, there is a feeling that we cannot even get to that.  There is a huge amount of going forward and backwards, and, I am sure, a huge administrative burden in trying to get these accounts audited.  Is there an additional burden on the Comptroller and Auditor General's office as a consequence of these particular audits not being delivered on time, or is that burden quantified?  Does this impact on the treadmill of audits, and how you distribute the work over the year within your office?  Are there sanctions?  We heard last week that essentially the buck stops with this committee.</p></speech>

Maybe it is time that, along with looking at this, we look at what potential sanctions could be applied for non-adherence, over and above appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts.  It would have struck me as a pretty basic function that they should fulfil.  If we are going to change behaviour, there has to be a mechanism for doing so, and I do not think just appearing before the Committee for Public Accounts, or the risk of that, is enough, given the length of time some of these are outstanding.</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy has touched on this.  If all these institutions were to give their accounts regularly and keep up to date, what implication has that for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office staff?  He might address that particularly.</p></speech>

Almost all public sector bodies, with the exception of third level education bodies and one or two others, are on a calendar year basis.  What we face, therefore, is a very highly peaked demand for work.  There are a number of strategies that we try to follow to deal with that peak.  One of the things we would like to do is to do audit testing in-year.  It is called interim audit testing.  That works quite well with the HSE, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and so on, that is, larger entities with bigger budgets and more transactions.  Due to the fact that there are organisations that are in arrears, it is a bit of a job to shift the emphasis to carrying out the audit after delivery of the financial statements in total.  That is one of the strategies, and it will take time to turn the ship and get into a more efficient situation.</p> <p>  The second thing we do is contract out a certain number of sets of financial statements for audit to private sector auditors.  They carry out the audit work and report to me.  I still issue the audit opinion, so we would have a certain amount of review.  That helps us.  It gives us additional resources at the time when the peak occurs.  Those are the kind of strategies that we need to undertake.  </p> <p>  Obviously, the first and most important issue for us is to get the financial statements delivered.  We have been taking a harder line in recent years whereby if the financial statements are thrown in but they are not ready for the audit, we discount that.  We do not regard that as having been received.  They have to be ready for audit when they submit the financial statements, and then we try to schedule as optimally as possible.  Realistically, however, without an enormous increase in the resource level, we could not have all the financial statements audited within, say, the first half of the year.  That just would not be possible.</p></speech>

When we do our scheduling, we do it on the basis that the financial statements as presented are correct, and that our work will effectively be focused on validating that, and checking that what they have presented is correct.  The difficulty we run into is when there are errors in the financial statements, or particularly if there are propriety matters or report matters that cause a problem.  The process then gets slowed down.  In that situation, we have carried out the audit but it takes a long time to get follow-up explanations.  It is difficult for us to do it right in a very narrow timeframe.  We take a very wide view of the business of an organisation.</p><p>We consider propriety issues that may not be considered to the same degree by a private sector auditor doing standard financial statements and the question arises of whether the financial statements are correct.  That creates a complication for us, slows the process and knocks out other schedules, for instance, if we are scheduled to do an audit and find they are not ready we may not have anybody else lined up immediately.  It takes a week or so and we lose time.  There are many aspects to this.  We try to assist and to be as helpful as possible but if somebody misses their slot, for whatever reason, we cannot necessarily go back and do it.  We also cannot walk away from a client.  If a client has a problem we are stuck with one another.  A private sector auditor would say they will not do this but we do not have that luxury.</p><p> There are several sectors where the three-month submission date is not actually the prescribed date.</p></speech>

Can any sanctions be built in?  Someone running a business must have the audit done for the taxman and if it is not done the person is fined or there is a surcharge or interest to pay and so on.  Are there any fines in this case?  This is public money, given to people and they are two years behind.  I find it hard to believe that we are giving money for 2018 to someone who has not shown audits for 2015.  There should be some repercussions where public money is being given to a body that has not given its accounts for two or almost three years.  That is unbelievable.</p></speech>

What I have outlined is step one.

The Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills will be here next week. </p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien said that in respect of every organisation, and there are hundreds of them, that get a grant from the HSE in excess of &euro;150,000, it is in receipt of 100% of the 2015 accounts, completed.  It is well over 70% of the way through the 2016 accounts and we are not near the end of the year.  He did not threaten to cut their funding but to delay it until such time as they got their accounts in.  That resulted in 100% compliance by the sections 38 and 39 organisations.  That has not happened in any other section.  There is a great lesson to be learned from how the HSE did it, without any statutory authority, just a straight business approach, if they delayed sending in accounts it would delay sending out next year's cheques.  It brought them all to heel.  That is remarkable.  I asked him if he could second some of the staff who achieved that to another Department.  We had a good laugh at the end of it.  I am not saying we should go that far but the HSE is one third of the public service.  It has achieved this as a result of the pressure from what goes on here.  We can actually achieve something.  The first step is to get the audited accounts in.  We do our job and we put the pressure on others to do their job.</p> <p>  The work programme for today is to meet the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  Next week we will meet the Department of Education and Skills, Solas, City of Dublin Education and Training Board, ETB, Kilkenny and Carlow ETB, Kildare and Wicklow ETB and Tipperary ETB.  That is four ETBs.  We will break it into three sessions, first, the Department of Education and Skills and Solas; the second group will be City of Dublin and Kilkenny and Carlow ETBs; and the third will be Kildare, Wicklow and Tipperary ETBs.  We have said that all people from all organisations are to be present for the duration of all the meetings.  We want the people from City of Dublin ETB to hear what Solas says and people from Tipperary to hear what is said about Kildare and Wicklow because we want them to hear what is going on.  Some may have particular issues, others not.  If they do not all fit in the Public Gallery some of them will be asked to sit for the duration of the day's proceedings.  Next week's meeting will be long, with three separate sessions of two hours apiece.  There might be a voting bloc between them. </p></speech>

That is part of its role, and perhaps it takes up most of our time, but a significant part of the role of the Committee of Public Accounts is to look at the income side of things, including revenue collection and taxation receipts.  In this case the Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a specific chapter on the corporation tax receipts, and we will deal with that specifically.  </p><p> Everyone who has written about this issue has mentioned the volatility of corporation tax receipts and the risk to the Exchequer and public services by heavy reliance for a large proportion of that tax - some 75% - on the multinational sector.  In addition to that, I believe that ten Irish companies are paying a very high proportion of that corporation tax; perhaps as high as 36%.  It is a risky business and an issue we need to examine.  We will be examining the Revenue Commissioners on that issue, but it is important for the Committee of Public Accounts and the public at large to hear from the Revenue on one side and the multinational companies on the other, including their understanding of how the taxation system works in Ireland.  There has been much discussion on this matter, and because corporation tax is a specific chapter we need to examine the interactions between the multinational sector and the State on tax receipts.  We will not be able to look at information other than what has been published.  These companies are all listed on the stock exchange.  However, I believe we should invite some of these major companies in to assist us.  I have looked at the situation and had the Oireachtas Library and Research Service prepare a paper for me in the last couple of weeks on corporation tax receipts.  The main areas concerned are the financial-insurance sector, the IT sector and the manufacturing sector.  I am proposing that we write to these companies.  It is likely to be early in the new year before they are able to avail of the opportunity to come in.  We will ask those parties to send the person who is most equipped to deal with taxation issues and with the Exchequer.  We will ask these companies to provide assistance to us.  These companies, and many similar companies, have attended in Westminster and the House of Representatives.  They all have a big footprint in Ireland, and they should show the same respect to our Parliament as they have shown to other national parliaments.  </p><p> I have had a look at some of the biggest players.  If any of the members of the committee notes that a major player has been left out we will discuss it.  I am proposing that from the finance sector we invite JP Morgan and CitiBank, from the IT sector we invite Apple and Google, and from the pharmaceutical and medical devices sector we invite GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.  They are six big companies, and it would help our understanding of how the system operates enormously.  We will draft a suitably worded letter of invitation.  It is a voluntary attendance of course, but when we worked on Project Eagle companies such as Lazard from outside the State came to the committee to assist us in our work.  Hopefully these organisations will show the same respect to the Irish national parliament as they have shown to other national parliaments.  I would like to get this in motion.  No letter will issue until we clear the content.  It is slightly unusual, so we have to frame it in a proper way.  At this point there will be requests for these companies to appear voluntarily.</p></speech>

It might be found then that there is a tax shelter being used or that section 110 reliefs have been used in a way that was not anticipated.  Can we have insight into some of the thinking behind this from the Department of Finance?  Some of these things ended up using fairly significant tax shelters.</p></speech>

The Chairman gave the example of these companies appearing in different jurisdictions and committees of parliaments.  Some of those committees are very high-powered and have many staff, and the members have lots of support.  We do not have that.  It is a caveat to this.</p> <p>  Much of this focusses on alleged loopholes that these companies were operating to avoid paying tax.  This is all legal and above board, but the companies were allowed to use structures to reduce their tax liability.  The Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has done a lot of work on this already.  Can we get a briefing for the members of this committee on what the lie of the land and the tax code was before the changes?  There were changes made in 2013 and 2015.  Perhaps that is contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, but I doubt all of it is.  It would be useful to have as much information as possible available to us to prepare for those meetings.  I imagine that we are talking about meeting the companies next year, so that gives the secretariat enough time to get solid briefing packs for us.  We also require the information about the operation of the tax code and the changes that were made.  Otherwise we will not be able to do the type of job that is required.  Given the limited resources that we have we will depend on as much background information as we can get.</p></speech>

We might possibly need a senior taxation consultant from some establishment who is very <i>au fait</i>with this and can inform and educate this committee on how we need to deal with those we are meeting.  The level of taxation expertise required does not exist anywhere in the Oireachtas.  It is not its function.  We will have to use the consultancy budget, with the agreement from the commission, to allow us to get proper professional advice for that situation.  That is a good suggestion.</p></speech>

When we were in Cardiff for the conference on public accounts, we found that there was precedent for bringing these companies before a public accounts committee.

I fully agree with the suggestion, and I agree with my colleague that we cannot do this with the staff that we have.</p></speech>

This was distributed across six expenditure programmes, including a new programme in 2016 reflecting the additional responsibility for environment policy transferred to the Department as part of the restructuring of portfolios following Government formation.  As part of that transfer, the Department also took on responsibility for management of the environment fund, which had a budget of around &euro;35 million for 2016.</p> <p>  The expenditure under the Vote was divided between the various programmes is as follows.  The largest expenditure programme - accounting for &euro;241 million, or more than half of the total spent &ndash; related to broadcasting.  That programme was substantially funded by television licence fee receipts, which totalled just under &euro;214 million in 2016.  Most of the expenditure under the programme was in the form of grants of just over &euro;179 million paid to RT&Eacute;, and &euro;35.4 million to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.  &euro;13.7 million was paid into the broadcasting fund, and &euro;11.5 million was paid to An Post in respect of its costs of collecting the broadcasting licence fees on behalf of the Department.</p> <p>  The Department spent &euro;86 million on the energy programme in 2016, &euro;66 million of which was committed for energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p> <p>  The Department spent just over &euro;43 million on the environment and waste management programme in 2016.  More than half of the programme spending in 2016 was to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition, the Department had a budget under the environment fund in 2016 of around &euro;35 million for environmental projects and initiatives.  That expenditure is accounted for separately.</p> <p>  The voted provision for the communications programme in 2016 was &euro;34.7 million, but the expenditure outturn was just over &euro;19 million, an underspend of &euro;15.7 million, or 45%.  Almost three quarters of this arose because of unexpected delays in the procurement process for the roll-out of national broadband.</p> <p>  The Department spent just over &euro;30 million under the inland fisheries programme, mainly in grant support for Inland Fisheries Ireland and the North-South Loughs Agency.  Spending on this programme was over &euro;2 million higher than originally provided, mainly due to additional funding provided for the fit-out of a new national warehouse and the purchase of new equipment for Inland Fisheries Ireland.  The Department spent almost &euro;20 million on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.  About half of the expenditure related to the specialist functions and services of the Geological Survey of Ireland.</p> <p>  The net expenditure on the Vote was around &euro;32 million less than was provided for in the 2016 Estimate.  The Department got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;12 million in unspent capital funding to 2017.  The balance of the surplus of &euro;20 million was due for surrender.</p> <p>  This brief outline of the Vote expenditure indicates that the Department oversees and funds a broad range of public sector bodies.  It also has responsibility for oversight of a number of major commercial State bodies that do not receive ongoing grant funding.  These include An Post, EirGrid, the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.</p> <p>  I have provided the committee with a diagram that aims to summarise the public bodies within the Department&rsquo;s aegis, indicating those which I audit and those that are outside my remit.</p></speech>

I will introduce them now: Orla Ryan, principal officer; Triona Quill, principal officer; Brian Walsh, assistant principal; and Frank Groome, assistant principal.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned at the outset, our Department has changed in formation since the last time I appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are now the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, whereas the last time I appeared here we were the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I ask the committee not to be fooled by the name change because the Department obviously still holds the energy and natural resources functions.  Our remit, then, expands significantly beyond functions relating to communications, broadcasting, postal, energy, natural resources and inland fisheries to encompass responsibility for the areas of climate change, waste management, resource efficiency, air quality and environmental policy.  These new structures have been in place since May 2016.</p> <p>  The Department made significant progress in 2016 on a range of commitments set out in the programme for Government and in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2016-19.  Total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2016 amounted to just under &euro;439 million, some &euro;42 million or 8.7% below the budgetary allocation of &euro;481 million.  The underspend related primarily to lower than expected expenditure on the national broadband plan, energy research projects and the demand-led sustainable energy schemes, the delayed commencement of landfill remediation projects and reduced broadcasting expenditure due to lower than forecast TV licence receipts. </p> <p>  I will set out briefly the key strategic priorities supported from the Vote in 2016.   Delivering a &ldquo;connected&rdquo; economy and society where every citizen, company and community can realise the full social and economic potential of the digital world is a policy priority.  Some &euro;14 million was spent on communications, multimedia developments and the information society.  The Department continued to progress the procurement process under the national broadband plan.  The plan has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.5 million or 65% of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland can get access to high-speed broadband and this footprint is expanding.  By 2020, through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention, about nine out of ten premises in Ireland will have access to high-speed broadband.</p> <p>  The Department continued to support digital entrepreneurship and to promote engagement by small businesses with the digital economy.  To date, some 4,000 businesses have been awarded grant assistance under the Department&rsquo;s trading online voucher scheme, while 9,000 businesses have benefitted from advice and peer-to-peer support under the scheme.  A new digital skills for citizens scheme was launched in 2016 under which community and voluntary organisations will provide 25,000 people annually with ten hours of free digital skills training. </p> <p>  Expenditure in 2016 in the broadcasting area amounted to almost &euro;240 million.  Of this, some &euro;179 million was paid in grant aid to RT&Eacute; in respect of revenue from the sale of television licences.  Exchequer funding of &euro;26.1 million and TV licence fee funding of &euro;9.3 million was provided to TG4 to deliver on programme commitments.  Licence fee funding of &euro;13.65 million was provided to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to support the audio and audiovisual media sector in the production of new television and radio programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, as well as programmes in the Irish language.</p> <p>  Some &euro;80 million in Exchequer funding was spent in the energy area in 2016.  Using less energy, and using it more efficiently, is the most cost-effective and accessible way for us all to take action on climate change.  Expenditure of just under &euro;58 million under the better energy programme, which is delivered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, supported energy efficiency upgrades to approximately 25,000 homes and 385 community and commercial buildings in the drive to reduce CO2 emissions. </p> <p>  The warmth and well-being pilot scheme to provide deep energy efficiency upgrades to people suffering from acute respiratory conditions who live in poor quality homes has grown from a base of 72 home completions following its launch last year to approximately 400 this year.  To date, Government investment in energy efficiency has supported the upgrade of more than 350,000 homes, or one in every five homes in the country. </p> <p>  The purchase of more than 600 new electric vehicles was grant-aided in 2016.  This will need to increase significantly in the coming years and the decisions taken in this year&rsquo;s budget and Estimates will allow us to ramp up support for low-emissions vehicles.  Renewable transport, renewable heat and renewable electricity generation all must significantly increase over the coming years as we move progressively towards the national objective of a competitive, low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. </p> <p>  Some &euro;9.8 million was spent on various geoscience projects, including INFOMAR, the national seabed mapping project, and the Tellus programme, which is updating the State&rsquo;s geological mapping data sets.  </p> <p>  Just over &euro;29 million was paid to meet the administration and operational costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland, and the Loughs Agency in 2016.  This funding enabled Inland Fisheries Ireland to undertake some 188,000 patrol hours and 36,000 inspections.  The Department provided &euro;24.9 million to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in 2016 to support the delivery of its core functions.  In the area of waste management, funding of &euro;7.8 million was made available to local authorities in respect of landfill remediation projects. </p> <p>  In conclusion, the Department continued during 2016 to oversee and implement a wide range of policies and programmes which have a significant strategic national importance and which are essential to our national economic and sustainable development.   I look forward to assisting committee members with any questions they may have today. </p></speech>

Faoi dheireadh, t&aacute; cothroma&iacute;ocht inscne le feice&aacute;il ag an mbord, comhghairdeas leis an Roinn.  At last we have some gender equality here and it is welcome to see.  It is the first time for me to see this after almost two years in the Oireachtas.  I also offer my congratulations on the clear accounts, with the exception of the procurement account to which we might come back later.  The Department covers such a broad range of areas.  Climate change is obviously major.  The Chairman might tell me when I am halfway through my allocated time because I want to start with some practical questions and then come back to climate change at the end.  In its air quality report for 2016, the EPA confirms that the European Environment Agency, EEA, estimated that 1,510 premature deaths took place in Ireland in 2014 because of poor air quality.  The EEA is obviously basing this on World Health Organization, WHO, standards, which are thankfully very high.  We will come back to this.</p> <p>  My first question concerns details on landfill remediation given on page 21 of the accounts.  Perhaps Mr. Griffin could clarify some things for me here on this remediation.  The Estimate provision was substantial but the outturn was much less.  There is also a note here stating the reason for the delay.  The report also refers to a consultant's report.  Can Mr. Griffin explain that to me?  There was a delay because of a consultant's report and there was a delay because of complexity.  How many remediation projects are we talking about in total?  How many of those were delayed?  I would appreciate it if Mr. Griffin could just give me the answers.</p></speech>

I will be guided by the Deputy in terms of the amount of information she wants.</p><p> There was an underspend of approximately 41% in 2016 in the context of the amount we had expected to expend.  When one looks at the nature of the beast with which one is dealing - Deputy Catherine Murphy will be very familiar with this regarding Kerdiffstown - one realises that these are very complex projects.  They require statutory consent before proceeding.  They must meet the relevant procurement rules.  They may also involve complex legal cases and that is the case in terms of a number of them.  There is a need for a technical assessment to be undertaken on each project that we are proposing to fund in order to ensure that we understand: the nature of the problem and the options available; that stakeholder engagement has taken place; that funding is available; and the position on the scope of works we are proposing to fund.</p><p> Looking at 2016 specifically, there were six projects that we had proposed to fund to a greater extent than actually occurred in 2016.  The first was Kerdiffstown in County Kildare.  The delay there arose because of time taken to prepare the planning application, the EIA and the waste licence application.  Fingal Harriers in Timoole, County Meath, was the subject of ongoing legal action.  Stackallan in Slane, County Meath, was the subject of ongoing negotiations between the site liquidator and Meath County Council.  The progress anticipated in respect of Portlaw Cotton Mill in County Waterford was not made.  The site is in private ownership and it has a complex character involving environmental, heritage and social interests.  The final one that did not progress to the extent that the local authorities and ourselves expected was that relating to Shannon Vermicomposting.</p><p> One can see that there are delays.  From our perspective, we want this to happen as quickly as possible in terms of the remediation action that is required because this has very significant impacts on the local communities, significant impacts on the environment and potential significant impacts on watercourses.  As I said, if one takes 2016 in isolation, we would not be satisfied with the level of progress made.  However, there are justifiable reasons why matters did not progress in the way we had foreseen.</p><p> The picture is probably a lot better when one looks at it in its broadest sense.  If one goes back to the genesis of this, which is a European Court of Justice case in 2012 whereby the court found against Ireland in respect of systemic problems with aspects of our waste system, including the extent of legacy local authority dumps and illegal landfills in particular.  A commitment given by the Government at the time to the effect that a programme of measures would be put in place.  One of those measures would be to provide funding for the remediation of these landfills.  Of the 58 to which that case related, I would say that in excess of 40 have now been completed.  We are left with a number that have yet to be addressed, albeit some of them quite complex.</p><p> In the context of the six that we have identified, we would expect that progress will have been made during the course of this year.  Money has been provided in the Vote for that and, indeed, we have provided money into 2018 to continue the programme of works.</p></speech>

Each of the three regional waste management plans have identified legacy landfills of high, medium or low-risk categorisation.  The ones that fall into the high-risk categorisation come to 70 or 71 - I am not sure of the exact figure.  They are spread right across the country.  In the Deputy's county, one has South Park in Galway city, Gort, New Inn, Glenamaddy, Tuam, Rinkippeen and Portumna.  That level of problem is still reflected across the State.  While our initial focus was on dealing with the cases that were the subject of the European Court of Justice finding, we will have to continue a programme of remediation works for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  We are working with the local authorities, the CCMA-----</p></speech>

It is a distinct and separate phase and is not deemed critical to the overall success of the work completed to date.  Approximately &euro;10 million is required to carry out that work.  We do not have a budget agreed yet to complete the work and we need to undertake a review of the works required to remediate Garryard to get a final figure on that.  That is the Silvermines site.  We have done the bulk of the work that was required on the Silvermines site.</p></speech>

Looking at the trends between 2008 and 2016 - to give the Deputy a few figures to illustrate the variability in the level of sales that occurs in any given year - we had a reduction of 64,000 in the number of licences sold between 2008 and 2012.  We had a reduction of 18,000 between 2011 and 2012.</p></speech>

The variability is one reason.  The other reason we would expect to have seen an increase is the efforts An Post has taken to tackle evasion.  There was a major advertising campaign and an increase in recruitment of temporary inspectors.  Another factor we would have programmed in during 2015 when we were doing the Estimate was the expectation that legislation would have been introduced in 2016 to allow the Minister hire procurement agents.  We saw what happened in the UK when it outsourced its collection of TV licences: the evasion rate went from approximately 13% to 7%.  A number of things were factored in that we expected would have had an effect.  One can add to that the economic growth that was expected during 2016.  When there is economic growth, people start to invest more in household goods, including televisions.</p></speech>

I will conclude on climate change, which has come under Mr. Griffin's Department's remit.  We are aware of all the reports on climate change.  We have seen the most recent recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly begging us for leadership and pointing out that all sorts of measures could be taken.  The members of the Citizens' Assembly are happy to pay increased taxes and consider carbon tax and so on.  What leadership has Mr. Griffin's Department shown regarding the challenge of climate change?  Where can I identify the money set aside in this regard?  I see the expenditure on measures relating to energy and I see underspends in respect of various items.</p></speech>

There has been a considerable increase in the number of homes that have been the subject of energy retrofit work that has been completed.  As stated earlier, 350,000 properties have been retrofitted by the State.  We are doing a lot of work in the Department on the renewable energy front as well.  We are seeing good progress being made there.  We had a very ambitious target of 40% of electricity from renewable energy by 2020; we are now up to over 27%.  I will talk about a number of things the Department is doing that are very relevant to the climate agenda but then I want to say something about other Departments because-----</p></speech>

It has been in place for a number of years.  It was updated this year.  Regarding the impact across the government sector, we have a target of 33% in energy efficiency savings by 2020.  We are now at 21%.  In 2015, we avoided an energy spend of &euro;154 million in the public sector by virtue of the measures that have been put in place right across the system.  What we have introduced is a fairly novel approach to the spend on energy efficiency in Departments, which are allowed to retain the savings they accrue by virtue of investing in energy efficiency measures and to invest it in other measures.  That has been agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have asked each Department to appoint an officer at senior level, generally someone at assistant secretary level, to be an energy advocate within his or her Department or agency.  We co-funded upgrades of ten national schools with the Department of Education and Skills in 2017, we co-funded - with the OPW - deep retrofits of ten public buildings in 2017 and we set aside funding in our own Vote in 2018 to double that.  This amounts to 20 schools and 20 public buildings, and they will act as demonstrations for what can be done if the money is invested.</p></speech>

One of the issues it raised was peat, for example.  The support for peat in Edenderry was phased out in 2016 and the support for peat in west Offaly and Loughrea will be phased out in 2019.</p> <p>  Regarding investment in electric and low-emissions vehicles, we have a low-emissions vehicle task force in place.</p></speech>

I do not accept that.  There has been a focus on what we are doing in the building, which is a minute element of what it is that the Department and the system are doing.  If one looks at the national mitigation plan that was published during the year, we have listed 60 measures that are under way which will have a very significant impact on our emissions profile in the State.  We have an emissions trading scheme in place.  We have a carbon tax in place and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has committed to reviewing it next year before the next budget is announced.  We have renewable electricity support schemes.  We have financial supports available through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which I have mentioned for energy efficiency improvements.  There is a lot of investment in the social housing programme in energy efficiency upgrades.  We support large industries with expert advice on what they can do on their own energy efficiency programmes.  There is investment in public transport, a smarter travel initiative and a biofuels obligation scheme.</p> <p>  That is just what is under way.  If one looks at what is planned, it includes a new renewable electricity support scheme, a new renewable heat incentive, smart metering, further incentives for low emission vehicles and further investment in public transport.  There is an array of things that are happening right across the system.  If I had a blank cheque, I would spend a lot more on climate action, but I do not.  Like every Department, we have to compete for funding with health, justice, education and water services.  We are comfortable that the strategic approach being taken to addressing this issue is sound.  I mentioned the national mitigation plan.  We are doing work in the national adaptation framework and expect to see a substantial and visible ramping up of activity to tackle climate action in the next couple of years.</p> <p>  The other thing I did not mention, one linked with the work of the Citizens' Assembly, is the fact that we have established a national dialogue on climate action to try to have engagement with the public to effect behavioural change across the State on the issue.</p></speech>

Government policies pay lip service to public transport.  To take the example of Galway, there is no provision for light rail in the national planning framework and absolutely no recognition that we need public transport services.  That is, however, an issue for another time.</p></speech>

The Department will be very important in the years ahead.  </p> <p>  I will start on the issue of broadband, in particular, the provision of high speed broadband in rural areas for the benefit of the country.  I am disappointed to note that only &euro;5.4 million of the &euro;16.8 million allocated in 2016 under subhead A3 was spent.  This is surprising considering that the country is crying out for the roll-out of broadband, on which we have report after report.  The development of rural areas is being held back by the lack of access to broadband.  I ask Mr. Griffin to explain the reason only &euro;5.4 million or one third of the &euro;16.8 million allocated was spent last year, given the need for broadband.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy is right that the bulk of the underspend in 2016 was in relation to the national broadband plan.  I do not see this as a reflection of a delay in the plan or a lack of commitment on our part in this being a priority for the State.  In fact, what one sees is that the bulk of the money underspent in 2016 on the national broadband plan will be spent in 2017.  There is a timing delay more than anything else.</p></speech>

The view was taken on the work that was to be funded from the Vote in 2016 that we had not progressed aspects of it by the end of the year.  However, the spend would have been recouped at the start of 2017.  I take the Deputy's point on this issue.  I have a brother who lives in Kilcreevanty outside Tuam who berates me about this project every time he sees me and another fellow who lives in Ballycommon outside Nenagh.  Both of them work in the information technology sector and both are without access to high speed broadband once they leave their workplaces.  However, we are seeing progress.</p></speech>

We have always made the point that the broadband plan comprises commercial investment and also the State-led intervention which is progressing.  We reached an important stage in September with the submission of detailed proposals from the two remaining bidders, eir and enet.  We will go looking for final tenders in the first part of next year.  We will also appoint a preferred bidder next year.</p></speech>

We have been hearing about it being put out to tender since the most recent general election.  Why is it taking so long to place the tender and get the project up and running?  Why is it always next year?  We heard that it would be rolled out in 2017-18.  Then the date was put back to 2019 and we now hear it will be 2020.  The date keeps being pushed back when we are crying out for broadband services.</p></speech>

It is important that I do because I do not want people to be under the impression that things have not been happening in the past few years.  In 2012 some 700,000 properties were connected to high speed broadband.  By April 2016 the figure had increased to 1.2 million or 52% of premises.  In September 2017, 1.5 million or 65% of premises had access to high speed broadband.  By the end of next year the figure will be 1.8 million or 77% of premises and by the end of 2020 it will be 2.1 million or 90% premises.  A huge amount is happening and what one is seeing is a significant ramping up by the commercial sector.  We had eir 300,000, which was launched in April this year and on which the Minister signed a commitment agreement.  We had SIRO, which agreed to invest &euro;450 million in 51 towns, providing 500 connections across the State.  Virgin Media has agreed to extend its footprint, while enet decided to invest &euro;100 million in 115,000 premises in nine locations in the west and north west. </p> <p>  I have heard Deputies across the House refer to the national broadband plan as the next rural electrification scheme.  Back in 1927 those involved in the rural electrification scheme did not have to deal with public procurement procedures.  If they did, it might have been delayed a lot longer and some of us might still be in the dark.  The reality is that we have to comply fully with public procurement procedures.  I would much prefer to have a process that was robust and that stood up to scrutiny should any party involved in the procurement process decide to take the State to court by way of a judicial review at the end of it.</p> <p>  We actually put the project out to tender in December 2015.  After the first phase, the pre-qualification questionnaire, we had five consortia, comprising 32 companies.  All of them had to be evaluated.  We had to enter into detailed dialogue with the companies that were still part of the process.  We are talking about a contract that runs to about 1,500 pages.  It is a very complex procurement process.  While I understand the frustration, I would be much more comfortable in having a robust procurement process over which the Minister, the Department and I could stand at the end, having delivered a preferred tender or tenderer in a position to hit the ground running to deliver high speed broadband to the 542,000 properties without high speed broadband.</p><p>There was also an intention to establish a mobile phone and broadband task force - a clear commitment of the Minister when he came into government - and that has taken place.  It has done a lot of work on the intermediate steps that could be put in place to remedy some of these inefficiencies, especially around mobile phone signal issues across the State.  The Minister has optioned the additional spectrum at 3.6 GHz, which will provide spectrum to private sector companies to roll out broadband.  The Minister has also facilitated RT&Eacute; by way of providing &euro;8 million in the Vote in 2016 in order that it can exit-----</p></speech>

I just want to come to the brass tacks of the situation.  We are aware that the dark blue areas on the plan are economically sorted, the light blue areas is where there are 300,000 extra homes with 2,000 being done, but then we have the amber areas that are marked for State intervention and are not commercially viable.  I would like to know more about that area.  We have had all the reports, the <i>Switcher.ie</i>report and the Vodafone Ireland report; I have them all here with me and I could keep on reading them for another ten minutes but they basically say that 37% of rural businesses are being forced out of their localities because they cannot rely on the current broadband service and that jobs and SMEs are basically walking away.  Businesses in the survey have said they will leave the rural areas where they are currently situated in order to get high-speed broadband because they want to be economically viable and be able to take on their rivals.  These are the questions I want the Secretary General to answer.  I have all the reports.  I want to know whether 180,000 people still will not have access to high-speed broadband in 2020 or what does Mr. Griffin envisage the situation will be in 2020, that is, in three years' time?</p></speech>

We expect it to be closer to three years than to five years.  The reason I gave detail to the Deputy earlier was because I want the committee and members of the public to understand a huge amount of activity is ongoing both around the procurement process in which we are involved and in the work that has been undertaken by the private sector around the commercial aspect.  That is why the committee can see us shifting from 700,000 in 2012 with high-speed broadband to 1.5 million premises now, and more to come.  With regard to the 536,000 or 540,000 properties that are still waiting for high-speed broadband, we will provide that by way of-----</p></speech>

We have a very clear prioritisation programme and the mandate for the company or companies that are awarded the tender is to hit the ground and do it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The input from that Department is vital because this is a bottom up approach.  They are already talking to the local authorities and the local enterprise offices to ask about priorities in their counties and to ascertain whether a particular type of business, the schools or the business parks need to be hit first.  We will have that input into the prioritisation programme.  Once the contract is awarded the company will be in receipt of a subsidy from the State to make this commercially viable for them.  When the contract is awarded I do not see any blockages to a quick mobilisation and a speedy roll-out to those parts of the State that have yet to receive it.</p></speech>

I am a farmer from rural Ireland and I am worried about the recommendations around carbon tax or fines.  Ireland's largest indigenous business and some 90% of exports are agricultural.  I am worried about how the recommendations can be married with our produce such as cattle, beef, bacon, lamb, other meat, dairy and grain products etc.  The Citizens' Assembly talks of bringing in a carbon tax that will affect farmers.  We are aware of the viability of agriculture at the moment and the profit margins are very small.  Will Mr. Griffin clarify how the taxes and the sector could be married? Ireland exports some 90% of its agriculture produce into Europe.  Are we then going to subsidise beef, for example, coming from Brazil or South America? What about the carbon footprint of transporting that across the Atlantic?  How will all of this be married together to keep agriculture viable in the State if carbon taxes are being considered?  I do not believe that Ireland is getting recognition for the trees it has or for the amount of grass that is grown here.  The Citizens' Assembly did not consider these factors.  Speaking from an agriculture point of view, I would like Mr. Griffin's view on how all of this will be reconciled?</p></speech>

Climate action was one of those topics.  The Citizens' Assembly will provide a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will assign that report to a relevant committee of both Houses - I do not know if that will be one committee or several committees - depending on the issue being discussed.  I presume it is several committees.  I imagine that the agriculture recommendations will come to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The matter may also be debated in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

The objective for the agriculture sector for 2050 is carbon neutrality, while ensuring the things we need to do in respect of food security and food sustainability are reflected in any decisions that are taken.</p> <p>  There has been huge investment in afforestation over the last decades.  That is recognised at EU level in how the effort-sharing regulations are being structured.  The EU is making allowances for the possibility of netting off some of the obligations by factoring in the changes that have been made on the afforestation programme.  There is a lot of work ongoing under the GLAS scheme and the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS.  There has been huge investment in the beef data genomic project.</p> <p>  When I listen to colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine talk about this particular issue they are strongly of the view, in respect of the approach being taken in the Food Wise 2025 strategy to increase dairy output and the national herd and so on, that it is being done in a climate-friendly fashion.  They say that the dairy and beef sectors are two of the most climate-friendly sectors when one considers similar such sectors at EU level.</p> <p>  Much work is being done in the agricultural area in this regard.  I do not doubt that more will have to be done but I would not express a view one way or another on what the assembly has specifically proposed in this area.  I take the Deputy's point about carbon leakage.  This is when industries are vulnerable to the impact of industries in third countries, such as our agriculture sector and the industry in Brazil and Argentina for example.  Particular consideration needs to be given, from a climate change perspective, in how we manage that. </p></speech>

I have experienced that.</p><p>We have three good rivers where I come from - the Suir, the Barrow and the Nore - but they are all closed to salmon fishing at the moment because of scientific evidence that there are not enough fish to sustain such activity.  We have to get it up to a certain standard before we can go back fishing again.  I have asked the Minister on several occasions about the buy-out scheme that was in place approximately ten years ago for various forms of fishing, including rod fishing and the traditional forms of fishing like snap-net, draft-net and drift-net fishing that are found in my locality.  All of these fishermen have been off the river for the past three, four or five years.  Some of them have been off the river for longer.  Many people were able to make a partial living out of fishing when they were in their 30s and 40s.  They made a lot of money out of salmon when they were plentiful.  Small farmers and people living in labour were able to use this activity as a back-up.  Could another buy-out scheme be considered?  Many of these people are getting old now.  They are gone beyond fishing for reasons of age.  Could a new buy-out scheme be introduced to give some reward to people who were fishing all their lives, and getting some income from it, until the rivers were closed.  Now they are getting no income from it.  Could there be a buy-out scheme?</p></speech>

I am aghast that Mr. Griffin is not personally aware of the figure in question.  Perhaps he has just been handed the relevant details.  I would have imagined that Mr. Griffin would be familiar with this information, or would at least be interested in knowing whether the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is exceeding the targets it has set for all Departments.

He is handing over taxpayers' money.  Should he have a service level agreement?  If he does not think so we certainly think so.  We are here every week of the year when publicly funded Government Departments hand over substantial funds to third parties on the basis of work being carried out.  We would expect a public service level agreement to be in place and I am shocked to hear that.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's first question on whether we can bring in RT&Eacute;, I have in front of me on my iPhone RT&Eacute;'s summary financial highlights for 2016 from its financial statements.  Its commercial revenue in 2016 was &euro;158.2 million and licence fee revenue was &euro;179.1 million, giving a total income of &euro;337.3 million.  The majority of RT&Eacute;'s income comes directly through the Department so it is unusual.  Up to now, we have always taken the view that commercial semi-State bodies, such as ESB and others, have a large amount of commercial revenue, but it is clear to me that the majority of RT&Eacute;'s funding comes directly from the Department.</p><p>An organisation that gets the majority of its funding through the Vote of the Department should be answerable to this.  Since the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has no service level agreement in place, I think RT&Eacute; might have to answer to us because it has not provided a service level agreement to date.  The 2016 figures are in line with 2015.  This is an organisation which is substantially funded directly through Mr. Griffin's Department.</p></speech>

When an Accounting Officer appears before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for gross expenditure, in the normal run of things, we would have a line-by-line breakdown of how that money is spent.  There is a gap here where we do not have &euro;179 million of the overall &euro;439 million.  Mr. Griffin cannot tell us whether a service level agreement is in place.  In broad terms, he tells us that it is just spent on RT&Eacute; and then goes on to tell us how RT&Eacute; spends its money.  That does not cut it.  We need to come back to this issue.  I would like RT&Eacute; to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts if possible.  Maybe we should discuss that and come back to it.</p></speech>

The operation of RT&Eacute; is governed by comprehensive legislation, the Broadcasting Act 2009.  There are provisions in it for the objectives of RT&Eacute;.  It submits a five-year strategic plan to the Department.  The code of practice for the governance of State bodies applies to it.  The updated 2016 code of practice will be applied to it.

I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General about this.  He might not have it at the tip of his fingers since he did not know the question was coming and he might have to give us a note next week.  Are there any other Departments where amounts of this scale are handed out without a service level agreement being in place?  Everything mentioned has been about the controls in place for RT&Eacute;, its financial accountings, reportings and its regulator.  Are there many cases of grants of this scale from Departments being handed out without some level of agreement in place?  We have had the third level sector before the committee.  The colleges and universities have to submit a programme of what they are doing to draw down grants.  It does not interfere with their independence but one cannot just hand out &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million and hope that is the end of it and they do their job.</p></speech>

Where is the joined-up thinking and when will we use a little common sense to pull things together?  There are two valuable capital assets that belong to the State, but their value is not being reflected in the accounts.  It is stated no valuation was available.  Do we have to go through the lengthy process I have just mentioned or why will IFI not go to Rooney's in Galway and whoever else in County Donegal to get a valuation?  That would lead to us having accurate information for the people.</p></speech>

As there has been a decline of 35% in mail volumes in the past few years, I am glad that is so.  We can look at what the product was intended to do.  It was to provide a unique address for all properties; 35% of property addresses in the State are non-unique.  In that regard, the nearest to us in the OECD is Portugal which is at a figure of 2%.  The system was also relevant to the development of e-commerce in reducing the cost of logistics, furthering access to emergency services and reducing the State's input.</p></speech>

Kildare is not known for mountains.  It is a very flat county.  This mountain started to grow and grow.  There were ongoing complaints about it for years and then it went on fire and cost about &euro;40 million.  Mr. Griffin might correct that number.  There was a very expensive remediation effort over several years as a consequence of not properly monitoring or regulating and all the rest of it.  On those types of legacy sites that are not public sector landfills, particularly the ones that are high risk, what is the prospect of pursuing the original owners for the costs if they have to be remediated by the State?  What has been spent on legal issues so far on that?</p></speech>

That is still payable to the Courts Service but to date it has not been paid.  There are prosecutions ongoing with regard to the two principals.  In that case, legal proceedings are still in place with a view to the State securing as much of the fine as we are entitled to.  Where there are illegal landfills, the Deputy can be assured the State is engaged or will engage in undertaking legal actions where that is required.  What we are seeing is that the State has become better at this over the past few years.  We have put in place what is known as the waste enforcement regional lead authority.  There are three lead authorities in place, more or less aligned with the jurisdiction of the regional waste management planning process.  We provide &euro;7.4 million annually to fund a network of 120 enforcement officers.  We are seeing the effect of that on the ground.</p></speech>

At any point, there is a potential vulnerability to the State where the European Commission may determine that we have not transposed the directive in time - we are not in that space just yet - or we have not transposed it properly.  In other legal cases currently under way before the national courts, damages may arise - we hope not - relating to the State's performance of its functions.  We also have judicial review cases on a number of issues.  These factors could materialise in future years, but for us to try to put a figure on them would be speculative and inappropriate at this stage.</p></speech>

We monitor the programmes on an ongoing basis, receive regular reports from finance officers and discuss them with our management board.  In the early part of the year, the expectation is that progress will be achieved and items set out in programmes will be delivered.  It is only in the latter part of the year that there is final clarity around the level of activity and, therefore, the level of spend that is available to us.</p> <p>  There is little point in reallocating money in September because, for example, those programmes that may have capacity are not in a position at that stage to go through a tendering process to secure the additional services that we would propose to fund.  We perform a reallocation in the middle of the year.  It will become apparent in the third quarter of the year where we are likely to end up in terms of the level of underspend.  I have set out what happened in respect of landfill remediation, but I could go through each subhead and give an explanation of what happened.</p> <p>  I will make two further points.  We are in a position to carry over up to 10% of our capital provision to the following year.  That happens.  I would be more comfortable with money returning to the Exchequer to other worthy causes, be it in the year in question or in subsequent years, rather than it being spent inappropriately.</p></speech>

We are on the wrong trajectory to 2030, never mind to 2020 because we will have missed the targets to that year.  We are facing a significant fine each year from 2021.  In that context, what strikes me, given that there was still flexibility in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, is the level of ambition to make sure we will not end up paying these fines.</p></speech>

We had a target to achieve a reduction of 20% in emissions by 2020.  That was one of the highest targets in the European Union when it was established in 2009.  The simple fact is that we had a decade of lost investment.  We wanted to do certain things, whether it be renewable energy or energy efficiency projects, that we simply were not able to do because the money was not available.  That is the context in which we have to discuss the issue.  Based on the most recent estimates which the CPA will update in April 2018, we will hit a figure between 4% and 6% of the 20% target.  That leaves quite a distance to reach the target.  There are mechanisms in the European Union which allow us to buy carbon credits at a price.  However, we do not know the price or the quantum of credits we will need to buy.  </p> <p>  There is an acknowledgement by the European Commission of the "lack of realism" - I cannot come up with a better way to describe it at this stage - in the target set for Ireland in 2009.  It was reflected in the approach the Commission had decided to take in setting the starting point for member states in progressing towards the 2030 target, average emissions between 2016 and 2018.  In the Department we are working to assess the various scenarios in terms of the potential cost to the Exchequer, if we must pay.  I would not use the term "fines" because that would require the Commission to issue infringement proceedings against a member state.  There are statistical transfer mechanisms in place which will allow us buy allowances.  We have acquired allowances in the past few years that will be offset any cost that will arise.  </p> <p>  I covered the level of ambition in the Department.  I only focused on the Department, but one would also need to look at the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government in terms of the work being done on the built environment and the housing stock.  There is a high level of ambition, determination and political commitment across the system of government to do more in this area.</p></speech>

I will begin by referring to RT&Eacute;, although the issue was discussed earlier.</p> <p>  Many like to bash the State broadcaster.  On various discussion programmes one will hear contributors refer to the headline figures for presenters' pay and so forth.  That seems to be the popular thing to do, but I do not subscribe to it at all.  If we value the national broadcaster, we need to foster it at a time when the traditional media are under immense attack.  As politicians, we should be conscious that this issue goes to the very heart of our democracy.  In a functioning democracy an integral element is a functioning independent journalistic system.  To use a phrase that has made its way into the dictionary, thanks to the man in the office in America, we now live in the age of fake news.  We should, therefore, value and foster the traditional media outlets at a time when they are coming under increasing attack.  Do we value high quality journalism?  Do we value the special "Prime Time" report last week, about which Members spoke this week?  It takes investment to commission such a report from respected journalists.  When people castigate RT&Eacute; for not being successful in bidding for major international sports events, they forget that it is competing on a global scale and that takes money.  When we look at the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the Appropriation Accounts, it comes down to factors such as the television licence fee evasion rate and the intense digital competition.  I fear for the State broadcasting service.  RT&Eacute; has had to make staff cuts this year.  It has sold land to try to tide itself over, but this can be done only once.  Does the Secretary General share my fear for RT&Eacute; because of the pressures it is operating under?  I know that there was a discussion earlier about service level agreements and so forth, but RT&Eacute;'s public service obligations are immense and it must cover items that are not mainstream.  We should try to bring balance to our discussion.  Has the Secretary General undertaken an analysis of things that could be done to help the State broadcaster?</p></speech>

There has been a reduction in the TV licence fee income and commercial revenues in the past few years.  Since 2008 RT&Eacute; is down &euro;85 million in commercial revenues.  This is having a real and direct effect.  If one looks at the capacity of RT&Eacute; to invest in independent productions, in 2007, when the economy was its peak, it was spending &euro;79 million in that sector.  In 2016 it spent &euro;40 million.  The inability to invest in the sector is costing jobs across the State.  In fact, it is affecting the quality of what viewers see on RT&Eacute;, the ability of the company to produce high quality output and media content.  In the Department we have a real concern about the future funding of the company.  If I was to be brutally honest, I would say the TV licence fee model was broken and I am not sure whether it can be fixed.  The level of evasion is 14.6% and we are losing &euro;40 million per annum.  That affects not only RT&Eacute; but also the broadcasting fund, from which good works, both audio and audio-visual, are commissioned.  There has been a major reduction in the capacity of the fund to deliver such programmes.</p> <p>  The Minister has asked the Oireachtas joint committee to look at the funding of public sector broadcasting and it has done a body of work in the past few months.  We expect to see its report in the next few weeks.  The Minister will bring it to the Government with proposals as to how the issue can be dealt it.  We need to take a serious look at how we approach the funding of public sector broadcasting.</p></speech>

The figures back that up.  The licence fee has remained the same at &euro;160 since 2008.  Population and household numbers have risen, but RT&Eacute;'s TV licence fee income has fallen by more than 10%.</p><p>Along with that, the figure for uncollected tax on TV sets exceeds RT&Eacute;'s annual losses.  Mr. Colm McCarthy produced a piece on this earlier in the year in which he used similar language in speaking about the "broken" model, saying it was not fit for purpose, given the proliferation of media on which one could access content.  What are the potential replacement models?  A doubling of the licence fee has been looked at, but commercial revenue has also dropped this year and which has been attributed to the impact of Brexit.  I have been talking to advertising executives and believe viewing patterns are also changing.  People go home in the evening and watch Netflix.  They are not even watching mainstream media.  Advertising executives realise that their spot at 9.15 p.m., during the break in the RT&Eacute; news programme, is not as valuable as it once was.  As a consequence, they are going to lower the amount they spend and it becomes a race to the bottom.  The commercial side could also end up being banjaxed.</p></speech>

They access content online and use YouTube, Netflix, etc.  Their generation is moving away from the linear model.  People are more interested in television stations making decisions for them when they are 35 years old and have a home, a couple of kids and a job and do not want to make decisions themselves.  With opt-out channels such as Sky, Channel 4 and Dave Ja Vu, a lot of advertising is beamed from the United Kingdom and there is a hit to the State of &euro;50 million in the loss of advertising revenue.  Through the revision of the audiovisual media service directive we are looking at introducing a levy on that advertising.</p></speech>

There is a hit of &euro;50 million in an overall advertising market that is worth between &euro;200 million and &euro;235 million.  There was an increase of 30% in online advertising in 2015 and 2016 and revenues from online advertising in Ireland increased from &euro;100 million to &euro;445 million between 2010 and 2016, which reflects a huge change in the trend.  If people are moving away from consuming linear broadcasting, is it credible to talk about a TV licence?  People now access TV in very different ways.  A number of years back we debated a broadcasting charge.  Is this a space about which we need to start thinking again?  The then Minister, Alex White, said he was not prepared to proceed with it until he had built a case and got the public to understand it.  The work done by the joint committee and the roadshows held will help, but I hope the committee will now come forward with firm proposals.</p> <p>  There is also a big debate on retransmission fees.  The Deputy may have read about the spat on this issue between ITV and Virgin Media in the United Kingdom.  At the committee we discussed whether the broadcaster should be in a position to simply negotiate with the likes of Sky and Virgin Media.  There is a potential revenue stream there, but there is major resistance from these companies.  Nevertheless, we hope the committee will come forward with recommendations for us in this area in the coming weeks.  I hope we can bring them back to the Oireachtas and the Government.</p></speech>

We will enter the space of American TV where commercially-owned channels can dictate editorial policy.  I do not want to live in a world where I will have to watch the Irish version of Fox News to get my information.  We either value journalists or we do not.

My party's spokesperson, Deputy Timmy Dooley, is looking at that issue.  It is an industry that has equally been crucified.  Some titles are selling only 60% of what they sold 15 years ago.  Again, we have to ask if we value independent media, including print media.  I am still a card-carrying member of the NUJ.  They also need to be protected.  I wonder what role the Department could play in that regard.  It deals purely with broadcasting, but has it looked at this issue?</p></speech>

We have a role in regard to media mergers.  As the circulation levels of regional papers have declined substantially, there is a need for further investment.

I spent a long time on a county council and wonder if the Department has looked at the potential exposure in this regard.  In my county an illegal dump has recently been discovered in Timoole in Rathfeigh and the bill for 70,000 tonnes of waste, including 30,000 tonnes of contaminated soil, comes in at &euro;6 million.  There was also a high profile case in County Donegal during the summer.  How can we resource councils in order that they can nip this in the bud before having to spend such sums?</p></speech>

We have become a little more sophisticated in our enforcement processes in the past few years and the regionalisation of waste management functions has helped.  We have designated waste enforcement regional lead authorities and committed &euro;7.4 million last year and this year, with a similar amount next year, for 120 local authority waste enforcement officers who work closely with the regional authorities to prioritise enforcement action.  We work very closely with the Garda, the EPA and other statutory authorities such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The fruits of that labour could be seen in what happened in the recent case in County Donegal and we expect more such concerted action in the future.  When we find legacy landfills sites, we will continue to pursue people to recoup some of the costs incurred.</p></speech>

Mr. Griffin explained the position on the national broadband plan.  Will he give us the dates once again?  I have a specific example in mind which has general implications.  It concerns an address in Connemara.  There are blue spots where there is broadband.  There is, however, a house right beside a blue spot which does not have broadband.  We have written many times about the matter and been told that is not commercially viable to provide broadband in this house, although a service is availble in the house beside it.  Having made further inquiries, we have been told by the broadband liaison officer that the house will come under the new national broadband plan.  Will Mr. Griffin clarify the matter?</p></speech>

I suspect that the house in Connemara to which the has Deputy referred is one that will be provided with a service as part of the eir 300,000 initiative agreed to in April.  A service will be provided for close to 20,000 houses in Galway under that arrangement.  The house beside it falls to be dealt with as part of the State's broadband intervention.  We expect it to be put out to tender very early in 2018, to award the tender during the year and then commence its roll-out.  I cannot give the Deputy a date for when the person in Connemara who is 100 m from the other individual will have their connection, but it will be within three years of the date on which the project commences.  A prioritisation scheme will be put in place, but I cannot give a date.  I can only say it will form part of the State's intervention programme.</p></speech>

We provide capital grants to support energy efficiency upgrades proposed by communities.  That could be a community hall, a number of homes or other buildings within the community.  Second, the community scheme itself is grant funding that is provided to sustainable energy communities, to allow them gear up and put together with advice from the SEAI appropriate packages of measures that they can put forward.

We have a RES scheme that we expect to be in a position to launch in the first part of next year.  A significant part of that will involve community involvement in the schemes themselves, whether they are development led or whether it is communities coming together.  For example, in the Tipperary energy scheme they were putting forward a project themselves.  We will have to look at a mechanism to fund that as well.</p></speech>

Probably the biggest underspend was on the demand-led scheme, which is the Better Energy Homes scheme where we are relying on people to come forward to us and make proposals or seek grant funding from the SEAI.  That did not arise to the same extent that we had predicted but, overall, relative to the provision in 2016, the underspend is modest enough.  I mentioned earlier that one of the issues for us is that when we get additional funding, we have to ensure that the SEAI is fully geared up in terms of staffing and external advice to support delivery of the schemes.  There was some work to be done on that in 2016 because there was such a big jump in the capital provision between 2015 and 2016 but the SEAI is well geared up now.  We have a very detailed and frequent engagement with the SEAI-----</p></speech>

The note says that the renewable heat incentive, RHI, programme was not initiated in 2016 due to delays in finalising a detailed consultancy report.  Why was there a delay and why was there a need for a detailed consultancy report?  This is an energy research programme.</p></speech>

We need to learn lessons in respect of how we roll out an RHI programme to make sure that the sort of cost overruns that have occurred and the potential very significant cost overruns that are likely to occur in the future will not happen in our scheme.  Part of the consultancy was to look at the controls that need to be put in place to protect the State and its investment, at both scheme and project levels, and to make sure that for any windfall gain, for example, through a reduction in the price of biomass, there would be some clawback mechanism.</p> <p>  In respect of the others-----</p></speech>

We have been working very closely with the Commission in respect of state aid approval and we have to get a final sign-off with them on that.  It will be fully operational in 2018 with a provision of about &euro;10 million, I think.</p> <p>  On the other parts, there was a &euro;900,000 underspend on an INTERREG programme that did not proceed.  There was an underspend on the international energy research programme because again that is a demand-led scheme and it is difficult to predict what the level of demand will be in any given year.  The reassuring thing in respect of ocean energy is that we are investing and continuing to invest.  Some of the projects we are seeing coming through the prototype development fund in terms of creativity, cutting edge and initiative are very impressive and, in fact, it might be no harm in writing to the committee to include a copy of the most recent report they have done from the prototype development fund.  I think people will really be bowled over by the calibre of the work that is being done.</p></speech>

On the previous occasion on which I was before the committee, we discussed the introduction of postcodes in other jurisdictions.  It can take many years for the effects to be seen.</p> <p>  I briefly outlined to Deputy MacSharry some of the things that we are starting to see in terms of take-up.  The postcode system is being used by the HSE National Ambulance Service very effectively.  The Central Statistics Office is using the system for its residential property price index.  The National Transport Authority has included the system in its journey planner.  It may be of interest to Deputy Cullinane to note that Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council has incorporated Eircode into the online customer management system.  The HSE has incorporated it into its primary care reimbursement service and patient care administration system.  We are seeing several large logistics companies using it, including CityPOST, DHL and Niteline.  The Property Registration Authority is using the system, as is Ordnance Survey Ireland.  We have statistics available to suggest that 7,500 active courier delivery drivers used the Eircode app during October.  That app has been used 600,000 times since its launch in May 2016.  We are seeing the system used far more in retail and e-commerce.  A recent Government decision held that all public authorities that are upgrading systems in which there is an address field are to use Eircode.  I will add to what I said earlier about the National Ambulance Service.  The service is upgrading its fleet.  The new fleet will have satnav included and Eircode will be built into the technology.</p> <p>  I am satisfied that we have made considerable progress.  Some 800 private sector companies are using Eircode.  They operate in the sectors I have mentioned and there are others in the insurance and financial services sectors as well.</p></speech>

Clearly, Mr. Griffin has considerable detail before him.  It might be no harm to give the committee some follow-up detail.</p></speech>

How does the Department carry out analysis of how successful Eircode has been in terms of usage, who is using it and how are they using it?  Are global positioning system companies integrating Eircode?  How many have integrated it or are planning to integrate it?  How many addresses are in the State?  Are they all now linked?  Do they all now have an Eircode postcode?  How many businesses use Eircode as part of their daily work?  I am keen to get that type of information if possible.</p></speech>

All of the addresses in the State have been allocated an Eircode postcode.  In the case of new builds, it takes until the following quarter from the completion of the premises for the postcode to be allocated.</p></speech>

This is now linked.  There is considerable outsourcing in the public sector at the moment.  Does the Department recognise the industrial relations machinery of the State?</p></speech>

They refuse to attend Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and Labour Court hearings.  When the Department enters into contracts with these organisations, why are there no obligations on them to at least recognise the industrial relations mechanisms of the State?  I would have thought that should be a basic obligation.  If a company is being asked to do a job on behalf of the State and is getting taxpayers' money, I would at least have expected that it should have to comply with industrial relations law and abide by and participate in the industrial relations machinery of the State.  The first point related to Capita.  Is Mr. Griffin aware that Capita has, in several instances, not engaged with the industrial relations architecture of the State?</p></speech>

Deputy Cullinane raised a second point relating to the emergency call-answering service call centre.  I am familiar with the issue because of an industrial dispute last year that affected the Navan call centre in particular.  The information I have suggests that Conduit attended the WRC with the workers during 2016.  It was not possible to resolve the issues at the WRC and the matter was referred to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court has examined the matter on several occasions.  I understand the Labour Court has invited the parties back on 12 December to address the matter further.</p></speech>

That is going back several years.  I understand a decision was taken in 2007.  I am unsure whether it was forced upon us, taken by design or voluntarily.  In any event, the decision was to tender for the provision of an emergency call-answering service.  There was an open tender at that stage.  The contract was won by BT, which was appointed in 2009 or 2010.  The company has run the service effectively in recent years.  We can see this by reference to our statistics relative to other member states - we perform exceptionally well.</p></speech>

I am unsure whether there are any guidelines from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter or how it plays out.  If there is no stipulation or requirement that the companies in question should at least engage with the industrial relations machinery, then I imagine the Department would have no difficulty with the principle.  Is that correct?  If we are going to pay a company to do a job under a public contract, it should engage with the WRC and the Labour Court.  Does Mr. Griffin agree with that as a principle?</p></speech>

The countryside is a dirtier place now than it was a few years ago.  More dumping is happening on the sides of roads with, for example, couches tossed out of the backs of cars.  In the environment fund, expenditure on waste prevention and national market development programmes was reduced in 2015 compared with 2014.  I also note funding for the national strategy on biodegradable waste was cut from &euro;38,098 in 2014 to &euro;1,845 in 2015.</p><p>The Department is going in the wrong direction.</p></speech>

Waste initiatives are part funded from the Vote and part funded from the environment fund.  I will provide the full picture in writing back to the committee because the Chairman raises a valid point.  On the face of it, it appears we are doing less on waste when in fact we have done a great deal more on it over the last year.</p></speech>

Under "environmental awareness", the Department had &euro;32,550 for BirdWatch Ireland in 2014 but nothing was contributed to that organisation in 2015.  Perhaps, it carried out a survey for the Department in 2014, I do not know, but we have to be concerned about wildlife in the natural amenity.  Why did that happen and what is the most recent position in 2016?  In fact, the Department probably has the 2017 figures.  That leads me on to anti-litter initiatives.  The local authority anti-litter awareness grant was reduced significantly in 2015 compared with 2014 based on what is in the fund.

I have a blue and a black and my neighbour has a green and a black.  A green bin for recycling in one area is a blue bin in my area.  It depends on the contractor.  My question is very simple.

That is the question I am asking.  We are dealing with this environment issue.  I do not think I have ever sat at a meeting like this without asking this question.

However, the cost of waste collection in County Laois is &euro;360 per annum for a wheelie bin.  I pay it, but it is bad value for money.  It is &euro;1 a day and &euro;7 a week for a person in receipt of social welfare payments.  I used to travel through towns years ago and practically every house had a wheelie bin.  They are a rarity in some communities now because of the cost.  All the talk the Department engages in on waste management and everything it measures relates only to what is collected through the system.  I maintain, however, and my own instinct is, that at least 50% of houses are not even being counted or considered because they cannot afford a wheelie bin for recycling or whatever.  Every time I ask this question, I am told the private sector has it.  I cannot understand how a Department does not have a handle on this issue.  I am surprised that nobody knows the number of people who have a bin.</p> <p>  We have spent decades drawing up waste management plans and we continue to talk about the different centres.  However, no one talks about the 40%, 50% or 60% of houses that are outside the system.  I ask the Secretary General to talk to me about that.  What is the Department doing to bring more people into the system?  I do not get any sense of it and never have in my life as a public representative.  Is it possible for the Department to provide the committee with the number of houses from which each licensed contractor collects?  Does it have that?  Any time I have asked a local authority, I have been told the information is commercially sensitive but the Department cannot do its job unless it knows the answer.  It cannot know what its job is in relation to waste management unless it has this information.  I hope the Department can provide it.  It is probably not possible to provide the information by local authority area because of contracts.  AES in the midlands covers a variety of areas.  What can the Department do?</p></speech>

By his own admission, the Secretary General tells me at least 600,000 houses are outside the system, if it is 1 million.  That is an awful admission but the Department does not seem to know about it or have any information.  I am being a bit difficult on this because I do not believe the Department and local authorities and everyone else involved.  It is a commercial business and the money is taken from those who are willing to pay.  Those who do not pay do not exist as far as waste collection statistics are concerned.

I am sorry I was not in a position to provide the level of detail required by the Chairman and Deputy Cullinane this morning.  If one looks at what is required by a service level agreement, a great deal of it is covered by the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The Act sets out the public service objects of the public service broadcasters, which are RT&Eacute; and TG4.  RT&Eacute; and TG4 must provide public service statements, statements of strategy and annual statements of performance commitments.  Annual reviews are carried out by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and presented to the Minister.  There is a five-year review on the adequacy of funding.  As I said earlier, the accounts are independently audited, published by the organisations and go before the Government and so on.  We obtained legal advice at a point in time - I will need to check when - and it said that a service level agreement was not appropriate given the comprehensive provisions governing strategy objects in the Broadcasting Act and, separately, the fact that RT&Eacute; and TG4 are independent in their functions.  I also note that, in accordance with the 2016 code of governance, we will be putting in place an oversight agreement between the Department and RT&Eacute; before the end of the year.  It is also the case, of course, that RT&Eacute; reports to the relevant joint committee on a regular basis on a whole range of issues.  On the point Deputy Cullinane raised, presenters' fees account for 1% of overall company costs.  I will set this out in a more structured way in a response to the committee.</p></speech>

Mr. Griffin need not give me the final accounts.</p> <p>  In respect of the 2016 annual report, Mr. Griffin must be tired discussing broadband but mobile phone signals are also an issue.  I do not have a mobile phone signal from any operator in my constituency office or my house.  At either location, I have to walk out to the garden or to the side of the road in order to receive a phone call.  I live in a village that it is not very small.  Mobile phone signals in Ireland have deteriorated.  Everybody is talking about broadband but there has not been a single mention of mobile phone signal strength.  Many people use smartphones to access the Internet as well to make calls.  Broadband is brilliant but one needs a mobile phone signal to start with.  Mr. Griffin said the regulator let companies off too lightly by not insisting on a sufficiently high level of penetration once it got to 80% or 90% of the------</p></speech>

First, the availability of a good and ubiquitous mobile phone service requires spectrum.  One thing the Minister has done is to auction the 3.6 GHz spectrum, which frees up more spectrum for use for the mobile phone sector while accruing &euro;78 million to the State.  I mentioned earlier that he has given RT&Eacute; &euro;8 million to do a class of a digital switchover, which will allow it to get out of using some of the spectrum that is used for television broadcasting and free that up for mobile phones.  This type of spectrum - 700 MHz - is particularly useful in rural areas because of the nature of the wave.  That will become available in 2019.</p> <p>  The other thing that is ongoing on foot of the mobile phone and broadband task force is that the operators are working very closely with the local authorities.  A number of pilot local authorities, including the Chairman's local authority in County Laois, are under way to see where are the blackspots.  Local authorities and the mobile phone operators have been asked to identify these and what can be done, including piggy-backing onto State infrastructure, to see if the service can be improved.  That pilot programme is under way. </p></speech>

I have not seen any new masts being erected in the past five years.  While the old permissions are being renewed, there does not appear to be an appetite to fill the gaps.  The companies are throwing the issue back on the State by asking to use State infrastructure rather than spending a few bob of their own money.</p> <p>  Cybersecurity is an emerging theme.

We have seen that quite clearly over the last number of years.  People would not have dreamed, even five years ago, of getting into offshore renewable energy.  The price of that has come down dramatically.  We are seeing the technology costs reducing very significantly.  I am talking about the totality of the shift from the sort of fossil fuel-based economy that we are operating in to a low-carbon economy where we will have to invest in the electrification of the suburban rail lines and more Luas lines.  There will have to be changes in agricultural practices and there will be a cost.  We will have to fundamentally change our tax model if we are moving away from diesel cars to electric cars.  All of this has a cost but obviously there are massive savings and good things will come.</p></speech>

There was some discussion on this yesterday with Deputy Burton, where reference was made to the provision in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 of a restriction limiting the amount of trading losses incurred by a NAMA-participating bank that could be set off against future trading profits.  The set-off was limited to 50% of the profit in any given year but, in the Finance Act 2014, the Minister's predecessor removed that restriction.  Our awareness of the current position of the banks comes from their published accounts.  As at June 2017, Bank of Ireland's deferred tax assets included an amount of &euro;1.251 billion in respect of tax losses available to relieve future profits from tax.  AIB, at December 2016, had deferred tax assets of &euro;2.928 billion.  In its 2016 annual report, Permanent TSB showed a deferred tax asset on tax losses carried forward of &euro;373 million.  This equates to tax losses of some &euro;2.98 billion and the estimation is that it will take 22 years for those losses to be utilised.  We heard similar estimates from the other banks when their representatives appeared before the committee recently.</p><p>What is the Government's position on this issue, with specific reference to the change introduced in 2014?  Is the Minister holding the possibility of a potential change to the provision as a stick he may use in his dealings with the banks concerning the tracker mortgage issue?  Is it one of the weapons he hinted he might use in the event the banks do not meet their responsibilities in this regard?  I am well aware that trading losses carried forward are an important feature of our corporation tax code.  However, the circumstances here are truly exceptional and the provision does, therefore, warrant examination.  Will the Minister comment on the capital position of the banks in which we own shares?  Has an analysis been done, for example, of what a change in the existing provision would mean for them from a capital perspective?  As I understand it, these deferred tax assets are recognised as core tier 1 capital.  As such, has the Department done an assessment of whether or not a change which impacted on the figures might require the State to stump up more capital to put into the banks?  I would want to see that analysis before making any decision on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#B00700"><p>My amendment No. 45, like Deputy McGrath's amendment, relates to the carrying forward of bank losses.  I have been raising this issue since 2014, when the then Fine Gael-Labour Party Government decided to change the provision which allowed for only 50% of losses to be carried forward.  That provision was a deliberate inclusion in the NAMA Act 2009 by the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, who made the point when he introduced it in the Seanad - the Minister and I were both in that House at the time - that it was necessary because of the magnitude of bank losses that were being recorded.  It was important, Mr. Lenihan noted, that these banks should start to pay a proportion of tax as soon as possible.  Limiting the carrying forward capacity to 50% of losses showed the then Minister's foresight.  He knew the banks would enter into profitability at some point and that if the standard 100% carry forward of losses in our tax code applied, then the banks would not be paying tax for decades.  He did the right thing at that time.</p> <p>  However, the then Government decided to change that provision in 2014.  I am not immune to the reasons this was done.  Deputy McGrath referred to core tier 1 capital ratios and the fact that if the change was not made, some of the banks, including the pillar banks, may have needed to raise additional capital .  If they could not raise it in the markets, it might have fallen to the Government to stump up more, which would not have been palatable to the Irish public.</p> <p>  However, we are now in 2017 and in a position where all of these banks have returned to profitability.  AIB is on course to record a profit this year of &euro;1.5 billion and to be one of the most profitable banks in Europe.  Bank of Ireland made a profit of &euro;1 billion last year and Permanent TSB entered into profitability last year, although it slipped back a little in the first six months of 2017.  Taking AIB and Bank of Ireland, their combined profit of &euro;2.5 billion would require a payment of &euro;300 million if they had to pay corporation tax.  They are paying nothing, however, because they are able to carry forward their losses.  AIB told us it would be 20 years before it starts paying taxes and Permanent TSB said it would be in excess of 20 years before it begins making payments.  The Bank of Ireland delegates indicated that it will be quite a number of years before their bank pays tax in the State.  These banks have played fast and loose with Irish people's money.  They have deprived Irish families of their homes and their futures, which has had an impact on individuals' sense of well-being and mental health.  We are all familiar with this from the tracker mortgage scandal and many other scandals over the years.</p> <p>  The core issue here is the question of why the Government has not re-introduced the provision in the 2009 Act which was intended to be there for the duration of the banks' losses.  That restriction was not intended by Brian Lenihan to operate only for a year or two.  The late Minister knew the banks were never going to make a profit for a number of years.  The provision was introduced with an eye to the situation we are in now, and the Late Mr. Lenihan knew we would reach this point some time in the future.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will talk about the bank levy but that is not the same.  It is not based on profitability and is wider in its application than those institutions which have the major losses.  One can argue that this is about deferred tax and the banks will end up paying the tax at some stage, when the losses are all used up.  If we reverted to the 50% provision, we would just be allowing the banks to continue paying their losses over a longer period of time.  The point is that we need the taxes now, not in 20 years time.  We do not know what circumstances will prevail in the State in two decades but we do know we could use this revenue now to address the serious crises in health and housing.  I strongly commend these amendments, which are merely seeking a report on this issue, incorporating the pre-2014 capital position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#C00100"><p>Loss relief is a standard feature of corporate tax regimes worldwide.  Under the Irish corporate tax regime, losses incurred in the course of a business are allowed to be taken into account in calculating the appropriate amount of tax due by companies.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over a longer period than just a single year and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not allow loss relief in the next.</p> <p>  Under existing loss relief provisions in the tax Acts, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for offset against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods.  Alternatively, a company may claim to have the loss set off against profits of any description for the same accounting period in which the loss was incurred or of an immediately preceding accounting period of the same length.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and of the tax codes of all other OECD countries.  It would be difficult to justify the taxation of business profits without also taking due account of business losses.</p> <p>  As both Deputies have acknowledged, under the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 a new section, section 396C, was inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The provision limited the amount of prior year losses that a NAMA participating institution could offset against trading profits to 50% of trading profit for each accounting period.  It should be noted that it did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used.  In 2013, the Minister for Finance decided it was appropriate to remove the restriction on relief for losses in participating institutions with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.  This was done against the backdrop of the introduction of new capital rules.</p> <p>  The removal of the restriction has protected the carrying value of deferred tax assets at the banks in which the State has a significant stake, thus improving capital ratios under the new Basel III rules and consequently increasing the value of the State's investment.  The removal of section 396C enabled the banks to absorb their losses over a shorter timeframe than would be the case with a 50% limit in place.  While corporation tax will not be payable on the banks' trading profits until their losses are fully absorbed, the net effect of the measure in terms of tax receipts is one of timing.  This will be offset by an improvement in the valuation of the State's equity stakes in the banks as well as its debt investments, while the risk to the State as backstop provider of capital is also reduced.  Rather than interfere with the deferred tax assets by changing tax policy, the Government has ensured a contribution from the sector by introducing a bank levy which has been payable since 2014.  This provided an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It is anticipated that the bank levy will to raise &euro;750 million over five years.</p> <p>  To deal with each of the amendments in turn, it is important to acknowledge that they are different even though they are grouped together.  Deputy McGrath's amendment seeks to outline what the impacts could be of restricting loss relief, whereas the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty seeks to examine what options there would be for going ahead and doing it.  From a policy perspective the first amendment asks me to outline what the consequences would be of pursuing a policy while the second amendment more clearly reflects the view of Deputy Pearse Doherty that this is a policy direction the Government should take.  The strong advice I have received is that any indication that we are going to change the taxation status of the deferred losses would have an effect on other objectives we are seeking to fulfil with the banks in terms of what we want the future capital position to be and the ability of the State to recover the investment the Irish taxpayer has made in those banks.</p> <p>  I do not have any intention of changing how we tax the deferred losses in the Irish banking system because I believe there would be consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfil other objectives that the House and the Irish people want me to fulfil in respect of the Irish banking code.  If the committee wants me to refer back to it at a later point and outline the consequences of such a policy action I am willing to do so.  Deputy Michael McGrath asked me a direct question about the capital consequences of doing this.  I do not have that information with me today.  I have asked my officials to check whether such a piece of work has been done, so I will have to refer back to the committee on that.  However, I wish to emphasise that from my perspective changing how we tax what are referred to as "assets" would have other consequences for which I would be held responsible by the committee.  My firm view is that the medium-term response to how we deal with this issue is the maintenance of the bank levy.  If the committee wants me to outline what would be the consequences of other courses of action I will do that.</p></speech>

It is an important aspect of our corporation tax system and it should be preserved.  There are exceptional circumstances here and that is why the issue must be examined.  The reason I framed the amendment as I did is to tease out what the consequences would be of making a change.  It is a timing issue but it is a timing issue over a long horizon of more than 20 years in certain cases.  When the Minister made his statement on the tracker mortgage issue he said that one of the possible policy measures available to him was amending tax law in a targeted way.  Is he clarifying this morning that he was not referring to possible changes to the treatment of deferred tax assets in respect of the banks and the carrying forward of losses and that he was only referring to the bank levy when he made that reference?  Second, what commitment is the Minister giving with regard to the consequences for the capital position of the banks?  Can a paper on that be forwarded to this committee so we can examine what the consequences would be of the impact on deferred tax assets and then the impact on the capital position and a possible call on the Exchequer for additional capital?  I would like to see that analysis.</p></speech>

On the second question, I will ask my Department to prepare a paper laying out the consequences of such a course of action.  However, I wish to make it clear that the policy outlook I will adhere to is the maintenance of the bank levy.  I believe that is the best course of action open to me at present to allow me to realise other objectives in respect of the banks in which we have shares.  While I will refer back to the committee with figures relating to what could be the consequences of other courses of action, I wish to do so in the framework of also indicating to the committee that my perspective is that the bank levy continues to be the appropriate tool of raising additional tax revenue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#C00400"><p>First, if we had the ability to table amendments that would impose a charge on the State or the public purse I would not have drafted amendments to provide for a report.  I and my party want the Minister to revert back to the pre-2014 position.  I do not want the Minister to justify the fact that AIB will pay no taxes for 20 years and Permanent TSB will pay no taxes for 22 years.  Some of these banks are recording &euro;1.5 billion in profit.  Bank of Ireland will not pay any taxes to the Irish State for a number of years.  The public wants those banks to start paying their taxes and they want those taxes used to fix the health service and the housing and homelessness crisis.  They want the banks and bankers to start paying fair taxes.</p><p> That is why I am pressing amendment No. 45.  I want an informed discussion and debate and the report would allow us to do that.  The options will include all of those issues, but I want to steer the Parliament in a direction such that we no longer tolerate a situation whereby a bank that records &euro;1.5 billion of profit in 2017 does not pay a penny of tax to the State.</p><p> Like Deputy McGrath, I value the issue of losses being carried forward.  I have not argued for that to be taken out of the tax code.  However, I have argued against the position resulting from the NAMA Act 2009, put in place by the late Brian Lenihan.  Obviously there was pressure at the time because of the bailout of the banks and a massive guarantee had been issued to the banks at the time.  The then Minister had the foresight to see that these banks were going to be profitable at some point in future and that they needed to start paying their taxes as quickly as possible.</p><p> The 2013 situation no longer arises.  Representatives from Allied Irish Banks appeared before the committee and I questioned them on the matter.  They referred to the fact that if they did not have this provision in 2013, and taking effect in 2014, there would be need for additional capital.  However, they also confirmed that if we went back to the 50% figure, there would be no requirement for additional capital to be raised.  Moreover, even if additional capital were to be raised, those banks are likely to be able to raise that capital on the international markets instead of drawing from the public purse.</p><p> This is why I am pressing amendment No. 45.  The Minister is saying that he will give us the information, but he is not going to change his position.  The Minister is doing that deliberately and I understand why he is doing it.  He is sending a clear signal to the markets, potential investors and the banks to the effect that everything is fine and not to worry, and that as long as Fine Gael is in government, they will be able to continue not paying taxes on the massive profits they make for the coming 20 years.  The Minister is signalling to the bankers that Fine Gael has their back and that the party is for opportunists.  I am saying that is wrong.  There is no point in the Minister providing information to us but then saying he is not going to change his position.</p><p> Amendment No. 45 tries to allow members present to decide whether it is the right course of action to allows banks in the State that have been bailed out with tens of billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money to pay no taxes for the next 20 years.  We can decide through a vote that this situation needs to come to an end.  We can have an options paper within six months on how to bring it to an end and it will include all the information that has the effect of the capital allowance.  From there, we can make the decision on which option is preferred.</p></speech>

I accept the logic of companies being able to bring losses forward for the reason outlined by the Minister.  He suggested that it does not take place over one year, etc.  However, the Minister seems to be studiously avoiding the point that in this case these were not the banks' losses, but public losses.  The public paid for these first time around.  By the time we head for the 20 year mark, it will be a post-privatisation scenario if the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, presumably, have their way.  That will mean the public effectively pays again in terms of not getting tax.  It is a double bailout for the banks paid for by the taxpayer.  This is not a normal situation.  It is an extraordinary situation because of the bank bailout.  That is the reason for the call for the Minister not to respond by simply saying that the rules operate in this way because this is not a normal situation.</p></speech>

I have other considerations to bear in mind as well apart from the view of a particular bank.  Given Deputy Doherty's understandable focus &ndash; it is one I share &ndash; in trying to have evidence, facts and views available to him before he reaches a policy view, I would have thought that a consistent position would be to allow me to spell out in the coming period the consequences of a move like this.</p> <p>  That is not what Deputy Doherty is asking me to do with this amendment.  He is saying this is what he wants to happen, as he has already said.  The main interest of my party is not, as Deputy Doherty suggests, to look after the interests of the privileged few.  My objectives fall into two different areas.  First, I want to ensure taxpayers have a path to get back the money invested in these banks.  I thought Deputy Doherty had a similar view.  I want to ensure that we get back all of the &euro;28 billion invested in the banks and I hope Deputy Doherty shares that view &ndash; I believe he does.  The advice and information available to me suggests the maintenance of the bank levy in the medium term and the ability for us to regain the investment over time.  If the Government decides to dispose of its shares in those banks, we can then have a debate on what we do with the proceedings of those disposals.  The path to regain that money is best served by indicating that we believe the current tax policy is the appropriate one.</p> <p>  I reiterate the point in respect of what Deputy Murphy said.  I want taxpayers to get their money back and I want to ensure the money we have invested in those banks comes back to us.  While these banks have returned to profitability, it is a return to profitability after many years of losses.  Otherwise, I would not be in this situation or dealing with the questions that Deputy Murphy is putting to me.  I am keen to ensure that as soon as possible we have a banking system that is capable of meeting the other needs of people.  At a bare minimum, this includes handling and resolving promptly issues relating to tracker mortgages, which I expect to see happen in the way I have outlined before.  The system must also be capable of meeting other needs in terms of being able to provide the right levels of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises as well as for investment opportunities and purchases that families want to make throughout the length and breadth of the country.</p> <p>  These are the reasons that the course of action I outlined on budget day and again today is the best one to take.  I can outline to the committee the consequences of an alternative approach.  However, I want to do that clearly in the spirit of saying that I believe the course of action I have outlined in recent statements is the right one.  I would be willing to outline to the committee the perspectives and figures that are available to me and that indicate why this is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#D00900"><p>I do not believe there is too much distance between the various arguments being made around the table.  Perhaps it might be helpful to look at some principles.  One of the first principles relates to someone who is earning a good deal or has a business where that business is making a large profit.  If that business is a key domestic business, such as banking, and it is profitable on a current basis notwithstanding a history of losses, then it should contribute.  That should apply notwithstanding the extraordinary history of the collapse of the banks and their extraordinary behaviour, which contributed to that collapse.  I presume we can agree that this is what the common good requires as well as common decency and any notion of fairness or equality.  All of these aspects are fairly accepted principles in a good taxation system.  The Minister has indicated that he broadly supports such a system.</p><p>Essentially what we are talking about here, in the context of Irish law, custom and practice, as referred to by the Minister, is the recognition of losses.  What this is doing is restricting the ability of the banks to avail of the losses over time, or indefinitely, as is now the case now, and for as much loss as has accrued, and without any recognition - because it would probably be very difficult to apply it to all businesses - of whether they were at fault in any way regarding the creation of these losses.</p><p>  Previously when I was in opposition and the late Brian Lenihan was in government, we came to an agreement that there should be a restriction on the ability of very high-net-worth individuals to use losses here and now so that, in the current period and not the indefinite future, they would have to make a minimum contribution.  The reason for that was very simple.  A series of reports was produced by the Revenue Commissioners on my request to show there were people with incomes in excess of &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million.  It sounds like much more innocent days because those sums were considered to be a great deal ten or 15 years ago.  The agreement was that the individuals concerned could not end up paying zero tax while those working in their houses, estates, farms or stud farms would be paying tax on a much more modest weekly income.  The Government at the time in question agreed to increase the levy, as the Minister knows.  His officials will say the agreement was very successful.  Did it result in a flight of people from Ireland?  Did it result in a collapse of their enterprises?  If their enterprises collapsed, it was not because of the agreement but it was a matter of basic equity.</p><p> If the Minister examines the history of this &mdash; he said he will revert to the committee on this &mdash; he will note it is very offensive to somebody who is going to take the new Luas through St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to point to the Bank of Ireland, tot up what it cost people in this country, notwithstanding that it is in recovery mode, and say it is great and that while it is currently making &euro;0.5 billion in profit, it will, I am sure, be making a profit well beyond &euro;1 billion in a couple of years.  The same will be said about AIB.  It is very difficult to understand.  Losses do not matter when profits are not being made because the banks have nothing to claim against.  That is why the argument is only gaining ground now and why we are only understanding it now.  I discussed this matter when in government and I am not going to talk about the details of the discussions.  The levy, which the Labour Party put forward, is still a lesser mechanism than actually restricting the use of the losses.</p><p> On grounds of broad business efficiency in the economy, the hangover from the losses is wrong.  It is wrong from the perspective of other people in business, perhaps competing with the same banks or perhaps having an interest in providing services, that the banks have this extraordinary leeway.</p><p> At a minimum, the reports should be produced but the Government should also consider my proposal actively.  It is a bit of a warning shot across the banks' bows but it also tells the people who bailed them out collectively and ensured much hardship and many reductions that there is some notion of fairness, equity and horizontal equality in the Irish tax system that addresses the matter of significant earnings.  We can pick a figure.  We could create a company earnings threshold of &euro;200 million, for example.  With regard to the indefinite hangover, we have been talking about using or losing development land.  It is wrong, at a time when we need significant funds to fund the kinds of services we expect and, more particularly, the infrastructure we need to remain competitive after Brexit, that they are not being asked to make a contribution.  Their not doing so makes them feel like masters of the universe all over again.  Hence, they do not feel obliged to treat their customers with the kind of sensitivity and understanding the Minister is displaying towards them because of what they experienced.  Their former leadership was much more culpable than an ordinary person who bought a mortgage in good faith and went into debt.  At times, the banks suggested to couples that they hold on to their existing apartment and let it, with the result that they ended up with the nightmare of being accidental buy-to-let landlords in the market.</p><p> I welcome the fact that the Minister sounds open to discussing and examining this.  I do not believe it is difficult for the Department to support the production of the reports.  If the Minister has an alternative basis on which a report might be produced - he might bring it to us on Report Stage - I, for one, would certainly be prepared to consider it.  It relates to an important issue concerning principles in the Irish tax system.</p></speech>

We have debated this before.  I have exchanged views on the matter with the other Deputies here this morning.  The banks to which the Deputy is referring and that are the subject of this debate are banks in which the Irish taxpayer has an investment or equity of between &euro;11 billion and &euro;11.5 billion, as she well knows.  One of the greatest contributions I can make back to meet the needs of the taxpayers who supported the banking system at a time of crisis is to get their money back.  The Irish State had to borrow to put money into the banks.  Our national debt, as a result, is higher than it should be.  I want to get the money back.  The Deputy has a different view on what we should do with the money when it comes back, as was the case when receiving some back from the disposal of the share in AIB.  The Deputy has put a different case forward regarding how it should be invested.  I believe the right thing to do was to put the money we got towards paying back the additional debt we incurred as a result of having to put money into the banks.</p> <p>  My assessment and recommendation to the Deputy today is that if she shares my view on trying to get the money back and also on some of the other points she touched upon, such as the need for more investment in infrastructure, we should use the banking levy as I propose.   We know we need our banking system supplying more credit to allow more homes to be built, for example.  We know issues arise over the pricing of products within Ireland by comparison with other countries we might compare ourselves to.  I want to see improvements and changes in this regard.  When I consider all the competing objectives, my assessment is that the best course of action for us, up to 2021, is to use the banking levy as a way of regaining revenue and getting value back for the taxpayer, as opposed to what Deputy Doherty is asking me to do today.</p> <p>  I repeat what I indicated earlier, namely, that while I am not going to indicate I am changing my policy direction on the banking levy, I will revert to the committee.  Perhaps we can deal with this matter on Report Stage and outline the consequences of alternative courses of action.  Based on my understanding of those consequences, I believe the retention of the banking levy is the most sensible option to allow us to get money back while also delivering on the other objectives I know the Deputy would want me to achieve for our banks.</p></speech>

The Minister shall within 3 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report in relation to the tax neutral status available to Section 110 companies that are involved in loan origination businesses, which examines removing this tax neutral status.&quot;</blockquote> <p>This amendment relates to another report on the tax-neutral status available to section 110 companies which are involved in the loan origination business in order to examine the removal of this status.  In the Finance Bill 2016, changes were made to the section 110 regime.  We saw these changes brought in and they were welcome, but there was a carve-out built in with regard to non-bank landers involved in the loan origination business.  This means that non-bank lenders with hundreds of millions lent to Irish businesses, and with profits in the millions, could continue to pay tax of as little as &euro;250 per year.</p><p>Let us look at an example of one such lender.  BlueBay has issued debt to the fast food business, Abrakebabra, and the Mater Private Hospital, among others.  From looking at its lending rates online, I assume that the blended average rate of its loan book is in excess of 6%.  That would mean profits of well over &euro;9 million in 2016 where BlueBay had &euro;160 million loaned out, a blended rate of 6% and profits of &euro;9 million.  Does the Minister know how much tax it paid?  It paid &euro;250 on profits of &euro;9 million.  That is not acceptable, and it is not fair in light of everything we have seen.  We talk about tax avoidance, the Paradise Papers and so on, and politicians will tut-tut at this and tut-tut at that.  This is about really smart accountants trying to find loopholes.  The Minister is engineering the loopholes into the Finance Bill.  This was done deliberately last year.  How can the Minister stand over a company which loaned out &euro;160 million and made in the region of &euro;9 million profit on those loans to Irish businesses, including the Mater Private Hospital and Abrakebabra as examples, paying only &euro;250 tax on its profits?</p></speech>

The tax provisions are intended to create a tax neutral regime for securitisation and structured finance purposes.</p> <p>  Loan originations involve a section 110 company fronting for a foreign bank and either lending directly to larger more sophisticated borrowers, or immediately issuing newly made loans to smaller borrowers from the foreign bank.  Provided the foreign bank is established in one of the countries with which we have signed a double tax agreement, no Irish tax would have arisen on its interest income had it lent directly to the Irish borrowers.  As the original creditor, there can be no taxable capital gain on any subsequent sale of the loans.  If the loan origination company is a qualifying company, within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it can to operate in a tax neutral manner in Ireland using a section 110 company.  </p> <p>  In respect of the Finance Act 2016 changes, the desire was to address behaviour and issues in the area of property and property-based loans.  I acknowledge, however, that issues outside property are more complex and I want to ensure that section 110 operates in a proper manner.  If concerns are raised about the operation of section 110 in the loan origination space, I will ask the Revenue Commissioners and my officials to investigate these concerns.  I am not, therefore, in a position to accept the amendment.</p> <p>  I will make two points.  First, neither I nor the Revenue Commissioners are engaged in any kind of engineering or drafting of legislation to allow companies or individuals to avoid tax we believe they should pay.  Second, I know some of this was touched on yesterday with the Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, but I am aware of all of the debate on, and changes which were subsequently made to, the Finance Bill 2016 with regard to section 110 companies and organisations as well as property transactions and lending in that regard.  I am aware of concerns that have been raised recently, but the Revenue Commissioners have told me that its assessment is that no tax which could have been due has been lost in this space.  However, if I receive any indication from the Revenue Commissioners or from my Department that is no longer the case and that issues are developing in the loan origination space which need to be addressed, I will look at those issues.  </p> <p>  I will not comment on the information which the Deputy has offered in respect of an individual company because it is not appropriate for me to do so, but any companies in the loan origination space should be meeting their tax commitments in Ireland.  If I receive any information to the contrary, I will consider the matter and engage with the Revenue Commissioners on it.</p></speech>

I would not suggest otherwise.  Last year, when the Oireachtas dealt with section 110, a carve-out for loan origination was clearly written into the Bill.  These changes did not apply to loan origination.  Therefore, these companies can still use section 110 vehicles to write down their tax liabilities.  They have special purpose vehicles under section 110 which neutralise, or almost neutralise, their tax liabilities.  Therefore, neither the Revenue Commissioners nor I would in any way suggest that Revenue is developing policy for tax avoidance.  I have huge regard for the Revenue Commissioners.  The accusation I made was about the Minister and his Government, not the Revenue Commissioners.  Let us be clear - the Revenue Commissioners are not losing any tax on this because it has to apply the law and the law says that companies can use this vehicle in order to pay such low taxes.</p> <p>  We can talk about section 110, we can talk about special purpose vehicles and we can talk about loan origination, but my basic question is as follows.  I gave BlueBay as an example.  I know the Minister cannot talk about an individual company but its files are on record.  It paid &euro;250 in tax.  It is involved with the State through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  Cardinal Capital Group is using the exact same vehicle.  It has not filed its returns yet, but it is likely that the same figure of &euro;250 will appear.  The key question is that if a company has loaned out &euro;160 million, for example, at a rate of 6% and made profit of in the region of &euro;9 million, how does the Minister for Finance stand over the fact that it only paid &euro;250 in tax on that profit.  Does tax avoidance not hurt us all?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#F01000"><p>Last year, the Government acknowledged, after section 110 had been consciously created, that it caused a problem.  The Government was supposedly shutting down a major tax avoidance measure, but at the same time keeping this loophole open.  At the time the Government estimated in the budget that the shutting down of this so-called loophole in section 110 would raise an additional &euro;50 million.  Does the Minister have any figures as to how much was raised?</p> <p>  Can the Minister provide any justification, because he did not do so in his reply to Deputy Doherty, as to why this carve-out was created for loan origination businesses?  If he acknowledged that section 110 was being used in a problematic way by big companies in order to avoid paying tax and was closing it down generally, what was his justification for continuing it for loan origination businesses?</p></speech>

Loans which derive their value from land in the State are an interest in land, so we also maintain the right to tax profits associated with these loans.  We do not maintain the same taxing rights over loans that derive their value from other sources, for example, a business within the State.  As I touched on earlier, loan origination involves a section 110 company which is fronting for a foreign bank and lending directly to larger borrowers, etc.  If that bank is established in a country with which we have signed a double taxation treaty, no Irish tax would have arisen on its interest income had it lent directly to the Irish borrowers.  As the original creditor, there can therefore be no taxable capital gain on any subsequent sale of the loans.</p> <p>  On Deputy Paul Murphy's question on the yield, the figure we had provided for in budget 2017 was &euro;50 million.  Given the year is not yet complete, I cannot give an indication now on whether we will meet that figure but my expectation is that we will meet it and possibly exceed it.  However, I will be able to answer the question early in 2018.</p></speech>

I am not answering a question that relates to an individual company.  It would not be appropriate for me to do so.  I am answering the question generally.  In Irish legislation, as it stands, and our double taxation treaties, which we have with many countries, we maintain the right to tax land differently to how we tax loans and other forms of activity.  That is the reason.</p></speech>

However, does the Minister not think that we should change the legislation?  That is what we are doing here with the Finance Bill and what we are looking for in this amendment.  We are seeking to change the legislation.  Companies making &euro;9 million in profit here should be asked to pay a bit more than &euro;250 in tax.</p></speech>

I am not doubting the bona fides of the figures he is putting forward but I am not in a position to comment on them.  I have explained to the Deputy the general reasons for the approach we take.

It would examine removing this tax neutral status.  That is what we are seeking and what we will be voting on.  It is immoral that companies which record millions of euro in profits pay &euro;250 in tax.  The Minister and others who will vote against the amendment or abstain on the issue will tut tut about tax evasion, but the Minister is engineering tax evasion into our tax code.  These companies are breaking no laws and the Revenue Commissioners are doing exactly what is required of them because they are applying the laws of the State, which we as politicians design.  We have designed this law.  Thank God we changed the law on property and so on last year, but now it is time to change the law on loan origination.  This amendment calls merely for a report to examine the issue.  Therefore, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

In this context, it is strikingly obvious from the report of the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers that significant numbers of individuals and companies do not just want low taxes.  Rather, they want to pay no tax in whatever global situation or company they work in.</p><p>I have raised this issue on a number of occasions over a long period of time.  In the context of the most recent revelations and the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, regardless of whether there is a long transition period, this is something we in Ireland have to address.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that we have a very clearly stated rate of corporation tax and other taxes, people who operate with the intention to avoid or evade taxation and use a globalised financial, taxation and legal system to do so can avoid paying any tax in Ireland.  It is in that context that I put forward this amendment.</p><p>I heard a representative of the OECD, whom I have met on many occasions, speak on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; earlier.  When I was a member of the previous Government, I was probably the strongest advocate for Ireland joining the OECD process in regard to broad tax reform with a view to benefiting all countries, including Ireland.  I did not want the country's eyes wiped by accountants, lawyers and others who play a globalised game, in terms of desperately needed tax revenues for this country.</p><p>Ultimately, such behaviour is probably one of the greatest threats to modern democracies because it is resulting in a skewed and unfair system.  As revelations in various disclosures have shown - there will be more - some people are getting away with it because of the global structures in which they are involved.</p><p>Ireland has an extensive range of tax treaties with other jurisdictions.  Jurisdictions which were part of the British empire are the most effective and efficient forms of tax avoidance locations anyone in the world has seen.</p><p>There are a number of states in the United States which specialise in this area as well.<br/><br/>We have a problem.  We also have a problem, as the Minister is well aware, with our neighbours in the European Union who, understandably, at times have a concern and at times pick unfairly on Ireland because they believe that, due to our corporation tax regime, we are a major facilitator.  We know the current discussions in regard to the Apple case.  What I am suggesting to the Minister is that he produce a report on a minimum effective tax rate.  His predecessor had certain objections to this, which I have to confess I never fully understood.  A minimum tax rate can be set very low but it does a couple of things.  From a tax point of view, it means that the corporation comes into a potentially meaningful relationship, a documentary relationship, with the tax authorities in this country, other than filing a simple return at the end of which is a big nought, because it does not have anything to pay, or at the end of which is an amount that is so low in regard to its taxable profit that it defies the understanding of ordinary citizens.  I do not believe the Government has anything to fear from such a report.  In fact, in the context of the current revelations, and perhaps the strategic communications unit could be consulted on this, there is much to be said for the Irish Government not disregarding Irish interests but addressing these issues and developing an awareness of what is coming down the tracks.<br/><br/>What is coming down the tracks is a way of doing this that a number of jurisdictions have already shown and debated. ?  Obviously, I do not know if this is this going to take a short or a long time, although the Minister may have more information on that.  He is attending ECOFIN and I am sure some of these issues will come up.  As I said, this issue in regard to income tax was addressed by one of his predecessors quite a long time ago.  That was done by agreement and the sky did not fall in, although many were fearful the sky would fall in.  Instead, very wealthy people who are resident in this country have to contribute a minimum effective tax rate whereas the Revenue Commissioners' reports had previously shown that people earning in excess of &euro;1 million annually were paying no tax at all because of the arrangements they had entered into.<br/><br/>The report is to be on the merits of a minimum effective tax rate.  This would require whoever was drawing up the report on behalf of the Government to address the downsides of having a structure which is riddled with loopholes like a sieve and which, because of the secrecy surrounding taxation affairs, we always learn about some years later.  That we are not doing this is absolutely undermining our democracy and the democracy of many other countries.  I am sure there are people, particularly within the Revenue Commissioners, who are very knowledgeable about this and who could produce a measured and thoughtful report about what this is doing to the country, the implications for democracy, the implications for the fairness and equity of the tax system and fairness to different classes of taxpayer and the implications for the future strong, positive and robust development of the country.  We are at risk, post-Brexit, not just of becoming an outlier but, in the eyes of some, of acquiring a kind of pariah status, which is deeply unfair to this country and, strategically, is something the Government should be very careful about.  As I said, there was a lot of opposition in previous Governments, at a time when I do not think the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was a member of Government, to the idea that we would, for example, pursue the OECD process.  We pursued the OECD process and, if anything, it has been very helpful to the country in that the OECD was able to come out at various stages and say that Ireland is not a tax haven <i>per se</i>, which has been very important for our international reputation.  It would also be very important to future investments in this country as very big global investors will seek to be in environments that are not labelled simply as tax-dodging entities.<br/><br/>I would be interested in what the Minister has to say on this as I think it is fundamental to securing the future of this country.  The Minister referred to banks not having any scheme to mitigate the use of carrying losses forward.  He talked about that in terms of giving a payback to the taxpayers for what they had done for the banks.  However, the Minister must seek to defend in a serious way the reputation of the country, which is being shredded.  The Taoiseach may be very friendly with the President of France, Mr. Macron, but that is not going to cut much ice when Italy and France join up effectively, as they are doing at the moment and have been doing for some time, to address these issues.<br/><br/>The other issue is that some of the companies involved are so large that it is relatively easy to identify, say, the ten or 15 which may be most involved, certainly from our point of view.  The old excuse is that we cannot discuss this on grounds of secrecy but these entities are so large and so much part of people's day-to-day lives that they are not secret.  I totally agree with the adherence to secrecy in terms of taxpayers' affairs but, when the entity has multiples of the entire output of Ireland and multiples of the reach of Ireland, while it is not a country and is a company, fresh thinking is required.<br/><br/>The process began two budgets ago when the Government began to bring in people like Seamus Coffey to prepare reports.  All I can say is that, whether one agrees with those reports or not, their production has been extremely useful and helpful to the country and its reputation.  I am interested to hear whether the Minister is going to pretend this is not the world we are living in now.  We need to look at this issue and be able to talk about it.  We need to defend the rights of Ireland to attract foreign direct investment and the jobs it brings.  We need to have a fair tax system, but one that results in corporations paying minimum taxes.  There is no point in saying that, in practice, these very big companies actually do pay something; we need to have a structure that we can point to, and we need to pick a figure, for example, 6.5% or 7.5%, which is a very modest figure.  We need to do that so we are able to turn around in the future and defend our location as a very attractive location for foreign direct investment.  We need also to be able to reassure those companies that the environment in which they are operating is genuinely lawful and not damaging to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>These are very big issues.  The proposal is to look at minimum effective tax rates.  One can pick different kinds of minimum effective tax rates and it would be for whoever the Minister might commission to work on this.  Ten years ago we could not get any information about how much the highest and lowest individual taxpayers paid in tax.</p><p>Gradually we got information about that and that enabled us to change the system.</p><p> At the moment Ireland is being called out and named, unfairly in some respects, as being among the worst culprits mentioned in the recent revelations.  We need to put our collective information and intelligence on this matter together because otherwise we risk becoming a pariah country, something we do not deserve.  We should not receive such treatment but the Minister is going to have to take some decisions to address this.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the consequences of the growing public debate over the international and domestic taxation of massive companies.  I am also well aware of the legitimacy challenges that this poses for individual taxpayers and of the consequences for our national reputation.  As one might expect given the gravity of the matter, I put a huge amount of my time as Minister for Finance into managing this.</p> <p>  It is important to reiterate a number of points here.  I am completely committed to the OECD process because it has, to date, generated a global template for dealing with corporate tax matters.  I have avoided commenting on the details of any particular company mentioned in the Paradise Papers or in the Panama Papers before that.  As was reiterated by the OECD contributor on Morning Ireland today, however, we can draw the broad conclusion that a global solution is required here.  Part of such a global solution would involve many companies moving at the same time or having the same pathway towards resolving this matter.  We have both the OECD agenda and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, process at the heart of much of what we have done and are looking to do.</p> <p>  I welcome the contribution made by Mr. Seamus Coffey's report on this matter and I have put it out for public consultation.  The Finance Bill 2017 lays the foundations for many of the other changes and decisions I will be making into the next year and beyond in order to continue to bring the Irish corporate tax code into line with the OECD recommendations.  I will carry all of this out.  I want our corporate tax code to be both acknowledged by all to be legitimate and to leave us competitive.  We will pursue both of these objectives and are on a path to doing so.  The OECD contributor on Morning Ireland today recognised that, after a period of debate which is understandable given the open nature of our economy, Ireland has indeed put in place actions to ensure that we play our part in the co-ordinated actions necessary to deal with the consequences of unco-ordinated tax regimes all over world and with what certain companies and very wealthy have been trying to do.  At the next Eurogroup and ECOFIN meeting, for example, recommendations will come from the European Commission on the creation and consequences of a so-called blacklist.  Ireland will play its full role in dealing with these matters because it is in our national interest to have them resolved. This is what we are trying to do here.</p> <p>  What I have to manage, however, is the other side of the coin, namely, the fact that we have a corporate tax model that is both a legitimate response and a legitimate element of the economic model of a small, open country located where we are in Europe.  As a result of Brexit and the process of  moving towards leaving the European Union by the end of transition period, the United Kingdom is now already committed to making choices on its corporate tax model and on reducing the headline rate.  This means that companies will look at what the United Kingdom is doing as well as at their own locations and investments here in Ireland, and this is something of which I also have to be aware as I outline a path for how we want to ensure that our own corporate tax model is both competitive and legitimate.</p> <p>  Deputy Burton talked about our reputation being shredded.  I ask her to also take into account, however, the efforts we have made to deal with matters over the past few years as well as our clear commitment to the OECD process.  The Deputy talked about secrecy but I think she also acknowledged that I, as Minister for Finance, owe it to anybody with tax relationships and commitments here in Ireland to be able to have private exchanges of information with the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot comment on that.  It is a principle to which I must adhere but it must be fair and equal to all.  Deputy Burton mentioned our reputation as being among the worst culprits.  Again, however, the OECD representative acknowledged this morning that Ireland is playing and has played its part in already inserting OECD recommendations into our tax code.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, signed up to further elements of the BEPS process some time ago and I look forward to enacting these measures.  Further recommendations will come from the OECD across the first half of next year.  We will work with these constructively so as to see how a consensus can be generated on how to deal with other aspects now emerging as important:  digital taxation, for example.  This committee would of course also hold me accountable if I were to follow any course of action that then turned out to be responsible for the loss of Irish jobs and investment.  What I have described here is the pathway that I am following and what it is that I am seeking to manage.  </p> <p>  With regard to what Deputy Burton proposes in this amendment, a paper of this nature was, as the Deputy is aware, produced in 2014.   This paper acknowledged that there is no internationally agreed standard for calculating effective rates of tax.  It agreed on three different methodologies for doing so, laid out the different options for each, and analysed in greater detail eight different figures quoted in respect of Ireland.  The paper also concluded that the approach based on national aggregate statistics from the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office is the most suitable.  Based on data from the Central Statistics Office, using the net operating surplus, and from the Revenue Commissioners, using the taxable income, the report highlighted that since 2003 the effective corporate tax rate has averaged 10.9% and 10.7% respectively.  More recent analysis by the Revenue Commissioners noted that the effective tax rate of companies in 2015 was provisionally calculated as 9.8%, representing an only marginal increase on the 2014 rate of 9.7%.  In 2012 and 2013, the effective rate was 10.1%.  I would note that while these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of targeted measures, such as the research and development tax credit. </p> <p>   Given how recently this paper was produced, then, and given my commitment to the implementation of the OECD process to date, I do not accept Deputy Burton's amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#L00300"><p>I am sure that the Minister knows that the premise on which that particular 2014 report was produced is not appropriate to the dilemma now faced by this country on this matter.  We have already had a number of examples in this debate of  prominent companies and structures of one kind or another which have had the happy result for their owners of being able to avoid paying practically any corporation tax.</p><p>If the Minister tells me that the shops on the main street of a town or the SMEs or the like on industrial estates and in warehouses on the outskirts of towns are paying between 7% and 11%, I have no difficulty in accepting that.  They are not able to avail of the types of structure available to certain categories which we have already discussed during the debate on the Bill.</p><p> Second, I did not say Ireland was the worst.  That is not my view.  I said something different, that the country's reputation was being shredded at a time when we needed friends.  Yes, people might admire some of what is happening in Ireland, but the fact that we have some of the largest global companies and that we have a finance sector and a number of others that involve not SMEs but the very wealthy in very effective tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes ought to be of serious concern to the Minister.  It ought to be of particular concern because of what is coming down the road post-Brexit and may start within the transition period, as we do not know how long it will be.  It is also something that is gnawing at the foundations of democracy.  In the long run it is a short-sighted view to try to argue, as the Minister is doing, that we should continue in this way.  During the last Government it was part of the reason Ireland signed up to the OECD process, with which not everybody agreed.  The views of Fine Gael on this issue are very different from those of the Labour Party and it was a difficult debate in that Government.  However, it resulted in a process that improved Irish compliance with international tax norms while retaining Ireland's attraction as a foreign direct investment location.</p><p> The report to which the Minister referred is interesting, but I would not put too much faith in it addressing the types of issue I am addressing.  I am not addressing people and companies in Ireland who are tax compliant and pay their fair share.  Nobody has a problem with any of them as they are providing employment throughout the country.  However, I do have a problem with situations where zero or close to zero - we had an example this morning - ends up being the contribution they make to this society.  All I am suggesting is a simple mechanism.  It does not have to be at a high, punitive rate.  It also means that the Revenue Commissioners would be put in a stronger position to deal with those companies and get behind how such situations are facilitated.</p><p> On a wider basis, the country must respond to what is in contained the Paradise Papers and what was previously in the Panama Papers.  I had discussions on this issue with the Minister's predecessor and the then Taoiseach.  It is not avoidable in the long term.  This is a very simple mechanism.  The Minister can go to the OECD and the ECOFIN meetings and say we are looking at bringing it into effect.  Fine Gael is part of the European People's Party in the European Union.  It is a union of very conservative parties.  The Labour Party belongs to the group of socialist parties.  There are genuine differences that have to be resolved in the interests of the continuation and viability of the European Union.</p><p> I am very disappointed by the Minister's response.  He made a charge about me that I did not make.  I ask him to note this.  However, I did say our reputation was being shredded.  I am a strong supporter of Ireland in attracting international investment.  I have worked with multinational companies, both professionally and politically, in my career.  In the long run they cannot avoid what is happening to them in the exposure of their tax avoidance.  The country needs to address that issue and this is an element of doing it.  There were good examples in the debate earlier this morning of situations that were broadly unacceptable.  This is always a game of catch-up.  The Revenue Commissioners simply do not have enough resources to keep up with all of the loopholes as they inevitably develop.  Nobody is asking the Minister to be able to see the future, but we must deal with what we know and, whether he Minister likes it, we all know now about the Paradise Papers.  Some of it is what we suspected and some of it is material of which we had no knowledge.</p><p> This is a very modest proposal to address an important issue for the country.  If the Minister wishes to put it into another format, I will be happy to hear what suggestions he might have to make.  That has been done previously and it worked out to everybody's advantage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#M00200"><p>I support Deputy Joan Burton's amendment which is a sensible one.  It proposes that we examine the merits of having such an effective tax rate.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on and question the Minister's current position on a number of matters.  Listening to him one would think the Government was great in leading the charge on the issue of tax transparency in the global process and whatnot and that it should be patted on the back for all of the things it has done.  I have mentioned the OECD report on which the Government continues to rely, but only one country in the world, Trinidad and Tobago, is non-compliant.  All of the rest are either compliant or partially compliant.  In addition, it is only about the transfer of tax information.  It does not delve into the issue with which the Minister is dealing - State-sponsored tax evasion.  What he is doing, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, is engaging in State-sponsored tax evasion.  As I said about the previous amendment, it allows companies to pay &euro;250 in tax on profits of &euro;9 million.  It allows a company such as AIB in which we have large a shareholding to record profits of &euro;1.5 billion and pay no corporation tax.  If that is not State-sponsored tax evasion, I do not know what is.</p> <p>  The issue is that the Government has been dragged kicking and screaming on many of these matters.  Yes, it closed the double Irish, but did it really do so?  It will still be in place until 2020.  That should not be forgotten if we wish to be accurate about all of the information available.  Anybody who used the double Irish can continue to use it until 2020.  However, the Government did it under massive pressure from us in the Opposition - I will not rehash all of was said to the effect that nothing could be done - and international pressure.  With regard to the stateless companies which I wrote legislation to close, the Government denied time and again that it had the ability to close them.  Then it had to do it because the CEO of Apple gave sworn testimony before the US Senate that he had done a deal - I was going to say a dirty deal - with the Irish authorities to reduce its tax liability to single digits.  At the time he referred to a figure of 2%.  Both he and the head of tax, Mr. Bullock, gave that sworn testimony and there was an international outcry that Ireland was doing this.  What did we do?  We eventually closed the stateless companies.  It was known to the authorities here that they were operating in the State.</p> <p>  Regarding the black list the Minister mentioned, does he now support the Commission's view that there should be a black list?  Does he also now support public country by country reporting?  I remind him, if he needs to be reminded, that he and his colleagues in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted in the D&aacute;il last year to block an EU directive that would have required public country by country reporting, not privately or what takes place in the information being shared by revenue authorities.  It is the public part of that information which relates to companies with a turnover or profits of &euro;750 million.  The Minister, with his colleagues in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, voted against the European directive.</p><p>At the time the Government argued that the Commission should not have a role as regards black lists which was an issue which should only be determined by national parliaments.  Does the Minister support that view?  The Irish Parliament, against the wishes of Sinn F&eacute;in, Solidarity and a number of other smaller parties, voted to use the provisions of the Lisbon treaty to fly the flag of subsidiarity and argued that the European Commission did not have the right to introduce the directive which was related to tax transparency.  The Minister should not try to pretend that the Government is leading the charge in any of this.  It tried to block the European Commission directive on public transparency which sought to provide for country by country reporting.  Imagine if it had come in; we would have been able to see where the taxes of Apple or other larger multi-national companies were being paid.  This is State-sponsored tax evasion, but there is nothing illegal about it because the Government is in charge.  </p><p> Big companies can engage in tax evasion because of Governments such as the one of which the Minister is a member.  He can sit before this committee and justify the banks not having to pay tax for the next 20 years.  Companies which record profits running to millions of euro can use vehicles that allow them to reduce their tax liability to &euro;250.   Ireland has opened the door to intellectual property and intangible assets being placed onshore.  This allowed Apple to write-off billions of euro in tax.  This Finance Bill will ensure Apple will not pay any of these taxes because the Minister is ensuring any of the intellectual property placed onshore until the date of the budget may be used as a capital allowance against profits.  That is what he is doing.  We can talk about competitiveness and so on, but I have a responsibility to spell it out that this is State-sponsored tax evasion.  </p><p> I am sick of hearing politicians on "Morning Ireland" or other radio and television programmes tut-tutting about these companies getting away with blue murder when they sit on the finance committee and vote through legislation that enables them to do precisely that.  If it was illegal, those doing it would be behind bars, but it is perfectly legal because people like the Minister, with his friends in Fianna F&aacute;il, allow legislation to be drafted in a way which enables multinational corporations and the elites in society not to pay their fair share of taxes.  Does the Minister now support the European Commission in introducing a black list of tax havens?  Does he support the European Commission's directive on public country by country reporting?</p></speech>

We are using a great deal of diplomatic capital on Brexit.  Inevitably, during conversations with European colleagues the isse of Ireland's corporation tax rate is raised.  We will come under pressure over it.  Much has been done in recent years, including the placing onshore of intellectual property, the closing of the double Irish and much more.  New Commission data have been released which are independent and which show the effective corporate tax rates of all European countries.  Ireland's performance is fine.  The data strip away the headline rates of 35% or 40% for some of the bigger countries and look at what is being paid.  In that context, Ireland is fine.  It might be worth circulating the data. </p> <p>  The Government has an opportunity to communicate better in this area.  Recently I was discussing Brexit with a European politician, one of those leading the work on European tax rates, and he raised the issue of Ireland's corporation tax rate.  I outlined the various changes which had been made and noted that in 2015, as a result of some of these changes, our corporation tax take had increased by 50%, which was unheard of and cash proof that the loopholes had been closed.  He said that information was not well known in the Commission.  It is very powerful information which shows that corporation tax returns here have increased. </p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been sniping away bombastically for ten minutes about Fianna F&aacute;il and I want to respond.  The single greatest tax avoidance measure was section 110 used by vulture funds.  I worked on the matter last year and it was Deputy Michael McGrath who said Fianna F&aacute;il would not support the budget unless the changes were made.  That was Fianna F&aacute;il's contribution, rather than hiding behind the couch and telling others what they should do.  Fianna F&aacute;il stated it would not support the Finance Bill unless there were changes to section 110 and those changes were made.  When Sinn F&eacute;in was in charge in Northern Ireland - it no longer is because it is unwilling to form an executive - it was a Sinn F&eacute;in member of the finance committee who proudly announced that they were reducing the corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland to 12.5%.  In the one jurisdiction where it could do something it provided for a massive reduction in corporation tax rates.</p></speech>

That was one of the main points raised.  It is clear that there is no consensus on how minimum effective rates should be calculated.  The Coffey report of 2014 was a very good one.  Perhaps it should be updated, but it did not substantiate the frequently made claims that the effective rates were in the order of between 2% and 5%.  I am concerned about some of the long-established reliefs which were limited because we had a very broad tax base, notwithstanding our discussion on how losses affected the banks which was most exceptional, rather we should discuss the issue of losses generally, research and development tax credits and the treatment of capital allowances.  If after applying all of these, one was to arrive at a certain taxable profit and apply the 12.5% rate and it came into conflict with the minimum effective rate one might set in a hypothetical scenario, would the achievement of the minimum effective rate supersede retaining the key pillars of the corporation tax code for research and development, capital allowances and losses?  There is a potential conflict which must be acknowledged.  These are legitimate deductions which are part of the corporation tax code and which could potentially come into conflict with achieving a certain minimum effective rate, depending on how one would measure it.  Anyone who reads the report which runs to over 40 pages will see clearly that there is no consensus on how minimum effective rates could be achieved.  It is the case that Ireland does not have as many reliefs and allowable tax deductions as many other jurisdictions in Europe.  We have seen the analysis in which countries such as France which have higher headline rates end up with much lower effective corporation tax rates.  That should be acknowledged.</p></speech>

Deputy Pearse Doherty spoke about my responsibilities.  I have outlined the responsibilities I have and which Deputy Michael Noonan had before me.  I have to ensure we change the tax code in a way that is compliant and consistent with the evolving international consensus.  We have done so and will continue to do so.  Deputy Pearse Doherty can point to the role he played in that debate, but the then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, recognised the need in key areas and made the changes at a time when there was a risk that they could undermine Irish jobs and the contribution corporation tax receipts made in funding public services.</p><p>For the Deputy to come in here and suggest the previous Minister made those changes because of the role of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party in the debate that took place ill serves the contribution Deputy Noonan made to putting in place the foundations for the reforms that are needed in regard to corporation tax, changes that were acknowledged this morning by the OECD.  We are a small open economy and changes like these can, of course, have a significant effect on the economic fortunes of our country.  The then Minister, Deputy Noonan, through the changes he made in respect of stateless companies and the double Irish arrangement, which were touched on by other speakers, began the process of change that was needed and which he proceeded to implement in regard to corporation tax.  Nobody should be under any doubt that if I went ahead and did things which undermined the predictability and competitiveness of the Irish corporation tax model, which has played a valuable role in creating Irish jobs, one of the first parties to condemn me for doing so would be Sinn F&eacute;in, led by Deputy Doherty.  The agenda I need to deliver now and in the coming years requires implementing the changes that are needed to ensure our business and tax models meet the expectations and requirements that are there from an OECD perspective and elsewhere while at the same time ensuring the competitiveness of our country is not undermined in a changing Europe and a changing world.  That is the complexity I look forward to managing in the time ahead.</p><p> Deputy Burton used the phrase "among the worst".</p></speech>

She made the allegation that I am looking to preserve things as they are without being mindful of the accelerated debate that is under way in regard to corporation tax across the world.  At the same time, however, she acknowledged that I wish to implement the OECD view and template on matters like corporation tax.  Those two statements are incompatible and inconsistent.  I am aware of the changes we have signed up to and of the new environment in which our corporate tax model is operating.  I am seeking a pathway that will enable us to maintain Irish employment and Irish investment while also creating a sustainable route to addressing the issues and needs that are there.  We have a pathway to how we will do some of that and I expect we will get further ideas and contributions from the consultation that is under way on the Coffey report on corporation tax, all of which I will respond to in the new year.  I am aware of the debate that is ongoing on changing taxation models and the evolving views on how larger companies operate.  As I said earlier, it continues to be my view that companies should pay a fair share of tax and should make their contribution to the societies upon which they depend.</p> <p> Deputy Doherty asked about the European Council's EU tax blacklist.  I look forward to seeing that report, which we expect will be presented at the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, meeting on 5 December.  I will have to see what the final report looks like but I expect to be in a position to support it.  I look forward to Commissioner Moscovici and the other members of the Council getting back to me with the work in that area throughout November.</p> <p>  I do not support public country-by-country reporting for the very good reason that we have a long-standing principle in this country that the exchange of information between companies or individuals and the tax authority is confidential.  That confidentiality in managing information will allow us to continue to make progress on the different issues we need to address.  To reiterate, here in Ireland, exchange of information between the Revenue Commissioners and a company or individual is private.  That is not the same as saying I support tax evasion.  In recent years, the Revenue Commissioners have collected an extra &euro;1 billion by dealing with activity that is illegal in regard to tax avoidance, including offshore tax avoidance.  They will continue to do that work and I will provide any resources or further powers needed to allow them to do it.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly spoke about the need to tell our story when it comes to the discussion around corporation tax.  I have been telling that story in this committee in recent days and it is a story I tell on almost a monthly basis in our Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings.  Together with the Finance Ministers of Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, I went before the PANA Committee of the European Parliament some weeks ago and outlined what Ireland has done in respect of corporate tax.  It is a story we need to keep telling.  I have met Commissioner Moscovici and Commissioner Dombrovskis on several occasions, both of whom are involved in this area, and outlined what Ireland has done and our commitment to playing a constructive role in this debate in the future.  We must continue to point to what we have achieved, including the growth in Irish corporation tax receipts and the progress we have made in eliminating issues which we acknowledged needed to be addressed.</p> <p>  Deputy McGrath cuts to the heart of all this when he asks what the trade off would be between a minimum effective tax rate, on the one hand and, on the other, the fact we have a broad corporation tax base with a limited number of credits against which companies can reduce their liability and where the difference between our headline tax rate and the effective rate is far narrower than is the case for other interests who make charges against our country in this area.  The journey between Ireland's effective tax rate and nominal tax rate is far smaller than it is in other European Union jurisdictions.  The desire to be predictable, competitive and legitimate is at the heart of our tax model.  Deputy Burton understands these issues well because she has participated, as she acknowledged, in the types of missions in which we seek to work with international companies to retain the jobs they have created in Ireland and encourage them to create even more employment here.  The Deputy knows that the value of predictability and certainty in our tax code is really important.  It is for this reason that I am not in a position to support a minimum tax rate.  For me to signal in this committee that I will support a proposal for the bringing forward of a report outlining the merits of that approach would undermine our efforts to tell the strong story we have to tell in regard to our efforts at implementing corporate tax reform while also retaining the jobs we have and attracting more jobs into our country.</p></speech>

Progress is very slow.  I know the issues are very important but relevance is a key principle.  In some cases we are going back to discuss the Finance Bill 2016.  We must be careful in order that we can make progress.  I want to be as fair as I can to give everyone a chance to contribute.  I think I have done that.  It is Deputy Burton's amendment.  I ask her to conclude her contribution.</p></speech>

That is the stand-out fact in relation to the story of Irish corporation tax in recent years.  The country has taken a very heavy reputational hit.  It is identified, in some cases completely wrongly but in other cases correctly, as being a country in which there is not proper oversight and jurisdiction in relation to certain companies that have taken advantage of particular structures in the Irish tax system.</p></speech>

The discussion earlier was in relation to the banks and their very significant profits running into the hundreds of millions, and probably into billions in the next year or two.  It does not matter what the tax rules are.  There is something absurd in a country where there is a desperate need to fund both investment and services to have extraordinarily profitable institutions bailed out by the taxpayer who are not making any current contribution.  The remedy on that is very simple.  It is brought in at a certain level of profit so that there is no problem for a company in a run-of-the mill situation where it has had a lot of capital investment and it may have had losses in the context of building a start-up.  It is set at a certain level and once a company has attained a certain level of profitability it must contribute.  That is what we have done in regard to high net worth individuals and therefore it just affects that category of people.  It is a targeted approach.  SMEs are highly unlikely ever to be affected by this.</p> <p>  In terms of the contacts with other European countries, I think the baseline studies that have been done to establish what real effective tax levels exist in different countries are very important because every country has different rules and there is no compatibility in those rules.  However, in terms of the BEPS process, it is a long-range one, which I support.  I have publicly and privately supported it.  I am happy to say the Government of which I was a member eventually supported it.  That made a lot of sense for Ireland.  I am basically challenging the Minister to continue that work in a way that will develop and protect Ireland's reputation rather than make us the target for future punitive action.</p> <p>  From what the Minister said in terms of ECOFIN, it may well be that most European countries have now decided to take a bit of a step back from all of this and to talk the talk but not particularly to take action.  In terms of the European Union itself, unless there is a way in which the fairness and equity of taxation is visible to citizens in terms of how they are treated for taxation purposes by government in all sorts of different ways and compare that with companies, in particular a clutch of key, globalised companies who effectively are outside the jurisdiction of most countries.  What has been shown in the Paradise and Panama papers is the use of globalised mechanisms.  All we can do is to address those mechanisms as they arise.  We had some debates on the issue here.  There was an example of a company with significant profits paying &euro;250 in tax.  It is very reasonable to ask how that happens.  If somebody earns &euro;30,000 a year he or she will still make some contribution even though in the scheme of things it is not a lot of money.</p> <p>  The Minister and his fellow ECOFIN Ministers must consider the principles of equity and what in the long run is the best for sustaining countries.  I am interested in the long run in Ireland being attractive to foreign direct investment.  I am interested in Ireland being attractive for Irish SMEs and in Ireland creating employment.  I have always stood by that and the Labour Party has always stood by that.  The Minister is running away from the issue and seeking to wrap it up in a message that all is now fine; there is nothing to see here, move on.  That is not true.  We know, for instance, from the report of the Revenue Commissioners themselves on the black box and the R&amp;D tax credit that we are now paying refunds to companies that are paying no corporation tax.  On the scale of things that is a small problem but it is a problem that requires to be addressed.  I put it to the Minister that the essence of taxation is that it is something that is in a constant state of flux and development and I am seeking that Ireland protects the integrity of its tax system as regards companies and corporations by having a structure on minimum effective tax rates.  That is all.  It is going to protect Ireland not cause any damage and it is going to improve fairness relative to ordinary taxpayers.</p></speech>

While the Chairman signs the ruling, he gets a direction to do so.  I raise this issue in the debate on every Finance Bill and I have dealt with seven.  It is not clear how the rules are applied.  I hope the Chairman will take up this issue at a later stage.  My amendment on intangible assets to change the date to an earlier one has been ruled out of order because it involves a potential cost on the people.  A different amendment which would have resulted in a cost of &euro;20 million was allowed for debate.  It is pot luck whether amendments will be allowed.  There is a need for a report on that issue.</p><p>In section 28 I wanted to delete lines 10 to 13 and substitute the following:</p><blockquote>Where a person disposes of land with residential development potential to which this section applies during the period beginning 4 years after the date they were acquired and ending 7 years after that date, any gain on the disposal of such land shall not be a chargeable gain.</blockquote> <p>The concern about the section is that it deals with the seven-year capital gains tax exemption.  It is not just for development land but all types of land and commercial assets bought during the period.  I have made the point, for example, that somebody who purchased a hotel some years ago, for whom the seven-year timeframe has not elapsed and who plans to sell it next year, will not pay capital gains tax at the rate of 33% on the gains made.  That is wrong.  I support the principle behind the amendment and the rationale for it that has been played out publicly.  It also fits in with what I said about the five-year dividend withholding tax exemption.  We need to focus on freeing up land for development, but the amendment to section 28 would not capture development land only.</p></speech>

I welcome the section.  Do we have a profile of the assets that have been purchased?  I can see the Minister's official shaking his head.  We do not have a breakdown of what was purchased during the window.  The period of seven years is being reduced to four to make land available and remove any incentive to hoard it.  Do we have any measure for what has been purchased?</p></speech>

As regards land, the relief makes no distinction as to how the land is being utilised or whether it has development potential.  This is in line with the original relief introduced in the Finance Act 2012, which is now section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The legislation was framed in this way because it is not possible to treat one type of land more favourably than another.  That is the rationale for my not accepting the Deputy's amendment.  I believe this change is justified given the current status of the property market and the need for land to be released for development use.  I anticipate that some of this land will be used for residential development.  This is a policy change that should be seen in the light of the decision I have made in regard to stamp duty on commercial property.  These two measures should be viewed together.</p><p> In regard to Deputy McGrath's point, we do not have a register of property to which this might apply but I do have ample indications to show that this does have the potential to stimulate the release of property throughout the course of next year.</p></speech>

The capital gains tax, CGT, exemption would apply if an owner held on to the land for seven years, but under this Bill he or she will be able to dispose of it after four years and still avail of the exemption.  I think that reduction in timeframe should only be available in respect of disposals which we know will result in development.  However, the Minister has responded that no such differentiation can be made, which is fair enough.  It being the case that this measure will apply to all land whether it has development potential or not, why are buildings included?  I refer members to the case of the hotel purchased in 2003.  As things stand, if the owners of properties purchased between the 2011 and 2014 window, be that an office block, a shopping centre and so on, propose to sell next year because they need to raise capital for other business ventures etc., and the uplift on their properties is &euro;500 million, they would have to pay approximately &euro;165 million in taxes, but following the implementation of this measure they will pay nothing in terms of capital gains tax.</p></speech>

There will be transactions occurring next year that I believe would not have happened but for this change being made.  I am trying to get to a point next year where we will have more land being released for development.   My objective is to try to maximise residential development.  The Deputy is correct that there are people who may have been planning to make a transaction next year anyway who will now do so in a tax environment that will be more favourable to them.  Against that, there will be transactions that will occur next year that otherwise might not have occurred.</p></speech>

I would like it to have applied to development land only but I understand that is not possible.  I have no problem with the reduction in the timeframe from seven years to four years in respect of the disposal of land.  However, I do have a problem with this being applicable to buildings also.  A case in point is the hotel which had an uplift of &euro;500 million during the time between its purchase in 2014 and now, which the owners plan to sell next year to raise additional capital for other investment and in respect of which they will have to pay approximately &euro;160 million in taxes as a result of CGT at 33%.  As a result of this ruling, when this hotel is sold next year there will be no tax due on the capital gains tax.  That does not benefit the housing market.</p></speech>

I am not in a position to share that information.</p></speech>

I am not saying that I do not believe the Minister has received that advice.  The tax code provides for taxation measures specifically to deal with land as opposed to buildings, for example, the vacant site levy.  I cannot understand, therefore, why the Minister cannot introduce an exemption from CGT for certain properties, for example, land as opposed to buildings.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that it is not legally permissible to narrow the focus and single out a category of land in relation to this relief.  Section 604A applies to all property purchase within the European Economic Area, EEA.  This provision was included in the legislation so as not to conflict with EU freedom of establishment rules.  The freedom of establishment is considered to be one of the essential freedoms in establishing the European Internal Market.  Articles 49 and 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union grants persons and companies the right to set up establishment and pursue economic activity within the member states of the European Union.  As the Deputy knows, I cannot share with him advice I have received from the Attorney General.  The advice I have just read into the record is advice I have received from the Revenue Commissioners, which indicates to me that I cannot make the change the Deputy requests.</p></speech>

My amendment originally sought the exemption in respect of development land only.  I accept the advice that it is not possible to differentiate between different types of land, but I did not hear in that advice any reference to it not being possible to differentiate between land and buildings.  That is the issue.  The change being made will result in huge windfalls for persons who were going to sell commercial buildings next year anyway.  They would have had to pay 33% tax on the gains accruing to those properties over the four or five years they owned them, but as a result of this change they will be able to sell and pay no tax. I understood that the intention behind this change is to try to release land for housing development.  Is there any way we can strip out buildings from land?  As I said, there was no mention of that in the advice the Minister read out.  Perhaps between now and Report Stage the Minister will examine whether there is any potential to have buildings stripped out of this, leaving only land?</p></speech>

I referred earlier to Section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This applies to all property purchased within the EEA.  In terms of interpretation of that provision, property includes buildings.  In regard to the Deputy's second point regarding the tax effect of this measure, following the coming into effect of this measure next year, in conjunction with the measure I have introduced in respect of stamp duty on commercial property, commercial transactions which occur next year will be subject to the higher stamp duty rate of 6%, as opposed to 2%.

The stamp duty rate has been tripled.</p><p>While I accept the point that it is possible that transactions that were due to go ahead next year anyway will now go ahead in a more favourable environment, that will be offset, I believe, by the additional land and property that should be released next year as a result of this move.  I am aware of specific cases where owners of property have made decisions not to go ahead with development, both commercial and residential, because of the way this policy was in the past, and I am looking to change that.</p></speech>

I reiterate the point that stamp duty is paid by the purchaser and capital gains tax is paid by the seller.  Two different parties will pay the taxes.  Even if they were the same, 4% compared with 33% is a big difference.  Between now and Report Stage, would the Minister be willing to examine whether there is any possibility that buildings would not be part of this change from seven years to four years and merely to isolate it to land?</p></speech>

Is it because section 28 amends the parent provision, which is a composite one on land and buildings, not only in Ireland but within the EU, that the Minister cannot divide them up?  Is that the issue?</p></speech>

Maybe we should not amend the seven year element at all.  Maybe we should introduce a separate section which allows for a redefinition of land specifically, the same way we did with Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  We should define land in terms of development land and allow them to pay no CGT.  There must be a way because there are massive windfalls coming down here for those will sell commercial buildings next year.  A huge number of commercial buildings are being sold every year.  We can see that in the expectation of the stamp duty revenues coming in next year.  This is quite a sizeable windfall for certain individuals without the benefit that we are looking for, which is the release of land on which to develop housing.</p></speech>

This is a very significant move in how I am looking to change the taxation regime in relation to property with the objective of trying to increase the supply of land in 2018.  As I said, I will provide a technical note to the Deputy and the committee outlining why I am not able to take the course of action that the Deputy is asking for.</p></speech>

Is it the case, therefore, that for 2018, if a person bought land or buildings between 2011 and 2014 and were to dispose of them in 2018, he or she would be CGT free?

Ireland has the 15th largest international financial sector in the world and the fourth largest shadow banking system.  The Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, currently manages &euro;1.9 trillion in assets without providing much in the way of jobs or taxes.  The logic for a financial transaction tax is twofold: first, to cure volatility and speculation in financial markets, which would mean more of a focus on productive investment as opposed to short-term speculation, and second, potentially to raise revenue that can be used for any number of matters.</p><p>Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins of the Nevin institute produced a report a couple of years ago which found that the net yield would be between &euro;320 million and &euro;350 million when one takes into account the loss of revenue in terms of stamp duty.  At a later stage, the Department of Finance estimated potential revenue of &euro;500 million.  That was the average estimate at that stage.  As far as I remember, in the run-up to this budget we did not get any estimates but our figures suggested that the net sum raised by the 0.1% and 0.01% would now be up to &euro;610 million given the growth of the financial sector.</p><p>The previous Minister for Finance always rejected this.  He always said, in terms of the European Union discussions, that the Government wanted an international solution and therefore did not want a European solution, which was effectively a recipe for doing nothing and certainly not taking any initiative from the point of view of Ireland.  Does the attitude of the current Minister differ in any respect?</p></speech>

The point is that the IFSC, like the City of London, functions as a tax haven for international finance.  If one looks at the almost &euro;2 trillion in assets that exist there compared with the number of jobs, the gap is enormous.  The average productivity of those working in the IFSC is some incredible figure that is wildly out of whack with productivity in other European Union countries because Ireland functions as part of a global network of tax havens.  One side of those tax havens is the Paradise Papers.  It is Panama, Bermuda, etc.  Another side is the functioning of the City of London but also the functioning of the IFSC in Ireland.  Let us debate that.</p> <p>  Then let us also acknowledge that a huge number of financial assets are located, certainly, nominally speaking, in Ireland.  A huge number of financial transactions take place through Ireland and there is a significant potential revenue source that the Government refuses to look at because it is part of defending the model of Ireland being a tax haven.  We dealt with this previously in terms of the amendment on a minimum effective rate of corporation tax, but the Government has the same approach to the financial sector which is at the cutting edge of tax avoidance.</p></speech>

I appreciate the study may be somewhat dated at this point but the report's conclusions are a useful indicator of the possible impact of introducing a financial transaction tax, FTT, in Ireland.  Given that it is Government policy not to introduce an FTT, I do not consider it prudent to allocate resources to further studies or exercises in this regard at this time.</p><p> The joint Central Bank and Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report recognises that assessing the likely impact on employment and tax yields due to migration of activity is difficult.  This continues to be the case as it is difficult to assess behaviour arising from the introduction of such a tax and second round impacts on investment and employment.  In 2012, the financial sector's share of overall economic output in Ireland was around twice as large as that of many other European countries and in 2016 it remained a significant element within the economy in terms of employment and gross value added.  There is significant employment in the sector with around 40,000 individuals employed in international financial services and 90,000 employed in general financial services.  The Central Bank and ESRI report sought to identify financial services sectors that could be impacted by an FTT.  It suggested that insurance, banking and financial intermediation, and fund management and security brokering were potentially vulnerable to an FTT.  Fund management in particular has been one of the growth areas of the financial services sector in Ireland, with some large employers and with a total estimated 14,500 employed in the sector.</p><p> The UK intention to commence the process of leaving the European Union increases the difficulties of introducing such a tax given the potential for the UK to compete more strongly using different domestic measures for such financial services activities outside the EU.  The international financial services sector in Ireland is now a truly national industry, extending far-beyond the original Irish Financial Services Centre in Dublin&rsquo;s docklands.  The sector generates direct employment for approximately 40,000 people across over 400 companies, with an estimated one third of those jobs located outside the greater Dublin area.  It is a thriving and vibrant sector, which makes an important economic contribution to this country.  Indeed, the Government&rsquo;s 2015 strategy for the international financial services sector, IFS 2020, is to grow jobs to 45,000 by 2020.</p><p> The firms with the highest propensity to migrate following the introduction of an FTT are likely to be in the non-banking sectors, which account for the smallest share of gross value added.  Nevertheless, it indicates that the relocation of even a small number of large international banks or fund administration firms would result in a loss of income tax revenue, corporation tax revenue and an increase in unemployment.  This would likely still be the impact now of introducing an FTT.  Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a stamp duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.  The yield from this charge in 2016 was &euro;391.94 million and I understand receipts to the end of October 2017 were over &euro;361.41 million.  If Ireland was to participate in the FTT it would require us to abolish this stamp duty.</p><p> With regard to discussions at EU level, the position taken by this Government and the previous Government&rsquo;s consistent position is that a financial transactions tax would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  This would prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions with a likely loss of employment and tax revenue.  Notwithstanding this, the previous Government was not prepared to stand in the way of EU member states that wished to work together to implement a financial transactions tax; in this regard, adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced co-operation took place during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January 2013.</p><p> In any event, despite significant engagement by the relevant Member States there has been no agreement on the introduction of an FTT and it is not clear whether agreement will be achieved in the near future.  I am of the view there are potentially significant negative employment, economic, and tax yield impacts from introducing an FTT in Ireland and I have no plans to introduce such a tax.  Consequently, I oppose the Deputies' amendment.</p></speech>

There is the possibility that the Brexit we see will be, as Mr. Jeremy Corbyn deemed it, a bargain basement Brexit, with Britain attempting a further race to the bottom in terms of tax of corporations and financial transactions etc. in the City of London.  The idea is that this is a particularly bad time for Ireland to consider a financial transaction tax because Britain may be going in that direction.  It is completely in thrall to the idea of a race to the bottom and the consequent logic.  From that, the only people who win will be the corporations and the people who lose will be those who depend on public services around the world.  That is the Government's logic.</p> <p>  With regard to Ireland being a tax haven, one can say something so many times one might even begin to believe it.  The idea that Ireland is not a tax haven but at the forefront of the fight against tax avoidance and tax evasion does not wash.  Oxfam did a report last year and found Ireland was the sixth worst country in the world in terms of being a corporate tax haven.  Mr. Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on poverty, said that nobody believes Ireland is not a tax haven.  It stands in reality and a big part of that is the IFSC.  The Minister previously mentioned that 40,000 people are employed in the industry but this can be contrasted with the level of assets controlled in the IFSC or supposedly located there.  There is the classic example of 5 Harbourmaster Place.  I am not sure what the current position is but there were &euro;2 billion in assets and 250 companies located there but not a single employee.  There is very little social benefit as a result of these activities but a way of getting a social benefit would be to have a study for and ultimately to introduce a financial transactions tax.  The Government will not even consider it or having a study for that purpose, which is very revealing.</p></speech>

We have called for the abolition of what we call the &quot;home tax&quot; as that is what the so-called property tax is where people live in their home.  It is not an asset as wealth but it is something they need to survive.  It is their shelter.  That home tax should be abolished and replaced with our idea, which would raise a similar if not the same amount as the property tax.  This would be a landlords' tax.  It would raise revenue and disincentivise landlordism.  Tax policy should be designed to do that.  We should not have this huge transfer of wealth from the public in its various guises, directly from the State and privately in the form of rent, to a landlord class that is massively overly represented in these Houses and the established political parties.</p></speech>

The local property tax is also a significant base-broadening measure.  The level of income expected to be generated by the local property tax in 2018 is in the region of &euro;470 million.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that, under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland may not introduce discretional revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.  This means that the Government must consider carefully any tax changes as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.</p><p> As regards abolition of the local property tax, LPT, it is now well established that the taxation of property through an annual recurring tax is less economically distortionary than the imposition of tax on either income or capital.  This is supported by economic literature and OECD analysis which underscores how an annual tax on land and buildings has a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.  Both international and domestic research indicate that property taxes are more growth friendly than taxes on labour.</p><p> The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property.  The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.</p><p> In the local property tax we have a stable source of funding which is fair and progressive with the owners of the most valuable properties paying most.  The tax is equitable, has reference to ability to pay, conforms to international norms and significantly broadens the domestic tax base.</p><p> We have seen in the past how over-reliance on revenue from transaction-based taxes, such as stamp duty, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, led to a significant fall in tax revenue when the number and value of transactions decreased sharply from 2007 onwards as a result of the economic and banking crisis thus creating enormous problems for Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal position.  I understand that a tax on second and subsequent non-family homes levied at &euro;600 for the second homes and &euro;1,000 on all subsequent properties would have an annual yield in the region of &euro;229 million.  This is based on those properties indicated to be non-principal private residencies by their owners in their LPT returns.  I am also informed that the estimated cost of abolishing the LPT in 2018 would be in the order of &euro;470 million, based on my Department&rsquo;s latest official forecast of LPT receipts for next year.</p><p> The difference between these figures is over &euro;240 million.  As I have outlined earlier, that amount would need to be made up for in other taxation measures, and as such I oppose the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</p></speech>

I appreciate it is tangential to the amendment, but deals with the taxation of landlords.</p> <p>  For several years I have tabled amendments to try to create an exemption for accidental landlords to stop them from being double taxed.  This year I want to raise it and have a short conversation on it on Committee Stage in the hope that the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Minister will introduce a Government amendment on Report Stage.  I am meeting the Minister, Deputy Donohoe on this matter later on this week.</p> <p>  Let me take a brief moment to explain what is involved here.  Some people bought very small houses or apartments prior to 2008, when they did not have any children or perhaps one child.  They are in negative equity and now, ten or 11 years on from that, they have growing families.  They are in a trap.  The apartment which they own is too small.  I spoke to a family with young children living in an apartment not to long ago and they were wondering if their children would climb up and jump over the balcony.  They were not at all comfortable with raising their children in the apartment in which they lived.  People in this situation cannot sell the property because they are in negative equity.  They have one of the following options.  First, they can remain in the property and try to raise their children in a property that arguably was not designed for raising children and in which they are not comfortable for their children to be raised.  Second, they can move out and rent out their apartment and try to find a two or three bed semidetached house somewhere further out.  While their household finances have not changed at all, they are earning the same amount of money, and are paying out in rent the same as they receive for the rent of their apartment.</p> <p>  The problem with this scenario is that their rental income is taxed at the marginal rate.  I have provided analysis to the previous Minister for Finance that showed that many people under very modest assumptions end up with tax bills of &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000.  They are trapped.  They can do one of two things if they want to move, they can move and hope that the taxman never finds them because they do not have the money pay or they can move and pay the tax bill.  I have dealt with a number of cases where the couple's ability to save and dig their way out of negative equity is wiped out because all their saving goes in paying the huge tax bill that materialises.  They are trapped.  I know people who have left the country and moved abroad in order to be non-domiciled in the hope that it will all work out.  It is that serious.</p> <p>  People's lives have been destroyed by this trap that has continued for ten years.  The tax system was never meant to do this.  The notion of negative equity creating accidental landlords was not considered when the taxation of rental income of landlords was considered.  I put it to the Minister of State that it is an unintended consequence of the tax system.</p> <p>  When I previously tabled amendments to address this issue before, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, came back and consistently refused to accept them on the basis that it could be a loophole for other people to avoid paying taxes.  He said it was too easy to game the system.  Last year when I had this conversation with him, he laid out specific issues he had in terms of people being able to abuse it.  These people were not in fact accidental landlords at all.  I have met nobody in Government or anywhere in the House who believes that in the specific kind of case to which I have referred, the genuine accidental landlords should be taxed an extra &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  Nobody thinks that is just or right, or good for the children and their parents.</p> <p>  We need to construct an amendment that stops people gaming the system.  Last year I did that and I got expert input as to how we could deal with the issue of gaming the system for the Report Stage amendment I tabled.  The conditions were as follows.  First, the property had to have been bought between 2002 and 2008 and no more than 113 sq. m in size, which is the average size of a three bed semi detached house.  Second, the property that the family were moving to had to have more bedrooms than the property from which they were moving, the logic being that they were moving to a larger premises to raise their children.  The people in question could only own one property.  Third, the property they were moving from had to have been purchased as their principal private residence, so it could not be an investment purchase and they had to have lived in the property for at least two years, they had to have been first time buyers when they bought the property and they had to be moving full-time into the new rented property and they could only deduct as much from the rental income as they were paying out in rent.  This all amounted to a very restrictive provision, which basically said that if one was a first time buyer who bought a very modest apartment in 2005, lived in for several years and did not own anything else and were in good faith moving to a larger property in order to raise a family, then one will not be penalised for doing so.  There is no way in which one can benefit and one could reduce one's tax liability from what one was paying when living in the apartment.  I will provide this amendment to the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  </p> <p>  People in this situation have been through hell for ten years.  Their lives have been destroyed and they have been caught by something that was never intended to catch people.  It is particularly galling when we look at the scale of the tax breaks that property developers, investors and land got, yet these people have been destroyed.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to raise it.  My hope is that between the Minister of State and the Minister, a Government amendment will be tabled on Report Stage so that finally this cohort of people can get some relief ten years on from the trap that they are in.</p></speech>

(1) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on additional revenue that would be raised by introducing a Millionaires&rsquo; Tax of 2 per cent on net wealth exceeding &euro;1 million.<br /><br />(2) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this bill, compile a national database on the distribution of wealth and assets.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 53 seeks to have a report carried out on what we call a &quot;millionaires' tax&quot;, which is a tax on net assets exceeding &euro;1 million.  Linked to that, the amendment provides for the compiling of a national database on the distribution of wealth and assets to allow accurate information be compiled on what a wealth tax would raise and, ultimately, to allow such a tax to be implemented.  This is linked to global crisis of rising inequality.  I am sure the Minister of State has seen the Oxfam figures which indicate that, two years ago, approximately 160 people controlled the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% of the world's population.  That dropped to 8 people last January and had decreased to 6 people in February.  Inequality is rising at an extremely quick pace and wealth is being concentrated in very few hands.  </p><p>The same is reflected in Ireland.  There are different studies here, including the CSO's household finance and consumption survey of 2013.  The Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, analysed this survey in its report The Distribution of Wealth in Ireland.  There was also an ESRI working paper in 2016.  From that information it can be concluded that the top 1% of the population in Ireland holds 14.8% of the total wealth, the top 5% controls 37.7%, the top 10% controls 53.8% and the bottom 50% controls less than 5% - only 4.9%.  Separately, the Central Bank currently estimates household net wealth at &euro;654 billion.  That figure has increased dramatically over the course of the last year.  According to the <i>Sunday Independent </i>rich list, the 300 richest people have effectively doubled their personal wealth from &euro;50 billion five years ago to &euro;100 billion at the moment.  </p><p>Ireland is an enormously wealthy country.  The issue is that wealth is owned and controlled by a very small number of people at the top, hence the proposal for a millionaires' tax.  We did the maths and, taking the Central Bank's figures for overall household net wealth and breaking them down according to the figures we have on the distribution of wealth, we determined that a 2% tax on net wealth exceeding &euro;1 million would raise &euro;3.238 billion.  That would affect only the top 5% of wealth holders in the economy - fewer than 85,000 households.</p></speech>

Wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which are already in place in Ireland.  Capital gains tax, CGT, and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, are, in effect, taxes on wealth, as they are levied on an individual or company, on the disposal of an asset in the case of CGT or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance, in the case of CAT.</p> <p>  The local property tax, LPT, which was introduced in 2013, is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  The domicile levy introduced in budget 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.  It is aimed at high wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, whether they are tax resident or not, to ensure they make a tax contribution to this country in a year of at least &euro;200,000.  The rate of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, on deposit accounts is now 39%, having been 41% from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016.  It was reduced by 2% in budget 2017, which also provided for further 2% cuts from 1 January in each of the next three years, so that the rate of DIRT will be 33% from 1 January 2020.  There is a stamp duty levy on the transfer of shares which yielded &euro;391.94 million in 2016. </p> <p>  As part of the joint research programme agreed between the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, covering macroeconomic and taxation issues, a research project involving detailed analysis of household wealth distribution in Ireland and taxation was recently undertaken.  The research was based on data collected by the CSO in 2013 as part of the household finance and consumption survey and involved analysing a wide variety of wealth tax scenarios, including scenarios based on wealth taxes currently in operation in a number of European countries that could hypothetically be applied to households in Ireland.  The research aimed to provide as comprehensive an analysis as possible of the wealth holdings of Irish households as of 2013 and the potential implications that a wealth tax could have if applied on the prevailing structure of assets and household composition. </p> <p>  To provide a broad range of estimates and to illustrate the different effects of adjusting threshold levels and including or exempting specific assets, wealth tax revenues and households liable were calculated using two different approaches.  The first took the existing wealth tax structures of a number of European countries and applied them to the Irish household structure.  The second used a range of hypothetical combinations of threshold level and asset exemptions to go more deeply into their respective impacts on the revenues and numbers of households that would be liable under different tax designs.  The aim was not to make recommendations on any particular system but rather to provide a broad range of estimates to demonstrate the factors that would need to be considered in formulating a wealth tax and how they would impact the overall tax returns and the numbers and types of households that would be affected. </p> <p>  The results gave a wide range of possible scenarios.  Applying other countries' models showed how variations in the exemptions and thresholds could result in less than 1% up to almost 50% of households being liable to a wealth tax.  The alternative scenarios investigated show that varying the level of the threshold was the key determinant of the number of households which would be affected, which is in keeping with the concentration of wealth at the upper end of the wealth distribution.  Given the numbers of households affected, the treatment of the household&rsquo;s main residence, which is the largest asset for almost all households apart from the very wealthiest, is an important factor in the level of average tax payment and hence total revenues raised.  Looking at the composition of households under the different tax scenarios, it was found that even with a narrow base and high threshold, some households in low income deciles were affected.  This is because of the imperfect correlation between income and wealth.  Applying an income restriction would remove many of the lower decile households from the tax net in most cases but would also reduce the numbers liable in the higher income deciles as well.</p> <p>  Wealth taxes form part of a broader taxation system and may operate as both complements and substitutes to other forms of taxation.  The potential implications of wealth taxes would need to be considered in conjunction with the burden of these other taxes.  From the wide variety of scenario outcomes, in terms of the tax base, revenue raised and the number and characteristics of households that can be affected, it is evident that the impacts of a wealth tax in Ireland would depend crucially on the detail of its design.  The extent to which a value can be assigned to an asset varies substantially.  For instance, it may not be possible for an individual to value or sell his or her human capital or pension funds, which can comprise a significant proportion of wealth.  Additionally, accurately valuing assets which are not regularly bought and sold can be administratively burdensome.</p> <p>  The Department of Finance will continue to monitor and consider any additional information and data that comes to light and will continue to examine potential taxation sources on an ongoing basis.  Having regard to the foregoing I do not intend to support this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#DD00500"><p>Obviously the Government's response does not surprise me.  To pick up on a couple of points, the idea that being unable to value assets is a major obstacle to a wealth tax does not seem to be credible because there are wealth taxes in other countries, for example France.  They are not at the level we are proposing but they exist, they operate and people pay them.  Any difficulties in the valuation of assets and so on are overcome in these cases.  The Minister of State is correct when he says that there is an imperfect correlation between income and wealth.</p><p>Five minutes ago he argued that the property tax was progressive because people with more expensive homes pay more.  I agree there is an imperfect correlation but that is precisely why the idea of having a ceiling or a net level of &euro;1 million under which one pays no wealth tax deals with that problem.  I do not believe there is any one in this country in a low decile in terms of income who has more than &euro;1 million in net assets.  The net aspect is important.  People can have big homes and so forth but they also have debts that go with them, generally.  The &euro;1 million in net assets is quite generous in terms of an allowance.  The tax would not be applied until people go above that point. </p><p> Ireland is a very unequal society.  Indications are that the distribution of wealth is more unequal than the average across the EU.  This is one of the measures which would address that inequality but the Government has repeatedly ridiculed it and suggested that it is in no way feasible.  I just do not accept that.</p></speech>

I drafted legislation to provide for same but I do not support the proposal that is here.  I believe the rate is too high and the tax is too broad.  That being said, the principle is still there and I support that principle.  The Minister of State's response was not surprising because it is very clear that this Government is not willing to look that any tax measure that applies to the elites, whether it is a wealth tax, closing down section 110 entities or making the banks, which are hugely profitable again, pay taxes.  The latter two proposals were blocked by the Government with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.  As the news was filtering through to the boardrooms of the banks that Fine Gael had blocked Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment aimed at ensuring that the banks paid an appropriate level of tax this year, next year and every year thereafter, Bank of Ireland was putting the finishing touches to a statement that it has just released acknowledging that it had screwed over another 6,000 Irish tracker mortgage customers.  This is in addition to the 4,300 customers who were denied a return to their tracker mortgages.  We understand, as does the Minister of State, the hardship those customers went through and we have just learned that another 6,000 customers were similarly affected.  This is the type of institution or company that the Government has decided, in the context of votes cast in the last few minutes, should not be paying any tax.  However, having read the CEO's statement, we still have no certainty as to when those individuals will be compensated and when the compensation process will be completed.  The CEO refers to a "pathway", but there is no end date in sight for those 6,000 additional customers on top of the original 4,300.  This is the kind of individual thinking with which we are dealing, but the Government has decided not to tax the bankers and other elites in society.  I would welcome the Minister of State's views on the fact that Bank of Ireland has not set out clear timeframes for the compensation of the additional 6,000 tracker victims that it has acknowledged today.</p></speech>

Quite a lot of work has been done on that issue, as the Deputy is aware.  The banks met the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, a number of weeks ago and it was agreed that 12,000 of the 13,000 customers who were identified at the end of September would be paid before the end of this year.  We expect the banks to do that.  That is the position.  I have not seen the 6,000 figure that the Deputy has quoted so I do not intend to get into that debate now.</p> <p>  In terms of a wealth tax, that is not something we intend to do.  This Government has said that it is not going to implement a wealth tax.  There are already taxes on wealth, including capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and the local property tax.  The vast majority of wealth in this state is in people's principal primary residence and there is a low rate of tax on that.  The local property tax brings in &euro;470 million.  We discussed it a few moments ago.  If Deputies want to tax wealth, that is where the bulk of the wealth in this society is held.  If they are proposing to increase the property tax, that is a proposal with which I do not agree.  We have a low rate of property tax and I am glad that it is low.  That said, it has broadened the tax base.  Capital gains tax, DIRT and stamp duty are also wealth taxes and they bring in about &euro;2 billion per year out of a total of approximately &euro;60 billion.  These are our wealth taxes.  If the Deputies are arguing that they should be increased, that is an argument we could have but that is a separate conversation.  It is not part of this Finance Bill or this budget.</p></speech>

I am not in favour of this so-called sugar tax and am not convinced by the arguments for it at all.  We tabled an amendment that was ruled out of order and which we may resubmit on Report Stage.  That amendment sought a report on the impact of the tax after its implementation and an assessment of how regressive it is as a tax.  There has been debate and some research on so-called sugar taxes in the US which concluded that people of colour and people on low incomes were hit substantially harder by what was called the soda tax in America.  I believe that would also be the case here and that this would be another regressive tax.  That does not mean that I am in favour of soft drinks or soft drinks companies.  On the contrary, I agree with all of the analysis that points to the major role that they play in childhood obesity in particular, but it is a question of how we deal with that.  Do we impose an indirect tax which, based on evidence from the US, will overwhelmingly be passed on to consumers or do we regulate the industry by ensuring, for example, that vending machines are not allowed in schools, community centres and so forth?  Do we have a ban on advertising of highly sugared drinks at sporting events, which is something that is also being discussed with regard to alcoholic drinks?  Do we tax those corporations directly, which I favour, as opposed to taxing the consumers in the manner proposed in this Bill?  If the Government were serious about tackling obesity, it would be looking at issues like physical education in schools.  Children in primary school in Ireland only get an average of 46 minutes of physical education per week but they get two and a half hours of religious education per week.  Experts recommend an increase of at least 90 minutes per week in physical education.  If the Government is interested in health promotion, then it must engage in such promotion as opposed to introducing new, regressive taxes that will hit those on low incomes the hardest.</p></speech>

Chapter 1 of the Bill provides that a sugar-sweetened drinks tax will apply when such drinks are first supplied in the State.  The introduction of this tax forms part of the Government's comprehensive plan, A Healthy Weight for Ireland, which aims to tackle the obesity and overweight problem in this country.  The tax will apply to non-alcoholic water and juice-based drinks which contain added sugar and which have a total sugar content of 5 grams or more per 100 ml.  Liable products will be identified by reference to the combined nomenclature classifications of goods to nutritional information required under the EU-wide food labelling regime.</p><p>I am not quite sure what the word "nomenclature" means.  However, it refers to classifications of goods and to nutritional information required under the EU wide food labelling regime.  The tax is to be charged when sugar sweetened drinks are first supplied in the State by a supplier and that supplier will be responsible for the payment of the sugar sweetened drinks tax.  A relief may be granted, by way of repayment, where liable products that have previously been supplied in the State are subsequently supplied outside the State.  Provision is also made for products exempted from certain food labelling requirements to be excluded from the scope of the tax.</p><p> There will be two rates of tax, with the lower rate applying to sugar sweetened drinks with a sugar content of 5 g or more but less than 8 g per 100 ml.  The higher rate will apply to liable products with a sugar content of 8 mg or more per 100 ml.  The charge will, when VAT is included, amount to 20 cent and 30 cent per litre for products liable for the lower and higher rates, respectively. </p><p> The yield from the sugar sweetened drinks tax, when VAT is included, is expected to be around &euro;40 million in a full year.  The tax will be commenced by ministerial order no later than April 2018 and after the necessary formal approval from the European Commission that the measure is free from state aid.</p><p> I hear what the Deputy is saying but it is the final piece of the action plan on obesity by the Department of Health.  Effectively, the Deputy has said that the tax is a blunt instrument but I contend that it is a start.  If the provision does not do what we hope it will do then it can be looked at again.  It is certainly the direction in which we intend to move.  Our experience is the more one taxes unhealthy products the less they are used and we think it is the right direction. </p></speech>

One of the purposes of the tax is to encourage people to switch from drinking full sugar soft drinks to other drinks be they diet drinks or other types of drinks.  I hope people would choose water as it is the best option.  I accept that the dangers are lesser.  However, artificial sweeteners are not without their problems, although I accept that they are probably lesser than the problems associated with sugar.  By disincentivising the consumption of very highly sugared soft drinks the Government is incentivising consumption, relatively speaking, if people want to get the same taste, of saccharine and aspartame.  A number of studies have indicated that there are health risks associated with both.  Has the Department considered the matter?</p> <p>  Perhaps it is just a turn of phrase.  Is this really the finishing piece of the Department of Health's action plan on obesity?  It has not had much of an impact, in terms of all of the things that could be done.  Even if I agreed with this taxation measure and thought it would have a substantial impact and was not concerned about it being regressive, I would still have a serious question mark over this tax being the final finishing piece.  Surely there are many more things that can be done, not least the question of physical education.</p></speech>

The sugar tax is a new strategy and the Department of Health has requested that the tax be implemented.</p> <p>  We have some more information.  Some matters in other jurisdictions have been assessed.  There was an evaluation of the impact on consumption.  The Mexican sugar sweetened drinks tax indicated that consumption fell in response to the tax and it fell more sharply for those people in low socio-economic groups.  That is the type of information we have available to us.  </p> <p>  The objective is not to get more money from people in lower socio-economic groups.  The objective is to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks.  In terms of cases where consumption has decreased, in the previous budget it was announced that a sugar tax would be implemented in this current budget.  We ask that the provision is given a fair chance.  We think the tax goes in the right direction but only time will tell.</p></speech>

We received a presentation recently and those involved referred to the market response in terms of cigarettes, in particular the strong volume growth at the lower end of the market where there is value, in that cigarettes are being sold more cheaply.  They argued that the full 50 cent excise increase is not fully evident in that sector.  Is that linked to the minimum excise duty?  It has never been changed.  There is a flat line.  More tax would be taken if the minimum level was triggered.  The tax strategy group suggested increasing the minimum excise duty of &euro;7.75 per pack, but that has not been followed.</p></speech>

Is that connected to the minimum excise duty?  There is an increase in the volume of sales at the lower end of the market.  The minimum excise duty has not been touched.  If it was touched, it would mean that those at the lower end would pay.</p></speech>

Was an analysis carried out?  In the presentation we received, which I understand was circulated to members, growth was shown to be particularly significant at the lower end of the market.  We received the presentation because of competition in the marketplace and growth at the lower levels.  Those experiencing a loss in the purchase of their products are complaining.  Behind that story one can see the relevance of the minimum excise duty question.  It is not being touched.  As I said, the tax strategy group said it should be.  It also means that the full 50 cent excise duty increase on a packet of 20 cigarettes is not fully evident in a sector where there is significant growth.</p></speech>

If there is a Revenue comment or examination - as you have said, from time to time the Revenue examines the matter - then let us have the full details so that we can make a comparison between what Revenue and the industry are saying.</p> <p>  I imagine that because of the competition within the industry now, those involved know where the market growth is.  Therefore, it is a question of whether the bigger companies move to that end of the market, where they do not want to be, or whether those in the market at the lower end feel the same pinch and are forced into the upper end.  It may be a question of competition between companies but it is a Revenue issue as well.</p></speech>

A range applies in this case.  The Minister of State has decided again to go with the upper end of the range.</p> <p>  I have looked at figures from 2007.  I know there was a change in the middle in the percentage on the retail price.  Let us consider the rate of duty on tobacco products for 1,000 cigarettes.  In 2007, the figure was &euro;151.  I have no wish to bombard the committee with figures.  The corresponding figure went up to &euro;288.  During that period the amount of excise paid on cigarettes came down.  Indeed, excise on cigarettes had been falling all during that period bar the past two years and, in the case of one of those two years, the change is explained because of plain packaging.</p> <p>  I am pointing out that the Government cannot go with the &euro;64 million figure.  It simply does not stack up.  There is a point where people will stop smoking cigarettes, and that is important.  This should be done for health promotion reasons and not to raise money.  However, the Government has decided to go with the upper end of the Revenue's expectations.  The Government did the same thing between 2015 and 2016.  The actual increase in excise duty during that period was &euro;16 million.  In previous years, the figure dropped significantly.  I hope that next year the figure will drop significantly as well, but the Government is banking on everyone staying smoking and buying the more expensive cigarettes, and that is not the case.</p></speech>

While receipts for 2016 finish below forecast, it should be noted that the receipts finished ahead of the 2015 outturn.</p></speech>

In the context of &euro;1,098 million in total receipts, the deficit behind the 2016 forecast was 5%.</p> <p>  It should also be noted that forecasting yields is becoming increasingly difficult with continued irregularities and fluctuations in tobacco clearances and tax receipts.  While overall yields have continued to rise over the past three years, issues such as front-loading and a projected decrease in smoking prevalence have made accurate forecasting more problematic.</p> <p>  While 2016 has been an exception, in recent years traditional tax revenue forecasts, using the same price elasticity as used for the 2018 forecast, were in fact realised and projections for 2017 point to a similar positive outcome.  In this regard, Revenue has indicated that a large volume of tobacco products are being cleared from warehouses and that an increase in receipts is expected for the remaining months in 2017.</p> <p>  Current estimates for revenue are that tobacco receipts will meet this year's forecast by the end of the year.  All in all, I am satisfied that the forecast is solid.  If there is a more dramatic shift in the level of consumption than the evidence points to at the moment, it will be welcome from a health perspective and the over-riding health policy.  The figures are essentially on target for 2017.  The figures for 2016 were over forecast while the figures for 2015 were under forecast.  That is the position for the past three years.  The figures for 2016 were below and for 2015 they were above forecast.</p></speech>

It is also a question for Revenue.  Revenue has given us a range of minus &euro;40 million to plus &euro;64 million, which is a range of over &euro;100 million.  We see the elasticity year-on-year and therefore Revenue needs to tighten up on the range.  We do an alternative budget.  We argue that nothing will come.  We take a mid-point, which is zero, basically.  The Government takes the approach that because this is in the context of a &euro;50 billion or &euro;60 billion budget, it will be able to find the &euro;60 million in question, even if it does not come in on target.  Anyway, we will see if the evidence supports it.  Will the Minister of State provide us with the outturn expected for 2017?  I presume the outturn for 2017 is 1.16%.</p></speech>

As public representatives, we all receive representations on the issue of the primary medical certificate.  However, I wish to refer to a particular aspect, the definition of &quot;qualifying organisation&quot; in the regulations mandated under the Finance Act 1989.  The definition states an organisation is a qualifying organisation for the purposes of the scheme if it is &quot;chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons&quot;.  The case that has been brought to my attention involves a school.  All of the pupils attending it have special needs and a good share of them are profoundly disabled.  As I understand it, the school which is a registered charity wants to buy a bus, but it is being told that it falls outside the definition in the regulations because it is not &quot;chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons&quot;; therefore, it cannot avail of the scheme.  I am sure the spirit of the scheme provides for such an organisation to be accommodated.  The purpose of amendments Nos. 57 and 58 is to deal with this situation.</p></speech>

Unless Revenue or the Department can show otherwise, I do not believe the amendments would constitute a mechanism that would facilitate the widespread abuse of the scheme.  As the Chairman said, in terms of their quality of life and access to the ordinary activities of life which, by virtue of their disability, may be confined somewhat, these are enormous issues for people with disabilities and institutions and organisations dealing with people with a serious and permanent disability; as such, I do not understand the approach being taken.  For many years I have assumed that it relates to a risk of abuse which has never been defined.  If it is possible to receive some clarification as to what exactly is the problem from the point of view of the Department and Revenue, perhaps we might be able to fix it.  The census and social welfare statistics and so on show that a significant number of adults and children have a disability.  This means that the scheme which is not easy to access and not transparent and effective is putting another barrier and enormous difficulty in the path of people with disabilities.  Like other members, I can produce examples where, in some cases, people eventually qualified but in others they have never fully qualified.</p> <p>  I would like to hear from the Minister of State on this matter.  Time has passed and it is now possible to carry out a lot of data collection and identification processes.  For example, the development of the public services card should allow for relatively easy verification.  In the school about which Deputy Michael McGrath was speaking the parents of a majority of the children would be in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  In the case of adults, those concerned are receiving a disability allowance from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  There are ways and means to cross-check data.  For instance, to receive a permanent or long-term payment such as domiciliary care allowance from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, whether for a child or an adult, there is a recognised medical evaluation procedure and a examination of the applicant's means.  All of this process is now computerised and there are programmes which, with the permission of applicants, allow the cross-checking of their data which Revenue accepts for other tax purposes.  Because of developments in the use of technology in the public service, I am at a loss to know why this is such a problem, given that it has been dealt with in other areas.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has also done a lot of similar work in the case of special educational needs organisers, SENO.  There is a huge volume of work being done in the public realm that should allow much easier verification of these data.  I do not believe preparation of a report, as proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath in the amendment, would in any way pose a threat to the budget.  I cannot understand why it is not possible for the Minister of State to accept the proposal in principle and come back on Report Stage with his own draft of what might be acceptable.  It is past time we addressed this problem which is an enormous one in people's lives, particularly the parents of children with a disability.</p></speech>

It is very difficult for a public representative to have to tell a constituent who believes he or she falls into the category of disabled person and therefore eligible for the scheme that there is nothing that he or she can do for him or her because of the rigidity of the scheme.  The entire area needs to be reviewed.  The amendments are worthy of support.  The wording of the provision should be changed from "chiefly engaged in the care and transport of" to "engaged in the care and transport of".  That would be a fair definition.  Claw-back mechanisms could be introduced to deal with organisations which ceased to be so engaged.  It is important that we support organisations involved in the transport and care of people with permanent disabilities.</p></speech>

The scheme is a significant tax expenditure, costing approximately &euro;65 million in taxes forgone and grant payments in 2016.  This figure does not include the revenue forgone to the local government fund in the relief from motor tax provided for members of the scheme.  In accordance with SI 353 of 1994, registered charitable organisations are eligible to become members of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme where they are chiefly engaged in the care and transport of disabled persons who have obtained a primary medical certificate.</p> <p>  The effect of the amendments, in removing the word "chiefly", would be to significantly broaden access to the scheme for charitable organisations.  This could open up the scheme to organisations that are not primarily involved in the care and transport of persons with disabilities.  As such, it could result in a poorly targeted scheme and also a large additional liability for the Exchequer.  Deputy Michael McGrath will be aware that the criteria for the scheme are necessarily precise and while this means that many persons with more general mobility disabilities do not qualify for the scheme, given its scale and scope, I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister announced in the budget the introduction of a new VAT compensation scheme for charities in recognition of the work undertaken by the charities sector.  This will provide an avenue of relief for such charities.  </p> <p>  I am not entirely comfortable with that reply.  If Deputy Michael McGrath withdraw the amendments, I will consult the Department on the issue with a view to possible changes being made in the regulations.  I will do the best I can to improve the scheme as it stands.</p></speech>

I am happy to withdraw the amendments in the hope we can make some progress on the matter between now and Report Stage.  I am not seeking a radical redefinition of what has already been provided for.  I can understand the Department's concerns, but there are schools the pupils of which all have special needs and many of whom have profound disabilities for whom a specially adapted bus is required.  I am aware of a particular case which led to my tabling of the amendments.  This applies to other schools also.  I accept that the definition needs to be tight and that the proposed change would have consequences, but it would be mean-spirited not to move on an issue such as this.  I will withdraw the amendments and discuss the matter further with the Minister between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

It is about professional contractors who provide IT, engineering, pharma, bio-pharma and other services on projects and who, on that basis, are classified in tax legislation in Schedule D, Case II as distinct from Case I.  The issue I am raising is that of the treatment of the travel and subsistence expenses they incur, not flat rate claims and so on.  A question arises as to whether persons who are legitimately self-employed are incurring these expenses wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their work, the current definition used.  There is an additional leg to this test for employees in that their expenses have to be incurred necessarily as well as wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their work.  What is the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department to this cohort which is not huge in number who are self-employed and centrally involved in delivering major capital projects for companies in the pharma, bio-pharma and IT sectors and so on?  In a situation where a self-employed person based in Cork travels to Dublin to work on a project for a number of weeks or months and pays his or her own accommodation and travel costs, should such costs be allowed as an expense for tax purposes?  </p><p>Those raising this issue, including the consulting firms involved in projects, the companies hiring them and the independent contractors, make the argument that rates are increasing, that business is becoming less competitive and that there has been a flight of expertise and talent from Ireland because of unfavourable tax treatment.  I have been trying for some time to get a straight answer from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners as to whether they have a case.  It seems they do.  I am not advocating special treatment for anyone.  I just want to know whether persons who are genuinely self-employed and incurring expenses as they move from one project to the next should, from a tax treatment point of view, be able to deduct them accordingly.  That is the net issue.  Perhaps the Minister of State might outline the position.</p></speech>

The general position is that travel expenses incurred in furtherance of business are deductible, whereas expenses incurred in travelling between work and home are not.</p><p>In regard to subsistence expenses, the general position is that expenditure incurred on food in the course of a business is not deductible.</p><p> In the case of expenditure incurred by self-employed contractors, unlike employees and office holders, self-employed contractors are entitled to a tax deduction in respect of all expenditure incurred by them wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their trade.  As already stated, this includes travel expenses incurred for business purposes.  In addition, whereas officeholders and employees must necessarily incur travel expenses and subsistence relating to that travel in the performance of their duties in order to qualify for tax-free reimbursement, there is no requirement that self-employed contractors must necessarily incur the expense.  The necessity of the expense is irrelevant once it is incurred in furtherance of the trade, subject, of course, to the restriction on travel to a place of work, as I have already mentioned.  In the case of a contractor engaged by an enterprise to deliver services at its place of business, that place of business will generally be the place of work of the contractor for the duration of the contract.</p><p> Therefore, on the basis that self-employed contractors are already permitted to take tax deductions for a wide range of business expenditure, and that the tax treatment of travel and subsistence expenditure is well established and based on long-standing principles, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I am aware that, as regards independent professional contractors, this is an issue the Deputy raised with the previous Minister, Deputy Noonan.  We have received a submission from officials which followed on from a meeting they had with a representative organisation for this sector.  One of the points raised in that submission was that it would perhaps be advisable also to consider a wider perspective than simply the expense issue raised here, in other words, the use of intermediary-type company structures, which are becoming more prevalent among the self-employed as a means of providing labour.  A consultation process on the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements was jointly launched by the then Minister for Finance and the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection last year.  The consultation invited submissions from interested parties on possible measures to address the loss to the Exchequer that may arise under arrangements of this nature.</p> <p>  I am pleased to note that I have just received the report which was informed by this consultation and which has been prepared by a working group of officials.  The report will contribute to the debate on any potential measures to address these impacts.  As the report looks at the wider issues of taxation and social welfare for this sector, I could not agree that we need another report before we consider this report.

I expected there would have been some progress.  We read in the newspapers that Paddy Power Betfair hired Fergal O'Rourke and did a bit of lobbying with the Minister which put an end to the idea of increasing the rate above 1%.  It was stated by the Minister of State's predecessors going back as far as the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, that we would be better to get the 1% bedded in and then look at increasing the rate.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have argued for some time that this rate should increase to 3% and that the burden should be placed on the punter.  This would actually be a benefit for small operators because, at the minute, they are absorbing the 1% and this would, therefore, increase their profitability by that amount.  We looked at a 3% rate because we believe that is a rate the larger operators could not afford to absorb themselves.  This would obviously bring in revenue which would properly fund the horse and greyhound fund but it would also provide money for addiction services and other services.</p> <p>  The amendment calls for a report to allow us to look at the options and to find how we could increase this rate over time.  I think it is important that we have a signal, given I thought we were to move in this direction this year.  I am not surprised at Paddy Power Betfair, and in fairness to Feargal O'Rourke, his company does professional work for Paddy Power Betfair and there is nothing untoward there, because that is what lobbying is.  Nonetheless, I believe there is a requirement to do this.</p> <p>  Betting is also a vice.  Many people do this, and I make a punt myself and I enjoy it, but it should be taxed appropriately.  I can remember going to the bookies for my father - I was probably doing it illegally - and I would have been paying 10 pence to the pound, because that was what the punter had to pay at the time in tax.  We are now talking about 3%, which is what is already captured online.  I believe it is important to do this.</p></speech>

The report explored gambling behaviour in Ireland, specifically the issue of problem gambling and its impact on the individual, the gambler&rsquo;s relationships with social connections and the wider impact of problem gambling behaviour on community and society.  The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 brought remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries offering betting services in Ireland into the regulatory regime for the first time.  At the same time, these operations were brought into the betting tax net, effectively doubling the revenue receipts from this source.</p> <p>  The 2015 Act was seen as a temporary measure pending the introduction of a wider Government approach to gambling under the gambling control Bill being prepared by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation and licensing of gambling activities, including betting and gaming.  It also includes a proposal to establish a social fund to assist in counteracting the ill effects for society, as well as for persons and their families, of irresponsible gambling.  The scheme does not include the national lottery, whose activities are separately regulated under the National Lotteries Act 2013.  Having been given special responsibility in this area, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is working to ensure that legislation providing for the regulation of the gambling sector can be published at the earliest opportunity.  Discussions with the Office of the Attorney General are under way.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment to prepare a report on increasing betting tax to 3% to be paid by the customer, my predecessor committed to reviewing the betting duty regime through the work of the Tax Strategy Group during the debate on last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  The Deputy will be aware that this report was published in the Tax Strategy Group paper earlier this year.  As part of this review, which included consultation with stakeholders and interested parties, consideration was given to the impacts, benefits and drawbacks of both imposing betting duty on the customer and also of increasing betting duty rates.  The review found, among other things, that applying a charge directly to the customer is problematic.  Betting customers are price sensitive and such a change to taxing the customer could encourage a move towards alternative forms of gambling that are not subject to tax or to seek out unlicensed operators.</p> <p>  I might add that, as part of the process, Department officials met with various stakeholders, including the advocacy groups Problem Gambling Ireland and the Rutland Centre.  I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p> <p>  I wish to add one point.  I accept the Deputy's view in regard to problem gambling.  From speaking with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, I agree the legislation he is seeking to have passed should be prioritised.</p><p>Everybody in the House should try to facilitate that.  That would be a huge help.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has done a large amount of work, much of it in his time as Chair of the justice committee.</p></speech>

It has been going on and on.</p> <p>  Speaking about old provisions, the provision in terms of the betting duty was originally at 2%.  At a time when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, it was in the legislation, if memory serves me right, but it needed a commencement order.  It was commenced at 1%.  The principle of the 2% is already there.</p> <p>  I am disappointed about this.  I thought we were moving in the direction of increasing this tax.  I am sure we will come back to it in due course.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

There was speculation in advance of the budget that the reduced rate would be done away with.  I would say the hospitality sector lobbied hard to ensure that it was not.</p><p>The total cost of this VAT reduction between 2011 and 2016 is &euro;2.2 billion.  It is a large amount of money.  The projected reduction for the coming year, according to the answers we got back in preparation for the budget, is &euro;491 million.  This, in reality, ends up in the pockets of employers in a highly profitable low-wage sector.  I have not seen any evidence to suggest that this kind of foregone revenue is worth the benefits that it brings because it ends up in the pockets of the already quite wealthy employers in this sector.  I would like to hear the rationale for not changing it in the budget and for continuing this giveaway of approximately &euro;0.5 billion a year as opposed to using that money directly to invest, including in regional development.</p></speech>

My party does not argue for the 9% rate to revert to the 13.5% rate across the board, although there are quite legitimate arguments to do so in certain sectors.  I can see the rationale, for example, for newspapers, to continue to enjoy a 9% VAT rate but I presume there is a reason that they are grouped together and that is why it has to happen.</p> <p>  What we have looked at is the cost of the hotel beds sector.  This particular part makes up approximately 40% of the revenue lost, given that vacancy rates have increased, that we have high costs in terms of hotel accommodation, and that hotel accommodation here is among the dearest in Europe and enjoys the highest occupancy rates in Europe.  We are conscious that this is not the case across the board.  I come from west Donegal.  The hotels in that area enjoy a short window of reasonable occupancy of between six and eight weeks.  The rest of the time is really challenging for them.  That said, the majority of the hotel beds are in Dublin where occupancy rates are the highest in Europe and prices have increased 6% in the past year.  There is no need to subsidise that sector anymore.</p> <p>  We need to find ways to support other sectors in areas which are struggling, such as hotels in more rural, isolated areas.  The Wild Atlantic Way is one way of doing that but there is a need for other interventions.</p> <p>  We need to learn the lesson, when we introduce a VAT relief or tax relief that works, to have the courage to start to taper it off.  This, in my view, is the cycle of tapering it off.  It is about producing a report looking at the implications which will catch all of the issues that I have addressed in terms of price, affordability, availability, the disparities in different regions, and isolating whether it is possible to introduce a relief for the non-hotel beds sector that has been identified but where the hotel beds rate would revert to the 13.5% rate.  When I talk about hotel beds, I am conscious that those hotel beds also include guest houses and other such forms of accommodation.</p></speech>

Revenue's most recent estimate for reverting the reduced 9% VAT rate back to 13.5% is that it would bring in extra revenue of &euro;491 million.  A 1% increase or decrease would yield or cost &euro;109 million.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of the reduced 9% VAT rate, since its introduction in 2011 to end 2016, is of the order of &euro;2.2 billion.</p> <p>  In terms of economic benefit, employment in the accommodation and food service sector has grown significantly since the introduction of the 9% VAT rate.  Employment in these sectors has increased gradually each year since 2011, with an increase of over 35% in the period of Q2 2011 to Q1 2017 &ndash; an increase of 40,500 jobs in the sector.  The rate of increase in employment in this sector was significantly greater than the overall level of employment increase.  In terms of overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents, the number of trips increased from 6.5 million in 2011 to 9.6 million in 2016, an increase of 48%.  However, these benefits could be attributed to other factors, such as the general and strong recovery in the economy and better economic performance in the target markets.</p> <p>  I decided in budget 2018 not to make any change to the 9% VAT rate as it continues to benefit the tourism sector throughout the country and any change in the rate could impact greatly on the tourism sector outside of the capital.  I am also conscious of the impact the decline in the value of sterling is having on UK visitor numbers and how any increase in the VAT rate might exacerbate this.</p> <p>  While it is noted that hotel prices in Dublin continue to rise, this is partly a function of supply which is being addressed.  Furthermore, because of EU fiscal neutrality constraints, different VAT rates cannot apply to different geographical areas in the country.  In this context, VAT policy must be decided in the context of the national interest.</p> <p>  However, I accept the position of the Deputies that the 9% VAT rate must be subject to ongoing analysis.  In this context I have asked my Department to undertake a comprehensive study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate ahead of next year's budget.  This will better inform any decision in relation to the reduced rate going forward.  As this analysis will not be finalised within the timeframes suggested in the amendments, I cannot accept the Deputies' amendments but I can assure them that their concerns will be included in the study to be undertaken by my Department.</p></speech>

The legal position is that children's shoes and clothing are zero rated for VAT purposes.  The definition is in relation to clothing.  It is not exceeding the size appropriate to children of average build up to ten years of age and similarly for footwear.  In practice, the administration of that by Revenue is that zero rating applies to the following criteria in relation to children's clothing, namely, sizes up to and including a 32 in. chest or 26 in. waist and children's footwear up to and including a size 5.5.  Those sizes were determined in 1984 after consultation with clothing and footwear trade interests at both manufacturing and distribution levels.</p> <p>  There is an EU context in terms of the EU VAT directive and a zero rating can be drawn from the derogation under Article 110 of the EU VAT directive.  What I have learnt so far from replies to parliamentary questions is that the position of Revenue and the Department is that the age cannot be increased, but the average sizes can potentially be changed, but only if there is evidence that the average sizes need to be increased.</p> <p>  The issue I wish to highlight is that if one takes footwear, for example, one has a certain price range up to size 5.5 which is the zero rating.  Parents who go shopping will know this.  A pair of zero-rated runners might be &euro;40 but if one goes to size 6 the cost could be &euro;60 or &euro;70.  The application of VAT to runners of size 6 or 6.5 does not explain the price differential.  It is clear that either manufacturers, distributors or retailers are taking the opportunity afforded by the jump from zero rating to applying the standard rate to impose a very dramatic increase in the price of footwear and clothing once the zero rating no longer applies.  There is a huge difference.</p> <p>  While the average might be at around age ten that a child would need size 6 footwear or in the case of clothing greater than a 26 in. waist or a 32 in. chest, there are many exceptions to that.  Many children of that age require larger sizes.  What we need to do is explore what flexibility, if any, there is for zero rating.  The Minister said the reference to the age is cast iron and cannot be changed, but there may be some flexibility in the average size relative to the age.  The rates were set in 1984 and I do not know if it has been reviewed since.  It is a very important issue for many families and there is an element of exploitation in that when one goes beyond the size threshold where clothes or footwear are no longer zero rated, there is a significant jump in price across a wide range of clothing and footwear for children, which is not explained by the application of VAT at 23%.  Is the Minister of State prepared to look at this and to see what can be done to help families dealing with this issue?</p></speech>

Under Article 110 of the VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on and from 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services after that date.</p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the zero rate of VAT applies to clothing and shoes for children and that is possible under EU VAT law because the zero rate applied to those goods on and from 1 January 1991.  It is not possible under EU VAT law to extend the application of the zero rate by raising the age limit of children to whom the zero rate could apply in respect of articles of clothing and footwear.</p> <p>  Since the mid-1980s, Irish VAT law has defined children's clothing and footwear as that not exceeding the size appropriate to children of average build and foot size of ten years of age.  That includes clothing described, labelled, marked or marketed as being for children under 11 years of age.  The practical application of the measure is that zero rating applies to children's clothing of sizes up to and including a 32 in. chest, a 26 in. waist or 152 cm in height; and children's footwear up to and including a size 5.5 or 38.  The sizes were determined in 1984 after consultation with clothing and footwear trade interests at both manufacturing and distribution levels.</p> <p>  While EU VAT law prohibits any increase in the age of children's clothing to which the zero rate applies, the practical application of the current zero rate to children aged under 11 can be refined where there is evidence that the size limitations have changed since the current criteria were agreed in the 1980s.  Where the industry representing children's clothing and footwear has reason to believe that the current practical size measurements no longer represent children aged under 11 years of age, it should make a submission to my Department to that effect and we will engage with the sector.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</p> <p>  Effectively, it is a matter of interpretation by Revenue if the average size to which the legislation refers has changed or if children have become bigger, which I expect is the case since 1984.  That is more than 30 years ago and children are definitely bigger than they were.  A submission must be made to Revenue or to the Department and we can pass it on or go directly to Revenue.</p></speech>

We are not adding in new goods to be zero rated.  We are changing the size.  I challenge the assertion that we cannot change the age.  It is clear that we cannot add in new goods to the basket of zero-rated goods but that is not what I suggest.  On what basis does Revenue and the Department say there is no flexibility on the age issue?  I accept that the Minister has said the size can be changed.</p></speech>

It had been 2%.  This caught many people in the farming community and to be fair, the Finance Bill has rectified the situation where a father or mother hands down the land to a son or daughter.  </p><p>We have tabled this amendment for 2% up to &euro;300,000 along with two other amendments and another on consolidation.  The latter relates to relief being available where farmers who have units of land that might be ten or 15 miles away may be in a position to sell it if another piece of land was for sale closer to them.  The 2% stamp duty is not about farmers alone, it is pertinent to every Deputy who lives in rural Ireland.  I asked about the rural-proofing of the budget.  Every Deputy across the country is trying to encourage people in small towns, especially where many businesses have closed due to the recession, and the premises are left vacant.  This is not a matter that concerns one party or group alone; everyone is trying to encourage people to open businesses and make towns more vibrant again.  Added to that, there is a major problem within the farming sector where large operators who have the funds are able to mop up lands, while we are trying to encourage young people to take over the land.  The idea of increasing the threshold to &euro;300,000 at 2% is for the benefit of the many farmers who do not have the same flexibility with a bank as larger operators, when a small piece of land comes up near them.  It would probably be the most land that a farmer would buy in their life.  Looking at the trends for protecting a family farm, it is often the case that a farmer will need to buy an extra piece of land to consolidate the farm for the future.  We must make this decision to protect family farms, that is why we propose that those farmers be given the opportunity along with other small businesses, such as hardware shop or other small shops which had closed.  It is great to see some parts of the country improve, but there are still many areas with vacant buildings.  This budget is telling them that they must pay and extra &euro;8,000 or &euro;12,000 for a building that we should be encouraging them to buy.  Money is not that freely available and there are people who are reaching their thresholds.  </p><p>There is significant confusion over consanguinity which I hope the Minister and the Department will clarify.  There is supposed to be a document that says that if someone is buying land and the deposit was paid prior to the budget and the deal is finished by the year end, the purchaser is not liable for this.  Will the Minister confirm this?  The 2% figure is included in this amendment to protect the small operator.  We do not stand for landlordism or multinationals, we are talking about the person.  If we fail to solve this problem, it will be another kick for rural communities and small towns, against everyone's efforts.  I am not having a go at everyone; people are trying across the board to ensure fair play and get businesses open.  If something like this is not done, there will be further demise in rural Ireland.  </p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice tried on budget night to have the measure postponed until the end of the year, and I supported him.  Many people have been caught by this for various reasons.  Some blame auctioneers or solicitors, or in some cases the banks where they could not secure the finance in time, and those people should be given a window to conclude the transaction.  They had made a deal, shaken hands and spat on their palms.  This measure was a double whammy for them.  It was unexpected and in the spirit of goodwill and behaving honourably they should be allowed to complete the deal without this blow.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice has outlined the funding.  We want to support the small businessman or businesswoman and the small family farm.  The iar-Thaoiseach came to Edgeworthstown and announced there was nothing he would not do - I said it was like the Four Roads to Glenamaddy - to rejuvenate rural Ireland.  This budget measure is doing the exact opposite, it is a blow to every town and village.  Anyone on this committee from a rural area - I mean everywhere beyond the Red Cow - will be familiar with these villages and towns.  I travelled to one last week in County Mayo, where I saw one closed building after the next.  My own town of Clonmel was once thriving, the biggest inland town in the country, and now the middle of the town is devastated.  We are trying to get people back into the town and rejuvenate it.  Then there is a housing crisis.  This measure is an obstacle to both of these problems.  We could solve much of the housing crisis, although not all of it, and get a living town once more while giving a break to entrepreneurs that they could buy a premises that has been closed for the last five or ten years if it did not reopen as a business premises; someone else might buy it and put accommodation above or at the back.  Several small businesses that were in the middle of the process have contacted me.  Some of them thought that the solicitors had completed the transaction but they had not, since one almost has to live with a solicitor to make them do what they are supposed to; the longer it goes on for them the better.  This measure is meanspirited.</p><p>It is against the spirit of everything we say - so much for rural proofing.  This is rural segregation.  It is not that many of these family farmers wish to buy land, but they have no choice if they wish to stay in the production of milk, cereal or beef, especially given the vast amount of land required.  It is different with poultry and other production.  Farmers must try to expand their acreage - the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, should understand that given where he comes from - to stay in the game or even to stand still.  That is especially the case with the onset of Brexit.  A number of young farmers have been brave enough to invest hugely in dairying and I am worried about them.  If they see some land they wish to buy, this will be a hammer blow from the Government.  They are already being hammered by the vulture funds.  We tend to think those vulture funds are abroad but there is a home grown vulture fund in my area of Tipperary.  It is buying every morsel of grass or seedling that grows.  It is a land grab by a very famous conglomerate.  That conglomerate has much prowess in the horse racing industry, which we welcome, and provides much employment.  However, it has amassed up to 17,000 acres by now.</p><p> I put a proposal to the Minister for Finance for a land tax on any farm over 750 acres.  Being from Tipperary I know how emotive the words "land tax" are but we must do something to ensure the survival of rural Ireland and to keep the schools open and the families, churches, teams and playing fields there.  We must keep the place alive, not shut it down behind gates.  We have submitted this amendment because we must give some type of solace, not blindfold these business people, entrepreneurs and families, tie their hands behind their backs and let them be sucked up by the vulture funds and just tossed to hell or to Connacht.  It is to hell or wherever now.  The vulture funds are not being touched.</p><p> We were very careful with our figures, with 4% from &euro;300,000 to &euro;500,000 and 6% from &euro;500,000.  We are not trying to be all things to all people.  It is for a specific group of people.  The value of property will rise in towns, even if there is not much business.  We are going to hunt all our entrepreneurs into this city where one cannot get a bed for a night, a parking space or anything else.  The recent OECD report found that 53% of all economic activity is taking place in the capital city.  It is 15% or 20% higher than the figure for any other capital city in Europe.  We are in the middle of Brexit and all the announcements and pronouncements of what we are going to do, along with all the hashtags and God knows what else.  The last Taoiseach never had to hashtag but went out himself to tell what he was going to do.  People do not want lip service.  They want tangible efforts and in this case to be left alone.</p><p> This hammer blow was totally unexpected, especially with all the talk about rural proofing.  The words "rural proofing" should be deleted from the Government's vocabulary because there is nothing rural proofing about this measure.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, will discuss our other amendment, No. 66.  Amendment No. 69 calls for a report to be laid before the D&aacute;il which would include a risk assessment of the sustainability of stamp duty receipts from commercial property.  This section of the Bill deals with the increase in stamp duty from 2% to 6%.  Agricultural land is captured in that, and that is dealt with in amendment No. 66 and the amendment tabled by Deputies Fitzmaurice and Mattie McGrath.</p> <p>  I wish to speak on the risk associated with the figures the Minister is using in respect of commercial stamp duty.  Commercial stamp duty was at the heart of the banking crisis in the last decade.  It is important that commercial property is monitored.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports an increase in commercial stamp duty so we do not have a problem in that regard.  However, we are concerned about the figures the Department is relying on with regard to the income to be generated.</p></speech>

This is based on the outturn for commercial property sales last year.  Looking at a linear increase, it would double at 4% and so forth.  We raised our concerns on the night of the budget and since then.  It is interesting to listen to CBRE property consultants.  They have insight into the current position of commercial property.  They say the figures for the past three years have been inflated by the sale of assets by NAMA and the banks, which has generated an unusually large number of high value transactions.  Obviously, one can take it that such transactions will not continue into the future.  In addition, most property commentators are of the view that total investment spend volumes in the Irish commercial property market will be lower in 2017 than they were last year.  Overall investments in the Irish commercial property market exceeded &euro;1.3 billion in the first nine months of this year according to Jones Lang LaSalle Limited, JLL.  JLL is of the view that volumes for 2017 will likely reach between &euro;2 billion and &euro;2.5 billion.  If we accept the higher estimate of &euro;2.5 billion, which would mean a significant increase in the last few months of this year, that is significantly lower than the &euro;4.5 billion outturn in 2016.  That is an expected &euro;2.5 billion in commercial property transactions in 2017 against &euro;4.5 billion last year.</p> <p>  It is risky to use what could be seen as dodgy figures to underpin the budgetary strategy.  I raised this issue two days ago when we were discussing cuts in income taxes, the sustainability of the tax base and so forth.  There is close to &euro;400 million coming from this, but we must investigate whether the figures are robust.  There are serious questions in this regard on a number of measures.  First, the experts expect the outturn for this year to be a little over half of the outturn for last year.  Also, the previous outturns were inflated because of sales by banks and NAMA.  A major gap, therefore, could emerge in the budget very quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1369" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#PP00500"><p>I am seeking some technical information on property transactions.  Property transactions take place equally throughout the year.  My query is about the transitional arrangements in the budget.  For the sake of argument, one twelfth of property transactions are still waiting to be stamped.  The deed might be executed by the solicitor and a signed contract is delivered.  People are just waiting to have it stamped.  Heretofore, the Revenue online service, ROS, included a box which one would tick when filing one's return online.  That would enable a person to avail of the reduced rate and, therefore, the person would get his or her certificate on that basis.  However, that does not appear to be the case on this occasion.</p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners issued two notes on this.  First, where somebody has the contract signed and ready to go, if he or she wishes to get the deed stamped he or she must pay the full increase.  He or she will get the refund back on the signing of the Finance Act.  That is ridiculous.  People are relying on bank finance in many of these transactions and one is asking the person to foot the cost of an additional 4% in tax for which the person is not liable.  The second point made in the clarification is that one can avail of the reduced rate but the Revenue Commissioners will not give one the stamp certificate.  If one does not have the stamp certificate one cannot get bank finance or register with the Property Registration Authority, PRA.  In other words, it is not a solution.  What can happen then is one's return could be late.  If somebody's stamp duty return is late, because he or she cannot finance the additional 4%, will the Revenue Commissioners charge the person interest and penalties on that?</p></speech>

At the beginning of the debate on the Finance Bill I said I was shocked that this increase in stamp duty was leaked.</p><p>It was leaked very comprehensively in all of the main national newspapers, particularly on the weekend before the budget, in a way that I have never seen with a tax measure before.  The Minister for Finance suggested in his response that this was perhaps a method for getting a feeling for how the sector would react to this proposal.  If there was in fact private information circulating beforehand, however, this means that a great many avoidance measures were undertaken back in the days before the measure came into effect.  This further means that people who were not in this golden circle of potential recipients of information will have lost out on the double.  When it comes to developing tax policy, this is extremely unfair.  It is unfair to the person in a rural smallholding who did not have the information that this was about to come down the tracks.  It is also unfair to the business that may have been undertaking an ordinary business transaction as it would not have had that advance information either.  This information was, however, clearly shared with and broadcast to the so-called players in the property market.  Any report on this should look at this matter because tax information released before the applicable date is of course enormously valuable information for deals that are in the pipeline.  I know that the Minster was annoyed that this issue was raised, but it has been a fundamental principle of Irish tax policy for a very long time that there be no such circle of people with access to prior information on the details of the budget.  It is important, then, that this be examined.</p><p> I come to second point.  There was clearly a surge in property deals last year because of various deals that were undertaken and legitimate questions have been raised over whether or not that surge will continue.  As this is the very pillar holding up the budget's arithmetic, we need to know the truth about the likely revenue outcomes from this tax.  The whole manner in which this deal was conducted strongly indicates that there are within the circle of this current Government some people with more access to information than others.  </p></speech>

I am sure that Deputy Peter Burke and a number of other members, Deputy Michael McGrath for instance, know that there are perfectly easy ways of avoiding this situation, firstly by selling a company's underlying shares - an option unavailable, incidentally, to the kind of small family farm holding that Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned - or secondly through various devices for resting contracts rather than completing contracts already in the field.  I do not care if the Minister of State is annoyed at this or not.  All of this amounts to a significantly unfair potential advantage to very wealthy people with tax advisors who are part of a circle of information and are able to get access to it.  The people mentioned in the various amendments, however, are highly unlikely to have that kind of access unless they get up very early on a Sunday morning to buy the newspapers and read the information there.  The Minister can bet his bottom dollar that if that information was available to journalists on the Saturday or Sunday it was almost certainly available to selected individuals much earlier in the week, whether that was to test out his credibility or not.</p> <p>  What we are talking about here is an examination.  Even if the proposals made by various Deputies here are not agreed to, the Revenue Commissioners as an independent body ought to look at this matter.  There ought to be a fair deal for the small taxpayer, be he or she in rural Ireland or indeed running a small business in urban Ireland.  There should be no one particular flow of information that might potentially benefit very well-off people with the wherewithal to afford extensive tax advice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#QQ00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to amendment No. 66.  As Deputy Burton has said, information is power, and in this case it would seem that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine did not have the information on the extension of stamp duty to farmers because he certainly came out the next day to say that this was not going to extend to them.  We now find, of course, that it does and there was great dismay among many in rural Ireland who were in the process of buying and selling land to find that this 6% stamp duty was to clamped onto it.</p> <p>  Our proposal here is to reduce that stamp duty rate in line with what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine said the day after the budget.  That is our demand here and we expect it to be met because at the end of the day the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine represents the farming community.  We all know that farm income in Ireland amounts to about half of the average industrial wage and that farmers are struggling to survive.  Many of the people in this situation want to buy land so as to make their holding sustainable.  Somebody holding 40 or 50 acres, for example, might decide to buy the extra 20 acres that becomes available beside them.  When that farmer goes to the bank to buy it, however, a big issue now is whether or not he or she is going to have to pay this 6% stamp duty.  This would clamp an extra charge onto the farmer that he or she might not have budgeted for at the outset.</p> <p>  The issues under discussion here have been very well rehearsed both here at committee and in the D&aacute;il on budget day.  The farming community is quite angry, not just at the increase but also at the fact that they appear to have been treated as little more than an afterthought in all of this.  They are quite justified in their anger because it is very clear that this was not thought through or worked out properly.  This duty was simply applied to commercial property without any thought for the impact that it might have on rural Ireland and on members of the farming community.  Speaking from this perspective, then, I respectfully request the support of the committee in getting this amendment through.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to address this if he has not done so already.  Deputy Burke set out quite well the consequences of not having such arrangements laid out in order that people might know where they stood.  In the meantime the Revenue Commissioners have made further clarifications on this, which I welcome, but which do not far enough in dealing with this issue.  There are two options: pay the 6% now and get a 4% refund at some future point without any guarantee of timing or mention of interest; or pay 2% now and not get the stamp certificate until the Finance Act 2017 passes into law sometime around Christmas and the purchaser complies with the proofs needed for the transition arrangements.  There are very serious practical difficulties with this.  I understand that in the past, generally speaking, transition arrangements were laid out in the financial resolution on budget night.</p> <p>  Can the Minister of State comment on the various proposals that have been set out in the amendments?  Some involve a tiered approach whereby the larger transactions would attract the highest rate with a reduced rate for transactions at a lower value.  Is it possible to cost such an approach and what would the implications be for the tax yield?  Can the Minister of State clarify if this had been factored into the budget?  </p> <p>  I welcome the changes made to consanguinity relief.  These will go some, though not all the way towards dealing with people's concerns.  We will shortly be debating amendments around farm consolidation in situations where there is already a capital gains exemption, and whether or not this might also be extended to stamp duty where the test of consolidation has been met.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1476" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#QQ00900"><p>I wrote to the Minister on this matter.  I also raised the issues brought up today by Deputies Burke and McGrath.  I know that the Minister has sent the correspondence on to the Revenue Commissioners but the outcome remains unsatisfactory.  We understand that there are transitional arrangements in place.  The problem, however, is that there are people who purchased land and for whom the transfer of that land went through on budget night.</p><p>They obtained finance to purchase a land holding and have no access to the additional &euro;10,000 or &euro;11,000 required to pay the stamp duty charge.  The problem is that the individual, who may be one of many, does not want to be in breach of the law.  Time is now running out and a decision needs to be made this week.  I understand there is a period of four weeks from when the charge is generated to when it must be paid.  I made the point that there should be an announcement from the Revenue Commissioners and the Government that no late fees or penalties will apply to individuals who do not pay the charge until the Finance Bill is through.  I have not heard any clarification in that regard.  The individual in question wants to comply completely with the law but must satisfy the bank.  He or she cannot gain access to any other money and did everything he or she believed to be proper.  He or she took out a loan for the value of the land and stamp duty.  On the night when the transfer went through, the law changed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#RR00200"><p>I have about 400 notes coming at me from all different directions.  We have had conversations previously about other taxes.  The 2% stamp duty rate was the emergency rate.  We had to reduce the rate to this to try to get the property market moving.  The standard rate in times gone past was 6%.  The rate has returned to that.  It was based on a sustainable, broad tax base.  The rate was as high as 9% prior to its being 6%.</p> <p>  We discussed earlier the VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  There is always pain when taxes reduced during an emergency are returned to a sustainable level that puts the nation's finances onto a solid footing.  Everybody in this room, and in both Chambers, wants the taxation system to be sustainable so we will not return to the cliff face we were at in previous years.</p> <p>  If it is acceptable, I will not address the matter of consolidation until speaking on amendment No.  67.  I will read my notes and deal with each section in turn.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 64 to 66, inclusive, and 69 have been grouped together.  Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 deal with the proposed amendments to the stamp duty rates charged on non-residential property.  Amendment No. 66 is specific to agricultural land, and amendment No. 69 seeks a report within six months on the sustainability of stamp duty receipts from commercial property.</p> <p>  Budget 2018 includes an adjustment to the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property from 2% to 6%, projected to raise &euro;376 million in 2018.  This is based on estimates in Revenue's pre-budget ready reckoner, which showed that a 0.5% increase in the stamp duty rate applying to non-residential property would result in a &euro;47 million increase in the yield.  From a &euro;376 million yield, a four percentage point increase was derived.</p> <p>  For non-residential stamp duty, this yield projection for 2018 is based on receipts for previous years, combined with an ongoing assessment of expected receipts by the end of the current year and for next year as well as impacts of earlier policy changes.  </p> <p>  Following budget 2018, Revenue has updated the ready reckoner to a post-budget basis, taking account of budgetary changes and revised growth forecasts from my Department for 2018.  The post-budget ready reckoner indicates that each 0.5% increase in the stamp duty rate applying to non-residential property would result in a &euro;49 million increase in the overall yield.  This would indicate that the estimated additional yield from the increase in stamp duty rate on non-residential property could be in the region of &euro;392 million rather than &euro;376.  While the estimated yield makes an assumption of no behavioural change, basing receipts on 2016-17 levels and trends is the most reasonable option.  The estimate also assumes current exemptions and other reliefs remain unchanged.</p> <p>  There has been some commentary regarding the estimated yield of &euro;376 million.  Most of the commentary has focused on the level of commercial property assets traded, with estimates putting this between &euro;2 billion and &euro;4.5 billion per annum.  It is clear from Revenue data, however, that the levels of commercial and other non-residential property transactions significantly exceed that which has been estimated by some commentators.  A simple extrapolation of the receipts for 2016, based on &euro;256 million at a rate of 2%, implies transactions valued at over &euro;12 billion in that year.  Adjusting for significant once-off transactions in 2016, which were stripped out, receipts in the three-year period 2014 to 2016 were quite stable.  For the nine months from January to September 2017, revenue receipts indicate a level of commercial activity in the order of &euro;6.4 billion.  This is significantly more than the estimates of certain commentators, and it is reasonable to expect this level of activity to continue.  </p> <p>  The latest forecast from CBRE for new office supply in Dublin from 2017 to 2020 is 880,000 sq. m.  This includes projects with planning permission granted and planning applications submitted, as well as projects under construction and recently completed, in 2017.</p> <p>  Naturally, tax receipts under all heads are monitored closely and reported on in the monthly fiscal monitor, which incorporates the Exchequer statement.  Any developments are, of course, examined by my officials.  This ongoing monitoring is more useful than a static report at some future time.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 66 would result in a reduction in stamp duty yields that would have to be made up from other taxation measures in order to maintain overall budget arithmetic.  I am informed that the estimated loss in yield under amendment No. 64 would be &euro;162 million, while the estimate in respect of amendment No. 65 would be &euro;105 million.  The estimated reduced yield from Deputy Doherty's proposal, in amendment No. 66, would be &euro;32 million.</p> <p>  In my budget statement I announced an extension of consanguinity relief for another three years and that the stamp duty rate applying under that scheme would be fixed at 1%.  Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members and is particularly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief, such young trained farmer stamp duty exemption.</p> <p>  Following discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I decided that in addition to extending the period of the relief and fixing the associated stamp duty rate at 1%, the age rule for the consanguinity relief will be removed.  This means it will be possible for all gifts and sales of farmlands to closely related family members who do not qualify for the 100% exemption from stamp duty under the young trained farmer scheme to benefit from the consanguinity relief at a stamp duty rate of 1%.  For the reasons I have outlined, I do not propose to support amendments Nos. 64, 65, 66 and 69.</p> <p>  There are a number of other issues with which I want to deal.  Land purchase is not the only option.  I am one of the farmers in the room, and there are others.  Budget 2014 reflected the analysis of the release for the farming and agriculture sectors.  There is a really substantial relief.  Farmers have the opportunity to rent their land to other farmers tax-free for the income up to &euro;40,000.  This is really beneficial.  Farmers enter an agreement to have a long-term lease, the lessor can get up to &euro;40,000 for the duration of the lease.  It is not correct to state nothing has been done for farmers who choose to expand.  A tax-free sum of &euro;40,000 is a lot of money over the period of the lease.  That should not be ignored.</p> <p>  I want to touch on some of the issues mentioned.  Commercial stamp duty at 2% yielded &euro;252 million in 2016.  At a rate of 6%, we are stating it will yield &euro;376 million, representing an increase of &euro;94 million based on an increase of 4%.</p></speech>

Large sales have been stripped out of the figures we have outlined in the statement on the previous years and we have taken an average over those years.  If there is a spike in very large sales, those figures have been excluded to take an average over two years.</p> <p>  I accept that there is an issue with the transitional arrangements, and I accept Deputy Burke's point about what happened in the past and Deputy Pearse Doherty's point about the individual.  I am pretty sure I was sitting beside the Minister when the point was raised about that individual.  I know the Minister passed the matter directly to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  We expect a response from him pretty quickly.</p> <p>  I will give an undertaking to the committee that we will try to resolve the issues in the transitional arrangement.  Deputy McGrath outlined two positions and he is correct.  We will consider them between now and Report Stage, if that is acceptable to the committee, to try to improve the present circumstances.  I am not giving any commitment that there will be any changes but we will consider it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#SS02400"><p>I am not an experienced politician but I back Deputy Burton up because I was informed a few days after the budget that an organisation in Dublin was told on the Friday before the budget.  That is what I heard and I claim that what I say is the truth.</p> <p>  In the line of what the Minister of State has said, we all need clarification on this transition period.  There is no point coming out of a meeting and not knowing what the Minister of State has said.  Is he saying that the 2% is applicable until the Finance Bill has been passed?  A clear message needs to go out from this committee.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about 850,000 sq. ft of office space in Dublin.  We are fully in favour of this for the big guy who can afford to pay big money, and we had tabled a later amendment to tackle the vultures who are crippling this country and ordinary people right around, it but it was ruled out of order.  However, that is for another day.  We are talking about the small business person who is trying to survive in every one of our constituencies.  It is like talking about the elephant and the mouse.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the time the country was in crisis.  Some parts of the country, thankfully, have made some recovery.  I am not being pessimistic but other parts have not made the same recovery.  The Minister of State has spoken about hotels and I compliment him on what he has done for them in the VAT rate.  We are reliant on the farming and small business communities to bring in revenue.  Will the Minister of State and the Department give those people breathing space?  Those amendments were tabled to make sure we hit the big operator who has plenty of money.  We are not talking about the people who can get millions of euro.  We are talking about what other Deputies outlined earlier, namely, people who have gone too far to get &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 more from a bank.  This is a problem in rural Ireland and this Bill has not been proofed for rural Ireland.</p> <p>  If the Minister of State talks to auctioneers around the country he will find that land deals are at risk because the extra &euro;10,000, &euro;12,000 or &euro;20,000 is not available.  That is very clear.  The Minister of State should read the articles the solicitors wrote.  It is not just me saying this.  We will stifle them.  I am not talking about the guy who can get &euro;40,000 worth of a tax rebate or allowance.  I am talking about a person who does not have enough land to rent to get &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000.  I am not talking about highfalutin operators but about normal people in normal parts of rural Ireland who have family farms.  That is what we are trying to protect, not the big operators.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#SS02500"><p>I do not know whether the Chairman would say I am an experienced politician but I do not think I am a fool, thanks be to God.  The Minister of State, however, must think that some of us are.  He said amendment No. 64 would cost &euro;162 million, and amendment No. 65 would cost &euro;105 million.  That comes to &euro;267 million, I think.  I agree with Deputy Burton and others.  We saw the economy crash and the trauma that ended in.  A big part of that was due to the errant stamp duty and where it went.  I thought we had learned a lesson from that but one of the primary pillars in this budget depends on stamp duty.  He might get it from the 800,000 sq. ft buildings here, and we welcome that, but where is the Government going to house the people who work in them?  That is a crisis facing everybody.  I know companies in Dublin that cannot get staff from England and abroad because they cannot afford to live here.  One hand does not seem to know what the other is doing.</p> <p>  It is a scandal that amendment No. 68 has been ruled out of order.  It proves there is a cabal.</p><p>There was an opportunity to level the playing field in terms of a distressed property being sold by financial institutions and vulture funds without being offered first to the borrower or family member at the same price as what is offered to the third party.  A 50% land tax could be incurred on that if we wanted it, with all the Paradise Papers and scandals that went on.  This was an opportunity to consider it and not rule the amendment out of order because of a charge being imposed on the people.  The people my backside.  We are trying to protect the people but it seems we are afraid to touch the fat cats.  Banks are selling distressed loans at 17% of value in some places, or 20% or perhaps up to 30%.  I have been in the Four Courts with unfortunate land owners or, even worse, householders or business people.</p><p> A fellow might have had a loan on a machine or tractor but these thugs are putting a tracer on the tractors so they can find out where they are and seize them.  They are sold at a distressed price without being offered to the borrower.  Many families, business owners and householders offered 70% of the loan value, with accountants backing up the figures and money put together by families, but that was not entertained because the Minister's friends in vulture funds wanted the money.  It is murky and dirty business.  We should be trying to balance the playing field and ensure there is some semblance of fairness.  These people do not get it in the courts, and that is for another day.  I am attending the High Court tomorrow with a family from Wexford, the Minister of State's county.  Perhaps he should be down there to watch what is going on.  It is a decent and well-respected family in County Wexford.</p><p> We have been told it will cost money but the Minister of State has no idea what it will cost.  These sales will not go through.  As clear as the nose on one's face, the auctioneers, solicitors and the hard-pressed young farmer or business person above all, who wants to get the loan for the transaction, will say that he or she cannot afford stamp duty.  These people will not know if they are tax compliant.  I do not know if there are representatives of the Revenue Commissioners here but we know well they will impose penalties and apply interest no matter what.  All we want is a level playing field and we tried that with our amendments.</p><p> I welcome the continuity of the fixed rate for a year.  I have no interest in the &euro;40,000 mentioned by the Minister of State.  They might all be big farmers in Wexford who lease the land.  I am talking about keeping family farms alive.  What the Minister of State suggests encourages people to go buy a yacht and get &euro;40,000 in tax relief.  I am talking about the unfortunate people trying to get the cow herd up, produce our milk and beef and bring about the wonderful exports we have.  We need to keep them functioning in the jaws of Brexit and the &euro;40,000 is no good to them.  My understanding is that is for the people who want to retire, whether they are young or old.</p><p> The Minister of State is not sure of his ground and he is certainly wrong in saying there is not a cabal.  There is a very strong and powerful organisation in this country that knew about this the Friday before the budget.  It is the same organisation that will not stand to represent the farmers who are being terrorised by the vulture funds in my county and that of the Minister of State, as well as Kilkenny and Waterford.  The racing syndicate is a vulture fund.  We can welcome what it does and we congratulate Mr. O'Brien last week.  It is not about him.  We welcome that it is a flagship industry but it is time to stop when it is amassing 15,000, 16,000 or 17,000 acres.  Without naming it, we know what organisation it is.  It knew about the budget and there is a cabal.  It is a dirty, rotten, stinking cabal and the little people do not matter.  One would think it would not be so after all that has gone on, especially with the Paradise Papers this week.  The Government will not control the banks that are selling the loans of people to the vulture funds.  It gives them a clap on the back.  I said before it is like rubbing butter on a fat sow's you-know-what.  That is what it is like and the Government will not tackle them.</p><p> There was an opportunity with these amendments but they have been rejected.  Worst of all is the rejection of amendment No. 68, which would have tried to level the playing field.  It would have tried to get something from these Oliver Cromwell-type vultures.  They are worse than Oliver Cromwell.  They are faceless and unaccountable to anybody.  They are destroying people's lives.  We have seen suicides and marriages breaking up as well as stress, trauma and cancer because of this.</p><p> There is a third force and I have been in the Minister of State's county trying to defend farmers, not far from where he lives.  People in this third force come in with balaclavas and Alsatians in the middle of the night, beating up people.  We know what happened to Mr. Henry, one of the Minister of State's constituents.  They beat him and his son, nearly killing them, on the side of the road.  There were no charges.  To make it worse, a garda who visited the scene two hours later let it go ahead.  We went to meet the superintendent and all we got was cheek.  How dare we act that way?  Shame on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for allowing that go on.  It is a dirty, rotten, stinking cabal and it can be called nothing else.  It will continue and the Government promotes the culture.  The Minister of State might see the Taoiseach's hashtags and nice pictures but we do not see him standing outside banks with his hashtags and camera.  He speaks about people on social welfare as cheats instead.  It is time the Government copped on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1510" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#YY00200"><p>I was talking about amendment No. 66.  The Minister said this amendment would result in a loss of &euro;32 million to the Exchequer if the stamp duty was reduced from 6% to 2%, which the amendment requests.  I am quite confused about that figure because if 4% represents &euro;32 million, it would suggest that there is approximately &euro;800 million in agricultural land sales in the country.</p><p>That appears to be a serious exaggeration.  Will the Minister clarify whether this figure relates solely to agricultural land and does not include land sold as sites for development and afforestation, categories which fall outside the definition of agricultural land?  I expect the figure would be much lower if it were based on agricultural land sales only.</p><p> Amendment No. 68, which relates to stamp duty, has been ruled out of order.  I have encountered a case involving a lady who was paying a mortgage on a commercial premises.  When the mortgage was bundled up with others to be sold she was refused permission to buy it at the same price for which it was subsequently sold to an investment fund.  This is one of the great injustices done to be people who have paid their mortgage, whether on commercial or residential property.  They are caught in a bind as their properties have been taken from them.  I fully support the proposal in the amendment proposed by Deputies Mattie McGrath and Fitzmaurice to force banks and other institutions in control of mortgages and commercial property loans to offer these loans for sale to individuals who would like to buy them back and continue to pay for and own their properties?</p></speech>

If it is of assistance to the Deputies, I will meet them once the Bill has been completed to discuss this matter further.  I understand the issue is being raised frequently in particular areas of the country and I am willing to meet the Deputies, as public representatives, to discuss it.  While I obviously have an understanding of the issue, Deputy Fitzmaurice flagged to me his view that the process he described had accelerated and the number of cases being raised with him had increased.  This issue has been causing difficulties for people for the past year or thereabouts.  However, given Deputy Fitzmaurice's point that the number of cases was increasing exponentially, I am interested in having a meeting on the issue, albeit only with public representatives, to ensure I understand precisely what is taking place and whether there are any specific issues I need to be aware of.  If the issue Deputy Fitzmaurice raises is similar to the one raised by Deputy Martin Kenny, both Deputies would be welcome to attend the meeting.</p></speech>

Last week, I drove to Belfast to meet people because it is not possible to meet the vulture funds.  Capita, a company which operates in different parts of Ireland, is dealing with the issue.  To cite one case with which I dealt, a man who is suffering from cancer had a loan on which &euro;33,000 was owed.  The figure had increased to &euro;40,000 when Capita bought the loan with interest.  When I proposed repaying &euro;25,000, Capita, in addition to refusing the offer, this morning informed me that it planned to proceed with a sale in the middle of negotiations.  This is the type of reckless behaviour in which the vulture funds are engaging.  While I thank the Minister for his offer of a meeting, the time has come to name these people in the D&aacute;il, where Deputies have protection, and highlight what they are doing because this practice will result in a suicide.</p><p>I concur with the point Deputy Kenny made.  The vulture funds bought these loans at a low rate.  While we do not have a problem with them making money, we do not want people to be screwed.  </p><p><b>Chairman:</b>If the Minister does not mind, I would like to add to this discussion because the issue of vulture funds, which I intended raising towards the end of the meeting, is highly relevant and has been raised a number of times in this debate.  The loans we are discussing are generally managed by regulated entities such as Capita.  The problem people are experiencing is that it is virtually impossible to meet representatives of these organisations and difficult to obtain documents from them if one is putting together a paper trail to try to find a resolution.  When one finally meets their representatives, the culture one experiences is shocking.</p><p>Young people in a bank have been conditioned to stonewall people and be stony-faced when meeting customers who are clearly experiencing mental distress as a result of the issue they are experiencing.  It is not the case that they cannot negotiate but that Capita, on behalf of the various funds, will not negotiate, which is truly shocking.  I have attended some of these meetings.  I have also attended the Master's Court on a number of occasions.  The most recent hearing I attended with a client had 138 cases listed for Allied Irish Banks.  The Master of the High Court extended the time for dealing with these cases on foot of a request to do so by the banks.  This only adds further anxiety and trauma to an already wrecked family.  One must see this to believe it. </p><p>The same circumstances prevail in the registrar's court.  Unfortunately, the banks are facilitating this practice because it suits them to do so.  AIB and Bank of Ireland are serious offenders in this regard.  I raised with the Minister a case involving the sale next Saturday of properties owned by the Morrissey family, which tells us everything we need to know.  The family has sufficient funds outside AIB to purchase the properties in question.  They also have a track record going back 100 years and are working a number of quarries.  The families of approximately 100 families rely on them.  Once the properties go to a public auction, the cartel in quarrying, namely, the three big powers in the quarrying game, will buy the quarries and close them down.  As a result, the cost to local authorities of road construction and housing will shoot up because it is controlled by three companies.  I do not say this lightly but because I have been observing this process in this committee for a long time. </p><p>In my correspondence with the Minister, I asked him to stop the sale of the Morrissey properties from proceeding and allow the family to buy them back at the value the banks say they are worth.  This would protect competition in the marketplace, 100 jobs and the services and goods supplied into the quarries in question.  That is all I am asking.  I am not asking anyone to show favouritism but simply to recognise that there is a reckless cartel in the banks and vulture funds and among the large companies that are wrecking the lives of individuals. </p><p>This committee tried on more than one occasion to have various funds - the main players - appear before us to explain how they operate and what they do.  They refused point blank to do so.  I have dealt with these funds face to face and I am shocked by them.  Capita, a regulated entity which is supposed to act properly, is even worse than the vulture funds.  I am interested in hearing from Deputies Fitzmaurice and Mattie McGrath and perhaps other Deputies who have attended these meetings.</p><p>It is truly shocking that this bad culture of banking has been handed on intact to the next generation of young bankers.  The country is suffering immensely for this reason.  I am not being extreme about this or taking it to the edge.  However, I have seen this often and, as a public representative, I find it disturbing when my efforts to do something about it in the Oireachtas fail.  It was for this reason that I contacted the Minister directly on the Morrissey case.</p><p>That is a real example of what is happening.  People appeal - they do not do so lightly - to individuals like me and the Minister to intervene.  As we own the bank, the sale should be stalled while negotiations are ongoing.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice has made a valid point.  As negotiations are ongoing with Capita, on behalf of the vulture funds, such institutions escalate their efforts to sell properties to put pressure on the individual or individuals concerned.</p><p> I shall tell the Minister what I said in the D&aacute;il.  I shall not say it in an argumentative manner but will simply outline the facts.  I sat in front of three representatives of Capita with the man at the centre of this case.  Both he and his family are completely and utterly broken.  They are suffering a terrible mental illness because of it.  All the man can do is give Capita permission to sell every piece of property he owns.  When the representatives asked him about the residual debt, he said he could not do anything about it because he did not have any money.  Then a young girl seated behind the desk reached over and said to him: "I want you to ask your father, mother, brothers, sisters, community and credit union, but we want money, money, money."  That is exactly the way she said it and I found it horrific listening to her.  </p><p> I shall finish by saying I am disturbed by what the banks are doing and by what has happened between AIB and Morrissey's.  I am sorry if I went on a little, but I had outline what was truly happening.  It had to be said.</p></speech>

I was almost finished when we broke.  </p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for clarifying what happens on an hourly, daily, nightly and weekly basis.  I have received telephone calls throughout the night about such matters.  If the Minister does not know that this is true, I do not know where he is living and it is a case of hear no evil, speak no evil and see no evil.  I can attest to the fact that this is happening and it is downright evil.</p> <p>  About receivers, I know of a well respected family in the Minister of State's county who are having an unmerciful time in trying to sell everything.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice and I have tabled amendment No. 68 which, unfortunately, has been ruled out of order.  It would afford individuals, like the people I have mentioned - I know the business - an opportunity to be offered the property at the price it was offered for sale to a third party.  The family in question have not been given an opportunity to buy back their business to keep it going and retain 100 jobs in the area.  They have not been afforded an opportunity to keep their pride, dignity and mental health.  The amendment has been ruled out or order.  It seeks to ensure that when a property is sold for 30% of its value or even less, an appropriate charge would be applied.  In this case the financial institution involved was offered between 70% and 80% of the asking price for the property, but it refused to sell it back to the original owners.  It is a controlled takeover, which is totally unacceptable.  I commented on this matter earlier when the Minister of State was present.  Receiverships are happening.  For proof all one needs to do is go to the courts where receiverships are registered or to the High Court tomorrow morning where one will be able to witness the case I have mentioned, with hundreds of others, for whom there is no refuge in the courts - none.</p></speech>

In the future, when such meetings are being arranged, representatives of the funds, particularly those that are regulated, should be forced to come before this committee to ensure proper accountability and transparency.  We have tried to get them to come here, but they have refused do so, yet they have access to officials in the Department of Finance.  At some stage a balance must be struck between access and accountability.</p></speech>

This section is anti-rural.  I have outlined the issue already.  I appreciate that the Minister of State rather than the Minister was present for the discussion, but we have not received clarification around the ambiguity concerning the matter to which Deputies Burke, Martin Kenny and Michael McGrath referred, namely, people who have paid a deposit and are waiting to conclude the deal.  According to Deputy Burke, people must pay money that they do not have to get money back.  There needs to be clarification of what the situation has been since the night the financial resolutions were passed in the D&aacute;il.  There is a hold-up in property everywhere.  People are waiting to see whether the Government will show common sense by allowing for 2% in respect of people buying small businesses, farms or land up to a certain threshold.  In light of the vote, that will not happen, but I would like clarification.</p></speech>

Before we adjourned, the Minister of State indicated in general terms that he was minded to revert to us with some work on this area and to re-examine the matter.  What does that indication mean?

The first relates to filing a return, paying stamp duty at 6%, receiving a stamp certificate and, on enactment of the Finance Bill, a refund being put in place.  The second relates to filing a return through the e-stamping system and paying the stamp duty at approximately 2%, in which case a stamp duty certificate will not be issued.  On enactment of the Finance Bill, Revenue will publish information on how a postponed stamp certificate can be obtained.  We will discuss this matter further with the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  I was hoping that the announcement of the second measure would address the difficulties that had been caused.  The Revenue Commissioners have since informed me that neither interest nor penalties will be charged across the period during which this matter will be addressed.  This is a further recognition of the issue by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

I want to inform members of them now.  I believe some Deputies have been aware of the second measure because that has been communicated to individuals who have been dealing with the issue.  The Revenue Commissioners have since informed me that interest or penalties will not be charged across the period in which this has been dealt with.  I expect the Revenue Commissioners will amend their own communication accordingly to reflect that.</p></speech>

There is a problem with getting money from the banks if a person does not have the certificate.  Will the Minister address that situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-09a.1545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1369" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110900002#CCC00300"><p>I made the point earlier that the second option that the Revenue Commissioners have issued is not workable in the 44 day period for stamping the document.  This is because if a person is relying on the banks to finance the purchase of the property and is trying to draw down the finance to execute the sale and finish it off, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, will not process the transfer, and the banks require this to be processed, if that person does not have a stamped certificate.  The option is of little value.</p></speech>

Otherwise there will be issues for people who are caught midstream between now and then.  While Revenue may not levy any interest, interest could arise in commercial transactions with a delay of a couple of months.</p></speech>

I am also well aware of the reaction from owners and those who were involved in seeking to purchase more agricultural land.  At different stages in the aftermath of dealing with this matter, I have put in place measures to try to deal with some of these issues.  I did so in respect of consanguinity.  I know that has not met every need there is, but I did put the measure in place to try to deal with the issue in ensuring that farm purchases could stay within the family to facilitate the intergenerational transfer of land.</p> <p>  The next  matter that was then raised with me were issues that were occurring for transactions that were mid-flow.  The Revenue Commissioners and I have been seeking to respond to the issue.  This has led to the different options emerging.  As Deputy Burke and others are raising a matter with the second option, I will raise the issue again with the Revenue Commissioners.  I will see whether there is a way of engaging with the authority that would deal with it.  I am very reluctant, and I do not know if it is technically possible, to go down the path of further financial resolutions in respect of the budget because of where we are with the Finance Bill, and it may not be possible to do so, but I will continue to look at any measure I can to deal with families who have been affected by this policy move.  I will respond well before we get to Report Stage to the matter that Deputy Burke has now raised.</p></speech>

The sooner this is sorted out and something is clearly put in place in which people can have confidence, the better, as it is really what is necessary.  The impression we got from the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, was that he would come back with something sometime.  It needs to be something very solid very fast.  That is really the issue.</p> <p>  I have another point which I referred to when I spoke on amendment No. 66, which refers to agricultural land sales.  It is suggested that &euro;32 million will be lost as a result of reducing the proposed 6% tax to 2%, which suggests that there is &euro;800 million in land sales.  I am asking the question again.  Does the figure of &euro;32 million include land other than agricultural land, for example, sites, development land, and all of that?  If it does, it is a considerably smaller figure we are talking bout if the amendment is passed.</p></speech>

I will come back to him and find the base off which the figure was calculated.  On his earlier point, I know that Deputy Kenny opposes what I have done even though it was contained in the Sinn F&eacute;in pre-election budget.</p></speech>

A number of days after that, as the issue of transitionary mechanisms began to emerge, the Revenue Commissioners, principally, although I tried to play a role in it too, dealt with the different mechanisms that we could provide to deal with the matter.  If I can make progress on the matter imminently, I will do it.  However, I cannot tell the Deputy when because I do not know if I can do it, but I have approached every other matter and tried to make progress on them in good faith.  I will do the same here.</p> <p>  I have now been conclusively informed that I will not be in a position to bring forward a further financial resolution on the matter.</p></speech>

Some farmers might have land ten, 20 or 30 miles away from the principal farm, perhaps through marriage or getting land from an aunt or an uncle.  We would call them farms that are separated.  In the interest of ensuring that they would not be travelling all over the country, there was stamp duty relief on the purchase of land near the principal farm and a farmer could sell land that was farther away to buy land nearer the home farm.  From my understanding of this stamp duty relief, but I am open to correction and this is the reason I have tabled the amendment in this way, this relief was removed last December.  In the west, people have parcels of land that were separated, and in fairness the relief to allow the farmer to consolidate his holding was a well-thought-out exemption.  I wish to ensure that this stamp duty relief is retained and that is the reason I tabled this amendment.</p></speech>

The issue I am highlighting is the need to extend the existing exemption from capital gains tax that applies to certain farm restructuring transactions to the stamp duty that would apply to such transactions.  In other words, the exemption that already applies to CGT would also apply in respect of stamp duty for farm restructuring.  I, along with my colleagues, Deputies Jackie Cahill and Charlie McConalogue, attended a meeting with the Department of Finance and Revenue on this issue to make the case and to explain where we are coming from.  The Minister will be aware of the existing relief, section 604B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, in respect of farm restructuring and which has to be certified by Teagasc.  It will be in place up to the end of 2019, and provided that certain strict conditions are met involving the sale and purchase of land to consolidate a farm holding, there is an exemption from CGT on the sale portion.  We are advocating that there would be a consistency of policy and that equally stamp duty should not apply to the transaction, on either the sale side or the purchase side.</p><p>I framed it in the form of a report but I hope that we can get an amendment on Report Stage to put what we are looking for into effect.  </p></speech>

The reason is obvious.  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned that it happened in the west, but it happens in most counties where there are smaller, fragmented land holdings.  The RSA had to withdraw its most recent diktat on the distance that certain tractors may travel because farms are fragmented.  Land holdings can be 20 or 30 miles away from each other.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  It was a good enough, well thought-out scheme and it needs to be continued.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael McGrath&rsquo;s amendment No. 76 calls for a report into the possible extension of the current CGT relief for farm restructuring to encompass stamp duty also.</p> <p>  There was a stand-alone stamp duty relief that previously operated for the consolidation of farms.  Section 81C of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 allowed a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she sold and purchased land, in order to consolidate his or her holding, where both the sale and purchase occurred within 18 months of each other.  The relief applied provided Teagasc had issued the farmer with a consolidation certificate in respect of the sale and purchase.</p> <p>  Deputy McGrath has raised this matter with me and I also engaged with his colleagues.  I also acknowledge the interest in this among other colleagues, including Opposition Members and Deputies Peter Burke and Pat Deering.   I intend to bring forward a Report Stage amendment to the Finance Bill to provide a stamp duty relief in circumstances where similar conditions would apply. </p> <p>  Capital Gains Tax Relief for Farm Restructuring is approved under the agricultural block exemption regulation 2014-2020, Commission Regulation No 702/2014.  It may be the case that a measure to provide a stamp duty relief in circumstances where the conditions similar to those applying to the CGT farm restructuring relief or the previous stamp duty relief have been met will need to obtain similar state aid approval.  It may therefore be necessary to provide that a stamp duty relief for farm consolidation transactions is subject to a commencement order.  It is a matter of which I am aware, several colleagues have raised it with me and I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage, and as such perhaps in the circumstances the Deputies may wish to withdraw their amendments Nos. 67 and 76.</p></speech>

It was an honest attempt to deal with some of the issues which the Chairman addressed not long ago.  We are not dealing with it.  The banks have run amok and they are engaged in daylight robbery.  The Taoiseach makes strong expressions to convey his angst.  Yesterday I asked him if the Minister for Finance had attended the EGM of AIB last week, and he was not able to tell me, maybe the Minister will tell me here.</p> <p>  The culture of "softly softly" is still there.  The Minister himself said that all is not well there.  We know that.  This amendment was an effort to do two things.  Against the vulture funds and our home-grown banks, and we now have a home-grown Tipperary vulture fund which is amassing land, this was to try to give a reasonable chance to the owners of distressed loans, whether in the cases of property, farms, family homes, buy-to-let or whatever, these were people who got up in the mornings, borrowed money, had a business and then the crash happened, which was not their fault. </p> <p>   Like the Chairman, I voted for that bank guarantee, and what did we get for it only two fingers from every hand; if there were three hands we would get two fingers from each of them the whole time.  We as a Parliament encounter this but so do the people the banks are dealing with.  We are talking about farms, households and machinery necessary to carry out business, where the debt was sold on for 17% of the value.  There were often many payments made on the machinery, some of which was old.  I referred to a man in Wexford who had been beaten up by thugs - his tractor was ten years old and worth about &euro;12,000.  Deputy Fitzmaurice and I put forward this amendment to see if we could get some respect and put some manners on these people so that, where they sold a distressed loan to a vulture fund, they would first have had to have offered the same conditions to the person to whom the loan was made - whether it was for a house, tractor, shop, or the farm.  That is not unreasonable.  What are we doing?  We are terrorising our own people and crushing them into ground to give away loans to foreign - and now home-grown - vulture companies.  </p> <p>  This was also a way of bringing in revenue.  It beggars belief that loans can be sold off for that kind of money.  We know what we paid to Europe for the money.  They told us it was a bailout but it was a clean out.  Here was an opportunity to stop this in its tracks and bring valuable revenue into State coffers, to allow a modicum of civilised living in rural and urban Ireland for families who will end up in hospitals, whether they are general or psychiatric.  A wasteland is being created, and for what purpose?  It is to line the pockets of fat cats and vultures.  I cannot understand it and I will not understand it, nor will any reasonable observer.  No one will accept it.  I do not like using the word but it is the rape of our own people and land for which we fought dearly.  My late father fought in the War of Independence as did many others to free our country, and for what purpose?  To be owned by these cartels and cabals and vulture funds.  That is what is happening and I am appalled that the Minister would not listen to our suggestion in the Rural Independent Group's pre-budget submission to introduce a land tax on farms of over 750 acres because that covers the vast majority of ordinary farmers.  People with holdings above that are not interested in their neighbours, parish or community, the just want to amass large tracts.  It happened recently in Wicklow where another stud bought a farm of land.</p><p>The stud industry is great.  I have nothing against it.  All we wanted was a level playing field or some semblance of one, but the Government failed to do that in the budget.</p></speech>

I note and understand amendment No. 68 has been ruled out of order because a member of the Opposition cannot raise a tax on a person, but a company is not a person.  We will redraft the amendment before Report Stage.</p> <p>  The Government has a large shareholding in Allied Irish Banks, AIB.  I understand AIB proposes to sell loans worth up to &euro;3.5 billion to vulture funds.  I call on the Minister not to allow that to happen.  It is only at the eleventh hour and the 59th minute that all of us here have finally got that people are in desperate need.  We need to look at the iCare model, in conjunction with NAMA, to facilitate people to remain in their homes.  Once a person's home is repossessed, his or her record is blackened forever.  There are many people who borrowed &euro;200,000 for whom the repayments are a stretch too far but they would be able to meet the repayments on a &euro;130,000 loan.  On the proposed sale by AIB of loans worth approximately &euro;3.5 billion, it is very important that the Minister keep on eye on the process.</p></speech>

When that market went belly up, the banks seized many of these businesses, many of which were still operational and solvent.  They became the fall-guy for what had happened, in spite of the fact that the banks were as culpable as the borrowers in terms of the attractiveness of the deals offered by them.  When everything went wrong, they walked away scot-free, leaving individuals with the problem.  There are many people whose businesses which they had built up in their communities over many years and which remained solvent were seized and sold by the banks.  That was wrong.  This venue is perhaps a calmer environment than the D&aacute;il Chamber in which to plead with the Minister to do something to protect the businesses and communities that are suffering as a consequence of what is happening every day in the Commercial Court, the Master of which recently said that if AIB did not exist, that court would be out of business.  It is dragging people through the courts every day.  It is not right.  There is the right and the left in politics, but there is also right and wrong.  This is not right; it is absolutely wrong.</p></speech>

I referenced the scheme on the night of the budget.  The refund will be subject to certain conditions, including a requirement that developers commence developments within 30 months of the land purchase.  This is consistent with one of the objectives of the stamp duty rate increase, to achieve a rebalancing of activity from non-residential commercial construction activity in favour of residential activity.  I will also be presenting an amendment on Report Stage designed to provide for certain anti-avoidance measures in connection with the upward adjustment to the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property.</p> <p>  I did not attend the EGM last week but an official of my Department did.</p></speech>

The Companies Act 2014 which was passed in June 2015 consolidated and amended all existing company law legislation.  It brought major changes to company structures and streamlined procedures for the merger of companies.  Most importantly, in terms of amendments being proposed, Chapter 3 of Part 9 of the Act provides for a statutory procedure that allows two Irish private companies to merge in order that the assets and liabilities of one transfer by operation of law to the other after which the former company, known as the transferor, is automatically dissolved without having to be liquidated.  However, a merger can also involve a public limited company.  Following publication of the Bill, it was noted that the references to the Companies Act 2014 were not sufficient to encompass mergers or divisions involving public limited companies.

However, some EU member states have negotiated a tax agreement with Taiwan.  My Department, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Revenue Commissioners, examined whether an agreement with equivalent effect to a tax agreement with Taiwan might be concluded in a manner consistent with our foreign policy.  In the Finance Act 2015 an amendment was made to section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to allow for agreements to be made with non-governmental entities such as Taiwan.  This paved the way legally to concluding an agreement.  Discussions on the next steps to be taken are ongoing with a view to identifying an approach that is acceptable to both countries.  There have as yet not been formal negotiations between Irish officials and representatives of Taiwan.</p></speech>
