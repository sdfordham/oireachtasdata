Apologies have been received from Deputies O'Connell and Catherine Murphy.  We will deal with the business of the committee in the afternoon as we want to deal with the Higher Education Authority, University College Cork and Cork Institute of Technology this morning.</p><p>As I mentioned, we are dealing with the financial statements for 2016 for the Higher Education Authority, University College Cork and Cork Institute of Technology.  Today we are returning to matters in the third level sector on which we reported in July last year.  We are joined today from Higher Education Authority, HEA, by Dr. Graham Love, chief executive, as well as Ms Sheena Duffy, Mr. Stewart Roche, Mr. Tim Conlon and Mr. Neil McDermott.  From the Department we have Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary, and Mr. Tony Gaynor.  From University College Cork, UCC, we are joined by Professor Patrick O&rsquo;Shea, president, and by Mr. Diarmuid Collins and Mr. Cormac McSweeney.  From Cork Institute of Technology we are joined by Dr. Barry O'Connor, president, and Mr. Paul Gallagher, Mr. John A. McCarthy, Ms Ellen Crowley and Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Byrne.  They are all very welcome to today's meeting.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off or into aeroplane mode, as putting them on silent mode is not adequate and they will still interfere with the recording system in the Oireachtas.  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Orders that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.  We will first take a short opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#H00200"><p>The Higher Education Authority is the statutory planning and policy development body for higher education and research in Ireland.  In addition, it is the primary funding authority for Irish universities, institutes of technology, teacher training colleges and a number of other designated education bodies.  Approximately 90% of the HEA's income in 2016 came directly from Vote 26, Education and Skills, with the balance, largely consisting of research funding, from Vote 32, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The HEA had gross expenditure of &euro;1.15 billion in 2016.  The bulk of this comprised grants to higher education bodies for specified purposes, including current spending, research, and capital project funding.  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the HEA's 2016 financial statements.</p> <p>  In 2015 and 2016, UCC recognised total income of &euro;346 million.  The university reported a modest surplus for the year of &euro;562,000.  As in prior years, my audit opinion in respect of the UCC financial statements was qualified in respect of the recognition of a portion of the future pension funding receivable from the State.  The root of the issue is that UCC awards professional added years for pension purposes to certain academic staff members on a different basis to that approved by the Ministers for Education and Skills and Finance under relevant legislation enacted in 2009.  As at 30 September 2016, the university was in disagreement with the Department of Education and Skills as to where responsibility lies for pension liabilities relating to transferred-in service.  The university estimated the total future cost of the disputed pension benefits at &euro;15.7 million and included this amount in its deferred pension funding asset.  I concluded that the recognition of the &euro;15.7 million asset as at the end of September 2016 was not in accordance with applicable accounting standards because of the disagreement with the Department at that date.</p><p>An agreement was subsequently reached between the university and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on shared funding of the disputed future liabilities.  This will be reflected in future financial statements.</p><p> The audit certificate draws attention to the non-consolidation of the results of Cork University Foundation DAC on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the university.  On 30 September 2016 the foundation had accumulated reserves of &euro;4.1 million.  Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements provides information on transactions between the university and the foundation.  Members will recall that the university has recently informed the committee of its intention to provide a full set of the foundation's financial statements, with the consolidated financial statements in future years.</p><p> The audit certificate also draws attention to disclosures in the university's statement of governance and internal control of instances of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  Reported non-compliant procurement to the value of &euro;4.4 million comprised &euro;3.9 million of spending identified by the university as being non-compliant and a further &euro;500,000 identified through audit testing.</p><p> The financial statements for Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, for the year ending 31 August 2016 indicate that consolidated income for the year amounted to nearly &euro;100 million.  State grant funding accounted for over &euro;38 million of this figure.  The other major sources of income were tuition fees and research grants.  Expenditure in the year was just over &euro;99 million, nearly 70% of which was accounted for by staff costs.  The net result for the year was a surplus of &euro;721,000.  Members will recall that there are two public private partnership, PPP, arrangements in place for buildings used by Cork Institute of Technology, namely, the Cork School of Music and the National Maritime College of Ireland.  The annual payments made to the two PPP companies are a direct charge on Vote 26.  They do not pass through the accounts of CIT.</p><p> My audit opinion for 2015-16 was unqualified.  However, the audit certificate draws attention to the fact that the institute did not provide for accrued pension liabilities under either the single public service pension scheme or the education sector superannuation scheme 2015.  The same was true of all other institutes of technology for 2015-16.  The audit certificate also notes that the Department of Education and Skills sought legal advice on the matter.  In October 2017 my office wrote to the presidents of all of the institutes of technology recommending that they commence accounting for pension liabilities in their financial statements for 2016-17.  I understand the Technological Higher Education Association, the representative body for institutes of technology, has procured the services of an actuary to carry out the necessary calculations.  It is expected that all 2016-17 financial statements will account in full for pension liabilities.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Love, chief executive of the HEA, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Graham Love" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#J00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Tim Conlon, interim head of system development and performance management; Ms Sheena Duffy, interim head of system funding and governance; and Mr. Stewart Roche, management accountant.</p> <p>  Every year the Higher Education Authority, HEA, allocates and distributes over &euro;1 billion in funding across a range of funding streams to the higher education sector.  As this is a major responsibility for an agency likes ours, I am happy to note that the HEA's financial statements for 2016 were signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2017 with no issues arising.  Our draft 2017 statements have also recently been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we are addressing follow-up queries.  Today the committee will also discuss CIT's and UCC's financial statements.  Our briefing paper addresses several issues related to these two institutions.  I will be happy to provide further details of the HEA's engagement on these matters.  The briefing paper also sets out other developments related to the higher education sector that are of interest to the committee.</p> <p>  The HEA continues to monitor University of Limerick's implementation of the recommendations arising from the Thorn report.  It also engages with the university on how it is demonstrating to its staff, students, stakeholders and wider community its commitment to learning from the report and its findings.  The HEA continues to fulfil its governance role through its rolling governance reviews.  The first such review dealt with procurement and resulted in positive engagement with the sector, as well as key stakeholders such as the Office of Government Procurement and the Education Procurement Service.  It has culminated in annual higher education procurement summits, most recently last month, and the introduction of a corporate procurement plan pack for institutions to adapt.</p> <p>  The second review dealt with intellectual property policies and arose directly from the engagement of the Committee of Public Accounts with the HEA and the higher education sector.  This has been a valuable exercise, with important recommendations being implemented.  This year's rolling reviews will focus on staff remuneration and benefits, as well as student non-progression.</p> <p>  In 2017 the committee had a productive engagement with the higher education sector on the timeliness of financial reporting.  A clear message was sent to the HEA and the institutions we fund on the importance of preparing and submitting financial statements promptly.  Previous delays inevitably had a knock-on effect.  However, the HEA notes the improvements made, as reflected in the Comptroller and Auditor General's most recent report on public sector financial reporting.  I again acknowledge the constructive engagement we have had with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on these matters.</p> <p>  Since the HEA last appeared before the committee there have been several important developments in the higher education sector.  On an operational level, the review of the funding model for higher education institutions was published.  It will introduce important changes to the way in which the HEA allocates funding and seeks to incentivise institutions to target growth areas such as STEM subjects, lifelong, part-time and flexible learning.  It also proposes the introduction of a financial penalty for serious breaches of governance by institutions.</p> <p>  On a wider strategic level, earlier this year the system performance framework for the period 2018 to 2020 was launched, with its focus on six key system objectives, ranging from meeting Ireland's skills requirements, improving equality of opportunity and improvements in governance.  A key element is the next cycle of strategic dialogue with higher education institutions, whereby institutions' performance will be measured against these key objectives for the higher education system.</p> <p>  This year has seen the passing into law of the technological universities legalisation.  This is an exciting step in the future of higher education which builds on the strengths and original missions of institutes of technology and also enhances their regional, national and international impact.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in its scrutiny of higher education matters.  Last year's meetings with the HEA and institutions were robust and frank but also useful in bringing matters to the fore.  The HEA sees the committee not only, rightly, as a watchdog but also a partner in improving governance and accountability in the higher education sector.  This is a relationship that I, as chief executive of the HEA, believe it is important to continue to develop.</p></speech>

We had a late start and I understand they have commitments in the afternoon.  They can refer to them, if they so wish during the session.

Will Dr. Love explain the HEA's service level agreement with the Department of Education and Skills, what it entails and what responsibilities in terms of governance come with it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Graham Love" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#J00600"><p>We have an annual service level agreement with the Department of Education and Skills, the essential element of which is our annual work plan, with its work streams, deliverables, etc, approved by the board.</p><p>That forms the core chapter.  Then, sitting on top of that is the relationship that defines how we relate to each other, that is, the Department and the HEA, the various responsibilities that sit under that and the meetings that we have to check on the progress on the work plan.  There are meetings a number of times a year between me and my team and Mr. William Beausang and his team, or, previously, Ms Mary Doyle, to track progress on the implementation of that work plan and other issues that are arising in the sphere of higher education.</p></speech>

Is that part of the service level agreement?</p></speech>

We then sit as a layer on top of that in our oversight role with regard to those institutions.  Yes, matters do come up throughout the course of the year.  We have just discussed in the private session earlier matters that would be part of that.  That is the normal run of business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K00400"><p>I asked that because of the matters that came up that we discussed earlier.  Must the HEA wait every year for the annual report from each institution before it can intervene if there is anything that the HEA needs to get involved in or is it done on an ongoing basis during the year?</p></speech>

We have a number of formal engagements each year and then, if matters require it, we engage directly on specific items.</p></speech>

On UCC first, is this &euro;15.7 million in shared funding the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a shortfall of moneys that is not there to cover future pension liabilities?  My understanding of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is that it will be a shared function now of both UCC and the taxpayer.  Can someone answer me that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Diarmuid Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K00700"><p>I will take that one.  Deputy Aylward may recall last year a similar issue was raised.  In the 2015 accounts, as part of our disclosure note when we were here back then, the Deputy may recall that we were taking a challenge against the State for the element of the liability that was in dispute.  During 2016-17, the matter was resolved.  When it comes to the &euro;15.7 million, there is now an agreed sharing of that liability between the State and the university.  We anticipate that when we are preparing the 2017 accounts - this is now our assumption as it will all be assessed and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General - we anticipate that the qualification in the accounts, as a result of that agreement between the HEA representing the State and the university, will now lapse and fall away because there is now an agreed funding model in place between the university and the HEA on how that element of pension will be funded into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K00800"><p>Is this a 50:50 split?</p></speech>

There are other elements of it around an ongoing adjustment to the university's overall base funding.  The amount will move every year.  As people retire, the liability will fall.  As there is an actuarial assessment, the overall liability will change every year as we go through the wind-down of those staff when they retire.  Essentially, overall it is 50:50 on the funding of the pension liability, the future lump sums for those people and pensions, and an element of an increase in the overall base funding for the university.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K01000"><p>Why must the State come in with 50% and why is UCC not able to fund its own pensions?  Why is the State, which is basically taxpayers' money, being used to subsidise pension funding?  Why is UCC not able to carry its own weight and fund its own pensions?  I want to hear Mr. Collins' view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Diarmuid Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K01100"><p>I will tell the Deputy about that.  Back in 2010, the university, for these staff, had the liability and the asset.  We had both the liability to pay lump sums and pensions and we had the asset.  In 2010, the five universities that had that scheme transferred their pension asset of &euro;1.2 billion to the State and with that came a commitment that when those people retired, the liability going with that asset would be underpinned by a State asset - if the university gave away the money, the State would pay for that.</p> <p>  When the people retired, there was a dispute subsequently about elements of added years.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out in his opening statement how added years were assessed by the State differed from how the pension scheme, which was underpinned by statute, had operated in UCC and the commitment was given that people's entitlements would be honoured in return for the transfer of the asset.  We had an assessment, and a view, that it was the State's liability to fund those people given that it took the fund.  The State disputed that but, as we have said in the answer to the first part of the question, we have reached agreement on that.  There is now a sharing accepted between both the State and the university on how that element of the liability is funded in future.</p></speech>

However, as a result of the single pension scheme, there are new requirements in terms of how future liabilities are calculated and where they are provided.  We are just working through, with the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General, how we incorporate that into our accounts.

It is a separate legal entity.  It is not part of the university and it is not consolidated with the financial statements.  We gave a commitment last year, because a similar matter arose as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's certification, that we would append those accounts going forward in order that when the accounts are laid before the Oireachtas they will have attached to them the financial statements for the Cork University Foundation.</p> <p>  In our president's briefing papers that we sent in last week, we have said that we are looking at a review of the foundation and the governance model and, pending that review, it may well change the accounting of the foundation.  I do not want to predict the outcome of it but were it to be no longer a separate legal entity, it would then be consolidated as part of the university itself.  For now, it is a separate entity.  It does what it does and supports the university.  Because it is a separate entity, it is disclosed in the accounts, under FRS 8, as a relationship under our disclosure note 31, but it is appended and it is not part of the consolidation.  Because of that, it is referenced as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's overall certification drawing attention to the matter that we have it.  It is not consolidated but it is a separate entity.</p></speech>

We are the only university in the country with ISO 9001 certification for procurement.  That indicates we are totally compliant with EU directives.  Although we are compliant with these directives, the audit identifies approximately 1.25% - pertaining to 35 suppliers and a value of &euro;4.4 million - that was viewed as being non-compliant with the guidelines.  We can explain that.  One item was related to co-funding of sectoral purchasing arrangements.  The university is a partner to another lead entity, which itself procured the service in a fully compliant manner.  The university, through clerical error, inadvertently identified that as being non-compliant when in fact it was.  That information has been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  Additionally, there are extensions of service contracts, particularly related to ICT matters, that were originally awarded competitively but where the competitive contract has expired.  We have not been able to re-compete them because we are working on the basis of a shared-services model with the HEA.  That is still in operation so we have to continue with the existing contracts until there is agreement from the HEA as to which types of contracts and vendors we should opt for.</p> <p>  There is also emergency expenditure.  I refer to priority issues related to blocked drains, safety issues and so on in respect of which we have an emergency arrangement to procure services on a short-term basis.  The university endeavours at all times to ensure it is compliant with public procurement policy.  It engages with the Office of Government Procurement, where appropriate.

The libraries are engaging in HEAnet, for example.  That is done through one institution but we all effectively piggyback on the contract that was properly tendered for by that institution.  Therefore, we are not non-compliant.  The contract was procured properly by one institution on behalf of the sector.  Inadvertently, through clerical error, it was recorded as being non-compliant.<br/><br/>With regard to the extension of service contracts, we have proprietary systems with certain providers.  The contracts might have lapsed but one would be using those providers to do one&rsquo;s maintenance.  As the president said, there is a move towards a shared-services model in ICT.  We were working with the HEA on that.  One would not be going back out to engage in a procurement exercise regarding the contracts until that particular review is completed.  It is not a matter of sweet deals <i>per se</i>; there are genuine reasons.</p></speech>

Other providers charge a higher weekly rental and charge for a longer period.  We are trying to help the students as best we can and we understand they are under pressure.

InfiniLED was a company spun out of the Tyndall National Research Institute.  It was spun out by the university.  As part of that spin-out, which happened in 2016, we got 15% equity for our share of the intellectual property going into the company.  It was sold subsequently and purchased by Oculus, which is owned by Facebook.  The company was bought for &euro;30 million and, because of our shareholding, which had been slightly diluted to about 12.5%, the university got a share of the &euro;30 million in income.</p></speech>

A contributing factor is that we made a surplus in the year in question.  It was an element of why we made a surplus in 2015-16.  We got about &euro;1.6 million in that year.  The Deputy is correct in that there is an element held in escrow pending performance of the technology.  We gave warranties indicating that what was spun out would deliver what it said it would deliver.  The 18 months are now up, in 2018.  Therefore, there remains another &euro;800,000 to come into the university this year.  We got money in 2016, and 18 months later, this year, we are to get money.  It is part of national policy and the document Putting Public Research to Work for Ireland, which was launched by the Minister in 2015.</p></speech>

I genuinely do not want to know because I do not think that would be fair.  It is &euro;36,000 per year to pay for rent for the president.  To the students and the public that might seem strange, but I think I have set it in the right context.</p> <p>  I wish to make a comment to UCC.  We received its letter on the Opera House, and I know the Chairman has a similar opinion to me.  The decision to do a deal with the Opera House was part of our findings with regard to the committee's interim report into the issue of non-taxpayer revenue being isolated as if it were a revenue in itself.  The Committee of Public Accounts has stated quite clearly we do not buy that line.  This is for all colleges, universities and third level institutes.</p> <p>  We have gone back and forward with UCC on number of occasions.  The cost of &euro;500,000 was stated as non-taxpayer revenue and this is reaffirmed in the letter, which states an own source of university income is supporting the partnership.  It is not.  Let us kill this right now for once and for all.  It is not a distinguishable income.  It all goes into the pot and the taxpayer is proportionately paying for signage over the Opera House.  Our question is whether we feel this is a good use of public money.  Personally, I do not think so.  An alliance with Cork Opera House yes, but not paying for signage over it.  Please do not ever write back again and state what was said here and repeat it in the press because we do not accept it.  We cannot be any clearer.  The college can argue it and that is fine, but with regard to what we have decided here, this is a use of taxpayers' money.  If the college did not have the taxpayers' money in the first place it would not be in a position to do it and that is obvious.  Let us nail that.  That goes for all third level institutions, and UCC is not unique to be fair to it.  This is just a comment and I do not want an answer.</p> <p>  I want to get onto the purchase of Grand Parade in Cork by CIT.  When we were here before discussing this we were told it paid &euro;1.25 million.  On 17 June we were not told how much it would cost to upgrade the building, yet a few weeks later the scaffolding went up.  I have pictures of it.  Why at that committee meeting did CIT not tell us about the extra costs that would be part of doing up the building and bringing it up to a certain standard?  The overall costs for this building are way in excess of what CIT paid and presumably it will come in at &euro;2.5 million rather than &euro;1 million.  Why did it not reveal this information to us, considering the many companies that were on site down there in a matter of weeks?  The contracts for those companies must have been signed before CIT appeared before the committee.  Why was that information not given to us at that meeting?</p></speech>

Obviously, they do not talk, or rather they do meet but they did not discuss this, which is fine but it is very strange.  I know Cork well.  I went to UCC for many years.  It is a great college and probably created me, if that sounds right.  I am sorry about that.  My issue, however, is that there are two colleges bidding against each other.  The asking price is &euro;950,000 and they pay &euro;1.25 million, which is &euro;300,000 extra.  For the taxpayers or the people watching as well as for the HEA and the Department, there is something strange there.  The Department should be aware of these things so that they can be examined.  It is certainly an issue.</p> <p>  Will the HEA officials tell us why the travel expenses in the accounts for two of the board members are higher than the others?</p></speech>

No. 9 in the Schedule to the Higher Education Authority  Act states about people who are not resident in Ireland:</p><blockquote>A member of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office if he is adjudged bankrupt or makes a composition or arrangement with creditors, or is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment or penal servitude or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State.</blockquote> <p>Why have we two board members who are not resident in the State?</p></speech>

I think that is dancing on a pin.  For me, if somebody is not resident in the State, in the spirit of the Act, they should cease to be on the board.  There are additional costs on this.

We believe that it is clear that somebody who was appointed and subsequently moves out of the country would cease to be eligible to be a HEA board member.

Following up on that, the HEA did write to this committee to say that it was not happy about the controls in place here, and was unhappy with the role and powers of the financial controller and the process by which they could write their own cheques.  I looked at the board minutes of CIT from 2 February 2017.  A Mr. O'Sullivan asked for an update on the appointment of an external member of the finance committee, which means there was no external person on the finance committee of CIT.  It then says that Mr. Gallagher informed him that the position was advertised externally and the recommendation would come back to the finance committee which in turn would report to the governing body.  Is it not alarming to the HEA that there has been no external person on the finance committee?  I will put this to CIT in a moment.</p></speech>

The governing body was established under the Act.  External bodies make nominations to the governing body.  The only member of the executive on the governing body is the president.  There are two staff members from the academic community, one non-academic staff member and two student members.  Everyone else on the governing body is external.  Once the governing body is established - it was last done in March 2015 - committees are established of members of the governing body.  A finance committee was established, but there was nobody on the governing body with an accounting qualification.  Following a self-evaluation review, it was decided that the membership should be strengthened.  There is provision in the terms of reference to co-opt someone with specialist skills onto the governing body.  This is the first time we have done it, but I am aware that a number of institutes of technology have done it previously.  We believe it is a matter of good practice and the committee undertook the process of advertising, short-listing and filling the position.</p></speech>

We are speaking specifically about CIT which has a turnover of &euro;100 million per annum, but my comment applies to the third level sector generally.  In the context of corporate governance, it is shocking that we have boards and governing bodies in place in the sector that do not have financial competence.  That might be the fault of the legislation, but it is shocking.  I am looking at the accounts of CIT which were signed by the then chairman and president.  The accounts refer to their responsibility to select the accounting policies.  This is an issue that deserves further scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General too.  It is extraordinary that we have chairmen and presidents of governing bodies which, by and large, do not have members with any financial competence who are putting their names to statements to the effect that they have selected suitable accounting policies; made judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; prepared financial statements on a going concern basis, unless the principle is inappropriate; and disclosed and explained all material departures from acceptable accounting standards.  I safely say, based on what the witnesses have said, that the people who signed such statements have no understanding whatsoever of what they have signed.  In effect, they have signed a blank cheque, although I accept that the accounts are audited.  I am not talking about the accuracy of the accounts because the Comptroller and Auditor General audits them.  Yesterday we were discussing the issue of corporate governance, the submission of accounts and the fact that accounts were being submitted late.  Now we are discussing the fact that we have governing bodies and boards of directors of State bodies, some of which have accounts running into the hundreds of millions of euro, which lack financial competence.  I know that such competence can be hired in, but it should be part of the board.</p></speech>

The financial statements are approved through the audit and risk committee, on which there is financial expertise.  We separated it out to ensure the audit and risk committee had a wider remit.  We have a finance committee which is largely procedural, but all of the financial statements and so forth go through the audit and risk committee.  The new code of governance requires that we conduct a matrix of skills analysis in the governing body.  When it comes to nominations to that body, we have a hand in pointing to skills deficits.</p></speech>

I am not referring to the skills available to the finance committees or other sub-committees of boards but boards as a whole.  We accept that we are talking about an educational establishment, but if &euro;100 million or more is going through it, it is disappointing for us to see that there is not a level of financial competence built into the board structure.  The institute is getting there, but I am sure Mr. O'Connor understands our concerns about what we are hearing.</p></speech>

That is part of the problem in dealing with all of these issues.  It might seem a little frivolous because in this case the amount is only &euro;13,000.  A report was produced and an examination carried out.  It was found that &euro;6,000 was outside the spending guidelines, but the taxpayer has to foot the bill anyway.  There is no sanction for anyone in the institute or any of the universities.  The &euro;6,000 will make no difference whatsoever in coming out of a multi-million euro budget.  There is nothing to stop anyone from doing this again.</p></speech>

We are a little ahead of ourselves, but if the final conclusion is that it was incorrect and should, for example, be deducted from the next grant, that, in itself, would be an important signal to send and sanction.  I add that, as part of the funding model review, one of the implementation measures is a penalty system which is being worked through this year with the implementation group.  It is generally concerned with what are regarded as serious and material breaches, but we will come back on that issue.</p></speech>

It strikes me when I look at the figure of &euro;150 million and the institute's spend on consultants that the institutes cannot open an envelope without asking an outside group to give an opinion.  It is amazing on what the money is spent and the amount spent.  That raises questions about what the hell the HEA is doing and what its role is in all of this.  For example, there was a feasibility study of experimental sheep research for a project, at a cost of &euro;131,000, for the academic year 2012-13.  Other spending included a sum of &euro;65,000 on PR for CIT.  The word "medical" also appears a lot on the list and I am not sure what it means: "Medical - &euro;61,000" and "medical - &euro;19,000".</p></speech>

Surely somebody could have looked at this issue and said it might be better to employ counsellors, that it would save money.  The same is true of IT services.  Although there is an IT section, for the academic year 2012-13 I see references to sums of &euro;37,000 and &euro;7,000 for IT support, as well as a reference to a sum of &euro;12,000 for the management of websites.  The same pattern appears for every other academic year.  At what point does the HEA stop and recognise that the institute is spending all of this money on outside consultants?  There are units in place in institutes with in-house experience.  Why are they spending so much money in outsourcing and on outside reports when they could do more in-house and save the taxpayer money?</p></speech>

It is a really serious matter.  There is a constantly increasing demand for counselling.  We had a number of in-house counsellors, but the demand from students, because of the way society is, means that we have six or eight counsellors coming in.  We are looking at reviewing the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#P04900"><p>To be clear, I absolutely understand that it is a big issue.  Mental health well-being is a very big issue.  I commend the fact that there are supports in place for students, but that is not my point.  It is a really good initiative by universities and institutes of technology if that is what they are doing.  However, we are looking at expenditure line by line and I see a pattern year on year that a lot of money is being spent on counsellors who work outside an institute.  It is a huge amount of money.  I imagine that money could be saved if more of the work was done in-house.  The same is true for IT services.  I do not understand why the institute would pay for website management if it has its own IT department.  Why is that the case?</p><p>In terms of IT, we have experienced quite a high turnover of staff.  That market is very buoyant.  Some of those skills we are bringing in on a short-term basis just as cover.  Some of the skills we are bringing in are specialist, for example, cloud computing and so on, so there is a variety of approach.</p></speech>

There is quite a broad definition of consulting.  We took the Deputy's question, went out to the institutions and went back to 2011, I think.  This is a significant spend, as the Deputy mentioned, of &euro;153 million.  It is critical to see it in the context of the spend across the institutions over that seven or eight year period - not as a justification in itself, but if the Deputy remembers, the expenditure across the institutions over that period was probably somewhere between &euro;12 billion and &euro;15 billion.</p> <p>  At times they will need additional skill sets that are not available in their institution; we have just heard of an example.  At times they may have some of those skill sets in their institution, but they need additional capacity for a period of time, such as the mental health services we just heard about.  At times they might be doing a building project and need to bring in a specialist for a particular focused task, so it is important to see the consultancy spend in that kind of context.  That is really important to stress here.</p></speech>

In 2015-2016 there was payment of &euro;10,500 for Cork IT to Brian Murray SC for legal opinion.  It just says, "Legal opinion PAC".  It should be borne in mind I put the question to a former president of Cork IT, when he was in before us, as to whether the then Accounting Officer had got PR training - in fact, he had got PR training - on how to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We made the point then that I hoped the PR training was about how to answer questions and not how to not answer questions.  Leaving that to one side, why did Cork IT seek legal opinion over attending a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, which cost &euro;10,500?</p></speech>

This was in relation to a series of anonymous letters in which 196 allegations were being made against the institution.  We have been through quite a bit of this, starting with December 2015 in the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was a very significant amount of personal information contained in all of that, in terms of reports and so on.  At the time we asked for some advice in terms of how we would treat that.  Again that is an issue that is continuing to build for us with tomorrow, the GDPR and so on.  It is a particular concern for us in that none of those allegations was substantiated, so it was not fair to be connecting individuals with those allegations.  We have talked a lot about redactions and so on, but we needed to be sure we were protecting that personal information and we sought advice accordingly.</p></speech>

I will come back to the letter they submitted later, but I wish to make a few points first.  My first question is for CIT.  Deputy Kelly asked about protected disclosures.  In June 2017, the then president and Mr. Gallagher appeared before the committee.  It was said at that meeting that Cork IT had never received a protected disclosure.  Is that still the case - at that stage it was June 2017?</p></speech>

Would it have related to issues such as: financial malpractice; impropriety or fraud; activities which involve or have the potential to involve bribery or corruption, failure to comply with a legal obligation; bullying; failure to comply with the institute's charter, statutes or regulations; endangering of health and safety; academic or professional malpractice; improper conduct or unethical behaviour; serious conflict of interest without disclosure; or attempts to conceal any of the above?</p></speech>

The institute engaged with that individual as best we could.  The individual has subsequently taken a High Court action against the institute, which we are defending strongly.  There was huge overlap in this whole area at the time between anonymous letters and a particular individual.</p></speech>

We provided a copy of the draft protected disclosure policy, which was largely as it is now and largely accords with the Act, although the Act was subsequent to it.  We also offered to the individual that we would have a review of any evidential base that was in support of any of these allegations, but none of that was ever forthcoming.</p></speech>

On 17 June, we had no cases.  Mr. Gallagher is outlining what seems to be a very specific case of disclosure.  He is saying that it is before the High Court.

It is, therefore, the discloser who has those rights.  Regarding what the institution does, there is no legal responsibility to investigate but, obviously, it is good practice that if one believes the issues are serious, one should have them investigated.  Hence, it is not a question of any institution, entity or individual in the organisation that receives the disclosure making a legal determination that it is a protected disclosure.  The point that is always made about protected disclosures is that one should forget about the legislation; if a concern is raised, the institution needs to satisfy itself as to the course of action that should be taken.</p></speech>

First, we have what seems to correspond with the 2012 draft disclosures policy in CIT.  We have established that a letter was received and that it was not seen as a disclosure.  The president, on 17 June last year, said, "No, we never received any disclosures."  Mr. Gallagher has said that was the case.  He has said it here again.  However, now we see something that could be a disclosure.  Then we have the process, whereby the institution then decides there are certainly some things in this that it may or may not need to investigate.  The institution refers the matter to the Department and the HEA.  The HEA sends it back and suggests that the institution put together the terms of reference and manage the process.  How is that good governance?  Even if everyone acted appropriately and were second-guessing themselves and were happy to investigate themselves, how would it be good governance to ask the fox to design the security system for the henhouse?</p></speech>

The query concerns costs.  The HEA might want to have a look at this.  A letter was written to the Committee for Public Accounts on 23 March 2018.  It stated that the costs of the merger to date were a total of &euro;571,803.  Yet a letter to the committee dated 27 May stated that the costs were &euro;752,186.  How can it be that the costs were &euro;752,186 in 2015, but went down to &euro;571,803 in 2018?</p></speech>

It seems hilarious that two letters were written to the committee three years apart, indicating that the costs were over &euro;752,000 three years ago, and are now &euro;571,000.  Two years have passed and the costs have decreased.  Apples with apples, oranges with oranges is the argument.  However, I have checked that out, and even allowing for that the figures do not add up.  This is a pretty urgent thing, given the fact-----</p></speech>

I have added those in.  We have public information on those.  They still do not add up.  I would like this information presented in a table.  The witnesses might come back to us next week.</p> <p>  Regarding the Department, obviously its officials have great respect for the HEA and all of that.  They accept that the HEA has a significant role to play.  I take that as given.  I wish to raise the issue of the merger, or the Munster Technological University, particularly the famous minutes that never existed but did exist.  I had to make them public through this process, which is absolutely infuriating and wrong in the first place.  I had to ask for minutes from the HEA, which were never meant to become public, to be made public.  The excuse given was not acceptable nor do I accept it.  These minutes said that the absolute overwhelming majority opinion, the almost unanimous view, was that this should not go ahead.  Policy is a matter for the Government and for Ministers.  That is fine.  As a former Minister I understand that.  However, viewing this matter from the perspective of the Department, I presume its officials basically just dismiss the HEA when they do not agree with it. </p></speech>

The point of public hearings is that the witnesses are asked questions in order to provide answers in public, in camera, for the people outside watching.  It is an indictment of the Department of Education and Skills that it did not have the capacity to send anybody here to answer questions, with full knowledge of the fact that these issues have been aired numerous times before.  The facts are that are minutes of the HEA board showing that the board recommended almost unanimously that this should not happen.  The policy decision of the Department was to go ahead.  As we heard, it will probably start later on this year.  The issue here is this.  I asked a direct question.  In that scenario, the Department dismissed the HEA.</p></speech>

I think I have outlined the point.  I have another question for CIT.  A company called KONE provides services and courses in CIT.  Are any former CIT employees directors of this company, or anyone who is formerly on the management team a director of this company?  Can the witnesses come back to us in writing on that?  Are any former employees or members of the management team directors of this company which is employed by CIT?</p> <p>  The final question is to the Department.  It is based on Mr. Gallagher's evidence.  Earlier, he said there were no protected disclosures prior to 2018.

Obviously, when the draft policy was in place, which Deputy MacSharry examined in detail, it was never used for any cases.  That is because there were no disclosures before 2018, so there were no disclosures during the period of the draft policy.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I am referring to pre-2018 all the time.  For clarity, there were no disclosures when there was a draft policy in place or a full policy in place, pre-2018 and so on.  I respectfully ask the Department, through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, or whatever process, to investigate this matter.  I had not intended to ask this question at all, but based on the evidence heard today, there appears to be a serious issue about the clarity required on whether there were any forms of disclosure in 2018 in the formal or in the draft policy.  I am formally asking the Department to investigate issue with regard to the Cork Institute of Technology.  Whether this is done through the HEA or directly through the Department is the Department's own business, but I ask it, please, to look into it.  This is necessary based on the evidence given here today because there seems to be a certain amount of confusion and information that needs to be looked into.  This is a request.</p></speech>

There was also detail on the rating and implication, grade 2, that the risk strategy or risk appetite of the institute was not well understood and that decision-making may have been suboptimal.  The review said that the institute could take on excessive risk to the detriment of the achievement of its long-term strategic goals.  It said that irregular review of the risk management framework set up by the governing body did not create a stable risk landscape and that it was without focus from the top in terms of risk management, including maintaining the risk register, overseeing progress of remedial actions and reporting to the governing body.  It made an interesting point that insufficient feedback from the governing body and a lack of awareness within the institute of the purpose of the risk register could result in a lack of buy-in.  The review also said that without capture of assurance of peak controls, the executive audit committee and governing body were not provided with adequate assurance as to whether risks were adequately managed.</p> <p>  I read the KPMG report, which is heavily redacted for us so it is difficult to get a full capture of its contents, something we discussed this before.  Notwithstanding what that report said and the witnesses' view, there was the subsequent review in 2016 by PricewaterhouseCoopers that identified failings in risk management.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

We fed back into that policy piece and a new risk management policy has just issued, which is being implemented in CIT.  I accept that risk management as a methodology within CIT is not that well-developed at this stage.  We have an institutional risk register but we have not embedded risk management down further into the organisation.  There is quite a bit of work to do around this.</p></speech>

Perhaps he will respond as best he can while we are in public session.  It concerns a draft report sitting with the HEA about Waterford Institute of Technology and intellectual property.   The HEA furnished the committee with a more global examination of intellectual property, which we will get to at some point.  Will Mr. Love explain to the committee when the report on intellectual property and Waterford Institute of Technology was to be completed, when the draft report was given to the HEA, how long it has been with the HEA and what the difficulties are with regard to publishing that report?</p></speech>

I will update the committee on this while we are in public session.  We have hit a number of difficulties with the report, including significant legal issues.  We have subsequently sent a version of the report to a number of individuals for feedback and a right of reply type process.  We have a number of legal objections to elements of the report.  I do not want to go into more detail than that here.  We have recently received details of those objections and inputs.  These are with our legal team at the moment.</p></speech>

The report was due in November and the Committee of Public Accounts is still waiting for the report as we go into June.  Does Mr. Love accept that a seven-month time gap is more than late?  Does he see this as acceptable from the committee's perspective?  We focused on this issue and we asked for an independent examination.  A report was done and someone obviously did a huge piece of work on it.  The report was submitted to the HEA, and while I understand that due diligence must be followed, we are seven months down the road and we still do not have that report.  It must also be borne in mind that this committee was hoping to use the report as an opportunity to explore the wider issue.  This situation is holding up the committee's work, and if an independent report is done, it must be published so we can see exactly what the problems were, if there were problems.</p></speech>

One of the strengths of a university is that it has autonomy and is able to borrow and invest.  If existing universities can borrow while technological universities cannot borrow, we do not have a level playing field.  That feeds into the concerns that those who are against technological universities have.  They may have other reasons too.  I want to see it happen but I have a concern about technological universities not being on a par with existing universities.  Is baseline funding for research and development in the legislation?</p></speech>

When allegations or matters are raised, it is very important that each institution has the capacity to carry out a good governance process, which can properly be viewed as independent, to help the institution to reach a satisfactory conclusion.  If all allegations like this have to be outsourced to an independent body - ourselves or some other body - the process of self-investigation will not develop within institutions and this will affect their competence to regulate and govern themselves.  An outside body or a set of outside bodies should be able to go a step further when that is needed.  When allegations like these are raised, I would be concerned if the institution could simply step back and say it has to be tossed over to somebody else.</p></speech>

It is black and white.  If there is an allegation against me, I need to be 100 miles away from the investigation other than when the independent investigator comes to me to ask me questions about it.  Why did KPMG consult the executive only?  Why did it not conduct wholesale interviews across a random selection of staff to see if any of these things stands up?  It did not do so.  According to a letter on this issue that was sent by Bob Savage after the draft report, KPMG undertook further review work and consulted the executive for a number of weeks.  The executive is telling us it was the subject of numerous allegations.  This entire process is flawed.  I suggest to the HEA and the Department that they should tear up the flawed guidance they have because it asks the fox to investigate the incident that resulted in the chickens being eaten.  That is not real, appropriate, authentic or credible.  In fact, it makes clowns out of everybody associated with this process, including those of us who are trying to ask questions.  This is not personal and it is without prejudice.  Maybe all of these allegations were totally vexatious.  The credible and professional names that are associated with the report which has been carried out - I refer to KPMG, legal firms and so on - are selling themselves short by being associated with a process that was such as shambles.  I suggest to the HEA and the Department that their guidance is laughable and wide open to accusations of containment and of enabling the process to be internally managed to ensure the truth is suppressed in the interests of protecting an individual, a group of individuals or an institution.  Frankly, it plays completely into the credible accusation, which this committee has seen more than most, that those who want to be whistleblowers need to be prepared to be portrayed as villains and crooks and to be thrown under the bus.  It is laughable and comical to suggest that the process of allowing institutions to investigate themselves is independent.</p></speech>

I think our general point is one we have made here before.  The protected disclosures legislation is relatively new.  I think most people share the view that it has not yet been fully embraced.  It is not operating as originally intended.  I am not talking about this case.  We are finding it everywhere.  I could list ten organisations in which we have encountered this issue.  I am not making excuses.  When the freedom of information legislation was introduced some years ago, people struggled for a few years as they sought to handle it.  They probably got the hang of it eventually.  The protected disclosures legislation applies to the private sector as well as the public sector.  It is very important.  We are in a space where everybody is struggling.  People have yet to get on top of the operation and spirit of the legislation.  We are finding that at this committee all over the place.  That is a general comment.  I am not looking for a response.  I will allow Dr. O'Connor to respond before I bring Deputy Connolly in.</p></speech>

I would like to make some points of clarification about the way the institute and the governing body work.   Apart from the internal members who were mentioned by Mr. Gallagher earlier, such as the staff and student representatives, all the members of the governing body are external members.  The sub-committees of the governing body are serviced by the office of the vice president for finance and administration.  All matters of human resources, personnel, finance and procurement go through one office.  Anything to do with students, quality and examinations goes through the office of the vice president for academic affairs.  We do not have a huge infrastructure there.</p></speech>

This relates back to what all Deputies see when they are dealing with constituents.  If somebody who has applied for social housing from his or her local authority does not get it and subsequently submits an appeal, good practice dictates that somebody outside the housing function, rather than somebody more senior in the housing section, should look at the appeal.</p><p>It is obvious that somebody utterly unconnected with the original decision should be looking at it.  That is common sense.  Mr. Gallagher has indicated.</p></speech>

However, I welcome what has been said.</p> <p>  My final point is on IMERC.  I have listened to everything that has been said here today.  Over two years we have listened.  The debacle relating to IMERC does not really inspire confidence.  Two third level institutions and the Naval Service set up IMERC.  Looking at the document it refers to new governance arrangements emerging.  It sets out all this flashy documentation and so on.  My time is limited.  I look at that and then I look at the review of Ireland's Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster dated May 2016.  It is an indictment.  I just have to put it on the record because I have taken the time to look at it and I have raised it previously.  It is not my area, but it jumps out.  We have to get an international panel of reviewers to look at this.  They distinguish the university and CIT from the institution that was IMERC.  Words fail me.  The team identified a very significant weakness in the structure and operation of the institutional IMERC's governance and controls, and the absence of robust procurement, financial management and public relations.  I will not quote the whole thing.  The witnesses will accept it is a damning indictment of the new governance structures emerging.  A structure was set up and it is allowed.</p></speech>

I accept that the three institutions were not damned in this report.  What was set up with the full co-operation of the three institutions was this institution.  This institution is the subject of a damning report by a panel of international experts.  We have all this glossy stuff telling us about wonderful new governance.  Dr. O'Connor accepts it is damning.  It was confirmed when it was dissolved.  As I understand, it was not dissolved from any internal recognition of problems.  It was dissolved because of this review and because very good people in the institutions said it was not right.</p></speech>

This came into effect on 18 April.  Essentially, the document says that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, has published guidance for assisting public service bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act.  It summarises the key features and states that all public service bodies have the responsibility to have procedures in place and available to their employees for dealing with protected disclosures.  It goes on to address the nature of my query.  As we know, a lot of this has been outsourced to other organisations and we asked what the procedure was and whether everybody goes and does their own outsourcing.  The Office of Government Procurement says it has a procurement framework which came into effect on 11 April this year, only the other day.  That is now being sent to all Government bodies in respect of outsourcing of these issues.</p> <p>  There are three framework agreements that can be put in place.  If the witnesses have not read the guidelines yet, they are on their way to them now.  They should have read them last week.  One framework agreement says that for the provision of third-party confidential recipient services pursuant to section 6 of the Protected Disclosures Act, an organisation that might not be big enough to have somebody independent internally can designate a third-party confidential recipient and there is a framework in place in respect of the procurement of that particular service.</p> <p>  There is a separate service that is provided for under this framework to say that an organisation can have a procurement service in respect of the full investigative services into an alleged wrongdoing purported to be disclosed under the Protected Disclosures Act including a review of such services.  That allows an organisation to have a person not just act as a confidential recipient but also investigate the alleged wrongdoing independent of the organisation.</p> <p>  The third framework procurement contract that is now in place is for full investigative services of allegations of penalisation or adverse treatment as a result of having made a disclosure of wrongdoing, or where such a disclosure is purported to have been made, pursuant to the Act, and for review of such investigations.  In the event that somebody feels they have been penalised as a result of making a disclosure or a purported disclosure - I stress that there is a presumption in the Act that a disclosure is a protected disclosure - this allows for a framework to be put in place and independently procured in line with Government procurement.</p> <p>  There are three separate contracts now available and that is part of the issue we have been processing here.  We felt the thing was not working and were putting the onus on DPER.  It is up to the Department at national level to get this protected disclosures legislation working across the board.  We found on several occasions - I have two or three more examples on my desk - that the current arrangements have not been working.  This framework is an acknowledgement that the system was not fully functional up to now.  This letter was dated 11 May.  It came to the committee within the last week and is due to be raised in correspondence.</p></speech>

I note what the Chairman has read out.  I note that it included words like "guidelines" and "internal, independent".  If that is not an oxymoron I do not know what is.  How can we have an internal independent person, without prejudice?  It is an impossibility.  Nobody internal can investigate or be part of the investigation of allegations against that institution - work colleagues, golf buddies, drinking buddies, friends.  That is not there.  Guidelines are optional, as we all know and have learned at our expense at different times.</p> <p>  I wish to make a proposal which will need a seconder.  That will have to be the Chairman unless Deputy Alan Kelly wants to second it.  I propose, whether it is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills in this instance or DPER in general, that we need a whole new set of guidelines.  It is never acceptable to have an internal independent party because that is a conflict of interest in itself.  Even if what the Chairman read out is now the gold standard that can prevent and give absolute confidence to whistleblowers, the public and everyone that everything is independent and there is going to be a full and complete investigation and consideration, it is not retrospective.  In that context, there should be a re-investigation independently overseen by the Department of the anonymous disclosure that has been referred to, any letters that are judged to be disclosures or not pre-2017, and the ones currently before them.</p> <p>  I do not believe it is appropriate - without prejudice - for their own protection at a very minimum that executives, staff or certain people within the institution that is the subject of a protected disclosure are in any way associated with the management, oversight, facilitation or otherwise of a protected disclosure.  I ask that we write to the Secretaries General or the Ministers at DPER and the Department of Education and Skills because it is in this context that there would be a re-investigation of this.  I think I have proven beyond doubt this was not independent - again without prejudice - because of the involvement of people who were named in allegations, however false they may have been or vexatious.  That is not transparent.  It is not good governance and it is a clear conflict of interest.  I formally propose that.  I ask the Chairman to second it.  I know the clerk is talking to him there.</p></speech>

We might then move down the process.</p><p>Dr. Love and Department representatives said that it is important, from a governance evolution perspective, for an organisation to learn from its mistakes and I totally agree with that.  However, the fact there is a procedure in place does not mean it is a good one or the right one; nor does it mean that it is going to lead to learning.  If a truly independent, external body is involved in setting terms of reference and managing matters at arm's length, like the Department or the HEA, the results of that process can act as the learning catalyst in improving governance in an organisation, whether that be CIT, Sligo IT or any other State entity.</p><p> I have a concern about this letter and the issue of parties and entertainment.  Dr. Love said that this had the potential to address the problem as he saw it.  He said that it was a personal view but wanted to reserve the right of the board to take its own view.  I am glad he so reserved because I cannot see how his board would be remotely happy with this.  It is all about what is going to be done in the future as opposed to addressing what happened in the past.  There is no sanction.  There is an acknowledgement that &euro;13,000 was dished out, that the person in charge of the money decided to spend it and that this was clearly condoned by others.  The only suggestion is that for presidential or governing body expenditure in excess of &euro;500, prior approval of the vice president of finance and administration is required but that is easily obtained.  That is not a procedure.  Where is the sanction?</p></speech>

Before doing so, the board should bear in mind that this is all about how things are going to be managed in the future.  All anyone has to do at the moment is get the permission of the vice president of finance to spend whatever he or she likes, which means this could happen again if the vice president of finance is disposed to agreeing to an ice sculpture, the hiring of a band and so forth.  That is a problem.  There is also no sanction.  Where is the tangible sanction which demonstrates to every institution that the HEA condemns the use of &euro;13,000 of taxpayers' money on this type of hospitality?  Where is the condemnation of the use of public money for a portrait?  The institute had so little confidence in its own art faculty that it did not even commission a student but paid &euro;20,000 to an external person to do it.  There should be no ambiguity here and there should be echoes of condemnation from the Department.</p></speech>

I am not inferring anything about Dr. Love's judgment.  He gave a personal opinion.  While I appreciate that the process is not finished, on 17 June it will be one year since we first discussed these matters and that is a problem.  The echoes of condemnation should still be heard from 18 June, that public money cannot be spent in this way.</p> <p>  The CIT proposal relates to a procedure.  We may be happy that a procedure will be put in place but not if the procedure is that the vice president of finance must say that it is okay whenever &euro;20,000 is being dished out for a portrait or an ice sculpture because that is not good enough.  I do not know how Dr. Love's board, when the time comes for its next meeting, could be remotely happy with this pitiful account of how taxpayers' money can be handled in the future.  People will only need the permission of one person to dish out whatever they want.  I expect to hear after that board meeting - albeit a year late - a loud chorus of condemnation and to see clear procedures laid out, rather than guidelines, on what people can and cannot do.</p></speech>

Back in October or November, the finance subcommittee of CIT's governing body also brought in another procedural check.

There is an added protection there from the point of view of the vice president of finance and administration.</p></speech>

I made an assumption, as did other committee members, that a certain person was the contract manager on a PPP project all along.  We had an entire discussion in the context of that incorrect assumption.  Nobody corrected that and the person concerned suggested in correspondence that we could have asked.  We were not corrected and did not know that we should ask because that was the information we were given at the time.  I ask the witnesses to put it on the record that the person referred to at our previous meeting, who we are not naming today, was not the contract manager until such time as the operational phase of the PPP project began.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

This protected disclosure will come up again.  I know of another item of correspondence raising the protected disclosure issue for next week as well, so this protected disclosure issue will come back and we can discuss it further.  We have already agreed to write to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills today asking them to comment on this issue of people internal to the organisation who may not be considered independent or may be named as part of the disclosure that has been made and the appropriateness of those individuals examining matters when they might be personally connected with some of the issues that have been raised in the statement.  We will ask for a response from the two Departments specifically on that issue and we can take it from there when we get a response.</p> <p>  No. 1302B, from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, OPW, provides an information note requested by the committee on the advices given by the OPW to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Probation and Welfare Trust.  We will note and publish this.  We have discussed it before.</p> <p>  No. 1309B, from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Acting Secretary General at the Department of Justice and Equality, provides a follow-up note on a number of matters, including the probation service building; costs associated with two protected disclosures; the numbers of people accommodated in commercial and State-owned direct provision centres; sections to be commenced in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act; the Bridge Project; and the process and systems to raise matters with the Minister.  We will note and publish this.  There is a lot of documentation there.  If members want to raise it again next week, they should feel free.  We will note and publish it for today.</p> <p>  No. 1320B, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, provides an explanatory note on Trinity College Dublin, TCD, and the inclusion of audit certificates with financial statements.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 1328B, from the State Claims Agency, dated 22 May 2018, provides follow-up to our meeting two weeks ago.  I consider this a very serious item of correspondence.  It arrived here just yesterday evening, and I arranged for hard copies to be given out to members even though there are 40 pages in it.  The issue is very serious.  I do not want to reopen the CervicalCheck discussion at the Committee of Public Accounts - not at the moment anyway - but there is a very difficult issue highlighted in this letter that the committee needs to deal with very strongly.  I refer to the addendum on page 2.  The State Claims Agency was asked by the committee for "A note with the details of the interaction with CervicalCheck and the [State Claims Agency] regarding how the communication process to the women affected would operate".  I wanted to read that last section into the record.  This is the cover letter.</p></speech>

There are the six requests we made to the State Claims Agency after its appearance before the committee on 10 May.  We requested &quot;A note with the details of the interaction with CervicalCheck and the [State Claims Agency] regarding how the communication process to the women affected would operate&quot; and four other items.  They were in the minutes of the meeting and the State Claims Agency formally got a letter asking that it reply to those five items.  The response to one of the items concerns me.  The bulk of the document concerns dealing with period payment orders and so on.  The agency is waiting for that section of the Act to commence.  The part I want to highlight is on page 2, the addendum to the letter signed by Ciar&aacute;n Breen, the director of the State Claims Agency.  It concerns the communication between the HSE and the State Claims Agency and the communication process to the women affected by the case.  He says in his letter:</p><blockquote>We have noted that John Gleeson of HSE CervicalCheck, during his evidence to the PAC on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup>May last, indicated that nobody in HSE CervicalCheck informed the State Claims Agency, in or about the time of Vicky Phelan's trial, that all of the women, the subject matter of the audit, had been informed.<br /><br />Mr. Gleeson's assertion does not accord with the facts.</blockquote> <p>I will read that statement again.  The HSE was here last week giving evidence, and the director of the State Claims Agency flatly contradicts it and says, &quot;Mr. Gleeson's assertion does not accord with the facts.&quot;  We have an absolute conflict.  I want to read the rest of the addendum.</p><blockquote>The Agency re-iterates its advices to the Committee that its legal team, comprising Senior and junior Counsel, a solicitor and paralegal, held a teleconference, on 20<sup>th</sup>April 2018, with a senior person in CervicalCheck.  Senior Counsel specifically asked if that person, the employee of CervicalCheck, was aware whether or not the affected women had been informed.  The reply was that all women whose smear [test] was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed they had been informed by their treating clinicians and this reply was carefully noted and attached to the [State Claims Agency's] legal file.<br /><br />In giving his evidence to the Committee, Mr. Breen had ascertained the above specifically for the purposes of giving evidence to the Committee on the particular point.</blockquote><p>Since that arrived this morning, I have sent a message back to the State Claims Agency asking it to provide us with the name of the person from the HSE who was part of the teleconference and, if possible, a copy of the final note.  On the face of it, there are two State agencies involved, two of the most important in the State.  One is saying that what was said by one in public session at a meeting of this committee does not accord with the facts.  The Committee of Public Accounts has nothing to do with CervicalCheck, but when witnesses appear here, we expect them to speak openly and with candour.  This man is disagreeing that that has happened.  This is an issue that the committee cannot let run.</p></speech>

The first is that, on the face of it, Mr. Gleeson might not have given accurate evidence to this committee.  That is quite serious.  I had difficulty with many of the answers we got from him, in particular.  That is serious.  What is more serious is the substance because if the State Claims Agency was of the view, formed on the basis of information it states it got from CervicalCheck, verified by its legal counsel, that all the women had been informed of the misdiagnosis, or that their treating clinicians had informed them, so maybe it was not the women directly-----</p></speech>

It is very profound and goes beyond whether Mr. Gleeson was correct in what he said to the committee.  I am more concerned about the substance.  I am not sure how we could handle that today but it is certainly very serious.</p></speech>

I was representing the committee elsewhere.  I have read a lot about the proceedings of this committee, the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and the Committee on Health.  First, there should be only one committee doing the business on this matter although I recognise two points: first, that the Committee of Public Accounts did a very good job last week and, second, that I do not believe some of the information that has been provided to the Oireachtas would have been provided had it not been for the Committee of Public Accounts.  With those two provisos, I must state there is a point at which we, as a committee, must recognise it is not customary for committees to duplicate each other's business, which is what is happening.  There are three involved.  The matter is to be subject to an inquiry that the Oireachtas will establish in due course.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the correspondence provided by Mr. Breen, which alludes to an issue that merits further discussion at this committee, should be provided to the health committee.  It is of relevance to it to consider it while not diminishing our role in the process from a public expenditure perspective.  I propose that the correspondence be sent to the clerk of the health committee.</p></speech>

I just wanted to put that on the record because I did not have the opportunity to do so before last Thursday evening's meeting where the decision to have a hearing on this matter, with which I have no difficulty, was agreed to, and the subsequent meeting of the committee on the matter.</p></speech>

The letter from the State Claims Agency is headed and refers to the work of the committee.  The subject was matters related to the State Claims Agency, management of legal costs, open disclosure, and the implications for CervicalCheck revelations.  Also covered were the 2016 financial statements of the State Claims Agency and the 2016 financial statements of the HSE.  The Deputy will know that, over recent months, we have had detailed correspondence from the HSE and State Claims Agency regarding the management of medical negligence issues.  That issue, which we have flagged, will be considered by this committee again.  The cervical screening issue that blew up in the public arena was an example of the issue we had been dealing with all along.  It is not the issue <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

I do not want to give the impression that it was.  I used to be a member of the Committee on Justice and Equality, and I remember that a common phrase used at its meetings was that it was not a catch-all for everything.  The justice committee gets almost as much business as the Committee of Public Accounts.  Now that I am a member of the latter, I recognise that it gets everything and that the justice committee is second.  I just wanted to put on the record that-----</p></speech>

I made the point here on the previous occasion that there had been seven committee meetings across three groups, with 32 witnesses in attendance.  I do not believe in unnecessary duplication but I do believe the Committee of Public Accounts dealt with specific issues.  There was a debate at the health committee yesterday that probably covered areas that we will not be covering.  The same happened with Templemore in that the justice committee said it should be considering that.  The same happened with the issue of Mr. Maurice McCabe.  That happens every time the Committee of Public Accounts deals with a matter.  The Deputy's point is well made.</p></speech>

She sends her apologies.</font></p><p>No. 1314C is from <font color="#002100">an individual and relates to the cost of insurance.  It is not within the remit of this committee to get into the matter of insurance costs.  The lady mentions motor insurance primarily, especially motor insurance for young people.

Agreed.</p><p>No. 1315C is from <font color="#002100">Ms Oonagh McPhillips, acting Secretary General at the Department of Justice and Equality, and relates to the GoSafe programme.  Can we note and publish it?  Agreed.</font></p><p>No. 1316C is from <font color="#002100">the former vice president of CIT and relates to matters discussed at the committee meeting on 22 March 2018.</font></p><p>I propose that we do not publish this but rather hold it over for consideration until next week.  The next item is No. 1317, a letter dated 27 April from an individual on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding <i>ex gratia</i>payments to the Irish Horse Welfare Trust.  I propose that we forward this item to the Department for a further response on the points as this has come up before.  Item No. 1318 is correspondence from an individual on the committee's hearing on cervical cancer.  The individual feels this would be more appropriate to be dealt with by the Garda.  We will just note that remark.  Item No. 1327 is correspondence from UCC on a request for information by the committee on a specific retirement package which was raised by Deputy Kelly.  We note that.<br/><br/>There are no statements of account before the committee today.  There is a gap in the work programme due to a cancelled meeting.  We will try to get the National Treatment Purchase Fund in on 14 June.  There being no other business, I note that next week we were to consider the draft report on corporation tax which was circulated from the secretariat weeks ago and which had been on hold.  The report has sat there but I hope we can run through it in detail next Thursday in private session.  It is not a long report.  We will try to complete that business in private session.  We are not circulating copies of that.  When we did so three weeks ago, it appeared on the front pages of newspapers within 36 hours.  People will have to come here and get hard copies, discuss it as it is here and hand it back in.  When we issue a report, it will be a report of the committee.  Before we adjourn, I note that Deputy MacSharry had indicated.</p></speech>

I asked the gentleman from education which section of the Act prescribed that and he quoted the section of the Act which allowed for the making of the guidelines.  Guidelines are just that, guidelines.  This is in the interests of all of the people.  As I said at the meeting, even if all of the allegations were vexatious, why would everyone not be interested in having a process which was beyond reproach in circumstances where the current one is not.  This was a significant issue which has caused a lot of trouble.  There has been correspondence to all of us to pursue it.  Why can we not have an independent investigation or reinvestigation of all of that?  I am not asking for a commission of investigation or tribunal or anything like that.  I note regarding the question of whether the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform ever comes back on the Chairman's correspondence that we need a very prescribed process.  A process should never be overseen or facilitated by the fox rather than the hens.  That stands to reason.</p></speech>

He is not after money.  He is just after proper oversight.  In the meantime, we are being hampered in getting answers from the relevant people when they are in because they state these matters are before the courts.  If we proceeded along those lines, we would do the State a service, save the money and maybe get answers for everybody.</p> <p>  No doubt the legal affairs office will come back and state that such a course of action is highly unorthodox and, of course, it is.  Sometimes it is okay to be pioneering, particularly if it shows a bit of common sense and saves a few pounds.</p></speech>

The Chairman has shown a great interest in this work and I thank him for that.  I am accompanied by Ms Niamh Cooper who recently returned from South Sudan, which she visited along with our ambassador, Mr. Liam Cunningham.  She is our head of communications.</p><p>I am also accompanied by my successor, Mr. Niall McLoughlin, as I am retiring next week, as well as by Ms Andrea Finnegan, our programmes officer on the humanitarian side, and Ms Sheila Garry, our programmes director, all of whom have deep knowledge in this area.  </p><p> World Vision is the largest privately funded non-governmental organisation, NGO, in the world.  It works in over 100 countries and the World Vision partnership employs over 44,000 people, many in the countries in which we are working.  We engage in long-term development work.  We stay and work with communities for many years to take them out of poverty and ensure they are self-sufficient.  We also advocate on people's behalf to help them to have a voice.  The voice of vulnerable children, in particular, must be heard.  </p><p> On the humanitarian side, we provide an emergency response and rehabilitation services where the need is vast.  We will talk about that side of things and our work in South Sudan.  It is more interesting to hear about the work we do.  I, therefore, invite Ms Cooper to tell the committee about her recent trip to South Sudan and the work we are doing there.</p></speech>

It is an honour to be here.   After travelling to places like South Sudan, it is wonderful to be able to come back and let people know what is happening there.

Therefore, we are grateful to have this opportunity.  </p> <p>  I will start with an overview of the context of what is happening in South Sudan and then go into detail on the work of World Vision.

That is the projection for the period between May and July this year.  That means that the people concerned do not have access to food - they are starving.  It is leading to malnutrition and death.  Some 1 million children under the age of five years are acutely malnourished.  That is horrific.  I have travelled to many places with World Vision and never seen the severity of the conditions in South Sudan at the beginning of this month.  I had to walk out of nutrition centres a few times because they were overcrowded, with queues outside.  They were like what we see on those terrible television advertisements, with starving children who were skin and bone suffering from malaria and severe malnutrition.  One woman had on her knee two very small twin babies who were desperately trying to breastfeed.  However, looking at her it was possible to tell that there was no chance they were going to get any nutrition from her.  When I asked her about it, she said they were actually improving.  When she had first arrived, they were in an even worse state.  They looked like newborn babies, but they were actually six months old.  That is the type of situation with which we are dealing and it was multiplied by hundreds on any one day.  It is serve.  </p> <p>  Some 4 million people have been displaced, one third of them within South Sudan and the rest in neighbouring countries.  They are running from horrific conflict.  When we spoke to the children, so many of them told us that they had witnessed their mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and friends being murdered in front of their eyes.  That is from what they are running.  There is no number 999 to dial.  They just have to run and flee.  </p> <p>  The economic situation in South Sudan is horrific, with hyperinflation running at a rate of up to 500%.  The humanitarian budget is providing for the provision of services in the country.  It is two to four times the national budget and used to provide health and education facilities.  </p> <p>  There has been an attempt to seek a cessation of hostilities.  I am moving to the next slide in my presentation.  The pink dots on the map of South Sudan are the areas where there is conflict.  There is conflict almost everywhere now and it is horrific.  That is what is causing the crisis.  People are being forced from their homes and cannot farm to produce food.  That is why there is no food available in the country.  The UN World Food Programme, WFP, shared the map with me when I was there.  I thought it was a powerful illustration of how the country was deteriorating.  From the top of the slide downwards, the red zones are the areas in which there is food insecurity.  In January 2016 there were no red zones.  There were orange zones, areas in which there were food crises.  The last image on the bottom right of the slide shows that there are emergencies across the entire country.  The situation was bad to start with, but it is getting worse daily.  From our perspective, we are desperate for the international community to be made aware of this, step in and do something to help the people of South Sudan.  </p> <p>  The key issues affecting children and the with which communities we are working are conflict, displacement and violence.  Children are mainly affected by the violence.  They have been murdered, sexually assaulted and forced into military and armed groups.  They are traumatised.  </p> <p>  I have commented on the economic situation.  Some 33% of the people in South Sudan have access to health services; the rest do not.  There is malnutrition, as well as malaria and, as a result of 3 million people not having access to water, cholera.  It is severe.  </p> <p>  Most children in South Sudan are not in school.  As a result, illiteracy rates are among the worst in the world.  Only 16% of women and 24% of men can read and write.  The position is dire.  </p> <p>  I will give a quick overview of World Vision.  It is the largest NGO in South Sudan where it has been operating for over 30 years, including when it was part of Sudan.  It has a presence in 30 states represented by the grey areas on the map.  Irish Aid is supporting our work in Melut and Renk in the extreme north.  World Vision is dealing with a total of 1.3 million people, mainly children and women.  We have almost 1,000 staff, run 68 projects and are investing $100 million.  We have listed our major donors which, of course, include Irish Aid.  We provide non-food items such as blankets, cooking equipment, water and sanitation facilities.  There is a desperate need for water, without which, as we know, children die as a result of diarrhoea and diseases such as cholera.  It is essential that we provide help.  I refer also to the provision of health services, livelihoods and protection.  World Vision is the World Food Programme's leading partner in providing food assistance.  We are providing food for over 1 million people throughout South Sudan.  World Vision is on the ground, even in the most dangerous areas.  We work with local and national staff.  The World Food Programme airdrops food and World Vision distributes it.  It is still very dangerous for staff on the ground.  There have been many security issues.  We call on the international community to ensure humanitarian workers can continue to provide food.  </p> <p>  We focus mainly on maternal and child health services.  We provide children under five years with nutritional and malarial support.  Malaria is the biggest killer of children in South Sudan.  Malnourished children are much more susceptible to it.  It can be contracted by up to 70% of children during the rainy season.</p><p>That is a huge number and up to 30% of these children do not make it.  Our focus is on providing support in that area.</p><p> We also deal with water and sanitation.  We are providing hundreds of thousands of people with clean water.  Nutrition entails emergency feeding for children who are severely malnourished.  We also provide protection.  We have what are known as child-friendly spaces throughout the country.  These are essential spaces where children are safe to play.  They learn, are educated and receive psychological support in these spaces.  There are also football pitches and they children sing, dance and colour pictures.  The children, who have been through the most horrific experiences, smile and laugh in these places, which are essential.  We have also worked with the United Nations to release hundreds of child soldiers whom we are rehabilitating after their experiences.</p><p> We are also working in Uganda, where 1.3 million South Sudanese people are currently displaced.  I do not know if the committee is aware that the Ugandan Government has a strong policy on accepting refugees and pursues an open door policy.  Uganda provides refugees with land and tries to help them support themselves while living in the country as refugees.  More than 100 people a day are still entering Uganda, whereas last year, the figure was 2,000 per day.  While the figure has decreased, people are still entering the country and 61% of them are children.  People go to Uganda to try to get education and healthcare for their children.  </p><p> World Vision is responding.  We are providing nearly 700,000 refugees with food and 70,000 children with protection programmes, mainly through our child-friendly spaces.  We provide education and we have provided clean water to more than 30,000 people.  We are supporting livelihoods also, for example, training people to be carpenters, even in camps such as the Bidi Bidi refugee camp.  I was just reading about one young man who trained to be a carpenter in the camp and whose business is booming.  Life continues and we are supporting that.  My colleague, Ms Finnegan, will speak about our Irish Aid funded work.</p></speech>

Looking at the map, Irish Aid is supporting our programme in the far north, in the state of Upper Nile.  The current programme is part of a two-year multi-annual programme.  It is part of a multi-country response.  In South Sudan specifically we are working towards three objectives, namely, child protection, education and women's protection.  Our total funding from Irish Aid for 2017 and 2018 comes to just under &euro;1.2 million.  In comparison with other years, the shift to multi-annual programming this year has been a real benefit to our team in South Sudan, because the team has been able to plan for two years.  I know that is an obvious point, but multi-annual programming gives us a sense of stability for the longer-term in planning for internally displaced persons, IDPs, and the host communities.</p> <p>  Regarding child protection, as my colleague, Ms Cooper, stated, we are working on child-friendly spaces, raising awareness of the rights of children and child protection issues, and working with community members in order that they can take action to make the community safer.</p> <p>  We provide education in emergencies.  We are building semi-permanent and temporary learning facilities, providing girl-friendly latrines and providing school learning materials.  We work with the community through parent-teacher associations and community education committees.  That is important for raising awareness of the importance of education, maintaining enrolment rates in the schools and providing a sense of stability to the children who have been displaced in Upper Nile state. </p> <p>  We are also working on women's protection and gender empowerment, including raising issues around gender-based violence, GBV.  We work with partners in the area on the referral pathway of response services for GBV.  We also provide women with life skills to help them along the way and build their resilience in responding to the challenges they face.  That is our broad-brush programme in South Sudan.</p> <p>  In Renk and Melut, World Vision also works on food security, livelihoods and nutrition.  The organisation tries to link up the programmes.  The women and children targeted under this programme are also targeted in our food security and nutrition programme.  As such, there is an integrated approach to what the children can receive.</p> <p>  The focus on education and child protection is vital.  Trends show that education and protection are most likely to be the underfunded responses in an emergency.  It is very much a lifesaving activity for World Vision, along with Irish Aid, to provide these services for the children.  It gives them a sense of belonging and, as Ms Cooper said, it helps them to feel safe.  The programmes provide a place for them to play, learn and feel like children again.  It is a vital response and we welcome the funding from Irish Aid to enable us to be flexible and to fund areas of protection and education.  Some 6% of children in South Sudan are displaced.  Most of them are not in education.  In 2017, almost 10,000 children accessed education through this programme, a significant number considering the challenges and population movement.  </p></speech>

He has been through what we could never imagine but he hopes for his future.  When one asks him and nearly everybody what they want or what is most important to them, the answer is peace.  They just want peace.  Geoffrey is focused on his education.  He want to be a doctor and he wants peace.</p> <p>  Slide 13 shows a baby who is in one of the nutrition centres.  The baby was much more unhealthy a few weeks earlier but his mother received nutritional support to enable her to breast-feed him and help him to be much healthier.  </p> <p>  Slide 14 shows an amazing woman who was part of our cash programming.  We have a programme in which we give people $40 a month for six months, along with training on how to set up a business, create small kitchen gardens and so forth.  She had a stall in the market where she sold peanut paste and she had managed to start saving a large part of the $40 she received each month.  She has started to put her three children through school and she says one child will be a pilot, a second will be a pastor and the third will be a doctor.  She was already planning on expanding her business before the six months had elapsed.  This shows the resilience of these people.  They are amazing.  They have been through hell but they are not giving up.  They are powerful.  They just want peace and they deserve peace and a future.  I call on the Government to do all it can to help bring about peace in South Sudan.  Ireland is highly respected internationally in this area.</p> <p>  What is needed now?  Funding is obviously needed and we are exceptionally grateful for the funding that Irish Aid has given already.  The recent funding announcement is very welcome, but we will always ask for more because much more is needed.  As I said, conflict resolution is vital.  Nothing can happen and we cannot move forward until there is peace in South Sudan.  There are so many possibilities for these amazing people who, like everybody else, including our own children, deserve peace and opportunities.  Please God there will be peace. </p> <p>  After conflict, we will need to focus on long-term development and helping people to get back on their feet.  Let us not forget what these children have witnessed.  While they are smiling now, there is no doubt they will need psychological and psychosocial support to deal with what they have experienced and move forward.  </p></speech>

The people in question deserve to live in peace.  In that regard, we would be very grateful for any intervention the Irish Government could make as it is not our place to intervene in that way.  We are there to help the people who are suffering, but it would be wrong for us not to allude to it.  We are very grateful for the extra funding that has been made available, but this is now a forgotten issue.  Last year everybody was talking about South Sudan, but nobody is talking about it now.  We really feel very strongly that we must highlight and focus attention on the issue in order that a remedy can be found.  We are in it for the long haul.</p></speech>

I saw some of the very good work being done there.  I was sceptical about going because I am sceptical about many things which involve fundraising where one cannot see exactly where the money goes.  There is, however, a lot of good work being done in helping children, particularly in schools.  Alleviating hunger is a huge issue.  When we asked what people felt they needed, we were told that many children were too hungry to go to school.  World Vision alone will not be able to resolve that issue.</p> <p>  I have two suggestions which might improve matters.  We came across people who were waiting to be transported to a refugee or resettlement camp and who were only being provided with nutritional biscuits, rather than hot meals.  There were pregnant women and young kids there.  Common sense has to prevail as much as possible in such situations.  Hot food had been provided in certain place but was then withdrawn for some reason.  Unfortunately, we did not get to learn much about the level of maternal health and the different health services being provided for women.  I would have liked to have seen more in that regard.  I know that good work is being done in the area and would appreciate it if more information could be sent to us. </p> <p>  I commend the work World Vision is doing.  It is very difficult, but another big positive was that many people living in the area were employed by World Vision to work with others.  That helps to empower them and give them the chance to work.  I wish World Vision continued success.  I do not want to speak on behalf of the committee because I am not a member, but World Vision should know that there are other Deputies with an interest in its work and that it should keep in touch with us.</p></speech>

He is very passionate about the work of World Vision and the issues involved.  In October he travelled to Uganda to the Bidi Bidi camp where the South Sudanese refugees were.  At the beginning of this month he travelled with me to Juba in South Sudan to experience the work we were doing and to see the situation there.  In the video he reflects on what he saw.</p></speech>

It is more than four and a half years since this conflict started.  It has been said here already that there is not an awareness among our community or the international community around the terrible conflict, the loss of life, the malnutrition and the displacement of people.  Ms Cooper spoke about the conflict, the hunger, the malnutrition and the displacement of people and the figures she quoted illustrate the huge humanitarian disaster.  Some 6.2 million people, which is more than half of the population, is in need of humanitarian assistance.  One in three persons is displaced.  Two thirds of the population have no access to health services and there is only 16% literacy among women.  It demonstrates very vividly for us the huge humanitarian disaster, and unfortunately there is not the public awareness of it that there should be.  Public awareness about catastrophes, hunger and famines is important.  When there is a crisis or a huge loss of life in different parts of the world that are well covered by the Irish and the international media people will contact us by email, by phone and by writing to us asking what is being done to try to help out in those conflict areas.  In the last few weeks, we have had these contacts made about the terrible loss of life in the Palestinian community.  All committee members, as Members of the Oireachtas, have received a huge number of emails - we were contacted through other means also - on the need to have the Middle East peace process restored to try to bring some order to the area.  Having listened to Mr. Cunningham it is most disappointing that the conflict that has gone on for four and a half years is getting worse.  It is frightening.  Ms Cooper referred to the lady who, through the cash transfer, is doing so much for her children and has the ambition for them to be educated and to acquire skills and contribute to society.  From that perspective, the resilience is clearly evident when one hears about the ambitions of that parent.  Ms Cooper also spoke of the need for security for NGOs.  Can I take it from her comments that humanitarian assistance is not getting to the most vulnerable people because of the security situation and because of the terrible conditions in which her World Vision colleagues and other NGOs work in that country?</p></speech>

There are places in South Sudan in dire need that we cannot access.  We are in places that are very dangerous.  World Vision works with local staff working on the ground in those places.  We have had to take staff out of certain areas because it has become too dangerous.  It is an issue in many countries around the world, including South Sudan.  This is one of the reasons we call on the international community to focus on it and do everything possible to assist us in bringing aid to those who desperately need it.</p></speech>

It is important that we get the message out that our taxpayers are assisting in this vital humanitarian work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1082" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018052400002#F00400"><p>I wish Ms Keogh well in her term.  These were very staggering statistics but it was also good to hear the positive stories.  I did not quite catch what was said about the numbers of displaced persons within Sudan.  Are they all Sudanese?</p> <p>  With regard to conflict resolution, I met with another NGO yesterday and we spoke of how there may be a need to refocus somewhat and that conflict resolution has to be nearer to the top of the agenda.  I totally accept the fact that people have to be fed and kept safe, but unless we get to the crux of the conflict everything is just going to continue as it is.  Following on from that is the need to look after countries that are in conflict and very fragile.</p> <p>  We must consider the role of the Government in South Sudan because I am sure life goes on in its own pleasant way for the Government there.  I am sure that things are very pleasant in Juba for many of its members.  Is there any urgency on the part of the Government in South Sudan to reach a resolution?  Mr. Cunningham referred to beneficiaries.  It would be interesting to hear exactly who he has in mind.  We can all speculate about who is benefitting from the conflict continuing.  What is the role of the main players in trying to bring it to an end?</p> <p>  We hear from the EU that part of the funding is for tackling the root causes of migration.  Conflict is a major cause of migration but we do not see it putting it up to people that they have to sit down at the table to bring about a resolution.  We are now talking about sustainable development goals, STGs, but how can we possibly achieve any of the STGs if we are still working in conflict situations?</p> <p>  World Vision has 44,000 employees, many of whom are local to the countries in which they work.  They would have better access to some of the more difficult places.  What kinds of employees are used?  Do they get particular training for the work they are doing?</p> <p>  In 2015 there was a peace agreement but nobody seems to be driving it.  As the Chairman said, it is going further and further down the agenda.  Many countries believe that the Irish Government could do more on the conflict resolution aspect because they see Ireland as an honest broker.  When the witnesses ask about Government support from Ireland, what exactly can it do at EU and UN levels?</p> <p>  We saw the cash transfer system operate in Malawi and Mozambique.  It is amazing what a small amount of money, directly into a person's hands, can do.  The person has that sense of ownership and makes the decisions about it.</p> <p>  World Vision Ireland has been there for 30 years.  What has it achieved?  I am aware that this discussion is about South Sudan, but I would also like to hear more about where the NGO works in Syria.  I can talk to the witnesses about that after the meeting if they prefer.</p></speech>

We want to work there but every single day there are issues for our staff there so it is very difficult for us to engage very publicly on a political level.</p><p>That is the reason we make presentations, as we are doing here today, and in this instance to appeal to the Government to do whatever it can to address these issues within the EU.  We find in all the countries we work in, particularly in Africa, that the Irish Government, of whatever hue it may be, is very highly regarded because our aid programme is probably regarded as one of the best in the world.</p><p> If I were to say at this forum what we in World Vision Ireland believe a political solution would be, the fear, from our point of view, is that we would be compromised in some way, which would be very inhibiting and frustrating for us, in dealing with the people who are in such dire need.  We advocate to Government, the UN and so on.  Our senior people within that country deal with the government there but it is always in an informal manner.  There are glaring issues sometimes that we wish to speak out about but that would put our workers in danger, which is very frustrating for us.  However, we continue to advocate.  We are grateful for this opportunity because this committee has a remit to inform Government.  Given that the aid programme is in place, the Government is in a position perhaps to address these issues within the EU or directly with the South Sudan Government.  The situation is very complex.  It is heartbreaking for us to see a deterioration when we have worked for so hard for so long and have seen progress.  Perhaps Ms Sheila Garry would like to speak about some of the detail of that work as she has been working there for many years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1085" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sheila Garry" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018052400002#G00200"><p>Yes.  Reference was made to the period of 30 years, and during that time the face of the conflict and all the issues in the southern part of Sudan, as it was, have been constantly changing and looking very different.  It is difficult to say how much the entire nation of that very large country has improved over the course of that long period.  We do what we can among certain targeted communities.  We have been working in the Maloote area with Irish Aid funded support.  The contribution from the Irish Government has had an enormous impact for that particular population, those people, their families and children.  It is one small area of South Sudan but for those people it is everything.  As was mentioned, the vast majority of children throughout South Sudan are not in school.</p> <p>  For the past four years in that area of the Upper Nile, it has meant that children have had access to basic primary education.  It is challenging to have a permanent presence of teachers who are fully trained and qualified.  There are many difficulties in that programme.  For those communities who are displaced, who might have travelled from one county to another and who plan to move on to another one as their local situation becomes volatile, it has meant they have been able to return to the normality of the availability of education and their children being able too access schools.  In those particular camps, as people are mostly based in a camp situation, we have been co-ordinating at a very high level with other agencies, and thousands upon thousands of children are accessing education who otherwise would not be.  Likewise, thousands of the smaller children are able to access a child-friendly space who otherwise would not be able to do so.  For that number of children to be able to get that type of counselling and work through the trauma they have experienced is a major achievement.</p> <p>  For us, we always need to be able to bring it back to the fact that these are the communities with which we are working.  The large-scale picture is that a great number of issues need to be tackled in that country.  Every agency is doing what it can in a particular area, and for that affected population, it is making a gigantic difference.  Other agencies may be intervening in other sectors in that area but we are the only agency working in the education field in Maloote county.  Without that Irish Aid support, there would not be education for those primary school aged children.</p> <p>  All our staff are trained up to the standard required for their positions.  World Vision has very strong human resources, HR, policies and a code of practice in respect of care practices for staff, and we will always prioritise the safety and well-being of staff.  We have a mix of local staff with some international staff when some of the required skills cannot be found locally in the areas.  For example, an accountant or highly qualified medical staff may not be available locally and those staff may be international, but our approach is always with a view to building up the skills and resources of the local staff we hire.  The hiring of staff is always done with sensitivity, for example, to the ethnic group from which they might come.  We have an approach which is called "do no harm".  That means, for example, when we are engaging in a new area with a new population or hiring staff, we as an agency need to make sure that in whatever way we work with that community, no difficulties are created by the fact that we are there.  In addition to that, we always incorporate elements of peace building and are mindful of the way our work can bring different communities together.  A part of that is ensuring there is transparency with respect to our being seen to be clear regarding who the people are whom we employ.</p></speech>

I appreciate the representatives being here highlighting these tragedies, but this message has not come across generally to people.</p><p>There are always conflicts that have a sexy appeal to the media but these places tend to be forgotten.  Our missionary work over the years concentrated on Africa.  All of this good work is a constant struggle.  I hope the opportunity of this meeting will highlight and benefit the work of the witnesses.  That we could invite them here may be rewarding for them but listening to them has been equally rewarding for us.  </p><p> Where does one start with this type of situation?  The financial aid we provide is only a drop in the ocean in terms of what needs to be done.  I appreciate that it is not the business of World Vision to try to find a political solution to what is going on but in the witnesses' experience is any progress being made such that there might come a day when they will be able to withdraw and say they contributed to that success?  Many of the problems in different parts of the world tend to be ongoing because new generations tend to keep the struggle going.  It seems that we are not getting to the grips with the real problem.  I accept this is not the concern of World Vision in that its job is to help people through aid and education.  As a committee, what can we do to help identify the real problem?  Is the issue tribal differences and so on?  I am ignorant as to what is the problem.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on what in their experience is causing this problem.  For example, is it a religious problem or a dictatorship problem?  What is the underlying problem that has not been dealt with?  I am ashamed to say that these parts of the world are forgotten.  We hear so much about other conflict areas but we rarely read or hear about South Sudan and the horrific stories relayed to us this morning.  I sincerely hope that through the media this story will get out to the general public.  This is not about the amount of money the Government is giving to World Vision.  It is important but is only a drop in the ocean.  What is more important is World Vision's obvious commitment to dealing with this situation, in respect of which it deserves moral support as well as financial support.  Perhaps following this meeting the media might give this problem the exposure it needs.  </p><p> I am 40 years in politics.  I am horrified to admit that I have only ever heard of some of these parts of the African continent in the context of what I knew in the past about the black babies and so on.  The idea that in this day and age hundreds of thousands of people have to flee their homes and countries into a neighbouring country is unreal.  I reiterate that it is extremely rewarding to hear about World Vision's commitment to this area, as is the knowledge the witnesses are passing to us today.  I sincerely hope that the committee will follow up with it on how matters are progressing.  I ask the witnesses to be straightforward, if they can, in telling us what we can do that would be of practical assistance in making this an issue of which people are aware.  I wish Mr. Keogh the best of luck in her future career.</p></speech>

I am always grateful for the Irish organisations and the example they set worldwide.  There is no doubt that Ireland is one of the leaders in providing aid. I welcome that in this instance we are aiding people in these countries to become self-sufficient, which I believe is the right route to go.  I am very involved in immigrant rights.  Irish people were once refugees.  We sought and took refuge in other countries.  Many Irish Americans have short memories of where they came from.  I am proud of World Vision and the many other organisations which do this work throughout the world.  It is in our DNA and I hope that will always be the case, never forgetting what happened to us 150 or 160 years ago.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to elaborate on the refugee camps.  It is incredible to think that Uganda has an open border in light of what it went through many years ago.  It is to be complimented and helped as well because I am sure that puts a severe strain on its budget.  It was mentioned that there are 2 million people displaced internally and 2 million in neighbouring countries.  Perhaps the witness would elaborate on whether this is the case in South Sudan only or in other countries as well.  </p> <p>  Yesterday, the Seanad had a discussion on the Palestine-Israel conflict.  In this regard, I believe there is inactivity on the part of the European Union.  Ireland has shown before that it can take the lead in taking on these countries and showing them up for what they are.  Like Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett I would like to know why these conflicts are continuing.  In terms of the EU, there is much talk but little action.  As a member of the EU, Ireland needs to stand up and be counted on this matter.  We did so previously in respect of other countries, which I am sure I do not have to mention.  We need to take action ourselves because what is being done with regard to the conflicts in these countries from a European Union point of view is inadequate.  I know Sudan has split into two countries.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on whether other countries are taking in refugees from South Sudan and, also, on the issue of internal displacement.  </p></speech>

The political initiative which members spoke about is really important.  World Vision is operating in many different countries.  Leaving aside the particular situation we are discussing today, it is not all doom and gloom.  Through our work in west Africa, we have seen countries that are succeeding.</p><p>They are democratic, and while they struggle, they are on the correct road and are getting the support they need.  South Sudan, the newest country in the world, is going through a civil war, which seems to be inevitable in the aftermath of independence, as the experiences of many countries suggest.  After independence, civil war seems to ensue.  We are talking about a place with many different tribes, which exacerbates the situation.  There are people there who want and need peace.  The children there need a future.  We have to help them in whatever way we can, through our advocacy or by other means.</p><p> We empower people on the ground.  We encourage people and help them to realise that things like equality and justice exist.  We are not imposing anything on anybody but are empowering people so that they can deal with issues for themselves.  The issue is that if people are struggling so badly that they are just existing from day to day, they cannot concentrate on anything beyond that.  We are trying to help those people to get out of the very basic situation they are in.  As Ms Garry has said, however, even in the area we are working in, we can see light at the end of the tunnel, and progress is being made.  We very much hope that some of the young people we are helping at the moment can help to bring their country out of conflict.</p></speech>

There was a war and it achieved independence.  Two South Sudanese leaders are now fighting for control.  As an NGO we cannot say much more than that, but it is very similar to what happened here in Ireland.  We cannot question what they are doing or say that they are not as civil as we are.  The same thing happened in Ireland.  It is to be hoped a resolution can be reached there, as was the case here.</p> <p>  RT&Eacute; was with me and Mr. Cunningham in South Sudan and reported from there each day.  We also appeared on "Morning Ireland".  Our national broadcaster has made an effort to raise awareness of the situation.</p> <p>  The members here are better known than I am.  I ask them please to speak about the situation as often as possible and in as many places as they can to raise awareness of this issue.  They must make sure that our Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to prioritise it, not just through funding but, if possible, through conflict resolution.  When the people of South Sudan are asked what it is they want, they do not say food or health but peace.  They know that without that there will be no end to their troubles.</p> <p>  The majority of the people who are internally displaced are South Sudanese, but there are some people in the north of the country who have come from Sudan and are now refugees in South Sudan, which adds another layer of complexity to the situation.</p> <p>  The Bidi Bidi refugee camp in Uganda has had an open door policy, which is very progressive.  It has provided refugees with plots of land, and we have supported those refugees in terms of trying to teach them how to look after that land.  There is, however, a desperate need to help Uganda to fund this.  Uganda has its own problems, so the fact that it has done this means that the rest of the world has no excuse.  It definitely needs funding and support.</p></speech>

While there has been huge movement to Uganda, over the years many South Sudanese people have moved to Kenyan refugee camps.  Recently there has been movement of people in the northern area of South Sudan to Sudan, including to areas such as the east Darfur area, which is in the very north of the country.  If a person is near a border, it becomes a good option to move across it, and when he or she gets across it, that person might find people from his or her own community living there, providing a kind of security.</p></speech>

We support the work of World Vision and it is very important.  A political resolution is required, however, and there is no impetus to find one.

The situation in South Sudan is very tricky.  The Government is in control in Juba, but outside Juba its control in certain areas is questionable.  When one is in Juba one does not feel particularly secure.  There is a feeling that anything could happen at any stage.  There is peace there at the moment, but it feels insecure, and things could get worse at any stage.  We are hoping that is not the case and that it improves.</p> <p>  The world could offer support to South Sudan, help it bring about peace and advise it on how best to go about it.  Ireland has experience in this area, so rather than dictate to South Sudan and say it is not doing a good job, we would ask that Ireland supports peace by supporting those involved in peace talks.</p></speech>

The purpose is to raise public awareness of and give the committee's endorsement to the work of many people in the most difficult areas of the world.  The figures cited by the witnesses clearly demonstrate how difficult the situation is in South Sudan.</p><p> The committee will write to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade outlining the issues discussed at this meeting and the need for the international community to do more.  We will also raise the political aspect of the issue and the likelihood of the 2015 peace agreement being revitalised.  I understand from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that our ambassador to Ethiopia and her colleagues engage in any way they can with local, regional and national leaders in South Sudan.  We will emphasise that engagement in our letter to the T&aacute;naiste.</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste will appear before the committee next Thursday to report on the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of Monday next.  I and my colleagues will no doubt raise this particular issue.  We want to send a message to the public at large who are very strong supporters of the Irish aid programme, including through the taxes they pay.  Ireland is the eighth largest donor of humanitarian aid to South Sudan in the European Union.  That South Sudan receives the second highest amount of Irish aid demonstrates a clear commitment by the Government and the Oireachtas to assist in any way we can.  This is not to underestimate the serious difficulties involved.  </p><p> I compliment the witnesses and their colleagues on the ground in South Sudan who are working in very difficult circumstances.  We wish them well.  I also compliment Ms Keogh on her work.  She was a good colleague in the Oireachtas over the years and it is good to see her back.  I wish Mr. McLoughlin every success in his new role as he takes over as chief executive.</p><p> On behalf of the joint committee, I formally thank all of the witnesses for their presentations and for answering members' questions.  Our next meeting, on Thursday, 31 May, will be with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Ivan Cooper, director of public policy with The Wheel, and also a director of Alliance Insurance Reform; Mr. Colm Croffy, director of the Association of Irish Festival Events, AOIFE; and Mr. Alex Sinclair, chief executive of Motorsport Ireland.  Unfortunately, Mr. Cooper has to attend the annual conference of The Wheel today so he will have to excuse himself at approximately 10.50 a.m.  As I forwarded the presentation to the committee last week and members may have read it, I propose to stick to the key salient details today.<br/><br/>The Alliance for Insurance Reform brings together representative bodies from the community, charity, sports and small and medium sized business sectors across Ireland, representing over 35,000 organisations, 645,000 employees, 41,300 volunteers and, with the joining of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, this week, 150,000 co-operative members, to demand rapid action to end crippling insurance costs.  Full details of our membership are available at Appendix 1.<br/><br/>The creation of the alliance is a response to countless stories from small organisations where services and jobs are being affected by excessive insurance premiums, liability and motor.  Members will have heard many such stories already.  That said, there is a great deal of fear among many organisations.  They are afraid to go public on their experiences because they are at the mercy of one underwriter or because they might draw additional claims on themselves.  What members are hearing is only the tip of the iceberg.  However, we do not intend to focus on stories today.  Rather, we intend to cut to the chase and focus on analysis and solutions.<br/><br/>We are at a turning point in our approach to insurance in Ireland.  The current system is dysfunctional to the extent that what is supposed to be a service industry that facilitates the operation of society has become an extractive industry, taking over &euro;2 billion in motor and liability premiums annually, protected and made compulsory in many cases by the State and so expensive that it represents a major threat to the viability of many of the organisations that form the backbone of our nation.  A survey of 950 organisations within the alliance, carried out by Am&aacute;rach Research in January, found that since 2013 nearly half of respondents have seen their premiums rise by more than 30%, while more than one fifth have seen rises of over 70%.  This is in the broader context of a consumer price index, CPI, increase of 0.9% in the same period.  Two thirds of respondents also reported having increased excesses or new exclusions added to their policies, an equally damaging trend that severely restricts the ability of community organisations to develop and creates additional exposure to cost.  Critically, 45% of respondents cited insurance as a threat to the future of their organisation.  A summary of the research is available at Appendix 2.<br/><br/>Our members feel that it is the insurance industry and the legal profession that have the strongest voices in the corridors of power.  Policyholders feel that we have no voice.  This is amplified by the recent Collins Institute report for Fine Gael which concluded that the Central Bank, the State institution charged with protecting insurance policyholders, is too focused on the needs of the financial services industry.  There is certainly a great deal of activity around the area right now, but our concern is that much will be discussed and little will be done.  It is not in the interests of the insurance companies or lawyers operating in this market that anything changes.  If we were them, we would huff and puff as a show of empathy with our customers but we would fight tooth and nail behind the scenes to stop real change.  We would cite constitutional issues, data protection issues or competition issues.  We would suggest self-regulation, agree protocols, ease off on the aggressive profit-taking for a while until the fuss died down or just string out the debate until the next election.  We would do anything to stop real reform.  <br/><br/>In the past eight weeks we have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, and his civil servants, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, the Data Protection Commission, the Personal Injuries Commission, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is clear to us that many elements of the work of the cost of insurance working group, CIWG, are grinding to a halt with the dead hand of vested interests evident.  The buck stops firmly with policy makers.  The actions we are suggesting are in the areas of transparency, consistency and prevention.  We believe them to be just, proportionate, feasible and achievable within a limited timeframe and that, ultimately, they will be effective.  They are also practical ways of solving the insurance crisis and we hope the committee will consider and support them.<br/><br/>I do not intend to go through all of the actions in detail but I will go into some detail on the transparency issue.  The insurance industry is of systemic importance to the proper functioning of Irish society and is enshrined as such in much legislation and regulation, yet there is virtually no transparency in this market, either at industry or individual policyholder level.  In regard to control of the data coming from the new national claims information database, we demand that control of analysis and reporting of that data<b><i></i></b>be given to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board rather than the Central Bank.  The PIAB has the expertise and funding necessary and no additional legislation would be required as sections 54 and 55 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 already allow for this function.  Even if this legislation is cleared, and with the best will in the world, we will not have any useable data for at least another five years.  This creates an enormous vacuum.  With this in mind, we are calling for the reinstatement of the blue book.  We insist that the blue book be immediately reinstated and enhanced to restore the only transparency which previously existed in the market before the Central Bank unilaterally discontinued it in 2016.<br/><br/>We are also asking that the agreed large increases protocol be scrapped and the issue revisited.  The first recommendation in the CIWG motor insurance report was that insurers set out reasons for large increases in premiums to consumers.  The protocol produced from this recommendation was one of the first actions to be ticked as completed in the CIWG updates.  However, the protocol, as agreed between the Department of Finance and the insurance industry - an example of which I sent as a link in the document - is a good example of how the CIWG is being strangled.  We would be better off without it, as it only creates the impression that something has been achieved when it has not.  We want a meaningful protocol agreed for both motor and liability insurance policyholders that individualises explanations with clear calculations showing the basis of premium charges.<br/><br/>In the transparency area, we are seeking the reinstatement of the 2003 insurance industry IBEC protocol for dealing with claims.  Almost a year was spent by the Department of Finance and Insurance Ireland talking in circles about a protocol for notifying policyholders about the progress of claims against them before the Department discovered a pre-existing protocol agreed between the insurance industry and IBEC in 2003.  The insurance industry is now resisting its implementation anew.  We demand that it is implemented immediately, backed by legislation, for both the motor insurance and liability insurance sectors.  A copy of this protocol is available at Appendix 3.<br/><br/>I will briefly outline the other six asks we have of this committee.  In terms of consistency, we are seeking a change to the approach used in calculating the book of quantum.  The Court of Appeal has already set the parameters for this changed approach.  We ask that they be put in place.  We also ask that judges who award damages in excess of the book of quantum set out detailed reasoning for doing so, such that we know what is going on in the courts when it comes to sky high awards.<br/><br/>In terms of prevention, we are seeking the linking of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 so that where a person's claim is dismissed because he or she has presented exaggerated or misleading information, the case would be automatically referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for potential prosecution.  We are awaiting the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit, which has been stalled now for six months.  I understand the file has been with Insurance Ireland for the past six months.  We want this unit put in place immediately.  We are also seeking regulation of claims management companies, also known as claims harvesters.  We believe these companies are adding fuel to the fire of fraudulent, exaggerated and misleading claims.  The UK has legislated for these companies with just cause since 2007.  We are asking that parallel legislation be introduced in Ireland.<br/><br/>We are also seeking amendment of section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<i>, </i>to bring us in line with the data protection legislation<b><i>.  </i></b>Currently, our members are caught between a rock and a hard place in that they are obliged to delete bulk CCTV footage within a month yet claims can come in for up to two years.</p><p> We want that amended as a matter of urgency.  </p><p> As an alliance we have put a lot of work into addressing this crucial issue for our members, their employees and volunteers.  We hope that the committee can help us get action quickly and we are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I am the manager of the mart in Donegal town.  I am also the chairperson of the Donegal Mart Society and of the Associated Livestock Marts throughout the country.  I have been a manager in Donegal town for 12 years and have been there for about 15 years in total.  We have faced many challenges over the years but these insurance hikes are one of the greatest we have ever had and if we do something on this, and quickly, marts will close.</p> <p>  Livestock marts annual premiums are rising at a shocking rate.  My submission to members includes a table with figures from various marts across Ireland which show what is happening.  There are approximately 85 to 90 marts in Ireland, some open and closed and we may see a reduction in number in the next couple of years, although I hope not.  An estimated 1.7 million cattle and 800,000 sheep go through them annually, with a value of &euro;1.2 billion.  FBD is the mart sector's primary insurance provider.  We cannot get so much as a quote from any other insurance company so we are at FBD's mercy.  Insurance providers view marts as having high significant exposure with injuries to employees and members of the public.  We have had many meetings with FBD over the years.  In 2016 we were asked to a meeting in Letterkenny where we were told that it was taking new safety measures, that an insurance assessor would be dispatched to all the marts and that we would have to make all these changes for health and safety reasons and to keep the premiums down.  We had no option but to take out a loan and we spent about &euro;15,000 at the time to undertake these works.  Lo and behold, the premiums increased anyway the next year.</p> <p>  I should add that we had two claims in 2014 and 2015 which I felt should not have been settled.  From speaking to most marts across Ireland, every manager will say the same thing, namely, that claims are being settled that should not be, and money is being handed out.  However, that is not something we will fix today.  It is public liability claims that are our biggest problem.</p> <p>  This year the accident in Mohill mart brought everything to a head.  It was a horrible accident and the man involved was very badly injured.  Changes had to be made.   The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, one of the leading bodies in the marts, had talks with different organisations, including with FBD, and many ICOS marts decided on a no-access policy into the marts or the corridors.  Some mart managers feel that does away with the whole reason behind a mart in the first place, that one cannot go down the yards to see the cattle, but there is agreement that something must be done and we cannot have people getting injured.  We are stuck between a rock and a hard place, we do not know where to go with it.  </p> <p>  There is also the cost of changing the marts around.  The mart in Donegal town is an old building and was 50 years in operation last year.  We need to put in a walkway across the yard which would be a large expense, and it is money that we do not have.  My job is to try to make sure that the mart breaks even each year.  It is impossible to get money like that now and when one operates from a 50 year old building, one spends a great deal of money all the time.  </p> <p>  There are also many marts which have seen huge hikes despite having no claims.  That is very unfair and I would like to know the reason for that.  </p> <p>  I am with Associated Livestock Marts, Donegal Marts Association and we are very fearful for the future of the marts.  Marts are needed in every town and village.  There was a reason they were established in the first place, to trade livestock, but it is also a social thing for farmers who might not see anyone from one end of the week to the next.  They go to the mart every week to discuss the price of cattle, but it is also hugely important for communities, villages and towns.  When a farmer comes to town, he spends money.  </p> <p>  I included a lot of background information in the note I gave to members.  I do not want to keep members all day but if we get nothing else from this meeting, it is that we get full disclosure from insurance providers on all mart annual premiums, their rate of increase, the factors contributing to the rising costs and details of claims, both contested and paid out by the insurance providers over the last five years throughout the country.  If we see that, we might see another side of what has been happening.  We are not being told it all.  Deputy Pearse Doherty checked this for me last year and we were told something that obviously was not true.  I have included part of a response I received in the briefing document I prepared for members.  We would also like assurances from FBD or whatever other providers.  We need to talk to them.  The marts cannot close but they cannot pay what is currently being asked of them.  I understand that we have to make changes, whether it is a viewing period for cattle or something else, and we must come to some agreement but insurance companies cannot say that they will wait five years for changes to be made, they must reduce the premiums back down now.  A mart which was paying &euro;22,000, for example, is now being asked to pay &euro;87,000.  That mart will not be open in five years.  We need to act now.  I want to stress that as long as I have worked in the mart and dealt with FBD, I have always found the staff very helpful and courteous but this must be addressed.  </p> <p>  Finally, I ask the Government to give serious consideration to a funding scheme to help marts.  It is the only thing that we can do as we must make these changes.  In the case of smaller marts, it could be CCTV cameras.  If, as my colleague noted earlier, we could change that so it would be in the 30 days and it would not be deleted, that would be very important.  We need funding for a scheme like that or for overhead walkways in the bigger marts because we are just about breaking even now.</p></speech>

The availability and cost of insurance are important considerations in developing and sustaining Men&rsquo;s Sheds.</p> <p>  Men&rsquo;s Sheds provide a valuable and welcomed service to local communities.  The initiative was introduced to Ireland in 2011 and there are now more than 400 sheds located in communities across the 32 counties, with more than 10,000 men in regular attendance.  A shed should be a safe environment where men can meet and participate in various activities.  In this way, they can overcome social isolation, improve personal well-being and contribute to the community.  </p> <p>  The rapid growth of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in Ireland indicates its value to members and their families as well as their wider communities.  The Irish Men&rsquo;s Sheds Association offers an umbrella organisation to affiliated sheds, in particular to those in the early stages of development.  Our priorities include sustaining sheds, individually and collectively, improving the well-being of shed members, co-ordinating volunteers and communicating key messages.  In this capacity we have heard countless inspirational stories from shed members and their families about the benefits of participation in a shed, sometimes life changing experiences.  </p> <p>  Once a shed has overcome the challenge of finding a suitable property, it must then obtain suitable insurance.  While this may be a common challenge for many community groups, the nature of activities in a shed may incorporate particular risks, such as undertaking workshop activities like carpentry.</p><p> It is a precondition of the Irish Men's Sheds Association, IMSA, membership that affiliated sheds have appropriate insurance in place for the activities they undertake in order to protect the health and safety of shed members.  Unfortunately, our experience to date indicates limited availability of insurance and volatile insurance premiums.  In response to these issues, which we believe threaten the sustainability of sheds, IMSA is continually exploring insurance options on behalf of affiliated sheds.  While we have had some success, the issue continues to frustrate many sheds, most recently the perceived growth in insurance premiums.  The pain is particularly acute for small sheds challenged by low economies of scale and with limited capacity to raise subscriptions or attract donations.  In addition, standardised policies do not accommodate the diversity of activities in local sheds and their very different insurance risk profiles.   </p><p> We are just coming towards the end of a nationwide engagement programme with our sheds, which we call "cluster meetings", where we bring together all the sheds in each county for open dialogue on key issues.  We are halfway through that process at the moment.  Insurance is one of the main issues we discuss, including how different sheds overcome the challenge.  The cost of insurance brings significant pressure on many sheds with limited financial resources.  We have recently developed a good working relationship with one particular insurance provider, FBD Insurance, for which we are very grateful.  This is a practical partnership.  FBD Insurance has local agents on the ground who can meet members of local sheds to discuss ways to make the shed a safer place. </p><p> It is also important to acknowledge that insurance underwriting is a complex discipline of which we and our affiliated sheds have limited direct experience.  We can only speak from the perspective of a community group that requires insurance and struggles to obtain it at a cost we believe to be reasonable.  We recognise the role of this committee in advising relevant Ministers on proposals that promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning.  While we are not making a specific proposal today, we welcome the opportunity to speak as an interested party with practical experience.  We also recognise the commercial needs of the insurance industry and our obligations as community groups providing services to the public.  However, we simply wish to express a real concern that the availability and cost of insurance may needlessly restrict important community services such as ours.  By their nature, most community groups are thinly spread across the country and, unlike commercial enterprises, they find it difficult to consolidate in pursuit of scale without negatively impacting on their reach into communities.  In this context, the threat of continually rising insurance costs could threaten the sustainability of men's sheds in Ireland. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Ryan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018052400002#F00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to speak this morning.  I work with the GAA and I am joined by my colleague, Ms Ciara Clarke.  I do not come to the committee with solutions to the difficulties it faces and I do not have specific proposals.  However, I will offer some context and background on how the GAA organises its insurance affairs.  What focuses our minds in this context is the fact that the single biggest bill a GAA club faces every year is its insurance bill.<br/><br/>The GAA provides a range of insurance cover for its units and members.  Cover is a combination of externally procured insurance policies and self-funded insurance.  It applies within the Twenty-six Counties and internationally, and is compulsory.  We negotiate and buy whatever insurance we require centrally and then recharge the costs to the units.  We take that approach because in the past we found that without central co-ordination, we were not in a position to guarantee that each unit would obtain insurance, in the first instance, or that, where insurance was provided, that it was adequate.  For this reason, we manage the programme centrally.  <br/><br/>The GAA has two separate subsidiary entities, one governing insurance and the other governing the injury fund.  They are accounted for and audited separately, and each of the entities discharges the insurance premiums and recharges the costs of those premiums back to the units.  They meet these costs by recharging premiums and by levying a predefined percentage of gate receipts into those funds.  Typically, when one pays &euro;20 or &euro;30 to go to a game - and hopefully many members of the committee will be at matches over the summer - some 5% of the gate receipt goes into our insurance fund and 6% goes into a fund specifically for injured players.  We are in the fortunate position of having two people working on insurance affairs for us, one of whom is Ms Clarke.  We also have a national insurance and risk committee which is chaired by Mr. Sheamus Howlin.  Some members of the committee may know Mr. Howling, who was unable to join us today and sends his apologies.  <br/><br/>We provide three main strands of insurance and challenges apply to all three.  The first is property insurance.  GAA property is defined as property held in trust under the rules of the association.  By definition, once a club has vested its facilities in the GAA, it will be covered in respect of property under the insurance programme we provide.  The scale of the programme means that our policy does not name every individual ground.  It names the four or five big grounds we are all familiar with, but thereafter it kicks in automatically for every other ground.  <br/><br/>We go to tender annually, either in October or November.  We go to the market seeking insurance to cover our properties.  As previous speakers noted and others will confirm, this is not an easy process.  However, we have been able to secure appropriate cover in the past and we are grateful for that.  The cover applies to every ground in the country, which in turn causes issues for us.  The fund pays its insurance premiums to the insurance providers.  It may be one provider or a portfolio of providers.  Over the course of the year, central council will recharge to each county an insurance premium based on its size, relative scale and claims history over the preceding five years.  The claims are managed by the insurance company and a loss adjuster under the direction of the GAA insurance staff.  This type of insurance is almost self-insurance.  The first and very substantial portion of annual claims cost is borne by the GAA fund and it is only when the claims cost goes above a particular threshold that the insurance cover kicks in.  It is an attempt to manage the insurance premium costs by manipulating and managing that threshold and the individual excesses that apply to each club when it makes a claim.  <br/><br/><b></b>Liability insurance is perhaps our biggest challenge in terms of insurance.  We provide cover centrally and globally for all of our clubs, but the key point we reiterate to clubs all the time is that the cover provides protection in the realm of playing and promoting hurling and football for the most part.  That is what the GAA is about at a community level.  All the other activities in which the GAA engages are either covered by permission or not covered.  Clubs can apply to us for insurance for fundraising events, club days and events and we consider whether we are able to provide cover.  There are some items for which we cannot and do not provide cover.  For example, and contrary to what people may believe having seen them in various clubs around the country, we do not insure bouncy castles.  These are a particular problem and a particular form of risk and we cannot and do not offer cover to people who place bouncy castles in clubs.  Where a club extends the use of its facilities to third parties, we always ask that the organisations in question in turn provide cover to us, show evidence of cover or offer some kind of an indemnity to protect the club.  <br/><br/>Liability cover applies in exactly the same way as property insurance.  The bills are charged centrally.  Central council, as an entity, contributes a lump sum to that fund and collects a levy from the gate receipts and we in turn levy the counties and the clubs.<br/><br/>The third strand I will discuss is not technically insurance, although it is referred to colloquially as such by our members and the organisation.  It is the injury fund, which we provide on a self-funded basis for players, referees, coaches and team mentors who might unfortunately suffer an injury during the course of the playing year.  The fund differs significantly from the liability and property programmes I explained earlier in that it is entirely self-funded.  We collect a premium or levy from each club based on the number of teams it fields in each competition over the course of the year.  We also hive off a small portion from every gate receipt of every game through the course of the year.  This income goes into the injury fund.  If a person is unfortunate enough to suffer an injury and it is verified by a referee or club official a claim will be submitted to us and benefits are paid out on a pre-ordained scale.</p><p>The costs must be vouched.  We provide a very modest level of compensation for loss of wages and such things.  We are proud of that scheme and we guard it jealously.  We think it is core to the benefits that we are able to offer our members.  The operation of the scheme on a day-to-day basis is run by an outsourced service provider.</p><p> If it is in order, I might offer a number of metrics, which were not included in the material provided to the secretariat, such as recent trends and specific challenges under the headings I have mentioned.</p><p> In regard to our property insurance in the course of the past five years, from 2012 to 2017, we have had a cumulative total of 340 property insurance claims at a total cost to the association of &euro;8.5 million.  By and large those claims relate to storm damage.  It is an odd facet of the organisation.  We are very proud of the scope and reach we have but by definition, that means we have a pitch in every parish and in every corner of the country.  Any time there is an adverse weather event, one can be sure that a GAA pitch somewhere will suffer.  Related to that, members will have ball nets and they signify that there is a GAA pitch somewhere.  They are a constant source of worry and claim because they are difficult to maintain and again in high winds, they are the first casualty.</p><p> In terms of liability insurance, our claims reserves total &euro;12 million.  Our annual premiums have doubled during the course of the past five years but the disheartening thing about the claims experience here is that of the &euro;12 million reserve, some &euro;7 million of those claims relate to things we do not consider to be at the core of what we do.  They are not related to hurling and football but to other events that took place in clubs, be they fundraising or social events and so on.</p><p> As for the injury fund, we manage about 6,000 claims for players over the course of the years.  That is typical and it has been a fairly stable figure during the past five years that approximately 6,000 people will suffer an injury or approximately 6,000 injuries will be incurred.  The cumulative cost to the association during that five-year period was about &euro;45 million, of which &euro;30 million is funded by team subscriptions and by clubs and the remaining &euro;15 million is funded by the central governing body.  I hope that gives members the scale and context of what is an issue for every GAA club around the country, no matter how big or small in scale.</p><p> The challenges we face fall into three categories.  I will not labour this point because it will arise in the context of the discussions.  The challenges are the increased volume of claims, the increased cost of claims and some difficulties we perceive as an outside party with the legal process and how that operates.  We also would be the first to admit there are challenges in the insurance realm for ourselves, in terms of how we conduct our own business.  We are trying to manage things and to improve all the time.  I am happy to deal with any questions from members.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses to the committee and thank them for the presentations, which are very informative.  Later on we will have a session with the insurance company FBD, where we will be able to tease some of this issue out.</p> <p>  I will begin by raising a concern that has been raised with me in County Donegal about the Irish Men's Sheds Association.  I also am aware that a number of men's sheds have closed down recently, in Cork for example.  Some of the established men's sheds groups have told me that the cost of insurance is a potential contributory factor for them having to make an imminent decision to close their shed.  Mr. Sheridan mentioned in his opening statement that there are 400 sheds at present.  Arguably, the areas that have a low subscription base, as they do not have the level of population, have a greater need for such a facility in the first place.  Will we now see a reverse trend with some sheds having to close?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Sheridan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018052400002#G00400"><p>We carry out an annual survey that give us raw data and evidence.  In the past five weeks, I have seen probably 200 sheds and probably have been in ten to 12 counties and so I have seen every shed, including all the sheds in County Donegal.  While the cost of insurance is a threat and a potential risk, the sheds have not closed because of insurance at present.  From day one, we have always seen that some sheds might come and go but that can be for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes, getting a premises can be a real issue, sometimes it is the ability to attract members and at other times, it can be a question of getting the funding, which includes being able to pay for items such as insurance.  Insurance directly is not a core issue for the sustainability of sheds but is a potential threat which could really threaten the sustainability of sheds throughout the country.  We are looking at it very closely.  Sometimes smaller sheds with fewer than 15 members must pay more per head for insurance than a large group in an urban area with 40 to 50 members.  We have raised our concern about this with the insurance companies and the companies are looking at that issue because it is a real issue.  It is in small communities in rural areas that the men's sheds have a profound impact on the members and their community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018052400002#G00500"><p>Has the Irish Men's Sheds Association looked at group insurance, which is available across the board in different organisations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Sheridan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018052400002#G00600"><p>That is a facility we are considering.  We are expecting proposals from insurance companies on that at present.  We are also consulting with experts in the field.  Again we have limited expertise in our team.  We have five staff members for more than 500 sheds.  We are a young, constantly-evolving organisation but we are looking at how a group scheme might work for an umbrella organisation.  It is also important to stress that no two sheds are exactly the same.  We might have a shed in Ballinteer in Dublin, who have just social meetings.  They come together and they meet.  It is important to remember that first and foremost, sheds are social spaces in which the activities are decided by empowering the men to make the decisions.  If a shed that is meeting purely on a social basis is compared with a shed with a large workshop where the members might be creating bits and pieces, they are not the same.  It is difficult for insurers to categorise them as one.  That is a real challenge for us.  We hope to make considerable progress in the next few months on the matter of insurance and see the options available for sheds.  One of our main priorities is to try to see what can we do and what can the insurance companies do to arrive at an option.  We hope that raising the issue today will help to bring the issue of insurance to the fore and help us in that journey to try to find affordable and reasonable rates of insurance in order that sheds can continue to have the impact at a local community level they have had to date.</p></speech>

I will be brief but I have questions for other witnesses.  Ms McGuinness from the Donegal Co-operative Livestock Mart gave us a very helpful table, which shows the dramatic increases in insurance in the past three years from 2015 to date.  I see the cost of insurance for three of the marts in my constituency, namely, the Donegal, Stranorlar and Milford marts, all three of which experienced increases in excess of 100%.  The increase for the Milford mart was 114% and yet it had no claims.  It is difficult to see how this can be justified.  Ms McGuinness mentioned that she had a meeting with an insurance company back in 2016 or 2017.  What justification has Ms McGuinness heard from the industry in respect of the levelling of such increases?  In particular, I wish to reference the response of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, which in fairness to him would have been provided to him by Insurance Ireland and is provided in the supporting documentation.  Insurance Ireland has advised that it is not aware of any recent major increases in the cost of insurance for agricultural mart owners.</p><p>That concerns me because if they do not think that a 100% increase over a three-year period is a major increase we have a problem with the insurance industry.  How has the industry been able to justify such levels of increases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eimear McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018052400002#H00200"><p>When we went into our first meeting in May or June 2016 in the Donegal area the insurance assessor examined how to improve health and safety, which was an issue.  I have been told by other mart managers that the same thing happened throughout the country.  When he came to our mart we had to put in safety pens for people to step into to avoid cattle on the passageways.  They cost a lot of money.  The insurer also wanted handrails and spoke about many other issues that day.  It was basically a question and answer session on how we could improve things because they explained that the claims were drastic and something had to change.  We felt the only thing we could do at that time was implement the safety measures, which we did.  I told the committee at the time that we had no choice but to do this and we took out a loan and did the work.  We cannot afford to pay any more insurance year on year.  That was the first meeting.</p> <p>  I had a second meeting with the insurance company when it paid out on a claim of ours which I was totally against at the time.  We had a field across from the mart and a man said he had been bitten by a horse in it.  A livestock mart does not own or keep any animals but there was a horse in this field.  I felt that claim should not have been paid.  I wrote a letter stating that to FBD as our insurance provider.  The company felt it had to pay out because that was cheaper than going to court and trying to argue the case.  I was angry over that.  I met the underwriters in Cavan town.  The same happened that day.  I brought my colleagues from Stranorlar and Milford marts with me and we spent the whole day discussing different ways to stop these public liability claims.  That is what is causing the problem, not animal injuries or anything like that.  The underwriter talked about not letting anybody into the yard.  Many mart managers feel that cannot happen but I feel unfortunately because of the way the insurance system works that is all we can do.  </p> <p>  We probably cannot fix everything today but I would like to come to some sort of understanding that the premiums have to come down.  In answer to the question the insurance companies say the public liability claims are too drastic and they are losing money on the mart sector.  It is of no benefit to them to have it.  My feeling is that they take a lot of money from farmers throughout the industry and they should be able to absorb the cost into their companies.</p></speech>

She has given us the data and how, for example, the premium for the Tuam co-operative has gone from &euro;34,000 to &euro;79,000.  I am not familiar with the profit margins of the mart.  Ms McGuinness said her job is to break even.  I do not know if that cost is easily absorbed.  If the marts continue to see this type of increase, which is in excess of 100%, with some increases of 255%, repeat over the next three years, would we definitely see the closure of marts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eimear McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018052400002#H00400"><p>Most definitely.  We are a service.  We do not set out to make a lot of money.  Suckler cow numbers are reducing drastically throughout the country.  That is a major issue for us too. There has been a drastic reduction in the number of cattle coming through our doors already this year.  That has not spread throughout the country yet but in Donegal there has been a drastic reduction.  That will eat into profits.  The Property Services Regulatory Authority, PRSA, now regulates us as well.  We have to do more book work.  Marts are 50 years old.  We put up a new office last year and before that we had to put on a new roof.  Cattle abuse livestock pens.  There is constant work to be done.  Everything is increasing in price.  We work to accommodate the different costs each year but we cannot accommodate for something that jumps so drastically.  We are a very small mart and that has to be taken into account.  We make our money on whatever stock comes through the door and that is reducing each year.  I set up a separate business last year sending sheep direct for slaughter and I had to do that to make up for the drop in numbers coming through.  It is eaten up every year, and that is all down to insurance.</p></speech>

The mart sector is part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  It also deals with isolation.  Ms McGuinness has made several helpful recommendations.  I want to focus on the idea of a grant funding scheme to help marts cover the costs associated with bringing their necessary operational changes into line with the proposed health and safety policies.  It is a recognition from the sector that we need to do something different to improve health and safety in anticipation of insurance costs coming down, which has not happened in the past.  I mentioned that proposal briefly to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, when I saw the opening statement.  Over many years there has been State and EU support for the agricultural sector, for slatted sheds and so forth, some of which has been quite generous because we understand the importance of the agricultural sector to our economy and to the fabric of rural Ireland.  I was interested to see that such support did not already exist for marts, which are the end point and sometimes the starting point in the process.  Have there been any discussions with the Department or the Minister on this or does Ms McGuinness want to start the process of getting this committee's support to have a grant-funded scheme bringing the marts up to a safer standard?</p></speech>

I am sure the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society has had talks with different bodies.  I believe it has met the Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy, and I hope this issue was discussed with him.  I am bringing it to the table today because it is necessary.  I hope maybe it would start here.  If we can get nothing else out of today's meeting we need that.  It has to happen.  Where would I get the money to start making more changes in the mart?  I do not know how much safer I can make it.  I could put in extra cameras but that would cost another few thousand euro.  There are health and safety issues.  I met a company recently that will go through all our human resources for more insurance costs.  It would protect us and do our health and safety work for us.  That would cost us is in the region of &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000.  Where do I come up with all this money?  At the same time there is no way around it.  I know that is what the insurance companies will ask us to do this year.  I have not received my renewal notice although I asked for it.  The table I gave the committee dates from the end of 2014 but we are discussing 2018.  My insurance does not expire until July.</p><p>I do not know how much my premium will be.  Some other marts are in the same position.  I hope the Government will do something about that.</p></speech>

We have been dealing with insurance for many years.  To be honest, I hope this gets coverage as it reminds me of other issues.  As a group, the witnesses are bringing to the table something that we did not get with various other presentations.  They are at the coalface.  We had a similar experience with mortgages, which came about with four excellent witnesses.  I hope the same happens here and I hope the media cover this meeting.  The witnesses went back over the past number of years.  By how much did premiums increase in 2017 and 2018?  I want to get some context.  Are we seeing different premiums now?  We know they have been increasing but what how much are they now?  Will the witnesses give a brief overview of the percentage increase and whether it is affecting members?</p></speech>

This is the key to the issue.  According to the email in question:</p><blockquote>I received a telephone call from [a person] in our office on Friday afternoon informing me that you had sent on the premium for 2018.  My first reaction was that I thought she was joking but when it emerged she was not, my sentiments turned to shock and anger.  I have taken the weekend to reflect on this and discuss with my colleagues and directors, and we are all in agreement that this premium is an outrageous amount and cannot be justified in any way.  Our board cannot and will not pay this.  I have checked back on the premiums since 2015 and it has emerged that these have increased by almost 100% in just four years.  The figure in 2015 was &euro;8,900 and they are now seeking &euro;16,300, which amounts to almost 17% of our total grant allocation from the funding authority.</blockquote></speech>

The increases that these organisations are having to contend with are not being catered for by the funding authorities.  This is putting such organisations in a real and serious bind.  Contrary to what has come forward so far, we have evidence of organisations that are cutting back, suspending services and even closing down.  I will conclude on this point.  The email in question continues:</p><blockquote>It is the view of the board that the insurance company has no justification whatsoever for these levels of increases, either on a professional or ethical level.  Such increases are morally reprehensible.  It amounts to legalised extortion.  [The organisation] has conducted its operations, programmes and projects for the past 39 years to the highest levels of professionalism, compliance and health and safety.  Our governance exceeds the required levels of all Government funding Departments.  What makes this massive increase more astonishing and appalling is the fact that the organisation has an exemplary track record in terms of its insurance and claims history.  There is no history of claims, other than one outstanding &quot;spurious and unproven&quot; claim relating to the lifting of a table.  </blockquote> <p>That is what is going on.  I am under terrible pressure.  I thank the committee for accommodating me in this way.  There have been huge hikes in the absence of claims.<br/><br/>The issue here is that insurance costs are beginning to strangle the life out of community and voluntary organisations.  A social enterprise that provides much-needed transport services to people with disabilities has seen its insurance premiums double from &euro;65,000 to &euro;130,000.  As a result of these increased costs, the organisation has cut back on its services and reduced its workforce.  It is paying more for insurance than it is paying for petrol as it provides disability transport services, if members can imagine that.  It appears that what is everyone's responsibility appears to be nobody's responsibility.<br/><br/>Our view is that there is a market failure here.  It is incumbent on our Legislature to get to grips with it, understand it and put in place the correctives that are needed.  The character of our local communities is at risk here.  It is virtually impossible to raise funds to meet the cost of insurance.  State funders are not prepared to increase the amount of funding required to meet insurance costs.  As a result, our communities will be degraded by reduced activity or the cessation of services.  Voluntary board members give freely of their time and have to cope with ever-increasing compliance requirements across the board.  The cost of insurance has brought some of them to breaking point.  I thank the committee for accommodating me.</p></speech>

IPB Insurance has advised city and county managers that for some level of celebratory community event, such as a Hallowe'en celebration, a community parade, a civic engagement or a heritage re-enactment in a town square, a public indemnity of between &euro;6.3 million and &euro;10.5 million is required.  For every extra &euro;1 million in indemnity that a festival committee has to come up with, the insurance premium increases by approximately &euro;1,500.  When AOIFE was founded in 1993, the two midwives to our association were the Irish Music Rights Organisation, which was looking for ridiculous copyright charges, and the insurance industry of Ireland.  There was just one provider in the system at the time.  In the early 1990s, some 28% of every &pound;1 being raised by not-for-profit festival committees was being spent on insurance.</p></speech>

It was interesting to hear my colleague from the livestock co-operative sector discussing all the changes and regulatory improvements in health and safety that her members are prepared to make.  When we were formed in 1993, we went down the road of getting a combined insurance policy to look after all the members in the country.  At that time, we agreed with the industry as part of the scheme that we would improve health and safety standards.  Every festival that was going to approach a city or county hall would have a health and safety officer, a health and safety statement and a risk assessment done by volunteers.  We have done all that now.  We were told 25 years ago that this would involve reductions in premiums and in claims.  What is happening now?  It does not matter how many pages of health and safety assessment or hours of risk assessment we have done.  Even though the insurance companies insist that we appoint safety officers and we photograph incidents when they occur, they settle when the book of evidence is provided.  If our insurers are ultimately going to write a cheque anyway, what encouragement is that for the 40,000 volunteers throughout the country who are running safe and compliant events regularly?</p></speech>

The Senator might reasonably ask why such an increase has taken place.  The reason for it is our claims experience.  Nobody in this country is prepared to discuss the matter of insurance with us.  When we go to Lloyd's of London, which is the only group that is prepared to put together a syndicate to provide cover for us, we are told that Lloyd's will not go into that market because it cannot predict what way claims will go if it has to deal with them.  It is a complete lottery.</p> <p>  We have lost four major events this year, including the Galway International Rally, which brought significant business to the Galway region in February, a time of the year when there was nothing else taking place in the region.  All of our sporting activities are run by volunteers who cannot take the risk of taking on this huge premium.  It is just not there.  We do not have the reserves to provide for it.  As a result, we are running on a week-to-week basis at the moment.</p><p>That is unsustainable.  </p></speech>

On transparency, my colleagues are correct.  We are in a crisis.  However, it is a crisis in a dark room because there is no data and as long as the insurance industry resists the presentation of comprehensive data, then it will continue to be so.  From that point of view, the most immediate thing would be to reinstate the blue book.</p></speech>

I thank the stakeholders for coming in and giving us their presentation.  I know Mr. Boland for a while.  I was elected in 2002 and insurance was an issue then also.  The then Minister, Ms Mary Harney, established the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to try to deal with the issue.  I was a businessman myself and I saw my insurance go from &euro;14,000 up to &euro;78,000 at that time.  In reference to Mr. Tom Ryan, the director general of the GAA, I am Chairman of my local hurling club.  We have a health and safety officer within our club to ensure the grounds are up to standard so we do not have a claim.  It is a big issue with GAA clubs.</p> <p>  I raised this issue during Leaders' Questions recently.  A meeting was to take place between Mr. Boland, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy.  Will Mr. Boland brief us on the outcome of that meeting?  Was he confident coming out that something will happen or was he deflated?  I think there is a box ticking exercise going on at the moment.  Public meetings are being held by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Government seemingly behind closed doors from what I can gather.  I got my invite to go to the one in Galway at the last minute.  I wanted to go but unfortunately I was unable to change my diary to attend.  Was the Alliance for Insurance Reform invited to the one in Galway or was there any engagement regarding the agendas of the meetings?  </p> <p>  Is PIAB working or does it need reform?  Is it too influenced by the legal profession on claims going through?  My final question is for all of the witnesses.  I was sorry to see the Galway Rally cancelled.  My nephew used to be involved in that, God be good to him.  He passed away.  How many events, roughly, are being cancelled around the country now due to insurance issues?  I know the GAA is probably the second largest landowner after the State.  The Irish Public Bodies Insurance scheme - which insures all the public bodies, public streets and public parks - needs to get involved.  It needs to start working with groups such as the men's shed association and charitable organisations to provide insurance cover.  Many of these events take place in public parks where people are charged and &euro;1.2 million or &euro;1.5 million of insurance cover must be shown upfront.  Has there been any engagement with the Irish Public Bodies Insurance scheme to see if it can work with the groups present?  I think it should.  I am not a member of this committee but perhaps it should be brought in here to answer if it can work with the witnesses on various events.  </p> <p>  What engagements do the groups present have with the major insurance companies?  Will they engage and talk?  I know they are answerable to one person and that is their shareholder.  At the end of the year, when they publish their accounts, all they want to do is show what profits have been made.  That is their goal and objective.  I met with the insurance regulator some years ago and, to be honest, it was a waste of time.  He told me his hands were tied and that he had no control or influence over insurance companies.  Perhaps that should be reformed. </p> <p>   I compliment the tremendous work the GAA does.  It is an organisation in every village, town and parish in the country.  It is a huge issue, as Mr. Ryan said, to make sure every ground and facility is up to standard.  What inspections does the GAA carry out?  Does someone go out, are the county boards under instructions or are there county board health and safety officers to make sure all grounds and pitches are up to a high standard? The quick fix question was asked.  Is it getting more difficult for the GAA to insure all of its grounds and are more stipulations being put in the way in respect of the huge amount of property under its vested control?  It will come to a stage where an audit of every single property will be needed before insurance companies will start insuring.  I think the Irish Public Bodies Insurance scheme has a major role to play with events like the Galway Rally and with the men's shed association and organisations like that.  I compliment Mr. Boland on the tremendous work he is doing to try to achieve reform.  </p></speech>

We do have certain reservations as to how that operates.  The biggest one is the permissible lapsed time between an incident happening and it being reported to PIAB.  That presents a practical difficulty for us because - and this has been mentioned - clubs are run by voluntary people and we are imposing a significant burden on them with risk management and reporting and recording adverse events.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.1263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1313" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018052400002#L01600"><p>Health and safety officers.</p></speech>

It is purely because the clubs are run on a voluntary basis.  People get involved in GAA clubs because they are interested in hurling and football and not because they are insurance professionals.  The elapsed time is our difficulty with respect to PIAB.</p> <p>  Deputy Grealish also asked about Irish Public Bodies Insurance.  It did, in fairness, engage with us at the point of our insurance renewal.  We did have discussions but we did not pursue that course.  There was also a question on health and safety officers and insurance officers in counties and in clubs.  We have a designated insurance officer - or we have a position of an insurance officer - in every county.  I cannot attest 100% that all of those positions have been filled.  It is difficult to get people to fill voluntary positions and that is one of the direct manifestations of the difficulties that the other organisations here have mentioned.  The burdens of time and responsibility pose a challenge for the GAA as much as any other organisation.  However, we do have that position.</p><p>There will also typically be a health and safety person in a club.  However, again, it is voluntary, it is subject to the constraints on people's time and it is not the core activity in the club.  Deputy Grealish mentioned the concept of an audit of properties.  This is something in which we are trying to engage in partnership with our insurers.  We are in the throes of going from club to club, recording all the particulars of the particular property.  This was mentioned in the context of the men's sheds.  GAA clubs are the same.  They can vary hugely.  In some cases it will just be a pitch; in other cases it will be a significant leisure complex and so on.  That exercise is ongoing.</p><p> Was there another specific question?</p></speech>

It can be difficult regarding men's sheds.  Many insurance companies will not even provide quotes, which can be an issue.  There is, therefore, limited availability, which skews the marketplace as well.  If there are more options, there is more competition and better choice for groups.  This is a challenge not only for us as a national body, but also for individual sheds when they look for a policy from an insurer.</p></speech>

Regarding engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, we met him and his civil servants in March.  We were not aware of the roadshow meeting in Galway at the start of this week.  We are well aware of the one in Cork next Monday, and quite a few of our members are anxious to attend it.  We have been keeping a close eye on the cost of insurance working group's updates.  It has been a little dispiriting because what was a good initial report seems to have run out of steam.  We did an analysis of the CIWG's latest update, which was issued quietly the Friday before last, and of the 48 actions which are ticked at this stage, 22 essentially amount to meetings or consultations.  They are not actions as such; they are additional consultations.  We, therefore, do not sense the urgency that is required on this issue.  It is an issue now, not an issue in five years' time.</p> <p>  We believe the PIAB is worthy and deserves our support.  It is a model for what might be done to reduce the cost of court cases in many ways but it is being undermined constantly, and we have a serious concern in this regard.  For example, two new directors are to be appointed by the Minister, one of whom will be a lawyer with experience in personal injury claims, but there is no specific representative for policyholders on the board.  It looks to us a little like throwing a fox into a chicken coop.  That is an issue from our point of view.</p> <p>  Regarding engagement with the insurance companies, as the Deputy pointed out, we were involved in this very issue in 2002 and 2003 and engaged significantly with them at that time.  It really got nowhere and I was not surprised.  Their job is to protect the interests of their members, and part of which is their profits.  We do not expect them to vote for Christmas.  It is down to the members as policymakers to implement the change that needs to be made because it will not be implemented by either the insurance industry or the legal profession.</p> <p>  Regarding IPB and its use, it sounds like a very worthy issue.  It will be a long-term issue, but we are looking for immediate actions which will address this situation.</p> <p>  On the cancelling of events, I will defer to Mr. Colm Croffy from AOIFE to give a little insight into events being cancelled.</p></speech>

We do a national advice tour in the Twenty-six Counties.  We have 22 counties done since January and we met more than 180 festival and community event organisers.  Invariably, in the top three issues they bring up with us is what we are doing about insurance and what they can do as community organisers and community event organisers to reduce these increasing burdens.  This is why we are involved with the alliance.</p> <p>  Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked whether we are at crisis point.  We are at crisis point from two points of view: first, the industry is fashioned the way it is.  However, in the community and voluntary sector - Mr. Tom Ryan mentioned this - it is increasingly difficult to find volunteers to come into the space, animate committees, take responsibility for the regulatory framework that is in place and then go raise the money when almost a third to 40% of what is brought in from the hospitality industry, sponsorship, fund-raising and ticket sales on the gate is handed over for a premium that is of no value to us in one sense.  Communities are caught in a bind because they cannot even be a member of a local public participation network, PPN, or apply to a local authority for a small community assistance scheme unless they have evidence of insurance and adequate cover for the activities being undertaken.  They are caught between the Devil and the deep blue sea, which is deeply frustrating.  I have been involved in this sector for 27 years.  There are no lifers left in the festival event scene in this country.  The Brendan Flynns, Harry Hughes and Willie Clancys of this world are as scarce as hen's teeth now given the level of difficulty forced on us by, in particular, this issue, and I wish it was not so.  It is incumbent on policymakers to change the playing field; otherwise, we will have an island which will not be as animated or as vibrant as we tell the world it is.</p></speech>

I welcome all the witnesses to the committee.  My first question is for all the witnesses.  They may not need to answer it directly, but they can reflect on it.  Do they think everyone should have his or her own insurance?  Most people who go on holidays go on multiple trips and have multi-trip insurance.  Other people get insurance every time they go on holidays.  I firmly believe everyone should have his or her own insurance policy.   I do not know whether the State should help to pay for poor people in this regard but we should have a debate on this.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Ryan the best of luck in his new job with the GAA.  It seems that 11% of the GAA's overall take goes towards insurance.  Mr. Ryan has an interesting model as to how to farm out some of that with some of the other costs borne by the GAA itself.  Various companies have gone down this route, including Supermacs.  Mr. Croffy referred specifically to the Twenty-six Counties.  Is there a different insurance model in Northern Ireland?</p></speech>

There is a slight difference in the injury benefit fund for players.  Players in the Republic of Ireland and players in Northern Ireland avail of different health services.  The benefits are slightly different in the Six Counties.  The way in which that scheme is structured - and this is relevant to the Senator's first point about personal insurance - such that we ask players, referees or mentors, if they have their own personal private health insurance, to bear the first instance of any claim.</p><p>The GAA's voluntary scheme will kick in after that and after whatever services are available to the particular player but those will vary depending on which jurisdiction he is in.  It was in that context that I mentioned the Twenty-six Counties.  The liability on the property programme extends throughout the island.</p></speech>

We operate a benefit scheme for players which is entirely self-insured and there is no concept of a premium there.  We collect levies from clubs and gate receipts and we use them to fund that programme annually.  The 5% and 6% are constant year on year because we try to insulate the scheme from the vagaries of claims in any particular year.  We try to build up a fund to use in the event of an adverse year.  Typically, the property claims are weather-related, and, typically and unfortunately, the liability claims are not related to injuries on the playing field but to events happening in the club, perhaps in the fundraising context.  We also find increasingly as the cost of maintaining facilities increases, clubs have to have recourse to hiring out their facilities, making them available for parties, twenty-first birthdays and so on.  Those kind of events give rise to the slips, trips and falls claims which we are finding an increasing financial burden.</p></speech>

The property is covered under the GAA's insurance programme and anything done on that property which is in accordance with our liability programme is also covered.

I feel after talking to many mart managers over the past year or two, but especially in recent weeks as I knew I was coming here, about their claims, many that were falsified were like an open book on what is happening in marts.  Why are these claims suddenly a big issue in the past three or four years?  The number seems to be growing.  It is an easy way to get money.  In the case of one of our claims, which I will not go into in detail, the gentleman had claimed off two other companies within the past ten years.  That was not justified.  It was never examined.  He was just offered a settlement.  There were no breakages; he had a sore toe.</p></speech>

That man had a sore toe.  A solicitor was not even involved in that case.  The insurance company approached him and that came into us.  Approximately &euro;13,000 was paid out.  I do not know who got that money or how much of it the man got.  That is a major issue.</p> <p>  To fix it we need to consider what is being paid out because we are probably not going to stop people coming into marts and being hit by gates or getting a kick from their own cattle.  They have probably recovered within a week but I do not know what the claim is for.  That should be addressed.  The nature and extent of the injuries should be considered and what they get for those.</p></speech>

The discussion is quite enlightening.  We all know insurance has long been a problem.  I recall during an election campaign in 1997 motor insurance for young people was a major issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Boland referred to the book of quantum being revised.  Is it fair to say that the book of quantum is just the historical, statistical analysis of what has happened?  If so, I do not know how it can be redrafted.  Can he tease out his point on that? </p> <p>  He made a point about the Garda insurance fraud unit, saying the Minister tells us there is not enough support in the House for this.  Did he give any evidence for this, or any suggestion as to why?  I commend all the witnesses but particularly the Alliance for Insurance Reform because it covers not only community bodies, which we are talking about today but also the Vintner's Federation of Ireland, VFI, and the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, which is my nominating body, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, RGDATA and the restaurant associations.  There are businesses all over the country.</p> <p>  I was speaking to an insurance broker last week and he was more on the side of the client than of the insurance companies.  He deals with a business of significant size that is wondering if it needs to close because insurance costs have increased so much that it cannot afford to exist if it continues to have to pay out this dead money.  I have certainly heard that after people have made a claim for a trip or fall, two years later the CCTV in the premises is gone and half of the staff has changed.  The same people are not in the building for two years.  That happens a lot in the hospitality industry. </p> <p>  Will Mr. Boland touch on the Garda insurance fraud issue and why the Minister said that?  The VFI and the LVA, which are alliance members, were before the committee a year ago to discuss, in particular, public liability in pubs.  We are hearing all that we heard from them again.  It is shocking, particularly in respect of the settling of claims, and their members not even being told they are being settled.  They are being settled because the insurer discovers a different judge is sitting and pays out a bit more because that judge is more generous than another one.  I know the witnesses cannot provide solutions for everything but they have highlighted some of them.  Is there anything else they want to say to us?  What percentage of claims do they think are spurious or vexatious?  Ms McGuinness touched on that in referring to the mart.  Could that apply equally to festivals?  Is there an industry in this?  A total of 8% of motor insurance claims relate to material damage.  Some are entitled to it but what percentage of the claims does Mr. Boland think are vexatious or spurious and not justified across all sectors?</p></speech>

I will not go into the details of the book of quantum.  It is a matter of public record that awards in Ireland, particularly for minor injuries, are far in excess of awards in other jurisdictions.  I am sure the GAA, with its cross-Border presence, has an insight into that.  The Senator asked how it can be reset.  He is absolutely right when he says that as it stands, awards are based on precedent.  The Court of Appeal has set a cap of &euro;450,000 on catastrophic awards.  It has introduced the principles of proportionality and, more importantly, common sense to the calculation of awards below that level.  We would argue that the basis of a framework is already there.  There is a process for looking at that, particularly through the Personal Injuries Commission.  We have a feeling that the commission has been shunted off towards whiplash injuries and is focusing on such injuries.  We believe it should have a much broader remit in looking at awards as a whole.  As another part of the current process, the working group is looking at the constitutionality of applying individual caps down the way.  That is a long way down the road as we work through the various stages.  We are in favour of the broadening of the remit of the Personal Injuries Commission.  Its second and third reports will come out in July.  We would like its work to be extended to areas beyond whiplash.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct when he says we were told by the Minister that there is insufficient support in the House for the Garda fraud investigation unit.  We do not know what the background to that is.  I suggest that the Senator should talk directly to the Minister about that.</p></speech>

We have had discussions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Our understanding is that the unit could be established without any legislation.  We understand that the facilities and resources are available to get it up and running almost immediately.  We would be in favour of that.  The UK model on which the new unit would be based is the similar unit within the City of London police.  That unit is funded by the insurance industry, which is what is proposed here.  Our understanding is that it seems there are no obstacles to setting this up.<br/><br/>The Senator asked what percentage of claims might be fraudulent, exaggerated or misleading.  A solicitor from Limerick suggested in an article in the <i>Limerick Leader</i>in January that the relevant percentage is 8%.  That would be in line with the experience in Europe, where a figure of between 8% and 10% is normally given for claims that are fraudulent or - more substantially - exaggerated or misleading.  Mr. Sinclair has an insight into this matter.</p></speech>

We went through a period when whiplash was the standard claim that went through the courts.  One was pretty much guaranteed a handsome reward if one was unfortunate enough to suffer whiplash injuries.  A claim being made by a person with a sore toe now typically includes claims for loss of sleep, depression, anxiety, issues with hearing, taste, smell and vision and headaches.  None of those complaints is quantifiable, but all of them are being included when a claim is being made for what might be no more than a sore toe.  That is a major issue now.</p></speech>

These things are not predictable in any real sense.  We have a Road Traffic Act insurance policy which covers all of our members because we want to make sure everybody has the correct insurance.  Without naming names or venues, we recently received a claim relating to a collision in the centre of a small town between a rally car and a road vehicle driven by a member of the public.  A car pulled out in front of our member.  The indicator on the car in question was not working.  To cut a long story short, the damage to the third party vehicle was estimated at &euro;700 and that was the claim.  Now, from nowhere, we have received a claim for personal injuries to a mother and three children.</p></speech>

We have a responsibility to our members and to the public to operate safe facilities.  If it is our fault, we have an obligation to compensate people for our shortcomings and that is what we do.  As Mr. Sinclair has mentioned, exaggeration or embellishment might well be a feature.  To be fair, I would be speculating if I were to put a percentage on that.  The volume of cases or claims has increased significantly in recent years.  In previous years, there was an ethos or attitude that people did not really sue the GAA.  It was not a feature.  We might have been a bit naive or complacent, but we are now finding that this attitude does not really prevail anywhere.  I hope committee members and others will have noticed that we are trying to broaden our commitment to local communities outside hurling and football, for example by encouraging walking groups and others to use our facilities.  When people who are not a core part of the GAA as an organisation suffer something adverse, they might be more disposed towards taking a claim than our own members might have been.</p></speech>

I do not know if anybody here covers that kind of thing.  I have heard about scenarios in which the residents' association of a local housing estate where 300 people are living decides to have a summer barbecue on a big green space within the estate, but is asked to stump up &euro;1,500 for insurance.  I do not know whether Mr. Croffy's organisation covers such events.  This kind of stuff is probably below his level.  I am talking about an event at which two or three people bring out their barbecues from their back gardens on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to cook a few sausages.  They are sometimes asked to cough up &euro;1,500 for the privilege of being careful.</p></speech>

I know of cases in which the local authorities that are in charge of these open spaces have asked residents for indemnities of between &euro;3.5 million and &euro;6.5 million, which equates to between &euro;1,500 and &euro;2,800 for a two-day event, or even an event at which people bring out a couple of barbecues and a few deckchairs from their own houses.  There might be a small stage, a public address system and a bit of bunting.  Such costs are discouraging people from congregating and organising events in a civic-minded manner.</p></speech>

Their stories are similar to ones we have heard before and I am particularly thankful to them for being so direct.  It is an issue that needs to be overhauled and dealt with immediately and there has been far too much lip service given to the work that needs to be done.  This committee intends to revisit this as part of its agenda.  We have the responsible Minister before us on 29 May and all of this will be put to him.  Then it will be up to each and every member and political party to pursue the matter through the House because it is having a grave effect on every single one of us in society, in business and in the voluntary sector.

This is something that is very close to our heart in FBD.  We submitted a presentation and I would like to bring the committee through the first slide of that presentation.  From a distribution point of view, FBD is very much in the heart of every community.  We have a business model that supports that and we have 34 branches spread right across the island of Ireland.  We have grown our branch network, we have gone from 32 to 34 so we see the branch network as a key differentiator in FBD to support our communities and that is different to our competitors' view of their business model.  That is the first thing.</p> <p>  Second, in terms of a product perspective, we have protection products that are there to meet our customers' requirements.  Thankfully we have 500,000 customers and we feel that we have very good products that meet their requirements locally, within the communities.  Our people that staff the branch network are living in the community so they are very aware of what the issues are locally within the community and we think that is a great strength.  Our good people in our branch network and our actual distribution reach puts us apart as being in the community and offering good products to our customer base.  We support many initiatives right across the country within FBD, like the Ploughing Championships, the Tullamore show, the Young Farmer of the Year, Bloom in the Phoenix Park and also local shows with Charleville and shows in County Cavan as an example.  Supporting local communities through our branch network by staff who are embedded in the community is hugely important to us.</p> <p>  From a risk management perspective, we offer more than just protections, solutions and products.  We want to listen to our customers and work with them locally to come up with solutions that meet their requirements and by that I mean having good risk management practices so that we can ultimately reduce the frequency of claims within businesses and correspondingly reduce the level of premiums that we charge.</p><p>FBD is the only Irish indigenous insurer and it is very important for us as the executive team that we support businesses locally and as a business we feel we are set up to do that.</p></speech>

In my experience the relationship is straightforward.  Accidents cause injuries and injuries, real or imagined, cause claims.  The cost of insurance is determined by the number of accidents and the cost of the accidents.  The cost of an accident has two key components, the cost of the compensation payment - that is how much we settle for - and the cost it takes us to agree that settlement.  If we want to reduce the price of insurance, we need to simply reduce the number of accidents, reduce the cost of the compensation payout and reduce the cost of getting to that compensation or payment decision.  There is a role for the customer, for the insurer and the State.  The role of the customer is to run a tight ship, so that he or she is health and safety conscious, understands his or her risks and manages those risks.  We as the insurer play a very important part in terms of giving the right cover, making sure that we provide the protection that they need.  We need to price it because we need to pay for the claims, but we also provide a great support in terms of helping them to survey their enterprise, understand their risks and puts steps in place to mitigate to those risks.  The third component is the role of the State.  There is a role for the leadership of the joint committee to address the chronic and costly deficiencies that are inherent in the present system.  </p> <p>  From FBD's perspective we fully support the endeavours of the working groups that are considering insurance matters.  We have thrashed through quite a lot in the years 2016 to 2018.  What we have highlighted in the slide on the screen is a summary of all of the important recommendations.  I will identify two or three of the areas that we see as very significant in terms of that endeavour.  First, the need to strengthen the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  We need to tackle what I would consider the really widespread non-co-operation and gaming of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process.  I am referring to solicitors who do not provide sufficient detail, wait for an award, reject it so that it is released so that they can then issue court proceedings and essentially turn on their money machine.  We also need a much more efficient process pre-litigation and during litigation.  In the legal system, delays are everywhere and those inefficiencies cost the insurance company money.  It is in the interest of the legal profession to have those delays.  In my view, they profit from the procrastination.  The legal system needs fundamental reform.  We welcome the review by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly which I think needs to be radical and rapid.</p> <p>  In regard to the Personal Injuries Commission, we simply put too high a value on injuries in this country, in particular I am referring to soft tissue injuries.  We know that in Ireland we pay about three times more for soft tissue injuries than they do in the United Kingdom.  We know that in France, the system does not pay on soft tissue injuries unless it appears on a scan.  I can guarantee that the vast majority of soft tissue injuries in Ireland would not appear on a scan.  A minor ankle injury cost up to &euro;54,700 in Ireland compared to &euro;12,554 in the United Kingdom.  We need to have internationally benchmarked awards and a consistent and objective approach to the assessment of injury.</p> <p>  We need to improve data sharing.  In the fight against fraud, we need to share much more data and make the sharing more timely.  We need to make it easy for insurance companies to access and interrogate the data.</p> <p>  There is a lot the customer can do, that the insurance company can do and I believe the leaders in Government can do a great deal.  I ask the Chairman that the joint committee stay the course and drive home the reforms in a meaningful way.  The choice is straightforward and clear.  We can have high cost insurance because of high cost claims or we can have low priced insurance but low cost of claims.  We cannot have low priced insurance and a high claims cost.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

We have been dealing with insurance all day.</p> <p>  We have been considering the insurance industry for years.  Premiums appear to be continuing to rise and the cost increasing.  An issue that arose in the course of earlier contributions is the process by which claims are settled.  There is a perception that the insurance companies are not going to court to fight cases but are settling them outside of court.  In the event of an accident, a person takes an action against a policyholder, but the perceptions is that in most cases the insurance company will settle rather than fight the case in court.  Will the witnesses elaborate on whether that is a myth or the reality?  What percentage of claims are settled outside court and what percentage are settle in court?</p></speech>

We are in the business of being there for our customers when things go wrong.  We are the company that provides the backstop for them.  Our motto in FBD is to be fair to the customer and fair to FBD.  What we try to do is a very thorough assessment of each claim.  We are looking for the following: Are they on cover; are we liable and what is the quantum?  If we can answer yes that they are on cover, that we FBD is liable and we can agree a quantum, it is in our interest and the interest of the insured party and the customer's interest to settle the claim as fast as possible for a fair price.  If that is not the case, we fight the case through a lengthy litigation process.  Part of the difficulty as I have mentioned in my presentation is the length of time it takes to go through that process and how much it costs.</p></speech>

There are many cases that we would like to fight in court right to a judgment but it would be foolhardy because of our system.</p><p>We see this in situations where there is relatively no damage to a vehicle but four people who are all suffering from soft-tissue injury are saying they are in pain.  It is very difficult for us to defend that because if the accident had happened and if liability is not in question it is down to the question of how much pain they are feeling.  What we need to do in that instance, to have any chance of winning, is to be able to attack the credibility of the claimant which is extremely difficult.  In those cases, it is foolhardy to bring the case.  The costs will increase quite significantly for us.  The payout will be the payout.  We fight many cases and in those cases two things generally happen.  One is the defendant will actually withdraw it on the steps of the court.

I am fed up of all this discussion.  No one is actually telling us what is the real position.  We have been around this.  FBD is a good company and great employers.  We had a wide spectrum of people in this morning.  I know from dealing with it myself that insurance costs are only going one way.  We have solicitors and barristers telling us awards have come down.  Mr. Cahalan is telling us awards have gone up.  Ordinary people are saying their insurance costs have gone up.  We had an array of business people in this morning from the marts, the GAA, the motor industry and voluntary bodies.  Every single one of them has seen a 20% increase in their premiums in the past 12 months.  FBD has taken over in respect of the men's sheds and I hope something can be worked out there.  Someone is not telling the truth on this.  At the end of the day, we cannot have three or four different stories.  The only result is the insurance premiums are going up.  We are being told by representative bodies that insurance companies are trying to get a protocol that was in place back in 2003, to which IBEC agreed.  That is 15 years old.  As we have had no blue book since 2016, we do not know what the results are in terms of the relative costs.  We have no protocol in place because there is a fight between the insurance industry and the Department of Finance as to what is agreed.  The Garda fraud unit is not up and running.  The insurance industry is looking for a revised book of quantum.  My worry is we have less data available to us than we had previously yet we are looking for ways of reform.  Mr. Cahalan and Mr. McMahon have a job to do for FBD.  The problem is I am no wiser than I was two or three years ago.  I am not a stupid man but I am no wiser.  What is going on?</p></speech>

There are 77 marts in Ireland.  We insure 52 of them.  We have a good handle on them.  The reality at the moment is that every &euro;1 we underwrite on the marts costs us &euro;1.30.

The marts are fundamentally important to us as a farm insurer.  This is where our customers trade.  In FBD we want to work with our customers, the mart owners, to put in good risk management practices.  The Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society, ICOS, the mart owners and the HSA have put in a voluntary code of practice to try to improve work practices.</p></speech>

Does FBD publish data to show the number of claims in any one year has gone up?  Mr. McMahon is basing that on the number of claims going up.  The marts told us that average rates have gone up by about 20% in the past year.</p><p>If the number of claims has increased would FBD be willing to publish that level of data, to show that the claims and legal fees FBD is incurring have increased and would substantiate that increase in premium?

A 7% margin is low.  Obviously, if the volumes are very high, turnover is high.  Mr. Cahalan said the company made a loss in 2015 and 2016.  It made a 7% profit in 2017.  He said we should follow the money.  I am asking him to show me the money.  I wish to see the make-up of total claims and I want it broken down between legal fees and claims paid.  That would give us something tangible that would link in to what Mr. Cahalan is saying.</p></speech>

I am asking this on behalf of the committee.  I am trying to drill down into this.  Everybody says the claims and legal fees are going up.  By how much are they going up?</p></speech>

Currently, the marts are loss-making for us.  However, the marts are places where our customers transact and despite the fact that they are loss-making, FBD is willing to write those risks.  We can only speak for FBD.  We are not here to speak for the wider insurance markets but specifically for FBD.</p></speech>

If it was the case that the levels of claims and legal fees have gone up significantly, I would be able to say, "that is the case".  The problem is that no matter what information we seek, it is never forthcoming.  Various groups appear before the committee.  My sugar levels are low today and I am calling it as I see it.  When people appear before the committee they just hold the line for the hour or two of the meeting and we are none the wiser.  There is an onus on the insurance industry to show us the money.  FBD is a great employer.  My car insurance is from FBD and it is a good, reputable company to deal with.  It is Irish and nationwide.  However, there is a perennial issue with the industry.  If the insurance industry came forward and gave us the hard data, that would be that.  The problem is that the insurance industry is not giving us the hard data.  If anything, it is fighting it every inch of the way, so we cannot get down to the facts.  Can the witnesses give me any indication in terms of figures?</p></speech>

Nobody seems to accept responsibility as to who is the cause of insurance claims going up.  The witnesses have put it quite firmly in the court of the legal people, saying they are the biggest factor in the cost of claims rising.  They said that the legal people get exactly or almost the same as whatever the claimant gets.  When the company receives a claim, whether it is an ankle injury, a soft tissue injury or whatever, who determines what the level of claim is in Ireland?  Is it the blue book or the book of quantum?  What does the company use?  We have been increasingly frustrated with all the insurance companies settling claims rather than letting them go to court.  We heard people from the marts and other people who have appeared before the committee say that they would love to have gone to court to fight the case but the insurance companies settled.  They settle regardless of what type of injury is involved and because so much is allowed for an ankle, leg or soft tissue injury.  Who decides what the level will be?</p></speech>

That sets the value.</p><p>We are then looking at the question of whether liability is a question.  There can be wide variance between our view of the value of that and the plaintiff's view of the value of it.  Ultimately, if we cannot reach an agreement on it, the judge will decide.  Another part of the problem was the underlying variability in taking cases to court.  I have expressed the difficulty, particularly with soft tissue injury, in defending against it.  If someone says they are injured, they are injured unless I can tell them they are not.  We are not talking about anything that is evidentially based.</p></speech>

We have seen where the GAA and various other bodies have put risk management in place.  Even though all this risk management has been put in place, however, the cost of insurance is going up even though risk management is working in a lot of places.  We have seen from the GAA that there are more claims now outside the playing field than on it.  I do not know the answer to it.</p></speech>

We work closely with our customers to implement risk management practices that will over time lead to safer marts.  This was a huge initiative.  From an FBD perspective, this is one where we were very proactive in going to our customers to implement.  Unfortunately, not all marts are where they should be from a risk management perspective.  We are very working very closely within the branch network to reach a standard that will help reduce the frequency of claims because that is in all our interests.  It is in the interests of the mart and us.  This is where our customers trade.  We have a huge interest in driving a risk management agenda to reduce the frequency of claims.</p></speech>

That is really what FBD is saying when it settles a case.  In many cases the business would like to see the case go the whole way, but when FBD settles, it is saying that the business is negligent even though the marts and all those people have put risk management in place to reduce the risk.  FBD is telling them that despite everything they have done, they are negligent.</p></speech>

Each case must stand on its merits.  One could have very good risk management practices but an individual case might show that something has gone on despite the risk management practices where the person is liable for that accident in the mart.

It is quite helpful to have an actual industry player before us because usually it is Insurance Ireland that appears before us and it usually has to defer back and say it is just here as a representative body but is not on the ground doing the claims, so it is good that FBD is here.  We heard a lot this morning from the community groups, especially the marts.  I asked what percentage of claims they believed were spurious.  Do the witnesses have a figure for what they believe are spurious or vexatious claims out of all the claims coming into FBD?  Is there a difference between those at marts versus motor insurance versus public liability?</p></speech>

Of all the claims we get in the first instance, 40% do not result in a compensation payment.  That is largely to do with investigating it, whether liability is a question here and whether the claimant proceeds to a claim on it.  Four out of ten cases fall into that bracket, which is very important to remember because it is very important for us and our customers to know that we investigate very thoroughly and we have very strict controls and systems around the investigation of claims.  Many claims that come to us do not result in payment.  That is very important.</p></speech>

I take the point totally on low prices and low claim payouts, and on high prices and high claim payouts.  The circle has to squared, or whatever way one wants to put it.  However, most of us drive the same car and do not make any claims.  We over-labour the point on motor insurance because we are hearing about many other issues but we just feel our premiums are going up and up.  The industry says it is not making a great deal of money, or has not been making any for a period, but somebody is making money out of this, whether it is the lawyers or the claimants.  Clearly, some people are genuinely injured and discommoded by their accidents but it seems to be the case that there are many more not in that category.  I would really like to hear from the delegates what the problem is in motor insurance terms.  Is there a concentration of incidents in a particular part of the country?  Are they related to a particular age group?  What is causing all the accidents?  The delegates are saying only approximately 20% of them are fraudulent.  Maybe 10% are getting through and 10% are not.  Maybe that is a figure for the industry overall but it is a lot of accidents.  Is there a way of reducing the number of those accidents?  Drink-driving is probably not the factor that it was.  Is it speed?</p></speech>

For the customers and public, it is important that insurance companies return a profit.  We have mentioned that in the accident year 2017, our margin was 7%.  By no means are we getting super-normal profits out of our business.</p></speech>

We completely empathise.  As a customer and family man, I understand that but it is important that we charge the appropriate price for the risk.  We have come from a position in which the market was chronically underpriced.  All insurers had to significantly pump money into their reserves.  That is not a good position; it is not a position we want to be back in.  From FBD's perspective, it is important that we be competitive.  The market dynamics will dictate such.  It is important that we can cover our costs so that in the event of a claim, we can make the payments.  We have seen the cost and frequency of claims increasing over the years.  That is beginning to stabilise, which is good for our customers and society as a whole.</p></speech>

I hope the committee can stay the course and drive the reforms through in a meaningful way.  We need to benchmark awards; we are simply paying too much.  We need an objective way to assess what an injury is and means.  Once we are paying that much, it is a fundamental problem.

Every twist and turn is inefficient.  That is why I welcome the review, which needs to be prioritised.  There are interested parties and it is difficult to change the system.  That is the challenge for our society.  The insurance industry exists to pay when something goes wrong.  We want to get to the settlement as fast as possible and have a settlement that is fair to the customer and FBD.  The fundamental problem is how long it takes and the cost involved in getting there.

My only concern with the recently published heads is that appeals go back into the court system, and everything is taken into consideration at the courts' discretion.  Will that create a real and meaningful change?  I fully support it.  The people should come to it with all the evidence they have.  It should not be adversarial.  It should be shared and assessed objectively, and the payment should be made.  We should value that at a reasonable rate.</p></speech>

Let me outline the interesting aspect of medicals.  First, we may receive a basic medical from a general practitioner that may state the guy is not too bad.</p><p>We get nothing else.  The claimant will not attend the injuries board medical, nor will he allow our medical practitioner to examine him.  An award will come out and the injuries board will come out and, very close to settlement, years down the line, we will be looking at a completely different set of facts and information that was probably available three years previously.  However, what is happening is that each of those years is creating extra expenses, extra income and extra cost in respect of the claim.</p><p> Another really interesting point, from my perspective, is that the injuries board might make an assessment that a person should recover from his or her injury, let us say, within six months, and that is rejected, goes into litigation and lasts three, four or five years.  The claimant is still suffering from the injury three, four or five years later, so the injury is no longer a year-old injury, but a five-year-old injury with a lot more pain and suffering.  The interesting question, though, is how many of those people miraculously recover the day on which the case is settled?  How many of them get physio the following day?  How many of them continue their general practitioner appointments once the case is settled?</p></speech>

There are anecdotal stories of businesses that are literally unable to continue in business because their insurance premiums have risen so much.  Are the witnesses aware of any businesses that have had to fold and have just said they could not keep going?

However, I go back to the example of the marts, where we are losing money.  We are genuinely trying to work with our customers to stay the course and to work with them on good risk management practices.  That is a key message I would like to leave with the committee.  From the perspective of FBD, as an Irish insurer supporting Irish businesses, we are doing everything we can to be there locally through our branch network providing products and a service that helps businesses grow and prosper.  That is what we want to do as a business and that is what we will continue to do, despite the fact that in some risks we are not making money.</p></speech>

Has there been a recent spike in claims?  We had representatives from the marts before the committee earlier saying that in recent years they had a serial complainant who seems to have got two or three payments from a sore toe or something.  I am not saying it was necessarily one of FBD's marts, but are marts becoming a target for people to make claims?</p></speech>

The customer base that goes to marts, that age demographic, is getting older.  Obviously, one is interacting with live animals, and measures such as ensuring the public cannot access the pens are a big issue.  Therefore, it is a matter of putting up proper viewing galleries and ensuring that the drovers are there to take the animals from the jeep into the pen and from the pen into the ring.  It is a matter of trying to come up with practices that allow the customers to look at the animals but in a safe way.  The marts are working hard with us to implement those practices, but we are on a journey with them.</p></speech>
