Apologies have been received from Deputies O'Connell and Catherine Murphy.  We will deal with the business of the committee in the afternoon as we want to deal with the Higher Education Authority, University College Cork and Cork Institute of Technology this morning.</p><p>As I mentioned, we are dealing with the financial statements for 2016 for the Higher Education Authority, University College Cork and Cork Institute of Technology.  Today we are returning to matters in the third level sector on which we reported in July last year.  We are joined today from Higher Education Authority, HEA, by Dr. Graham Love, chief executive, as well as Ms Sheena Duffy, Mr. Stewart Roche, Mr. Tim Conlon and Mr. Neil McDermott.  From the Department we have Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary, and Mr. Tony Gaynor.  From University College Cork, UCC, we are joined by Professor Patrick O&rsquo;Shea, president, and by Mr. Diarmuid Collins and Mr. Cormac McSweeney.  From Cork Institute of Technology we are joined by Dr. Barry O'Connor, president, and Mr. Paul Gallagher, Mr. John A. McCarthy, Ms Ellen Crowley and Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Byrne.  They are all very welcome to today's meeting.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off or into aeroplane mode, as putting them on silent mode is not adequate and they will still interfere with the recording system in the Oireachtas.  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Orders that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.  We will first take a short opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#H00200"><p>The Higher Education Authority is the statutory planning and policy development body for higher education and research in Ireland.  In addition, it is the primary funding authority for Irish universities, institutes of technology, teacher training colleges and a number of other designated education bodies.  Approximately 90% of the HEA's income in 2016 came directly from Vote 26, Education and Skills, with the balance, largely consisting of research funding, from Vote 32, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The HEA had gross expenditure of &euro;1.15 billion in 2016.  The bulk of this comprised grants to higher education bodies for specified purposes, including current spending, research, and capital project funding.  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the HEA's 2016 financial statements.</p> <p>  In 2015 and 2016, UCC recognised total income of &euro;346 million.  The university reported a modest surplus for the year of &euro;562,000.  As in prior years, my audit opinion in respect of the UCC financial statements was qualified in respect of the recognition of a portion of the future pension funding receivable from the State.  The root of the issue is that UCC awards professional added years for pension purposes to certain academic staff members on a different basis to that approved by the Ministers for Education and Skills and Finance under relevant legislation enacted in 2009.  As at 30 September 2016, the university was in disagreement with the Department of Education and Skills as to where responsibility lies for pension liabilities relating to transferred-in service.  The university estimated the total future cost of the disputed pension benefits at &euro;15.7 million and included this amount in its deferred pension funding asset.  I concluded that the recognition of the &euro;15.7 million asset as at the end of September 2016 was not in accordance with applicable accounting standards because of the disagreement with the Department at that date.</p><p>An agreement was subsequently reached between the university and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on shared funding of the disputed future liabilities.  This will be reflected in future financial statements.</p><p> The audit certificate draws attention to the non-consolidation of the results of Cork University Foundation DAC on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the university.  On 30 September 2016 the foundation had accumulated reserves of &euro;4.1 million.  Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements provides information on transactions between the university and the foundation.  Members will recall that the university has recently informed the committee of its intention to provide a full set of the foundation's financial statements, with the consolidated financial statements in future years.</p><p> The audit certificate also draws attention to disclosures in the university's statement of governance and internal control of instances of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  Reported non-compliant procurement to the value of &euro;4.4 million comprised &euro;3.9 million of spending identified by the university as being non-compliant and a further &euro;500,000 identified through audit testing.</p><p> The financial statements for Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, for the year ending 31 August 2016 indicate that consolidated income for the year amounted to nearly &euro;100 million.  State grant funding accounted for over &euro;38 million of this figure.  The other major sources of income were tuition fees and research grants.  Expenditure in the year was just over &euro;99 million, nearly 70% of which was accounted for by staff costs.  The net result for the year was a surplus of &euro;721,000.  Members will recall that there are two public private partnership, PPP, arrangements in place for buildings used by Cork Institute of Technology, namely, the Cork School of Music and the National Maritime College of Ireland.  The annual payments made to the two PPP companies are a direct charge on Vote 26.  They do not pass through the accounts of CIT.</p><p> My audit opinion for 2015-16 was unqualified.  However, the audit certificate draws attention to the fact that the institute did not provide for accrued pension liabilities under either the single public service pension scheme or the education sector superannuation scheme 2015.  The same was true of all other institutes of technology for 2015-16.  The audit certificate also notes that the Department of Education and Skills sought legal advice on the matter.  In October 2017 my office wrote to the presidents of all of the institutes of technology recommending that they commence accounting for pension liabilities in their financial statements for 2016-17.  I understand the Technological Higher Education Association, the representative body for institutes of technology, has procured the services of an actuary to carry out the necessary calculations.  It is expected that all 2016-17 financial statements will account in full for pension liabilities.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Love, chief executive of the HEA, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Graham Love" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#J00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Tim Conlon, interim head of system development and performance management; Ms Sheena Duffy, interim head of system funding and governance; and Mr. Stewart Roche, management accountant.</p> <p>  Every year the Higher Education Authority, HEA, allocates and distributes over &euro;1 billion in funding across a range of funding streams to the higher education sector.  As this is a major responsibility for an agency likes ours, I am happy to note that the HEA's financial statements for 2016 were signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2017 with no issues arising.  Our draft 2017 statements have also recently been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we are addressing follow-up queries.  Today the committee will also discuss CIT's and UCC's financial statements.  Our briefing paper addresses several issues related to these two institutions.  I will be happy to provide further details of the HEA's engagement on these matters.  The briefing paper also sets out other developments related to the higher education sector that are of interest to the committee.</p> <p>  The HEA continues to monitor University of Limerick's implementation of the recommendations arising from the Thorn report.  It also engages with the university on how it is demonstrating to its staff, students, stakeholders and wider community its commitment to learning from the report and its findings.  The HEA continues to fulfil its governance role through its rolling governance reviews.  The first such review dealt with procurement and resulted in positive engagement with the sector, as well as key stakeholders such as the Office of Government Procurement and the Education Procurement Service.  It has culminated in annual higher education procurement summits, most recently last month, and the introduction of a corporate procurement plan pack for institutions to adapt.</p> <p>  The second review dealt with intellectual property policies and arose directly from the engagement of the Committee of Public Accounts with the HEA and the higher education sector.  This has been a valuable exercise, with important recommendations being implemented.  This year's rolling reviews will focus on staff remuneration and benefits, as well as student non-progression.</p> <p>  In 2017 the committee had a productive engagement with the higher education sector on the timeliness of financial reporting.  A clear message was sent to the HEA and the institutions we fund on the importance of preparing and submitting financial statements promptly.  Previous delays inevitably had a knock-on effect.  However, the HEA notes the improvements made, as reflected in the Comptroller and Auditor General's most recent report on public sector financial reporting.  I again acknowledge the constructive engagement we have had with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on these matters.</p> <p>  Since the HEA last appeared before the committee there have been several important developments in the higher education sector.  On an operational level, the review of the funding model for higher education institutions was published.  It will introduce important changes to the way in which the HEA allocates funding and seeks to incentivise institutions to target growth areas such as STEM subjects, lifelong, part-time and flexible learning.  It also proposes the introduction of a financial penalty for serious breaches of governance by institutions.</p> <p>  On a wider strategic level, earlier this year the system performance framework for the period 2018 to 2020 was launched, with its focus on six key system objectives, ranging from meeting Ireland's skills requirements, improving equality of opportunity and improvements in governance.  A key element is the next cycle of strategic dialogue with higher education institutions, whereby institutions' performance will be measured against these key objectives for the higher education system.</p> <p>  This year has seen the passing into law of the technological universities legalisation.  This is an exciting step in the future of higher education which builds on the strengths and original missions of institutes of technology and also enhances their regional, national and international impact.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in its scrutiny of higher education matters.  Last year's meetings with the HEA and institutions were robust and frank but also useful in bringing matters to the fore.  The HEA sees the committee not only, rightly, as a watchdog but also a partner in improving governance and accountability in the higher education sector.  This is a relationship that I, as chief executive of the HEA, believe it is important to continue to develop.</p></speech>

We had a late start and I understand they have commitments in the afternoon.  They can refer to them, if they so wish during the session.

Will Dr. Love explain the HEA's service level agreement with the Department of Education and Skills, what it entails and what responsibilities in terms of governance come with it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Graham Love" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#J00600"><p>We have an annual service level agreement with the Department of Education and Skills, the essential element of which is our annual work plan, with its work streams, deliverables, etc, approved by the board.</p><p>That forms the core chapter.  Then, sitting on top of that is the relationship that defines how we relate to each other, that is, the Department and the HEA, the various responsibilities that sit under that and the meetings that we have to check on the progress on the work plan.  There are meetings a number of times a year between me and my team and Mr. William Beausang and his team, or, previously, Ms Mary Doyle, to track progress on the implementation of that work plan and other issues that are arising in the sphere of higher education.</p></speech>

Is that part of the service level agreement?</p></speech>

We then sit as a layer on top of that in our oversight role with regard to those institutions.  Yes, matters do come up throughout the course of the year.  We have just discussed in the private session earlier matters that would be part of that.  That is the normal run of business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K00400"><p>I asked that because of the matters that came up that we discussed earlier.  Must the HEA wait every year for the annual report from each institution before it can intervene if there is anything that the HEA needs to get involved in or is it done on an ongoing basis during the year?</p></speech>

We have a number of formal engagements each year and then, if matters require it, we engage directly on specific items.</p></speech>

On UCC first, is this &euro;15.7 million in shared funding the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a shortfall of moneys that is not there to cover future pension liabilities?  My understanding of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is that it will be a shared function now of both UCC and the taxpayer.  Can someone answer me that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Diarmuid Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K00700"><p>I will take that one.  Deputy Aylward may recall last year a similar issue was raised.  In the 2015 accounts, as part of our disclosure note when we were here back then, the Deputy may recall that we were taking a challenge against the State for the element of the liability that was in dispute.  During 2016-17, the matter was resolved.  When it comes to the &euro;15.7 million, there is now an agreed sharing of that liability between the State and the university.  We anticipate that when we are preparing the 2017 accounts - this is now our assumption as it will all be assessed and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General - we anticipate that the qualification in the accounts, as a result of that agreement between the HEA representing the State and the university, will now lapse and fall away because there is now an agreed funding model in place between the university and the HEA on how that element of pension will be funded into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K00800"><p>Is this a 50:50 split?</p></speech>

There are other elements of it around an ongoing adjustment to the university's overall base funding.  The amount will move every year.  As people retire, the liability will fall.  As there is an actuarial assessment, the overall liability will change every year as we go through the wind-down of those staff when they retire.  Essentially, overall it is 50:50 on the funding of the pension liability, the future lump sums for those people and pensions, and an element of an increase in the overall base funding for the university.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K01000"><p>Why must the State come in with 50% and why is UCC not able to fund its own pensions?  Why is the State, which is basically taxpayers' money, being used to subsidise pension funding?  Why is UCC not able to carry its own weight and fund its own pensions?  I want to hear Mr. Collins' view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Diarmuid Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#K01100"><p>I will tell the Deputy about that.  Back in 2010, the university, for these staff, had the liability and the asset.  We had both the liability to pay lump sums and pensions and we had the asset.  In 2010, the five universities that had that scheme transferred their pension asset of &euro;1.2 billion to the State and with that came a commitment that when those people retired, the liability going with that asset would be underpinned by a State asset - if the university gave away the money, the State would pay for that.</p> <p>  When the people retired, there was a dispute subsequently about elements of added years.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out in his opening statement how added years were assessed by the State differed from how the pension scheme, which was underpinned by statute, had operated in UCC and the commitment was given that people's entitlements would be honoured in return for the transfer of the asset.  We had an assessment, and a view, that it was the State's liability to fund those people given that it took the fund.  The State disputed that but, as we have said in the answer to the first part of the question, we have reached agreement on that.  There is now a sharing accepted between both the State and the university on how that element of the liability is funded in future.</p></speech>

However, as a result of the single pension scheme, there are new requirements in terms of how future liabilities are calculated and where they are provided.  We are just working through, with the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General, how we incorporate that into our accounts.

It is a separate legal entity.  It is not part of the university and it is not consolidated with the financial statements.  We gave a commitment last year, because a similar matter arose as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's certification, that we would append those accounts going forward in order that when the accounts are laid before the Oireachtas they will have attached to them the financial statements for the Cork University Foundation.</p> <p>  In our president's briefing papers that we sent in last week, we have said that we are looking at a review of the foundation and the governance model and, pending that review, it may well change the accounting of the foundation.  I do not want to predict the outcome of it but were it to be no longer a separate legal entity, it would then be consolidated as part of the university itself.  For now, it is a separate entity.  It does what it does and supports the university.  Because it is a separate entity, it is disclosed in the accounts, under FRS 8, as a relationship under our disclosure note 31, but it is appended and it is not part of the consolidation.  Because of that, it is referenced as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's overall certification drawing attention to the matter that we have it.  It is not consolidated but it is a separate entity.</p></speech>

We are the only university in the country with ISO 9001 certification for procurement.  That indicates we are totally compliant with EU directives.  Although we are compliant with these directives, the audit identifies approximately 1.25% - pertaining to 35 suppliers and a value of &euro;4.4 million - that was viewed as being non-compliant with the guidelines.  We can explain that.  One item was related to co-funding of sectoral purchasing arrangements.  The university is a partner to another lead entity, which itself procured the service in a fully compliant manner.  The university, through clerical error, inadvertently identified that as being non-compliant when in fact it was.  That information has been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  Additionally, there are extensions of service contracts, particularly related to ICT matters, that were originally awarded competitively but where the competitive contract has expired.  We have not been able to re-compete them because we are working on the basis of a shared-services model with the HEA.  That is still in operation so we have to continue with the existing contracts until there is agreement from the HEA as to which types of contracts and vendors we should opt for.</p> <p>  There is also emergency expenditure.  I refer to priority issues related to blocked drains, safety issues and so on in respect of which we have an emergency arrangement to procure services on a short-term basis.  The university endeavours at all times to ensure it is compliant with public procurement policy.  It engages with the Office of Government Procurement, where appropriate.

The libraries are engaging in HEAnet, for example.  That is done through one institution but we all effectively piggyback on the contract that was properly tendered for by that institution.  Therefore, we are not non-compliant.  The contract was procured properly by one institution on behalf of the sector.  Inadvertently, through clerical error, it was recorded as being non-compliant.<br/><br/>With regard to the extension of service contracts, we have proprietary systems with certain providers.  The contracts might have lapsed but one would be using those providers to do one&rsquo;s maintenance.  As the president said, there is a move towards a shared-services model in ICT.  We were working with the HEA on that.  One would not be going back out to engage in a procurement exercise regarding the contracts until that particular review is completed.  It is not a matter of sweet deals <i>per se</i>; there are genuine reasons.</p></speech>

Other providers charge a higher weekly rental and charge for a longer period.  We are trying to help the students as best we can and we understand they are under pressure.

InfiniLED was a company spun out of the Tyndall National Research Institute.  It was spun out by the university.  As part of that spin-out, which happened in 2016, we got 15% equity for our share of the intellectual property going into the company.  It was sold subsequently and purchased by Oculus, which is owned by Facebook.  The company was bought for &euro;30 million and, because of our shareholding, which had been slightly diluted to about 12.5%, the university got a share of the &euro;30 million in income.</p></speech>

A contributing factor is that we made a surplus in the year in question.  It was an element of why we made a surplus in 2015-16.  We got about &euro;1.6 million in that year.  The Deputy is correct in that there is an element held in escrow pending performance of the technology.  We gave warranties indicating that what was spun out would deliver what it said it would deliver.  The 18 months are now up, in 2018.  Therefore, there remains another &euro;800,000 to come into the university this year.  We got money in 2016, and 18 months later, this year, we are to get money.  It is part of national policy and the document Putting Public Research to Work for Ireland, which was launched by the Minister in 2015.</p></speech>

I genuinely do not want to know because I do not think that would be fair.  It is &euro;36,000 per year to pay for rent for the president.  To the students and the public that might seem strange, but I think I have set it in the right context.</p> <p>  I wish to make a comment to UCC.  We received its letter on the Opera House, and I know the Chairman has a similar opinion to me.  The decision to do a deal with the Opera House was part of our findings with regard to the committee's interim report into the issue of non-taxpayer revenue being isolated as if it were a revenue in itself.  The Committee of Public Accounts has stated quite clearly we do not buy that line.  This is for all colleges, universities and third level institutes.</p> <p>  We have gone back and forward with UCC on number of occasions.  The cost of &euro;500,000 was stated as non-taxpayer revenue and this is reaffirmed in the letter, which states an own source of university income is supporting the partnership.  It is not.  Let us kill this right now for once and for all.  It is not a distinguishable income.  It all goes into the pot and the taxpayer is proportionately paying for signage over the Opera House.  Our question is whether we feel this is a good use of public money.  Personally, I do not think so.  An alliance with Cork Opera House yes, but not paying for signage over it.  Please do not ever write back again and state what was said here and repeat it in the press because we do not accept it.  We cannot be any clearer.  The college can argue it and that is fine, but with regard to what we have decided here, this is a use of taxpayers' money.  If the college did not have the taxpayers' money in the first place it would not be in a position to do it and that is obvious.  Let us nail that.  That goes for all third level institutions, and UCC is not unique to be fair to it.  This is just a comment and I do not want an answer.</p> <p>  I want to get onto the purchase of Grand Parade in Cork by CIT.  When we were here before discussing this we were told it paid &euro;1.25 million.  On 17 June we were not told how much it would cost to upgrade the building, yet a few weeks later the scaffolding went up.  I have pictures of it.  Why at that committee meeting did CIT not tell us about the extra costs that would be part of doing up the building and bringing it up to a certain standard?  The overall costs for this building are way in excess of what CIT paid and presumably it will come in at &euro;2.5 million rather than &euro;1 million.  Why did it not reveal this information to us, considering the many companies that were on site down there in a matter of weeks?  The contracts for those companies must have been signed before CIT appeared before the committee.  Why was that information not given to us at that meeting?</p></speech>

Obviously, they do not talk, or rather they do meet but they did not discuss this, which is fine but it is very strange.  I know Cork well.  I went to UCC for many years.  It is a great college and probably created me, if that sounds right.  I am sorry about that.  My issue, however, is that there are two colleges bidding against each other.  The asking price is &euro;950,000 and they pay &euro;1.25 million, which is &euro;300,000 extra.  For the taxpayers or the people watching as well as for the HEA and the Department, there is something strange there.  The Department should be aware of these things so that they can be examined.  It is certainly an issue.</p> <p>  Will the HEA officials tell us why the travel expenses in the accounts for two of the board members are higher than the others?</p></speech>

No. 9 in the Schedule to the Higher Education Authority  Act states about people who are not resident in Ireland:</p><blockquote>A member of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office if he is adjudged bankrupt or makes a composition or arrangement with creditors, or is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment or penal servitude or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State.</blockquote> <p>Why have we two board members who are not resident in the State?</p></speech>

I think that is dancing on a pin.  For me, if somebody is not resident in the State, in the spirit of the Act, they should cease to be on the board.  There are additional costs on this.

We believe that it is clear that somebody who was appointed and subsequently moves out of the country would cease to be eligible to be a HEA board member.

Following up on that, the HEA did write to this committee to say that it was not happy about the controls in place here, and was unhappy with the role and powers of the financial controller and the process by which they could write their own cheques.  I looked at the board minutes of CIT from 2 February 2017.  A Mr. O'Sullivan asked for an update on the appointment of an external member of the finance committee, which means there was no external person on the finance committee of CIT.  It then says that Mr. Gallagher informed him that the position was advertised externally and the recommendation would come back to the finance committee which in turn would report to the governing body.  Is it not alarming to the HEA that there has been no external person on the finance committee?  I will put this to CIT in a moment.</p></speech>

The governing body was established under the Act.  External bodies make nominations to the governing body.  The only member of the executive on the governing body is the president.  There are two staff members from the academic community, one non-academic staff member and two student members.  Everyone else on the governing body is external.  Once the governing body is established - it was last done in March 2015 - committees are established of members of the governing body.  A finance committee was established, but there was nobody on the governing body with an accounting qualification.  Following a self-evaluation review, it was decided that the membership should be strengthened.  There is provision in the terms of reference to co-opt someone with specialist skills onto the governing body.  This is the first time we have done it, but I am aware that a number of institutes of technology have done it previously.  We believe it is a matter of good practice and the committee undertook the process of advertising, short-listing and filling the position.</p></speech>

We are speaking specifically about CIT which has a turnover of &euro;100 million per annum, but my comment applies to the third level sector generally.  In the context of corporate governance, it is shocking that we have boards and governing bodies in place in the sector that do not have financial competence.  That might be the fault of the legislation, but it is shocking.  I am looking at the accounts of CIT which were signed by the then chairman and president.  The accounts refer to their responsibility to select the accounting policies.  This is an issue that deserves further scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General too.  It is extraordinary that we have chairmen and presidents of governing bodies which, by and large, do not have members with any financial competence who are putting their names to statements to the effect that they have selected suitable accounting policies; made judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; prepared financial statements on a going concern basis, unless the principle is inappropriate; and disclosed and explained all material departures from acceptable accounting standards.  I safely say, based on what the witnesses have said, that the people who signed such statements have no understanding whatsoever of what they have signed.  In effect, they have signed a blank cheque, although I accept that the accounts are audited.  I am not talking about the accuracy of the accounts because the Comptroller and Auditor General audits them.  Yesterday we were discussing the issue of corporate governance, the submission of accounts and the fact that accounts were being submitted late.  Now we are discussing the fact that we have governing bodies and boards of directors of State bodies, some of which have accounts running into the hundreds of millions of euro, which lack financial competence.  I know that such competence can be hired in, but it should be part of the board.</p></speech>

The financial statements are approved through the audit and risk committee, on which there is financial expertise.  We separated it out to ensure the audit and risk committee had a wider remit.  We have a finance committee which is largely procedural, but all of the financial statements and so forth go through the audit and risk committee.  The new code of governance requires that we conduct a matrix of skills analysis in the governing body.  When it comes to nominations to that body, we have a hand in pointing to skills deficits.</p></speech>

I am not referring to the skills available to the finance committees or other sub-committees of boards but boards as a whole.  We accept that we are talking about an educational establishment, but if &euro;100 million or more is going through it, it is disappointing for us to see that there is not a level of financial competence built into the board structure.  The institute is getting there, but I am sure Mr. O'Connor understands our concerns about what we are hearing.</p></speech>

That is part of the problem in dealing with all of these issues.  It might seem a little frivolous because in this case the amount is only &euro;13,000.  A report was produced and an examination carried out.  It was found that &euro;6,000 was outside the spending guidelines, but the taxpayer has to foot the bill anyway.  There is no sanction for anyone in the institute or any of the universities.  The &euro;6,000 will make no difference whatsoever in coming out of a multi-million euro budget.  There is nothing to stop anyone from doing this again.</p></speech>

We are a little ahead of ourselves, but if the final conclusion is that it was incorrect and should, for example, be deducted from the next grant, that, in itself, would be an important signal to send and sanction.  I add that, as part of the funding model review, one of the implementation measures is a penalty system which is being worked through this year with the implementation group.  It is generally concerned with what are regarded as serious and material breaches, but we will come back on that issue.</p></speech>

It strikes me when I look at the figure of &euro;150 million and the institute's spend on consultants that the institutes cannot open an envelope without asking an outside group to give an opinion.  It is amazing on what the money is spent and the amount spent.  That raises questions about what the hell the HEA is doing and what its role is in all of this.  For example, there was a feasibility study of experimental sheep research for a project, at a cost of &euro;131,000, for the academic year 2012-13.  Other spending included a sum of &euro;65,000 on PR for CIT.  The word "medical" also appears a lot on the list and I am not sure what it means: "Medical - &euro;61,000" and "medical - &euro;19,000".</p></speech>

Surely somebody could have looked at this issue and said it might be better to employ counsellors, that it would save money.  The same is true of IT services.  Although there is an IT section, for the academic year 2012-13 I see references to sums of &euro;37,000 and &euro;7,000 for IT support, as well as a reference to a sum of &euro;12,000 for the management of websites.  The same pattern appears for every other academic year.  At what point does the HEA stop and recognise that the institute is spending all of this money on outside consultants?  There are units in place in institutes with in-house experience.  Why are they spending so much money in outsourcing and on outside reports when they could do more in-house and save the taxpayer money?</p></speech>

It is a really serious matter.  There is a constantly increasing demand for counselling.  We had a number of in-house counsellors, but the demand from students, because of the way society is, means that we have six or eight counsellors coming in.  We are looking at reviewing the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-24a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052400002#P04900"><p>To be clear, I absolutely understand that it is a big issue.  Mental health well-being is a very big issue.  I commend the fact that there are supports in place for students, but that is not my point.  It is a really good initiative by universities and institutes of technology if that is what they are doing.  However, we are looking at expenditure line by line and I see a pattern year on year that a lot of money is being spent on counsellors who work outside an institute.  It is a huge amount of money.  I imagine that money could be saved if more of the work was done in-house.  The same is true for IT services.  I do not understand why the institute would pay for website management if it has its own IT department.  Why is that the case?</p><p>In terms of IT, we have experienced quite a high turnover of staff.  That market is very buoyant.  Some of those skills we are bringing in on a short-term basis just as cover.  Some of the skills we are bringing in are specialist, for example, cloud computing and so on, so there is a variety of approach.</p></speech>

There is quite a broad definition of consulting.  We took the Deputy's question, went out to the institutions and went back to 2011, I think.  This is a significant spend, as the Deputy mentioned, of &euro;153 million.  It is critical to see it in the context of the spend across the institutions over that seven or eight year period - not as a justification in itself, but if the Deputy remembers, the expenditure across the institutions over that period was probably somewhere between &euro;12 billion and &euro;15 billion.</p> <p>  At times they will need additional skill sets that are not available in their institution; we have just heard of an example.  At times they may have some of those skill sets in their institution, but they need additional capacity for a period of time, such as the mental health services we just heard about.  At times they might be doing a building project and need to bring in a specialist for a particular focused task, so it is important to see the consultancy spend in that kind of context.  That is really important to stress here.</p></speech>

In 2015-2016 there was payment of &euro;10,500 for Cork IT to Brian Murray SC for legal opinion.  It just says, "Legal opinion PAC".  It should be borne in mind I put the question to a former president of Cork IT, when he was in before us, as to whether the then Accounting Officer had got PR training - in fact, he had got PR training - on how to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We made the point then that I hoped the PR training was about how to answer questions and not how to not answer questions.  Leaving that to one side, why did Cork IT seek legal opinion over attending a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, which cost &euro;10,500?</p></speech>

This was in relation to a series of anonymous letters in which 196 allegations were being made against the institution.  We have been through quite a bit of this, starting with December 2015 in the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was a very significant amount of personal information contained in all of that, in terms of reports and so on.  At the time we asked for some advice in terms of how we would treat that.  Again that is an issue that is continuing to build for us with tomorrow, the GDPR and so on.  It is a particular concern for us in that none of those allegations was substantiated, so it was not fair to be connecting individuals with those allegations.  We have talked a lot about redactions and so on, but we needed to be sure we were protecting that personal information and we sought advice accordingly.</p></speech>

I will come back to the letter they submitted later, but I wish to make a few points first.  My first question is for CIT.  Deputy Kelly asked about protected disclosures.  In June 2017, the then president and Mr. Gallagher appeared before the committee.  It was said at that meeting that Cork IT had never received a protected disclosure.  Is that still the case - at that stage it was June 2017?</p></speech>

Would it have related to issues such as: financial malpractice; impropriety or fraud; activities which involve or have the potential to involve bribery or corruption, failure to comply with a legal obligation; bullying; failure to comply with the institute's charter, statutes or regulations; endangering of health and safety; academic or professional malpractice; improper conduct or unethical behaviour; serious conflict of interest without disclosure; or attempts to conceal any of the above?</p></speech>

The institute engaged with that individual as best we could.  The individual has subsequently taken a High Court action against the institute, which we are defending strongly.  There was huge overlap in this whole area at the time between anonymous letters and a particular individual.</p></speech>

We provided a copy of the draft protected disclosure policy, which was largely as it is now and largely accords with the Act, although the Act was subsequent to it.  We also offered to the individual that we would have a review of any evidential base that was in support of any of these allegations, but none of that was ever forthcoming.</p></speech>

On 17 June, we had no cases.  Mr. Gallagher is outlining what seems to be a very specific case of disclosure.  He is saying that it is before the High Court.

It is, therefore, the discloser who has those rights.  Regarding what the institution does, there is no legal responsibility to investigate but, obviously, it is good practice that if one believes the issues are serious, one should have them investigated.  Hence, it is not a question of any institution, entity or individual in the organisation that receives the disclosure making a legal determination that it is a protected disclosure.  The point that is always made about protected disclosures is that one should forget about the legislation; if a concern is raised, the institution needs to satisfy itself as to the course of action that should be taken.</p></speech>

First, we have what seems to correspond with the 2012 draft disclosures policy in CIT.  We have established that a letter was received and that it was not seen as a disclosure.  The president, on 17 June last year, said, "No, we never received any disclosures."  Mr. Gallagher has said that was the case.  He has said it here again.  However, now we see something that could be a disclosure.  Then we have the process, whereby the institution then decides there are certainly some things in this that it may or may not need to investigate.  The institution refers the matter to the Department and the HEA.  The HEA sends it back and suggests that the institution put together the terms of reference and manage the process.  How is that good governance?  Even if everyone acted appropriately and were second-guessing themselves and were happy to investigate themselves, how would it be good governance to ask the fox to design the security system for the henhouse?</p></speech>

The query concerns costs.  The HEA might want to have a look at this.  A letter was written to the Committee for Public Accounts on 23 March 2018.  It stated that the costs of the merger to date were a total of &euro;571,803.  Yet a letter to the committee dated 27 May stated that the costs were &euro;752,186.  How can it be that the costs were &euro;752,186 in 2015, but went down to &euro;571,803 in 2018?</p></speech>

It seems hilarious that two letters were written to the committee three years apart, indicating that the costs were over &euro;752,000 three years ago, and are now &euro;571,000.  Two years have passed and the costs have decreased.  Apples with apples, oranges with oranges is the argument.  However, I have checked that out, and even allowing for that the figures do not add up.  This is a pretty urgent thing, given the fact-----</p></speech>

I have added those in.  We have public information on those.  They still do not add up.  I would like this information presented in a table.  The witnesses might come back to us next week.</p> <p>  Regarding the Department, obviously its officials have great respect for the HEA and all of that.  They accept that the HEA has a significant role to play.  I take that as given.  I wish to raise the issue of the merger, or the Munster Technological University, particularly the famous minutes that never existed but did exist.  I had to make them public through this process, which is absolutely infuriating and wrong in the first place.  I had to ask for minutes from the HEA, which were never meant to become public, to be made public.  The excuse given was not acceptable nor do I accept it.  These minutes said that the absolute overwhelming majority opinion, the almost unanimous view, was that this should not go ahead.  Policy is a matter for the Government and for Ministers.  That is fine.  As a former Minister I understand that.  However, viewing this matter from the perspective of the Department, I presume its officials basically just dismiss the HEA when they do not agree with it. </p></speech>

The point of public hearings is that the witnesses are asked questions in order to provide answers in public, in camera, for the people outside watching.  It is an indictment of the Department of Education and Skills that it did not have the capacity to send anybody here to answer questions, with full knowledge of the fact that these issues have been aired numerous times before.  The facts are that are minutes of the HEA board showing that the board recommended almost unanimously that this should not happen.  The policy decision of the Department was to go ahead.  As we heard, it will probably start later on this year.  The issue here is this.  I asked a direct question.  In that scenario, the Department dismissed the HEA.</p></speech>

I think I have outlined the point.  I have another question for CIT.  A company called KONE provides services and courses in CIT.  Are any former CIT employees directors of this company, or anyone who is formerly on the management team a director of this company?  Can the witnesses come back to us in writing on that?  Are any former employees or members of the management team directors of this company which is employed by CIT?</p> <p>  The final question is to the Department.  It is based on Mr. Gallagher's evidence.  Earlier, he said there were no protected disclosures prior to 2018.

Obviously, when the draft policy was in place, which Deputy MacSharry examined in detail, it was never used for any cases.  That is because there were no disclosures before 2018, so there were no disclosures during the period of the draft policy.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I am referring to pre-2018 all the time.  For clarity, there were no disclosures when there was a draft policy in place or a full policy in place, pre-2018 and so on.  I respectfully ask the Department, through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, or whatever process, to investigate this matter.  I had not intended to ask this question at all, but based on the evidence heard today, there appears to be a serious issue about the clarity required on whether there were any forms of disclosure in 2018 in the formal or in the draft policy.  I am formally asking the Department to investigate issue with regard to the Cork Institute of Technology.  Whether this is done through the HEA or directly through the Department is the Department's own business, but I ask it, please, to look into it.  This is necessary based on the evidence given here today because there seems to be a certain amount of confusion and information that needs to be looked into.  This is a request.</p></speech>

There was also detail on the rating and implication, grade 2, that the risk strategy or risk appetite of the institute was not well understood and that decision-making may have been suboptimal.  The review said that the institute could take on excessive risk to the detriment of the achievement of its long-term strategic goals.  It said that irregular review of the risk management framework set up by the governing body did not create a stable risk landscape and that it was without focus from the top in terms of risk management, including maintaining the risk register, overseeing progress of remedial actions and reporting to the governing body.  It made an interesting point that insufficient feedback from the governing body and a lack of awareness within the institute of the purpose of the risk register could result in a lack of buy-in.  The review also said that without capture of assurance of peak controls, the executive audit committee and governing body were not provided with adequate assurance as to whether risks were adequately managed.</p> <p>  I read the KPMG report, which is heavily redacted for us so it is difficult to get a full capture of its contents, something we discussed this before.  Notwithstanding what that report said and the witnesses' view, there was the subsequent review in 2016 by PricewaterhouseCoopers that identified failings in risk management.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

We fed back into that policy piece and a new risk management policy has just issued, which is being implemented in CIT.  I accept that risk management as a methodology within CIT is not that well-developed at this stage.  We have an institutional risk register but we have not embedded risk management down further into the organisation.  There is quite a bit of work to do around this.</p></speech>

Perhaps he will respond as best he can while we are in public session.  It concerns a draft report sitting with the HEA about Waterford Institute of Technology and intellectual property.   The HEA furnished the committee with a more global examination of intellectual property, which we will get to at some point.  Will Mr. Love explain to the committee when the report on intellectual property and Waterford Institute of Technology was to be completed, when the draft report was given to the HEA, how long it has been with the HEA and what the difficulties are with regard to publishing that report?</p></speech>

I will update the committee on this while we are in public session.  We have hit a number of difficulties with the report, including significant legal issues.  We have subsequently sent a version of the report to a number of individuals for feedback and a right of reply type process.  We have a number of legal objections to elements of the report.  I do not want to go into more detail than that here.  We have recently received details of those objections and inputs.  These are with our legal team at the moment.</p></speech>

The report was due in November and the Committee of Public Accounts is still waiting for the report as we go into June.  Does Mr. Love accept that a seven-month time gap is more than late?  Does he see this as acceptable from the committee's perspective?  We focused on this issue and we asked for an independent examination.  A report was done and someone obviously did a huge piece of work on it.  The report was submitted to the HEA, and while I understand that due diligence must be followed, we are seven months down the road and we still do not have that report.  It must also be borne in mind that this committee was hoping to use the report as an opportunity to explore the wider issue.  This situation is holding up the committee's work, and if an independent report is done, it must be published so we can see exactly what the problems were, if there were problems.</p></speech>

One of the strengths of a university is that it has autonomy and is able to borrow and invest.  If existing universities can borrow while technological universities cannot borrow, we do not have a level playing field.  That feeds into the concerns that those who are against technological universities have.  They may have other reasons too.  I want to see it happen but I have a concern about technological universities not being on a par with existing universities.  Is baseline funding for research and development in the legislation?</p></speech>

When allegations or matters are raised, it is very important that each institution has the capacity to carry out a good governance process, which can properly be viewed as independent, to help the institution to reach a satisfactory conclusion.  If all allegations like this have to be outsourced to an independent body - ourselves or some other body - the process of self-investigation will not develop within institutions and this will affect their competence to regulate and govern themselves.  An outside body or a set of outside bodies should be able to go a step further when that is needed.  When allegations like these are raised, I would be concerned if the institution could simply step back and say it has to be tossed over to somebody else.</p></speech>

It is black and white.  If there is an allegation against me, I need to be 100 miles away from the investigation other than when the independent investigator comes to me to ask me questions about it.  Why did KPMG consult the executive only?  Why did it not conduct wholesale interviews across a random selection of staff to see if any of these things stands up?  It did not do so.  According to a letter on this issue that was sent by Bob Savage after the draft report, KPMG undertook further review work and consulted the executive for a number of weeks.  The executive is telling us it was the subject of numerous allegations.  This entire process is flawed.  I suggest to the HEA and the Department that they should tear up the flawed guidance they have because it asks the fox to investigate the incident that resulted in the chickens being eaten.  That is not real, appropriate, authentic or credible.  In fact, it makes clowns out of everybody associated with this process, including those of us who are trying to ask questions.  This is not personal and it is without prejudice.  Maybe all of these allegations were totally vexatious.  The credible and professional names that are associated with the report which has been carried out - I refer to KPMG, legal firms and so on - are selling themselves short by being associated with a process that was such as shambles.  I suggest to the HEA and the Department that their guidance is laughable and wide open to accusations of containment and of enabling the process to be internally managed to ensure the truth is suppressed in the interests of protecting an individual, a group of individuals or an institution.  Frankly, it plays completely into the credible accusation, which this committee has seen more than most, that those who want to be whistleblowers need to be prepared to be portrayed as villains and crooks and to be thrown under the bus.  It is laughable and comical to suggest that the process of allowing institutions to investigate themselves is independent.</p></speech>

I think our general point is one we have made here before.  The protected disclosures legislation is relatively new.  I think most people share the view that it has not yet been fully embraced.  It is not operating as originally intended.  I am not talking about this case.  We are finding it everywhere.  I could list ten organisations in which we have encountered this issue.  I am not making excuses.  When the freedom of information legislation was introduced some years ago, people struggled for a few years as they sought to handle it.  They probably got the hang of it eventually.  The protected disclosures legislation applies to the private sector as well as the public sector.  It is very important.  We are in a space where everybody is struggling.  People have yet to get on top of the operation and spirit of the legislation.  We are finding that at this committee all over the place.  That is a general comment.  I am not looking for a response.  I will allow Dr. O'Connor to respond before I bring Deputy Connolly in.</p></speech>

I would like to make some points of clarification about the way the institute and the governing body work.   Apart from the internal members who were mentioned by Mr. Gallagher earlier, such as the staff and student representatives, all the members of the governing body are external members.  The sub-committees of the governing body are serviced by the office of the vice president for finance and administration.  All matters of human resources, personnel, finance and procurement go through one office.  Anything to do with students, quality and examinations goes through the office of the vice president for academic affairs.  We do not have a huge infrastructure there.</p></speech>

This relates back to what all Deputies see when they are dealing with constituents.  If somebody who has applied for social housing from his or her local authority does not get it and subsequently submits an appeal, good practice dictates that somebody outside the housing function, rather than somebody more senior in the housing section, should look at the appeal.</p><p>It is obvious that somebody utterly unconnected with the original decision should be looking at it.  That is common sense.  Mr. Gallagher has indicated.</p></speech>

However, I welcome what has been said.</p> <p>  My final point is on IMERC.  I have listened to everything that has been said here today.  Over two years we have listened.  The debacle relating to IMERC does not really inspire confidence.  Two third level institutions and the Naval Service set up IMERC.  Looking at the document it refers to new governance arrangements emerging.  It sets out all this flashy documentation and so on.  My time is limited.  I look at that and then I look at the review of Ireland's Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster dated May 2016.  It is an indictment.  I just have to put it on the record because I have taken the time to look at it and I have raised it previously.  It is not my area, but it jumps out.  We have to get an international panel of reviewers to look at this.  They distinguish the university and CIT from the institution that was IMERC.  Words fail me.  The team identified a very significant weakness in the structure and operation of the institutional IMERC's governance and controls, and the absence of robust procurement, financial management and public relations.  I will not quote the whole thing.  The witnesses will accept it is a damning indictment of the new governance structures emerging.  A structure was set up and it is allowed.</p></speech>

I accept that the three institutions were not damned in this report.  What was set up with the full co-operation of the three institutions was this institution.  This institution is the subject of a damning report by a panel of international experts.  We have all this glossy stuff telling us about wonderful new governance.  Dr. O'Connor accepts it is damning.  It was confirmed when it was dissolved.  As I understand, it was not dissolved from any internal recognition of problems.  It was dissolved because of this review and because very good people in the institutions said it was not right.</p></speech>

This came into effect on 18 April.  Essentially, the document says that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, has published guidance for assisting public service bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act.  It summarises the key features and states that all public service bodies have the responsibility to have procedures in place and available to their employees for dealing with protected disclosures.  It goes on to address the nature of my query.  As we know, a lot of this has been outsourced to other organisations and we asked what the procedure was and whether everybody goes and does their own outsourcing.  The Office of Government Procurement says it has a procurement framework which came into effect on 11 April this year, only the other day.  That is now being sent to all Government bodies in respect of outsourcing of these issues.</p> <p>  There are three framework agreements that can be put in place.  If the witnesses have not read the guidelines yet, they are on their way to them now.  They should have read them last week.  One framework agreement says that for the provision of third-party confidential recipient services pursuant to section 6 of the Protected Disclosures Act, an organisation that might not be big enough to have somebody independent internally can designate a third-party confidential recipient and there is a framework in place in respect of the procurement of that particular service.</p> <p>  There is a separate service that is provided for under this framework to say that an organisation can have a procurement service in respect of the full investigative services into an alleged wrongdoing purported to be disclosed under the Protected Disclosures Act including a review of such services.  That allows an organisation to have a person not just act as a confidential recipient but also investigate the alleged wrongdoing independent of the organisation.</p> <p>  The third framework procurement contract that is now in place is for full investigative services of allegations of penalisation or adverse treatment as a result of having made a disclosure of wrongdoing, or where such a disclosure is purported to have been made, pursuant to the Act, and for review of such investigations.  In the event that somebody feels they have been penalised as a result of making a disclosure or a purported disclosure - I stress that there is a presumption in the Act that a disclosure is a protected disclosure - this allows for a framework to be put in place and independently procured in line with Government procurement.</p> <p>  There are three separate contracts now available and that is part of the issue we have been processing here.  We felt the thing was not working and were putting the onus on DPER.  It is up to the Department at national level to get this protected disclosures legislation working across the board.  We found on several occasions - I have two or three more examples on my desk - that the current arrangements have not been working.  This framework is an acknowledgement that the system was not fully functional up to now.  This letter was dated 11 May.  It came to the committee within the last week and is due to be raised in correspondence.</p></speech>

I note what the Chairman has read out.  I note that it included words like "guidelines" and "internal, independent".  If that is not an oxymoron I do not know what is.  How can we have an internal independent person, without prejudice?  It is an impossibility.  Nobody internal can investigate or be part of the investigation of allegations against that institution - work colleagues, golf buddies, drinking buddies, friends.  That is not there.  Guidelines are optional, as we all know and have learned at our expense at different times.</p> <p>  I wish to make a proposal which will need a seconder.  That will have to be the Chairman unless Deputy Alan Kelly wants to second it.  I propose, whether it is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills in this instance or DPER in general, that we need a whole new set of guidelines.  It is never acceptable to have an internal independent party because that is a conflict of interest in itself.  Even if what the Chairman read out is now the gold standard that can prevent and give absolute confidence to whistleblowers, the public and everyone that everything is independent and there is going to be a full and complete investigation and consideration, it is not retrospective.  In that context, there should be a re-investigation independently overseen by the Department of the anonymous disclosure that has been referred to, any letters that are judged to be disclosures or not pre-2017, and the ones currently before them.</p> <p>  I do not believe it is appropriate - without prejudice - for their own protection at a very minimum that executives, staff or certain people within the institution that is the subject of a protected disclosure are in any way associated with the management, oversight, facilitation or otherwise of a protected disclosure.  I ask that we write to the Secretaries General or the Ministers at DPER and the Department of Education and Skills because it is in this context that there would be a re-investigation of this.  I think I have proven beyond doubt this was not independent - again without prejudice - because of the involvement of people who were named in allegations, however false they may have been or vexatious.  That is not transparent.  It is not good governance and it is a clear conflict of interest.  I formally propose that.  I ask the Chairman to second it.  I know the clerk is talking to him there.</p></speech>

We might then move down the process.</p><p>Dr. Love and Department representatives said that it is important, from a governance evolution perspective, for an organisation to learn from its mistakes and I totally agree with that.  However, the fact there is a procedure in place does not mean it is a good one or the right one; nor does it mean that it is going to lead to learning.  If a truly independent, external body is involved in setting terms of reference and managing matters at arm's length, like the Department or the HEA, the results of that process can act as the learning catalyst in improving governance in an organisation, whether that be CIT, Sligo IT or any other State entity.</p><p> I have a concern about this letter and the issue of parties and entertainment.  Dr. Love said that this had the potential to address the problem as he saw it.  He said that it was a personal view but wanted to reserve the right of the board to take its own view.  I am glad he so reserved because I cannot see how his board would be remotely happy with this.  It is all about what is going to be done in the future as opposed to addressing what happened in the past.  There is no sanction.  There is an acknowledgement that &euro;13,000 was dished out, that the person in charge of the money decided to spend it and that this was clearly condoned by others.  The only suggestion is that for presidential or governing body expenditure in excess of &euro;500, prior approval of the vice president of finance and administration is required but that is easily obtained.  That is not a procedure.  Where is the sanction?</p></speech>

Before doing so, the board should bear in mind that this is all about how things are going to be managed in the future.  All anyone has to do at the moment is get the permission of the vice president of finance to spend whatever he or she likes, which means this could happen again if the vice president of finance is disposed to agreeing to an ice sculpture, the hiring of a band and so forth.  That is a problem.  There is also no sanction.  Where is the tangible sanction which demonstrates to every institution that the HEA condemns the use of &euro;13,000 of taxpayers' money on this type of hospitality?  Where is the condemnation of the use of public money for a portrait?  The institute had so little confidence in its own art faculty that it did not even commission a student but paid &euro;20,000 to an external person to do it.  There should be no ambiguity here and there should be echoes of condemnation from the Department.</p></speech>

I am not inferring anything about Dr. Love's judgment.  He gave a personal opinion.  While I appreciate that the process is not finished, on 17 June it will be one year since we first discussed these matters and that is a problem.  The echoes of condemnation should still be heard from 18 June, that public money cannot be spent in this way.</p> <p>  The CIT proposal relates to a procedure.  We may be happy that a procedure will be put in place but not if the procedure is that the vice president of finance must say that it is okay whenever &euro;20,000 is being dished out for a portrait or an ice sculpture because that is not good enough.  I do not know how Dr. Love's board, when the time comes for its next meeting, could be remotely happy with this pitiful account of how taxpayers' money can be handled in the future.  People will only need the permission of one person to dish out whatever they want.  I expect to hear after that board meeting - albeit a year late - a loud chorus of condemnation and to see clear procedures laid out, rather than guidelines, on what people can and cannot do.</p></speech>

Back in October or November, the finance subcommittee of CIT's governing body also brought in another procedural check.

There is an added protection there from the point of view of the vice president of finance and administration.</p></speech>

I made an assumption, as did other committee members, that a certain person was the contract manager on a PPP project all along.  We had an entire discussion in the context of that incorrect assumption.  Nobody corrected that and the person concerned suggested in correspondence that we could have asked.  We were not corrected and did not know that we should ask because that was the information we were given at the time.  I ask the witnesses to put it on the record that the person referred to at our previous meeting, who we are not naming today, was not the contract manager until such time as the operational phase of the PPP project began.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

This protected disclosure will come up again.  I know of another item of correspondence raising the protected disclosure issue for next week as well, so this protected disclosure issue will come back and we can discuss it further.  We have already agreed to write to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills today asking them to comment on this issue of people internal to the organisation who may not be considered independent or may be named as part of the disclosure that has been made and the appropriateness of those individuals examining matters when they might be personally connected with some of the issues that have been raised in the statement.  We will ask for a response from the two Departments specifically on that issue and we can take it from there when we get a response.</p> <p>  No. 1302B, from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, OPW, provides an information note requested by the committee on the advices given by the OPW to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Probation and Welfare Trust.  We will note and publish this.  We have discussed it before.</p> <p>  No. 1309B, from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Acting Secretary General at the Department of Justice and Equality, provides a follow-up note on a number of matters, including the probation service building; costs associated with two protected disclosures; the numbers of people accommodated in commercial and State-owned direct provision centres; sections to be commenced in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act; the Bridge Project; and the process and systems to raise matters with the Minister.  We will note and publish this.  There is a lot of documentation there.  If members want to raise it again next week, they should feel free.  We will note and publish it for today.</p> <p>  No. 1320B, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, provides an explanatory note on Trinity College Dublin, TCD, and the inclusion of audit certificates with financial statements.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 1328B, from the State Claims Agency, dated 22 May 2018, provides follow-up to our meeting two weeks ago.  I consider this a very serious item of correspondence.  It arrived here just yesterday evening, and I arranged for hard copies to be given out to members even though there are 40 pages in it.  The issue is very serious.  I do not want to reopen the CervicalCheck discussion at the Committee of Public Accounts - not at the moment anyway - but there is a very difficult issue highlighted in this letter that the committee needs to deal with very strongly.  I refer to the addendum on page 2.  The State Claims Agency was asked by the committee for "A note with the details of the interaction with CervicalCheck and the [State Claims Agency] regarding how the communication process to the women affected would operate".  I wanted to read that last section into the record.  This is the cover letter.</p></speech>

There are the six requests we made to the State Claims Agency after its appearance before the committee on 10 May.  We requested &quot;A note with the details of the interaction with CervicalCheck and the [State Claims Agency] regarding how the communication process to the women affected would operate&quot; and four other items.  They were in the minutes of the meeting and the State Claims Agency formally got a letter asking that it reply to those five items.  The response to one of the items concerns me.  The bulk of the document concerns dealing with period payment orders and so on.  The agency is waiting for that section of the Act to commence.  The part I want to highlight is on page 2, the addendum to the letter signed by Ciar&aacute;n Breen, the director of the State Claims Agency.  It concerns the communication between the HSE and the State Claims Agency and the communication process to the women affected by the case.  He says in his letter:</p><blockquote>We have noted that John Gleeson of HSE CervicalCheck, during his evidence to the PAC on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup>May last, indicated that nobody in HSE CervicalCheck informed the State Claims Agency, in or about the time of Vicky Phelan's trial, that all of the women, the subject matter of the audit, had been informed.<br /><br />Mr. Gleeson's assertion does not accord with the facts.</blockquote> <p>I will read that statement again.  The HSE was here last week giving evidence, and the director of the State Claims Agency flatly contradicts it and says, &quot;Mr. Gleeson's assertion does not accord with the facts.&quot;  We have an absolute conflict.  I want to read the rest of the addendum.</p><blockquote>The Agency re-iterates its advices to the Committee that its legal team, comprising Senior and junior Counsel, a solicitor and paralegal, held a teleconference, on 20<sup>th</sup>April 2018, with a senior person in CervicalCheck.  Senior Counsel specifically asked if that person, the employee of CervicalCheck, was aware whether or not the affected women had been informed.  The reply was that all women whose smear [test] was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed they had been informed by their treating clinicians and this reply was carefully noted and attached to the [State Claims Agency's] legal file.<br /><br />In giving his evidence to the Committee, Mr. Breen had ascertained the above specifically for the purposes of giving evidence to the Committee on the particular point.</blockquote><p>Since that arrived this morning, I have sent a message back to the State Claims Agency asking it to provide us with the name of the person from the HSE who was part of the teleconference and, if possible, a copy of the final note.  On the face of it, there are two State agencies involved, two of the most important in the State.  One is saying that what was said by one in public session at a meeting of this committee does not accord with the facts.  The Committee of Public Accounts has nothing to do with CervicalCheck, but when witnesses appear here, we expect them to speak openly and with candour.  This man is disagreeing that that has happened.  This is an issue that the committee cannot let run.</p></speech>

The first is that, on the face of it, Mr. Gleeson might not have given accurate evidence to this committee.  That is quite serious.  I had difficulty with many of the answers we got from him, in particular.  That is serious.  What is more serious is the substance because if the State Claims Agency was of the view, formed on the basis of information it states it got from CervicalCheck, verified by its legal counsel, that all the women had been informed of the misdiagnosis, or that their treating clinicians had informed them, so maybe it was not the women directly-----</p></speech>

It is very profound and goes beyond whether Mr. Gleeson was correct in what he said to the committee.  I am more concerned about the substance.  I am not sure how we could handle that today but it is certainly very serious.</p></speech>

I was representing the committee elsewhere.  I have read a lot about the proceedings of this committee, the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and the Committee on Health.  First, there should be only one committee doing the business on this matter although I recognise two points: first, that the Committee of Public Accounts did a very good job last week and, second, that I do not believe some of the information that has been provided to the Oireachtas would have been provided had it not been for the Committee of Public Accounts.  With those two provisos, I must state there is a point at which we, as a committee, must recognise it is not customary for committees to duplicate each other's business, which is what is happening.  There are three involved.  The matter is to be subject to an inquiry that the Oireachtas will establish in due course.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the correspondence provided by Mr. Breen, which alludes to an issue that merits further discussion at this committee, should be provided to the health committee.  It is of relevance to it to consider it while not diminishing our role in the process from a public expenditure perspective.  I propose that the correspondence be sent to the clerk of the health committee.</p></speech>

I just wanted to put that on the record because I did not have the opportunity to do so before last Thursday evening's meeting where the decision to have a hearing on this matter, with which I have no difficulty, was agreed to, and the subsequent meeting of the committee on the matter.</p></speech>

The letter from the State Claims Agency is headed and refers to the work of the committee.  The subject was matters related to the State Claims Agency, management of legal costs, open disclosure, and the implications for CervicalCheck revelations.  Also covered were the 2016 financial statements of the State Claims Agency and the 2016 financial statements of the HSE.  The Deputy will know that, over recent months, we have had detailed correspondence from the HSE and State Claims Agency regarding the management of medical negligence issues.  That issue, which we have flagged, will be considered by this committee again.  The cervical screening issue that blew up in the public arena was an example of the issue we had been dealing with all along.  It is not the issue <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

I do not want to give the impression that it was.  I used to be a member of the Committee on Justice and Equality, and I remember that a common phrase used at its meetings was that it was not a catch-all for everything.  The justice committee gets almost as much business as the Committee of Public Accounts.  Now that I am a member of the latter, I recognise that it gets everything and that the justice committee is second.  I just wanted to put on the record that-----</p></speech>

I made the point here on the previous occasion that there had been seven committee meetings across three groups, with 32 witnesses in attendance.  I do not believe in unnecessary duplication but I do believe the Committee of Public Accounts dealt with specific issues.  There was a debate at the health committee yesterday that probably covered areas that we will not be covering.  The same happened with Templemore in that the justice committee said it should be considering that.  The same happened with the issue of Mr. Maurice McCabe.  That happens every time the Committee of Public Accounts deals with a matter.  The Deputy's point is well made.</p></speech>

She sends her apologies.</font></p><p>No. 1314C is from <font color="#002100">an individual and relates to the cost of insurance.  It is not within the remit of this committee to get into the matter of insurance costs.  The lady mentions motor insurance primarily, especially motor insurance for young people.

Agreed.</p><p>No. 1315C is from <font color="#002100">Ms Oonagh McPhillips, acting Secretary General at the Department of Justice and Equality, and relates to the GoSafe programme.  Can we note and publish it?  Agreed.</font></p><p>No. 1316C is from <font color="#002100">the former vice president of CIT and relates to matters discussed at the committee meeting on 22 March 2018.</font></p><p>I propose that we do not publish this but rather hold it over for consideration until next week.  The next item is No. 1317, a letter dated 27 April from an individual on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding <i>ex gratia</i>payments to the Irish Horse Welfare Trust.  I propose that we forward this item to the Department for a further response on the points as this has come up before.  Item No. 1318 is correspondence from an individual on the committee's hearing on cervical cancer.  The individual feels this would be more appropriate to be dealt with by the Garda.  We will just note that remark.  Item No. 1327 is correspondence from UCC on a request for information by the committee on a specific retirement package which was raised by Deputy Kelly.  We note that.<br/><br/>There are no statements of account before the committee today.  There is a gap in the work programme due to a cancelled meeting.  We will try to get the National Treatment Purchase Fund in on 14 June.  There being no other business, I note that next week we were to consider the draft report on corporation tax which was circulated from the secretariat weeks ago and which had been on hold.  The report has sat there but I hope we can run through it in detail next Thursday in private session.  It is not a long report.  We will try to complete that business in private session.  We are not circulating copies of that.  When we did so three weeks ago, it appeared on the front pages of newspapers within 36 hours.  People will have to come here and get hard copies, discuss it as it is here and hand it back in.  When we issue a report, it will be a report of the committee.  Before we adjourn, I note that Deputy MacSharry had indicated.</p></speech>

I asked the gentleman from education which section of the Act prescribed that and he quoted the section of the Act which allowed for the making of the guidelines.  Guidelines are just that, guidelines.  This is in the interests of all of the people.  As I said at the meeting, even if all of the allegations were vexatious, why would everyone not be interested in having a process which was beyond reproach in circumstances where the current one is not.  This was a significant issue which has caused a lot of trouble.  There has been correspondence to all of us to pursue it.  Why can we not have an independent investigation or reinvestigation of all of that?  I am not asking for a commission of investigation or tribunal or anything like that.  I note regarding the question of whether the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform ever comes back on the Chairman's correspondence that we need a very prescribed process.  A process should never be overseen or facilitated by the fox rather than the hens.  That stands to reason.</p></speech>

I just want their view on it.  On that, I note that when the Department of Health wrote to the CPP last week to try to stop the Chairman proceeding with the meeting, by 5 p.m. that evening the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor had a full legal position.  That took a matter of hours but it is weeks since I brought this up.  Is there a problem?  Did we request it?</p></speech>

He is not after money.  He is just after proper oversight.  In the meantime, we are being hampered in getting answers from the relevant people when they are in because they state these matters are before the courts.  If we proceeded along those lines, we would do the State a service, save the money and maybe get answers for everybody.</p> <p>  No doubt the legal affairs office will come back and state that such a course of action is highly unorthodox and, of course, it is.  Sometimes it is okay to be pioneering, particularly if it shows a bit of common sense and saves a few pounds.</p></speech>

The question I ask is, "Is there anything wrong legally with us doing this?", as opposed to "Give us lots of reasons why not to do it".  It is, "Can we award the try?", as opposed to, "Give us an analysis of the game?"</p></speech>
