The Donegal Islands Marine Resource Organisation is represented by Mr. Jerry Early, Ms Majella N&iacute; Chr&iacute;och&aacute;in and Mr. John O'Brien and the Loop Head Tourism Group is represented by Mr. Luke Aston.  I thank the delegates for coming before the joint sub-committee to discuss issues contained in the committee's recent report on promoting sustainable rural coastal and island communities and how the report's recommendations can be best implemented.</p><p>  Before we begin, I must notify the delegates of the procedure on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I understand Mr. Early from the Donegal Islands Marine Resource Organisation will lead the opening comments and he will be followed by Mr. Aston.  I invite Mr. Early to proceed. </p></speech>

It is our third time to attend here and we are quite chuffed to be back a third time.  Our organisation which was originally the Donegal Islands Fishermen's Group has evolved into the Donegal Islands Marine Resource Organisation, DIMRO, on which I will expand later.</p><p>  I welcome the report.   It is a fantastic report and it offers us a fantastic opportunity.  The reaction of the islanders in general to the report has been very positive.  That is a step forward.  I want to put on record that I believe it is imperative that this report is implemented.  I hope our good friends lobby as hard as they can to get whatever must be done to achieve that.  It really and truly serves as our best and last hope for progressing on what we have achieved so far.  </p><p>  My colleague Mr. John O'Brien, who was in the Donegal Islands Fishermen's Group and is now in the DIMRO will speak about certain proposed amendments to it and the members of the committee might like to talk to him about those.  Ms Majella N&iacute; Chr&iacute;och&aacute;in is from Comdh&aacute;il na nOile&aacute;in and she will speak about how we intend to broaden our horizons within the islands group to include all the islands.  At present the islands group is the DIMRO but we want to expand to include all the islands off the island of Ireland.  </p><p>  The history of the Donegal Islands Fishermen's Group started in 2007 with the ban on drift net fishing of salmon.</p> <p>We felt it was a huge blow not just to the islands but to the entire west coast region.  The islands in Donegal were heavily dependent on salmon fishing.  While we were fighting that case, restrictions on area 6A were introduced.  These exceeded our own role and required us to look further afield because we were fighting a battle on two fronts.  We were fighting the salmon ban as well as trying to restore what we regarded as our resources and our right to fish in area 6A.  That battle took us to Brussels and many other parts of Europe.</p><p> The Donegal islands group comprised three islands in particular, Aranmore, Inisbofin and Tory, to a lesser extent.  We are self-funded and have never sought funding from other sources.  We believed it was something we had to do as a legacy for our own children.  Our fight took us on a journey that none of us expected to last seven years.  I am hopeful this report may finally allow us to take a step in the right direction.  I hope it will be seen as progress.  The Common Fisheries Policy negotiations happened to take place while we were on our journey.  We met with Commissioner Demanaki, who was very sympathetic given that she also was an islander.  Amendment No. 14a to the final draft of the CFP states: "Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should be especially recognised and supported both financially and through the allocation of additional resources, in order to enable them to survive and prosper in the future".  That was a significant provision but the matter stopped there.  We need guidance from the sub-committee because, at the end of the day, we can only play the small islander card.  That appears to be a major statement of intent but we need guidance from members on how we can benefit from what they are telling us in the corridors of Europe.  We need help and guidance on how to break down that amendment to make it work to our benefit.</p><p> The inshore sector in Ireland is generally recognised as fragmented, with no defined goals or roles.  For the want of a better word, it is a mess and it needs to be totally revamped.  I suggest that a new group be established to oversee the sector.  Approximately 80% of fishermen in Ireland operate in the sector.  They are not being represented at any level, however.  The bigger, pelagic, boats are represented by the KFO and the IFPO, which are paid on a commission basis.  Unfortunately, we cannot afford to pay the commissions these groups request.  In the last month, due to the lobbying power of the pelagic fleet, the mackerel quota was increased by 65%.  I am very happy for those fishermen but that does not solve the problems that the other 80% of fishermen face.  Particularly in Donegal, inshore fishermen have no choice but to fish for two species, namely, crab and lobster.  Last week, unbelievably for the beginning of May, lobster made &euro;10.50 per kilogram.  That is a disaster because at this stage of the year the prices are not going to increase.  The price has not even bottomed out.  We have been corralled into one fishery and confined to two shellfish stocks.  Foresight is needed from either the Oireachtas or the Minister in expanding on this report, which offers something for everyone, not just the islanders but all those who live in coastal regions.  The inshore sector has to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  It is far too easy for Departments to push the problem elsewhere while there is no defined single line of responsibility.  I acknowledge that BIM is trying its best but it is overloaded in the wrong areas.</p><p> We believe these changes are important to our continued existence on the islands.  I do not say this lightly.  It was a survival plan and that is why our fight has continued for seven years.  Our existence depends on this report being implemented.  People need to stop the talking and devise a plan.  Everybody we speak to wants the islands to survive but, as far as I can see, that is not happening.  A structured plan is required whereby all the political parties come together to preserve the islands as the jewels in the crown for this country.  The sooner we do that, the better.  This report offers the best chance of achieving that objective.</p></speech>

Considerable effort was invested in drafting it and it has provided good groundwork on finding a solution to the problems we face.  The ban on drift net fishing for salmon in 2006 was a disaster for the entire west coast of Ireland and, particular, island communities.  We are totally dependent on seasonal fishing.  As Mr. Early noted, are currently selling lobster at &euro;10.50 to &euro;11 per kilogram. compared to &euro;17 or &euro;18 per kilogram this time last year.  When salmon fishing was an option we managed our stock by looking forward to 1 June when we could start drift netting for wild Atlantic salmon.  When the new regulations were introduced to the effect that salmon could only be caught in rivers, island communities were excluded.  An injustice was done in that regard and we are never going to give up until that injustice is corrected.</p> <p>That is because anywhere it has been done, it has never gone away.  It is always there to haunt one.</p><p> There was money available under the hardship scheme so that if one took it, one would go away and keep quiet.  Those of us here and the people we represent did not avail of the hardship scheme because we did not see any future in it.  One only gets money, which one spends and that is the end of it.  We wanted a heritage licence to pass on to our sons.  I own my own boat and my three sons work with me.  We created our own jobs.  We are self-employed, which is a bit of disaster, especially given all the bad weather this year.  </p><p> Many of the things which went wrong for us started from the time we joined the EU.  Putting us into boxes and having entitlements to crab, lobster, cod, etc., does not work.  As Mr. Early said, it might work to a certain extent for those who took advantage of the POs and moved to larger vessels, the pelagic boats, which have 90% or probably more of the mackerel and the herring quota.  As Mr. Early said, through strong lobbying, they got a huge increase in the mackerel quota, although that is not exactly true.  The country - the Irish Government - got a huge increase in the quota and it is up to it to distribute it among the right people.  The people of the Donegal island and along the whole the western seaboard should get a percentage of that.  Until this year, I think we only had half a tonne per day.  From what I hear, these large pelagic boats are not dancing as a result of this huge increase either because they are afraid the prices will drop to the same extent as the quotas have gone up.  The Irish Government - the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - got the increase in the quota and it is up to it to share it fairly.  The committee and the report must ensure that fish is distributed equally among all those who have a full polyvalent licence and who have an entitlement to that fish.</p><p> Much emphasis is placed on 10 m boats and more flexibility for them.  We want some more work done on that.  Since we started that campaign six years ago, I have been invited to many places, especially the Mediterranean and the French island.  While we get &euro;10 per kilo of lobster, they get &euro;60.  A 10 m boat in the Mediterranean is a large boat because of the weather there.  To encourage fishermen off the Donegal coast to try to earn a living with a 10 m boat would be close to a disaster.  Members will have noted the weather we had from October to January.  I have a 12 m boat and I try to work all year round with it.  To try to be self-employment with anything less than a 12 m boat would be a disaster.</p><p> The problem with the fishing industry is that one is either in it or one is not.  One has to be self-employed, which puts a lot of pressure on one to go out in all sorts of weather to earn a living.  There should be more flexibility in terms of social welfare to reduce that pressure.  If not, we should be allowed to have the boats we think suitable for that type of fishing.</p><p> If all boats from Arranmore, Tory, Inishbofin or elsewhere are all the same size, they will all compete in the same ground for the same species.  There should be more of a variety where the smaller boats fish along the shore and the larger boats move further offshore to fish for different species.  It should be simple enough to have a bit of flexibility there.  It would be worth listening to groups such as ours which know what they want.</p><p> I understand there will be some EU funding for young skippers - skippers under 40 years of age - getting back into the industry.  However, the boat must be between three years and 30 years but that does not make sense to us because no new inshore boats have been built in Ireland since 1983, so there are hardly any under 30 year old boats in this country and there is no market for them.  </p><p> With the new regulations and the end of discards, we should start with a blank page.  If we want to end discards, we should design boats which will not bring in discards.  We should design boats, like those about which we are talking, specially designed to keep shellfish alive.  That is a fishery which has no quota, no mortality and no waste.   </p><p> As I said, three of my sons are working with me.  There were four brothers in my family and we all expanded by getting our own boats.  If my sons or Mr. Early's sons want to expand into non-quota species, in particular, they should be encouraged and helped financially by the EU, by BIM or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  I have not seen one job created by Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Inishbofin and, as far as I know, in Tory or in Arranmore, although those from Arranmore may correct me.  Any jobs created on those islands were created by us with no financial aid.</p><p> I do not know who came up with the idea that the boat must be three years old.  I mention the boat I tied up last year.  I got word from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that if I did not replace her or put her through the code of practice before the end of July, the licence would be taken off the boat and that if I could not replace the boat within two years, the Department would take back the licence.  I would like some financial aid for one of my sons to replace that boat with a boat with which he could earn a living and create another three or four jobs.  The jobs I am talking about are jobs on the boat and not jobs in Hannigan Fish Trading or in Earagail Eisce, the people who buy the fish and add value to them.</p></speech>

I congratulate the committee on this report which is extremely useful and a step forward in terms of coastal and, in particular, island communities,.  It is broader than the fishing industry but we owe a debt of gratitude to the Donegal fishermen who have been pushing this for about seven years, mostly unaided.  These issues would not be on the table today if it were not for them.</p><p>  For its part, Comdh&aacute;il is looking to have a meeting or some event this year to see if we can get all of the fishers on the islands involved in an organisation, as they have done in Donegal.  I would say that this is an issue of concern to all of the islanders, just in case there is any perception that this an issue which is only of concern to Donegal.  </p><p>  The report mentioned Comhairle na Tuaithe or of some kind of forum where general policies issues at which the report looked could be progressed.  That would be great.  I am not sure if the committee is talking about an inter-departmental thing or something that would be broader but certainly Comdh&aacute;il would be more than happy to sit in on that if it was a possibility.  It is really important there is a forum where we examine coastal policy issues which includes fishing but also coastal management and tourism.  People may have difficulty with the flags but there are flags in each of the areas where there are islands.  Perhaps that is another vehicle where we could look at getting policy issues which are of concern to coastal communities and, in particular, island communities addressed.  </p><p>  Once again, I congratulate the Donegal fishermen.  If there is a comhairle na mara or something like that, we would be more than happy to sit on it and work with them.  </p></speech>

It is my first time in this House, so I am probably not as used to it as these Donegal lads.  I am coming from a tourism background now.  Sometimes we are so taken up with angling that inshore fishing sometimes clashes.</p> <p>I was in commercial fishing all my life until I started this and I agree with much of what the other delegations are saying.  One of the things that struck me was the idea of 10 m boats.  Based on my experience of fishing off the west coast for 25 years, it is a crazy idea.  The difference between a 10 m and a 12 m boat is huge.</p></speech>

Loop Head Tourism comprises three parishes on the Loop Head peninsula that came together.  We all had our little development associations and voluntary groups in each parish.  That does not get one anywhere sometimes and, therefore, we got together four years ago and developed Loop Head Tourism, a company owned by the development associations in the three parishes.  It was set up to develop and market tourism in a sustainable way in our area.  One of the first things we did was enter the EDEN awards, which are European awards.  We entered as a destination of excellence under the heading of aquatic tourism and we won it for Ireland, which was a great start for a new group.  Last year, we won the best holiday destination in Ireland in a competition run by Bord F&aacute;ilte and <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Working together like that has worked well for us in a defined area.<br />It is a little peninsula, which is almost an island, and much of the tourism in our area is marine based.  I am involved in angling and there is dolphin watching and nature watching at sea while many other sports and activities such as kayaking are available.  We are developing something within 12 miles of the land, which is very much what the committee is doing in its report.  It is a great idea but it cannot be done in isolation.  Fish do not decide to stop swimming when they come within 12 miles of the coast.  Fish are a huge asset for tourism also and I understand where fishermen come from but there is no point in it not being developed as a whole.  For example, Norway developed the two industries side by side and one supports the other.  They work together and it is a huge success in that way.<br />I grew up in Donegal, although my accent is English.  My parents came over from England when I was aged four.  I grew up in the Gaeltacht.  I was fluent in Irish but, unfortunately, I have lost most of it.  Perhaps that is why my accent did not disappear.  A Fr. McDyer attracted my father to the area and he then got into fishing, which we had no background in whatsoever.  Dad was very much involved at the time in a push for an exclusive 50 mile limit, which we came close to achieving.  However, members will be aware of the deals that were done between farming and fishing, which have been a disaster since.  I ended up skippering a 60 ft boat, which I stopped doing in 2004.   I started an angling business in 2005.  Most of our business is done with anglers from Germany and Holland.  I very much know how angling businesses are developed in our main competitors, Norway and Iceland.  I have a brother who is still involved in commercial fishing and, therefore, I also have a fair idea of what is happening there.<br />We are here to discuss the committee's report on promoting a sustainable rural Ireland and coastal communities.  I e-mailed a submission last week.  It is not a reaction but I wrote it because I am the main person in our group who is involved in angling tourism and fisheries.  We discussed the submission and it was decided to leave as it was.  I understand it is probably too radical to be brought in, but the idea that a few big boats in Ireland can control fisheries will always be detrimental to the development of a sustainable 12 mile fishery for many reasons.  Many of the report's recommendations would be of immediate assistance to our area.  Much of it makes great sense, particularly recommendation No. 2.  We are an island nation surrounded by our greatest asset, the sea, but we have no Ministry for it and that is crazy.  I was asked when I arrived whether I was here to see the committee on agriculture, which may be a reflection on where we are.  Recommendation No. 2, therefore, would be a good start in the implementation of what is a good report.<br />With regard to recommendation No. 22, I have experience through our local development association and our local pier of how, even with money in place, it can be next to impossible to develop local piers.  It is crazy the way it has gone.  If the committee wants, I can go into our experience in this regard shortly.<br />I refer to the potential of angling.  I have an agent in Germany who sells our angling holidays.  Two years ago, 230,000 Germans went sea angling in Norway while 12,000 visited Ireland whereas 15 years ago more German sea anglers visited Ireland than Norway.  That demonstrates how much we have slipped.  Part of that is having a product to sell, and part of it is perception while it is also cyclical.  Hopefully, it will come back.  However, Iceland is a new market for angling and it has grown bigger than Ireland in five years because it has a product that is strong, rich and well managed close to the shore, which is what angling is all about.<br />There is a recommendation about developing of a dual licence where fishing boats can engage in both angling and fishing.  It is a good idea on the one hand but, on the other, wearing my charter skipper's heart - I am a member of the Irish Charter Skipper's Association as well - if the committee wants charter skippers to develop a good product, which is what this is all about and invest money in boats, which are expensive while other people can hop in and hop of the market, that will distort the market and be detrimental to developing a good, professional charter skipper product in Ireland.</p></speech>

The witnesses are here to learn about the current situation with regard to the report and perhaps to look at alterations to the length of vessels, for example.  It is crystal clear that unless an island population has an income stream the population will tend to leave the island because it is impossible to live on fresh air.  This has been the pattern in small islands all over the world.  Social welfare payments are available but islanders by their tradition and by their nature do not depend on social welfare payments; they want to be grafting and working. </p><p>In 2006 the ban on salmon fishing removed a traditional source of income for Arranmore island and other islands down the west coast from Tory to Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire.  According to Comhar na nOile&aacute;n figures, in the case of Arranmore island an income stream of between &euro;800,000 and &euro;1 million per annum was wiped away overnight.  The option of a soft landing by way of grant aid was available but it was never really an option for the serious fishermen because they had an obligation to their island, to their community and to their families, to continue developing the way of life and to continue to explore options and possibilities for re-opening salmon fishing.</p><p> I commend the Donegal islands survival plan and the work of the organisation over the past ten years.  They have been swimming against the tide very often and it was difficult but they persevered.  Oireachtas Members have an obligation to support the organisation in finding a mechanism, in conjunction with the European Commission.</p><p> This report remains to be debated in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad.  There is a need for action and commitments from the Ministers responsible.  I agree with Mr. Aston's point which is on the mark.  Unfortunately, many of the issues pertaining to the fishing industry and the marine way of life fall between two Departments.  I experience this every week that representations to one Department are directed to the other Department; one Department will say it is the responsibility of the other Department.  We have recommended the need for a Minister at Cabinet level to have ultimate responsibility for marine tourism and all of the associated links.  It will not happen until there is a change of government but it is essential.</p><p> It has been recommended that the issuing of heritage licences could be used as a means of re-opening drift net fishing on a controlled basis.  These licences would only be available to people who could prove that they and their families had been fishing salmon down through the generations.  The angling fraternity makes the point that open drift net fishing will have a negative impact on the rivers and maybe there is some truth in that.  However, seals are causing the destruction of our salmon stocks in every bay throughout the country and pollution in the rivers is doing the same.</p><p> The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, has outlined that the habitats directive does not permit seal culling but it is carried out in other countries such as in Canada when salmon stocks are being endangered.  We need to persuade the European Commission to exercise some flexibility in this regard.  Mr. John O'Brien may have a view on whether it may also be necessary to work with the angling community in order to address some of its concerns.  Does the issue of a polyvalent licence for fishing for bait an issue need to be addressed?</p><p> Mr. John O'Brien hit the nail on the head with regard to the issue of crab and lobster fishing.  Mr. Jerry Early outlined the price of &euro;10.50 a kilo for the best of lobster.  This is crazy in my view.  Lobster and crab are being over-fished.  There is no alternative resource available to the fishermen and the Government policy is actually detrimental to the future stock of crab and lobster.  Unless something is changed by way of a heritage licence then that situation will continue.</p><p> I agree with Mr. John O'Brien on the mackerel quota.  Unfortunately Ireland's mackerel quota is distributed at the discretion of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Very often it goes to the golden 22 and the smaller vessels along the coast do not get their fair share.  There should be a percentage of the mackerel licence - at least 20% or 15% - held for smaller vessels.  I refer to the 2,162 vessels registered with the Department, 75% of which are under 10 m and almost 90% are under 15 m, yet they are given virtually nothing of a mackerel fishing opportunity.  This is not right.  While the KFO is to be applauded for doing a great job in lobbying for the larger vessels, the mackerel catch is not all landed in Ireland.  We are not gaining out of every tonne that is caught by those vessels whereas the smaller Irish vessels would all land their catches in Ireland and there would be more of a benefit.  This issue needs to be discussed with the Minister.</p><p> I refer to the Common Fisheries Policy proposal to provide a grant to fishermen as is the case with the CAP where farmers who are aged under 40 are entitled to a 25% increase in the single farm payment.  However, it seems ludicrous that the CFP is restricting it to vessels at least three years old whereas young farmers under 40 are not placed under the same restrictions.  That is an argument that could be raised.  If fishermen can buy new fishing boats then these will be safer, better and more modern and fishermen will be able to fish better.</p><p> We should not allow a situation where in 15 or 20 years' some of us might be here discussing the future viability of island communities and saying we should have opened the salmon fishing on a pilot basis 15 years previously.  We should not allow ourselves to get to the situation.  We need to follow up on the recommendations.  I suggest we invite the relevant Ministers to come before the committee to go through each of the recommendations individually.</p><p> The issue of marine tourism has been raised.  Marine tourism is vital but it has to be holistic and inclusive of everyone.  In my own county, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the tourism operators and Donegal County Council promoted angling tourism but this promotion excluded the island communities and what they can offer.  Any marine product has to include everyone so that everyone gets a slice of the cake.  This must include our islands which are a key national resource.  I agree with much of what Mr. Aston said about promoting marine and coastal tourism because it has huge potential.  According to the report, every local authority in the country needs to carry out an audit of the facilities available for leisure craft or commercial fishing craft so that a new Minister for the marine will be able to provide the funding needed to implement a plan.</p><p> Plans for the development of marine tourism down through the years have focused on isolated parts of the country and not on all of the areas around the coast.  That is why it is important to have a bottom-up approach and  why the cumann na tuaithe model through Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann or Comhar na nOile&aacute;n would be hugely important in identifying what is required and in trying to promote tourism and to keep a way of life alive as well.</p> <p>There would be no point in tourists visiting Arranmore or Tory Island if there were no locals living on the islands, as is the case with Inishbofin in County Donegal.  We need to strike a balance because tourists who visit islands would like to see that the traditional way of life is alive and well and people are surviving on the islands.  I believe we can achieve such a balance, especially in terms of providing people with an income.  The State has an obligation to revisit this issue and the sub-committee will certainly pursue it to our best ability.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I must leave to attend proceedings in the Seanad in a moment.</p><p>  The witnesses made a number of important points which the sub-committee should consider pursuing.  Mr. Early referred to an amendment providing for special recognition for islands in the Common Fisheries Policy and asked how this could be made to work.  Perhaps the sub-committee will ask departmental officials or those involved in drafting the amendment at European Union level what are the implications of such recognition and how we can make it work best for Ireland.  From what I have heard, the witnesses are knocking at an open door in this sub-committee whose members have echoed most of what they have said, especially with regard to the length of boats.  The sub-committee will revisit this issue based on the evidence provided today.  It is important that we examine this issue.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien stated there are no inshore boats that are less than 30 years old.  Perhaps the sub-committee should seek to obtain some data on that issue.  While figures may have been furnished to us, it may be worthwhile to revisit the issue on foot of statistics becoming available on the age of boats.  </p><p>  Mr. O'Brien also raised the important issue of the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the IDA in supporting fisherman.  The former was able to provide a certain amount of grant aid in the past but this was discontinued, probably for legal or policy reasons.  It may not do any harm to ask &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the IDA to clarify whether they are in a position to give support to the fishing industry and, if so, how they would be able to do so.  Perhaps these organisations must now defer to Bord Iascaigh Mhara in respect of this type of work.  I am aware that they were able to provide some support in the past. </p><p>  On the manner in which the fishing quota is divided, this issue did not arise today or yesterday as it has been around for a long time.  The quota comes within the remit of the Government and must be addressed if we are serious about keeping rural and coastal communities vibrant.  I apologise again as I must leave to attend the Seanad.</p></speech>

One of the sub-committee's recommendations, which I wholly support, is to make it slightly easier for local authorities to secure funding for the design element of planning for piers.  Central funding is already provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the bricks and mortar to construct piers.</p><p>  I am interested in the figures Mr. Aston provided on sea angling.  Does he have any figures on the development of sea angling on Loop Head?  More important, does he have proposals for developing this activity?  The tourism agencies informed the sub-committee that they had identified sea angling as one of the markets they would like to develop.  Mr. Aston appeared to indicate that Ireland's sea angling product is falling behind countries such as Iceland and Norway.  What practical steps should be taken to correct this?  How could we make it easier for groups such as the Loop Head Tourism Group to promote sea angling and attract tourists to their respective areas?  Piers are one issue. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32014050600008#G00800"><p>I propose to focus on the process, the boring element of this discussion.  C&eacute;n chaoi a dtiocfaimid &oacute;n &aacute;it ina bhfuilimid go dt&iacute; an &aacute;it ar mhaith linn a bheith?  Is b&oacute;thar fada at&aacute; i gceist.  Caithfimid tabhairt faoi gan dul ar strae ar an mbealach.  It is very easy to have a long process.  I compliment the Chairman on bringing us to the point at which we have produced this report.  This was a straightforward matter, however, in the sense that we knew from the outset what we wanted to achieve.  Fair play to the islanders in County Donegal who came here and put an argument to us.  It was strongly believed by mo chara in aice liom, an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill, that we should hear what the islanders had to say.  We subsequently decided to widen the discussion on the basis that all coastal communities need special attention.  Under the direction of the Chairman, the sub-committee has produced a report which makes 29 recommendations.</p><p>  I understand the witnesses would like us to make one minor amendment to increase the threshold for boats from 10 m.  The reference to 10 m vessels in the report is indicative.  I hope the representatives of coastal communities will agree that this report is fair and provides a good shopping list which, if delivered to a significant degree, would be a major step in the right direction.  It sets out a good agenda on which to work.  For this reason, we should not introduce all sorts of new issues until we have doggedly pursued what the proposals the sub-committee developed through this process.  As I noted, minor amendments can be made because they do not require us to depart from the concept.  We must focus, however, on trying to advance all 29 recommendations. </p><p>  Mr. Aston painted a very interesting overall picture, one which reflected the position of the sub-committee and fitted all the pieces of the jigsaw together.  We want to create an industry whereby the benefits of the seas around the coast rebound significantly to the advantage of local communities, rather than the large operators which are not area specific.  The large operators may operate out of one port and deliver their catch into another port 500 miles away.  The report focuses on fishermen who fish from and land their catch at the same port.  </p><p>  Recommendation 14 proposes that only boats of a certain size would be allowed to fish within a certain distance from the shore.  It does not matter what size of boat is specified, whether 10 m, 12 m or 15 m, or what distance from shore is agreed, whether 12 miles or 14 miles.  In that context, it was not very European to use miles rather than kilometres.  No European country will cede their right to fish in certain waters, whereas every small maritime community in Europe has an interest in having exclusive access to its maritime waters.  If one made a case in Europe for excluding all French and Spanish boats from one's waters, it would be rejected.  However, if one were to make a case to French fishermen operating small boats along the French coast that they should have exclusive access to their coastal waters for a distance of 12 miles, they would agree, as would Italian and Portuguese fishermen and so forth.  We must develop proposals that fit into the European jigsaw because other proposals that may be more attractive from a chauvinistic point of view would never see the light of day. </p><p>  The second issue emphasised in the report is salmon.  The first requirement is to obtain information.  It is amazing that despite the various bans on salmon fishing, there is not a counter in place on every river.  Being able to produce boring detail of this nature will get us somewhere.  If we could show that the number of salmon in our rivers is increasing, we would be in a better position.  It was a lack of information that killed us previously.</p><p>  I hope all the groups that appeared before the subcommittee and others will propose amendments to tidy up the report before we move on to the next phase.  The amendment proposed today relates to the size of boats.</p> <p>We could then all agree to pursue this through official channels to try to get it implemented.  We should pick off each recommendation one by one and ask if it will be implemented.  My experience is that some will be accepted, some will be rejected and some will be amended.  However, the ones that are accepted can be ticked off once they are done.  For the ones that are amended, the witnesses will need to see if they can live with the amendment and can then tick those when they are done.  They then need to fight on the other ones to try to get a change of mind.  Of course the more that are done, the more it is possible to focus on the remainder.  We need to be very dogged and systematic and not be deflected regardless of how long it takes.  If it takes five years to get somewhere, we should think that if we had started this ten years ago, it would have been all over five years ago.  We have to start somewhere and it is always a slow route through bureaucracy so the witnesses need to have a clear policy set out.</p><p> There is a reference to Comhairle na Tuaithe.  As the witnesses know, Comhairle na Tuaithe brings the statutory agencies, including the Departments, around the table.  If the Departments are not at the table, there is no point in talking because so much rests on them.  On the hill walking, there is Coillte Teoranta and all the relevant statutory agencies.  In addition, there are farming organisations, Mountaineering Ireland, Keep Ireland Open and so on.  All the players are around the table advising the Ministers and much of the time coming to common positions.  We did extraordinarily well to come to common positions on all sorts of things where we could all move forward together.  I believe if there was a permanent representative group, involving Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann and the small fishermen groups, it would give the witnesses a place at the table on a consistent basis every three or six months.  They could go back and sit around the table and this would be on their agenda.</p><p> I agree with the recommendation that responsibility for the marine should be in one place, but that is not the case for the moment.  This means that representatives of the relevant Departments need to come around the table in order to try to get them to move forward on the agenda.  In the committee's work directly with the various Departments and agencies, it is vital to try to push the same agenda in parallel with the organisations represented here today.</p><p> There is one recommendation that is totally within the hands of the community organisations represented here today.  It is recommendation No. 20, which states that while recognising there are a large number of representative fishing organisations based on geographical area, LOA, and fishing time, all fishing organisations should consider restructuring which would lead to the formation of an inshore fishing organisation to provide a unified voice.  The absence of a confederation of local fishing organisations operating on a national basis is very detrimental to their interests.  Despite differences in different areas, and there are the usual local loyalties and so on, when it comes to impacting on us as a committee and on the Departments, unless some consensus can be built between lobster fishermen in Connemara, Kerry and Donegal, and people interested in salmon in different counties, the witnesses are at a massive disadvantage compared with the industries that have a national voice.  That is not something we can do.  Only the people themselves can do that.</p><p> Ms Majella N&iacute; Chr&iacute;och&aacute;in knows that when representatives of the various islands around the coast came together 30 years ago to form Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, they dramatically changed the status of the island lobby for 3,000 people.  As a Minister, I found it greatly beneficial that representatives of Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands came together.  Going back to that time, there was not a ferry to any non-Gaeltacht islands.  In the beginning I believe some people in the non-Gaeltacht islands thought they would be totally subsumed because the Gaeltacht was much stronger.  In fact, it worked greatly to the benefit of the non-Gaeltacht islands and brought them up.  Therefore, I believe recommendation No. 20 falls back on the witnesses.</p><p> In my experience it is very difficult to communicate when it is necessary to communicate with 20 different disparate groups which might not agree all of the time and they have no mechanisms to come to agreement.  That is one part that falls to the witnesses and not to us.  We have made the recommendation.  Europe and the State are organised on the basis of representative groups.  Let us think about it - Europe in particular and national representative groups.  If we are considering going down the route of a comhairle na mara, unless that is in place the witnesses will not have the impact they should have and they will not see all this happen.  If that was put in place they would see a real force for making this happen.  I hope that such an organisation could have a full-time office and people who could pursue this as only full-time staff can do.  It is very hard for purely voluntary people to do.</p><p> M&aacute; chuireann t&uacute; ceist ar Ms Majella N&iacute; Chr&iacute;och&aacute;in, m&iacute;neoidh s&iacute; c&eacute; chomh tairbheach is a bh&iacute; s&eacute; do na hoile&aacute;in.

Many of the things he said reflect where we are going.  My main response is to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point on how representatives of the islands must come together.  This is our third time in this forum.  When I first came here, I came as an islander and was very intimidated by what I was about to face.  I was very intimidated by the people to whom I was to make my presentation.  However, I quickly realised that I should not be intimidated because I knew more about the needs of the islands than the people I was addressing.  When we started this campaign seven years ago a wise man told us that we were wasting our time.  I do not believe we wasted our time.</p><p>  However, on the back of what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about representatives of the islands coming together, since the report was launched on Inis&iacute;r, the representatives of the Donegal islands - mainly two, even though we were joined by people from Tory slightly - came together as a group and formed the Donegal Island Marine Resource Organisation, DIMRO, which incorporated all the islands, which is up to eight islands, off the Donegal coast.  We have moved away from focusing just on Donegal islands to focusing on marine resources, which is the key point, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has just mentioned so eloquently.  It is a resource that is our resource.  I know the Deputy said we could not go to Europe - to France, Germany or Spain - and ask for something back because it would not happen.</p> <p>The salmon was not taken from us by the French, the German or the Spanish but by our own people.  They can give it back to us.</p><p> Since DIMRO was established we have been getting the islands to come together and form one large group, exactly as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v proposed.  We cannot speak for the coastal organisations.  We have been active on the ground.  We have been here for seven years so if the seeds sown by this report come to fruition in another five I and everyone here can walk away leaving a legacy.</p><p> I congratulate the Chairman.  He has been very fair and thorough and many good things can happen with his guidance.  We are well aware this is a process and we are prepared to stay with it however long it takes.  Each day, month and year we lose people from the islands which needs to be examined urgently, sooner rather than later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Luke Aston" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32014050600010#J00200"><p>The answer to Deputy McNamara's question is probably the answer to many of the questions from the fishing lobby, namely, product.  It does not matter what one does or how one dresses it up, if one does not have what one says one is going to sell one cannot sell it.  The first way to improve angling tourism is to sort out the fisheries.  There is no point saying it is two different things.  There are many little things one can do.  One can bring the tourism people and do everything else about it but unless there is the product and the perception of product, Ireland will never improve its share of the angling market, which is a huge market.</p><p>  I have lots of ideas.  If one takes the product, the salmon was banned because of illegal fishing of salmon, and the perception of illegal fishing which made it easy for the angling lobby to use that against the fishermen.  This is the best country in the world for making fantastic rules and not enforcing them.  If there are new rules about the size of boats going into the 12 mile limit, the way of fishing and so on but the attitude on the ground is &ldquo;ah but sure, it&rsquo;ll be grand&rdquo; that has to be tackled.  We need to get a product, put a system in place and enforce it.</p><p>  Fisheries and angling are covered by a lot of legislation for passenger licences and fisheries enforcement, the type of fishing and passenger boat one is allowed to use, and every one has a different agency, the coast guard, the navy, the fisheries committee and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  Why not have a coast guard and fishery protection agency?  We are all told we have to save money.  It would be simple to do this.  There could be one agency with good-sized boats.  The navy has just bought two fine new vessels.  I do not what it costs to crew and run them.  In Alaska there is one protection vessel with the fishermen and those involved in angling all on side.  That is an obvious example.  If we have two or three boats that can stay at sea for a reasonable length of time with a few people who know what they are doing to enforce it and have smaller boats inshore.  They will inspect the angling boats and the fisheries.  In west Clare, in the Loop Head area the salmon fishing was limited to four days and the type of gear one was allowed and it worked.  That was a perfect situation.  Had it been recognised as working there would never have been a lobby strong enough to get rid of that salmon fishery.</p><p>  My business is angling.  There is a P5 licence to go outside 3 miles from the land.  I get a boat built to that standard, and jump through a lot of hoops to get the licence and I know several other operators who do exactly the same but a fellow can get any old bit of paper, or no paper and go out and there is nobody to stop him doing it.  There are no inspections at sea.  The person who jumps through the hoops is crucified with costs.  If the committee wants to help develop angling the first thing to do is develop the product.  That cannot be developed individually but must be part of an overall scheme on the 12 mile limit.</p><p>  The tourism people will talk about lots of other little things, marketing and access.  Only now are we starting to see flights return to the west coast.  Up to five or six years ago there were full flights from Holland to Shannon, with a lot of fishermen.  They have stopped coming.  We think that if people want to come from Germany or Holland it is easy for them to drive for three hours down a fine road from Dublin to the west of Ireland.  When one talks to them about it, however, one discovers that they are all, for some reason, used to driving much shorter distances than we are willing to drive.  We have to be able to get them from their location to where the product is quickly and easily.  In Norway and Iceland there is no limit on weight for fishermen.  Little things like that could be done. </p><p>  Another area of huge potential in Ireland is catch-and-release tuna fishing in Donegal Bay.  It is ridiculous that we are not allowed to market it or, in theory, to do it, even though we would be catching and releasing fish because apparently in Ireland there is no quota to land tuna.  It would not be landed.  There must be joined-up thinking on product development and what we can do.</p><p>  At any of the main angling shows I have been to in Holland or Germany every council area in Norway had a stand.  They all have lots of CDs with sexy-looking fishing on them.  I had no interest in angling until I started to do it out of necessity.  I very much enjoy it now.  Wherever I go in the world I always try to get in a day or two of fishing.  I can honestly say there is nowhere like Ireland for fishing.  There are 30 or 40 species.  I have caught everything from shark weighing over 1,000 lb to tiny culver fish.  The Norwegians have cod, haddock, a few plaice and cold fish and can build an industry in which 250,000 people spend &euro;1,000 each.  We have a fantastic resource but we are not able to market it.  The tourism people tell us people do not go anywhere for fishing.  There are 250,000 people from Germany who go sea-fishing in Norway.  There are lots of other types of fishing.  There are 1 million active anglers in Holland, and the same in Italy and France.  America has not been touched.  The Chinese love shark fishing.  I have taken them out.  They are incredible.  That has not been touched yet the marketing people will tell us nobody comes to Ireland to go fishing.  A basic start would be the recognition that angling produce is a huge market that has to marketed.  The product must be there and protected and the facilities, the boats and infrastructure on the piers and so on, must be in place.  That is a holistic answer to the question.</p> <p>All of that must be done and the answer to the question is holistic, as there is not just one element.  There is much potential.</p></speech>

Anybody else on the sub-committee will be invited to attend on 27 May when, if everything goes to plan, the Minister will be here.  That is as opposed to waiting for the report to be discussed on the floor of the House, as that is a lottery because many reports are produced by all the committees.  I am mindful that the Minister is organising a seminar on harnessing our ocean wealth on 18 June in Dublin Castle, and I hope that will have all the industry players present.  It is a starting point.</p><p>  Some key actions must be taken to continue the momentum, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has highlighted a potential framework for progress.  We should start with the recognition of the need for a forum, which could be comhairle na mara, and we could consider the issues of the Fisheries Local Action Groups, FLAGs, and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, for example.  As Mr. O'Brien indicated, there is probably an anomaly in the rules in getting new vessels running and newly trained fishermen back in business.  There is also the matter of the establishment of a national inshore fishing organisation, of which the islands would be a component.  We specifically discussed anybody inside the 12-mile limit and the 80% of people forming the ownership and control of the fishing fleet.  There would be a sectoral approach but the islands form part of the approach.  The amendment would provide recognition and give a good basis for the likes of a comhairle na mara, allowing vehicles for funding such as the FLAGs, the EMFF or others.  There would also have to be consideration of the rules guidelines.  The committee provided recommendations regarding heritage and pilot licences, as well as drift netting, where data has established that stocks are being replenished.  These are specific recommendations, including the limiting of fishing within the 12-mile limit to boats of 12 m or less.</p><p>  We have the bones of working recommendations which somebody should pick up and drive on.  We have proposed the recommendation of a structure to allow that happen.  The committee can facilitate but it needs a specific driver.  Comhairle na Tuaithe used the likes of the Leader money to pool others to access funding and drive to a roadmap for national trails and walkways, leading to tangible outputs.  In spite of what one might read at times, that has been quite positive.  People have established and maintained paths while getting paid to do so; these people are not paid for doing nothing.  There is harmony in that respect.</p><p>  Until the Minister comes before us, we can do little else.  We will emphasise many of the points raised today and we will take on board some of the suggested tweaks from initial observations of the report.  It is the key working document for where we go from here.  As somebody not directly involved, I can still see there is a need for anglers, islanders and everybody else - particularly those involved with drift netting and anglers - to sit down together and understand the issues.  There were times when they were felt as incompatible but it can be demonstrated that there is compatibility, which will lead to a more swift progression.</p><p>  That is a reasonable summary of what I consider to be the issues.  I was very pleased to be in a position to chair the sub-committee, although I admit I had the least expertise.  The sub-committee came together and worked productively to publish a report.  It is not intended for it to gather dust, and that is the reason we are having today's meeting and trying to drive the matter in a timeframe.  We hope that at the harnessing of our ocean wealth seminar, which is to be an annual event, there will be recognition of this sector.  After all, it concerns 80% of the fishing fleet.  It has the ability to address much aspiration, even in the amendment to the Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for coming to today's meeting.  Unfortunately, some members had to leave, although they were anxious to be here.  Deputy Ferris could not be here and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Deputy Harrington had to leave.  They take the report seriously.</p></speech>

I have used it extensively when making presentations to small business groups and accountants and so on.  It might be helpful for members to see on one page how we assess appeals to the Credit Review Office.  I will highlight a couple of columns in the document because it might be helpful for members to see how a banker thinks at times.  The gearing column shows the bank versus other stakes in transactions.</p> <p>If someone asks a bank for 100% finance, the likelihood is that they will not get it because the bank would be taking all the risk.  If a bank lent me &euro;1 million this evening, I would sleep a lot easier than it could.  Banks now typically look for a 30% stake from someone else other than themselves being put towards the transaction.  Sometimes when SMEs approach the Credit Review Office, this level of funding by the business is not enough.</p><p> Very few loans of any substance will be made without security.  Banks have returned to being cash flow lenders but I would add the caveat that it is cash flow with security so there must be some element of fallback.  In the left-hand column, we can see the capital account and reserves of many businesses that come to the Credit Review Office are very small.</p></speech>

I will return to it and go on with my 13th report which was issued several months ago.</p><p>  The reasons for appeal requests for credit are now for working capital increases and for business investment.  In the initial years of the office, the main reason was about survival.  It is a positive note that the shift has moved from survival to investment.</p><p>  We are seeing some demand for re-financing debts held by foreign banks which are exiting the Irish lending market.  This is a cause for increasing concern as the supply side is becoming super-concentrated and we are down to the two pillar banks, Ulster Bank and PTSB for re-financing.  Danske Bank is getting out of Ireland rapidly.  Some of the appeals coming to our office are from Danske customers who are having great difficulty in getting finance from the other banks.  This issue will become more significant in 2014 and into 2015.</p><p>  Ireland has many family-controlled smaller businesses which does not lend itself to equity finance.  The reliance on our banks will, therefore, remain high.  We are trying to see what else can be done to increase the supply side for businesses.  There are some new entrants appearing on the horizon but they are so small that they will not be game changers.  New entrants in debtor finance could be very valuable to some small businesses which try to grow off their current capital positions.</p><p>  The main banks probably have enough new safe business to achieve their business objectives without having to extend themselves with higher risk business.  This, again, is a cause for some concern.</p><p>  A recent Small Firms Association survey showed 40% of its members lacked confidence in approaching a bank for finance.  There are several initiatives to increase the capabilities of smaller businesses to interact with their banks.  Skillnets runs a regional programme on building financial capacity in small businesses.  Attendance by the SME sector has been disappointing, however.  I encourage small businesses to take these courses up as the skills on offer are required.  The Department of Finance and others have been working on a business database.  There are several State supports from the different Departments.  Trying to find out how to access them has been very difficult for a small business, however.  It will all be brought together in a simple interface whereby a business can enter its size, location and activity which will then bring up all available supports.</p><p>  The office had a monitoring role of the pillar banks&rsquo; lending targets until last year.  There has been some debate about the targets being removed.  The diligence by which we are watching performance has not been removed, however.  We now have four years of monthly trend performances collated.  Accordingly, we have a fair idea of what to expect and when.  I am pleased to report that in this year's first quarter, they had their best first quarter loan-sanctioning performance of all five years of monitoring.  Given the three months that has transpired, both banks are in line to achieve or exceed last year&rsquo;s performance in sanctioning lending.  This may be helped by some of the re-financing they are doing from other banks.</p><p>  We also continue to see a substantial amount of old loans with the banks being paid off.  While they are sanctioning a lot of new money in the market, there is still a fair tide of old money being repaid from old loans.  This is making the growth in their balance sheet sluggish.</p><p>  Individual formal meetings take place each quarter between the pillar banks and the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office.</p><p>  I will return to the diagram I was discussing earlier as it seems to have been circulated to members.  This is a one-page model that we have been using with trade bodies and accountancy practices in professional development seminars.  Looking further down the sheet, members will note there are also other sources of finance such as government and non-government sources which can sometimes help finance a deal and make the gearing more attractive.</p> <p>There is a view there is too much reliance on bank funding in Ireland and that other countries manage to finance their businesses with much less bank intervention.  We have a predominance of very small businesses in the SME sector, many are family-owned and do not want to give up any equity control to someone else.  This is a challenge, but if we can find a way to get non-bank finance for the amount which SMEs demand it would be helpful.</p><p> Many businesses which come to the Credit Review Office have negative capital because their reserves and capital are gone either through losses incurred in the past four to five years or property plays which went wrong.  This does not mean the businesses are irrecoverable but they will have to be nursed back to health and this is a challenge as a number of banks have withdrawn and the businesses now rely on a small number of banks for finance.</p><p> With regard to going concern part of the graph we examine the balance sheet to test the quality of all of its parts as well as the profit and loss accounts of the businesses and its trading performance.  We do this to establish the amount of free cash available after the profit and loss accounts have been considered to finance the repayments on the new loan being requested.  If we can see enough free cash to service the loan we will ask the bank to make the loan.  The key question is whether the bank or any other investor will lose money on the loan in the foreseeable future.  It might not meet bank policy, but if we can see the loan is reasonably safe and cash can reasonably be expected to flow we will encourage the bank to make the loan.  I apologise if I was disjointed but I hope I have given the committee a feel for the issue.</p></speech>

Four years on there still seems to be a lack of awareness of the office.  Does Mr. Trethowen have any thoughts on this?  Does Mr. Trethowen receive support for his office from the banks?  Is he sure when they decline a loan they pass on information about the office or is Mr. Trethowen picking up, as many of us are, that they are not so much declining loans as putting so many hurdles in the way of drawing down a loan that the customer may not do so?  These delays between sanctioning a loan and drawing it down are not considered a refusal.</p></speech>

We advertise extensively on the radio and in the media to ensure there is awareness.  Knowledge of the Credit Review Office was at 67% in the most recent Department of Finance half yearly survey.  Having stated this, it had reduced by 6% from the previous six months.  The survey also found 64% of SMEs responded they were not made aware of the Credit Review Office by the banks, so we still have work to do to get the message through to SMEs that we are here and about what we do.  The banks also have more work to do to ensure when they decline an application that the Credit Review Office is prominent.  Recently we became aware that on the first refusal one of the banks advises customers of the microfinance scheme but not the Credit Review Office and we have sought a meeting to try to address this.</p></speech>

In the good times cash was plentiful, loans were easily got and the reserves of some good businesses were put into buy to let properties and extra borrowing was taken to buy more.  We ask companies with a guarantee or single sole traders for a statement of assets from the promoter of the business.  During the office's first years we routinely saw a portfolio of buy to let properties whose values were under water as against what they were bought for and which had lending against them whereby the repayments were more than the rental income.  Instead of having liquid reserves which could be brought into the business when needed these reserves were stuck in fixed assets which had declined in value and were sucking cash out of the business.</p><p>  The second scenario, for which I have much more sympathy, is that prior to 2008 many businesses were growing strongly and required new premises or showrooms and they invested to meet the demands of the market at the time.  After 2008, when domestic demand collapsed and Government spending decreased, they found the value of the loan was the same but the property had halved in value and their turnover was down and so they found themselves in difficulty.  We still find this today with quite a few businesses which are trying to recover from this hit on their capital.  This is exacerbated by the banks which are exiting because they crystallise the situation in asking for refinance.  They are getting some write-downs but the proprietor must try to find a bank to take on the business.  We are finding it extremely difficult to get some of these businesses refinanced.</p></speech>

How will we keep them honest?  It is my view they played ducks and drakes with the targets and what they constituted as new lending was really relending and refinancing.  We have no idea of the targets.  How will Mr. Trethowen convince us and the business community that the banks are actually lending?  He states they are lending-----</p></speech>

We did not have a feel for the sanctioning activity of the banks.  We have had monthly activity reports for the past four years and we know when to expect lending to happen, which is generally quarter four.  The monthly figures we receive are put on charts and compared to the previous years and we have a feel for where we will end up this year.  If we felt it was going backwards we would meet the banks immediately.  The targets served a purpose when we did not know what was happening next but now we have a good feel for what to expect.  I believe the targets became superfluous.  With regard to ducks and drakes, in 2010 and probably 2011 some of the activity was in refinancing, but it was still viable as if the refinancing had not taken place many enterprises would have gone out of business.</p> <p>A lot of businesses were put out of business at that time.  Over the last couple of years the Central Bank has been asking the banks to tidy up their legacy book.  That is an exercise which has been gone through and has been reported to the committee.  It is now either new lending or it could be refinancing as well but because refinancing is so important to so many businesses I think it is valid to have it included there as well.</p></speech>

One area that could be helpful, but it does carry a bit of a historical stigma, is the old debtor financing or factoring.  It comes under a lot of different names such as commercial finance, debtor finance or factoring but it is invoice discounting and what that does is it lends not against the strength of an SME but against the strength of the debtor.  That could be Tesco, Dunnes Stores or someone whom one could lend against more easily.  Debtor financing could be helpful for a business which might not qualify for bank financing.  It could be the answer for a growing business.  It is a bit more expensive but the access to cash or capital would be helpful for them.</p><p>  On non-bank funding, the NPRF funds are welcome.  The work the Department of Finance is doing in non-bank funding to try to access new sources of finance will be helpful as well.  The challenge is that given the size of the businesses which predominate in the SME market &ndash; we have 200,000 SMEs but 90% of them employ less than ten people.  The amounts they need to borrow are a lot less than equity finance would require so it is a matter of trying to find some method to salami slice the credit that becomes useful for that size of business as well.</p><p>  On the loan guarantee scheme, part of the team has been looking at reinvigorating the scheme.  We could see where it did not work from when we were trying to find solutions to specific SME problems.  We brought them to them to the attention of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and it has taken them on board.  Everyone is learning on all of these things and I hope the next phase will address much of what has been learnt from the first wave.</p><p>  The microfinance scheme is proving very helpful for start-ups and for some small businesses, even in terms of producing part of the stake.  If the banks are unhappy with the level of gearing and the stake, sometimes if Microfinance Ireland is involved with them it lets them make a loan as well.  The sum of &euro;25,000 might be too small an amount.  It might need to be increased to &euro;50,000.  In addition, the term of the loan could be looked at to lengthen it to make the repayments a bit easier for new businesses as well.  The longer the term the less the monthly repayments will be.</p></speech>

We hear a plethora of different views.  We hear from the representative organisations, people like Morgan Kelly, the banks and the Department among others.</p><p>  Given that it is the understanding of most people that the system is not functioning in a normal way and that other voices say it is still very difficult to get a loan, I am amazed that three to four years later the response to it is so small in term of the number of people accessing the credit reviewer&rsquo;s services and that of Microfinance Ireland.  It seems shocking that this is such a pivotal issue and yet the use of all of the solutions that have been provided is so minimal.</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan spoke about the level of refinancing that is happening, for example Danske Bank leaving and refinancing and some of those businesses not being able to get refinancing.  Do we know what the figures are, whether there is &euro;200 million worth of refinancing or &euro;1 billion?  We do not know the numbers of applicants who have not been successful.</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan referred to the increased concentration in the industry.  We are losing lending capacity.  Are there figures to indicate what lending capacity we are losing?  Is it 10%, 20% or 30% of the lending capacity in the State?</p></speech>

They encourage their members to come to us.  There may be a reluctance to come to us for fear of antagonising the bank.  Given a situation where the market is concentrating, if one loses one&rsquo;s relationship with one&rsquo;s current bank it might be difficult to find another one.  That is the only assumption I can make.  If I am made aware of any bank that has taken a view on a customer that because he or she has gone to the Credit Review Office that they will be penalised I would take it up with the Department of Finance to address it with the chief executives of the banks.  I do not have any evidence that is the case.

I am not aware of the exact amount of that but it could be found among Central Bank statistics.  I must add the caveat that I only see cases that come to us that have not been addressed by the banks.  There could be people who are going to the pillar banks or to Ulster Bank to be refinanced and because their business condition is okay they are having no problems with getting refinanced.  I only see the cases that have a challenge that come through to us and, of course, I do not see them all.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n had a third question.</p></speech>

Mr. Trethowan said he does not have a figure in that regard.  There is also the issue of the level of refinancing that is not happening.  In other words, those who have functional lending with let us say Danske Bank and the lending needs were not met by any other player so therefore their capacity to trade and to provide jobs is reduced.</p><p>  Another issue relates to the total capacity of lending within the market and the effects of that.</p></speech>

When we had AIB and Bank of Ireland before the committee, from what we could deduce from AIB, it was saying that it included the restructuring of loans in its target.  Bank of Ireland seemed to be way ahead.  It seemed to have had a 90% offer of restructures as opposed that of AIB, which is around 25%.</p></speech>

Since the Central Bank took an initiative to deal with the restructuring, we have been seen much less restructuring.  That is clear in the figures that are coming through to us at present.</p></speech>

Debt distress within SMEs is meant to be a sleeping giant in this regard.  It is keeping expenditure, growth and development down at the moment.  It is a potential threat into the future.  Does Mr. Trethowan have a perspective on that, based on the work he is doing?  The issue of banks engaging in filtering before they give a formal negative response to a loan query is of relevance in this respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Trethowan" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014050600007#F00300"><p>I certainly think some sort of pre-filtering must be going on.  The sanction percentages we are getting are very high.  I think the loans are being casually refused at the bank counters before they get into the system, or else some sort of pre-filtering is happening.  The level of sanction activity that is being reported to us is very high in percentage terms.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n also asked about the share of the market enjoyed by each of the banks that are left.  When I started out in 2010, I reckoned that the two pillar banks had approximately 60% of the market, Ulster Bank had between 10% and 15% of the market and the rest of the foreign banks had the rest of the market.  The concentration of the market is now much more intense.  The two pillar banks are probably carrying 80% of the market.</p></speech>

Has he seen any structured form of nursing to bring these businesses back to health?  Is it a case of whatever the individual business experiences?</p></speech>

That bank looks at the performing element of the business and sees what can be done to deal with the rest of the business over a period of time.  I am not sure whether Bank of Ireland has the same sort of formalised structure in this respect.  One would have to ask the bank.  AIB certainly has such a structure in place.</p></speech>

He mentioned earlier that there can be problems with cash flow, rather than working finance.  Is this not anticipated by the traders and the SMEs?  Is there a lack of professionalism in that area?  Are the reasons the banks give for their refusals logical?  Do they seem understandable?  The banks seemed to be far too lax in the past.  On the basis of what Mr. Trethowan has said, it now seems that they are far too strict.  Are the banks looking for guarantors?  Since we changed our television set-up at home recently, we have been getting the British advertisements rather than the Irish ones.  It is interesting that every second advertisement seems to be offering a loan.  It is easy to get a loan from one of these companies as long as one has a guarantor.  It strikes me as unusual to assume that someone who wants a loan will automatically have a guarantor to guarantee him or her.  Mr. Trethowan said "we will encourage the bank to make the loan".  What sort of encouragement does his office use?  Is it a case of the carrot or the big stick?  What does the office do?  How does it manage to encourage a bank to give a loan?</p></speech>

Senator Quinn asked an excellent question about cash flow.  The SME sector is a very broad church.  It includes microbusinesses, small companies and medium-sized businesses.  It can include quite large businesses at times.  In general, we get good cash flow information from SMEs that have finance directors.  At the level beneath that, which might involve a sole trader or a partnership of people who are trying to act as finance directors while running the business, it becomes much more problematic.  In the same way that accounts are normally produced for the tax man or for the purposes of a tax clearance certificate, some SMEs feel that cash flow forecasts are produced for banks in order to get loans.  They do not use them for information management purposes, or to make sure they know where their business is going.  That is part of the reason the Department of Finance is holding seminars throughout the country.  It is trying to increase the ability of those involved in SMEs to run their businesses as well as possible.  If one provides cash flow information without knowing where one's business will be in six or 12 months, how can the bank know where one's business will be?  It is entirely legitimate to request a business to run a cash flow analysis.</p><p>  The Senator asked why loan applications are declined.  I think that matter will have to be addressed.  The code of practice for SME lending is being reviewed.  I think the reasons for declines will have to be made much more explicit when banks sends letters to potential borrowers.  They claim they always phone people to tell them why their loan applications have been declined.  The letter the customer receives in writing is generally generic in nature and does not set out the specific reasons he or she was declined a loan.  In the cases of the appeals we see, we find out what issue the bank was having with the customer.  When we tell the customer this is why the bank did not sanction the loan, it is usually the first he or she has heard of it.  I think an improvement can be made in that regard if it is needed.</p><p>  The Senator also asked about guarantors.  It is made clear in the model I have provided that the banks will always look for some sort of security.  They like to see tangible security.  In the case of a limited company, the first thing the banks will do as a guarantee is try to tie in the personal liability of the promoter.  They will not just take any kind of guarantees from a third party.  I could provide a guarantee for &euro;1 million today, but I would not be good for it.  They are looking for some sort of tangible collateral that underpins the guarantee and will give them comfort if the loan goes bad.  Can the Senator remind me of his final question?</p></speech>

We have trying to transmit the message that this service is available.  We have been told that 55% of appeals are decided in favour of borrowers.  What reasons are given by the banks to explain their failure to allow these loans to progress naturally?  What can the committee learn from that?

We are bankers, so we know what a bank is looking for in an application.</p> <p>If it is not in the initial application and the bank has not asked for it, my reviewers would speak to a borrower on the phone or perhaps visit him or her.  If a farm is involved, they might have a look at the farm, etc., in order to get a feel for the issue.  Frequently, we find information that a bank would not have in an initial application, and that goes to the other aspect of what we do.  If at any time a bank indicates it did not know about an asset but would have approved a loan if it did, we would withdraw from the process at that stage.  Our objective is for the borrower to get credit and not for me to have a number on a sheet of paper.  Once the potential borrower gets the credit he or she needs, either through a formal application or informal means, we are happy.</p></speech>

When the office recommends that a bank reconsiders a case, does it give advice to an applicant to do a business plan again or include more information?  Is there an advisory role in this respect?  I have stated on previous occasions that the office may have a role even earlier in the process, before potential applicants seek a loan, to give advice on how to complete forms in the first place.  When the office makes a decision, what happens?  Does an application revert to the bank as it is or are changes made to the application before the bank makes a decision?</p><p>  Some of the bank representatives came before Oireachtas committees.  Some of them indicated that a number of reviewed or appealed cases which subsequently saw loans granted later saw the debtor defaulting on debts.  Does the office monitor such issues or does it have any idea of those figures?  Indications were given here which more or less gave the impression that a high percentage of appealed cases later saw defaults.  I believe it was approximately 20%.</p></speech>

We uphold approximately 45% of applications that come to us and in some cases there is a deficit we cannot repair, with a business gone too far into decline or a start-up with insufficient experience, for example.  Sometimes people have a great idea but there is no capital, and most small and medium enterprises would face a significant challenge in the first two years of existence, with half going down.  If we have somebody with a good idea but no experience, we would be very cautious.  It is not my job to get people to borrow money.</p><p>  Sometimes we deal with businesses which have not recognised that the last four years required management action to repair a business; turnover may be falling but these people may still have a BMW outside the premises.  If a business has consciously tried to address a challenging position, we will do everything we can to help it but we will not do so for those which are sleepwalking through the process.</p><p>  I am not sure we can get in front of the issue of advising an applicant as there are too many people out there.  The Government is doing work on this through seminars to raise the capability of small and medium enterprises in presenting a more cogent application to banks.  We would also look to the new local enterprise offices, LEOs, to help businesses improve applications to banks as well.  We come in after an initial application and we could improve it if it has merit but could have been better presented in the first place.</p></speech>

The fees for the Credit Review Office range from &euro;100 to &euro;250 and one may get consultancy worth more than &euro;1,000 from a reviewer on the way through.  When appeal cases are successful and subsequently go into arrears, we have done some research and our figures are lower than what has been quoted in this room.  I will use the figures used by one of the banks that a third of the appealed cases had gone into arrears subsequent to us asking for the money to be loaned.  To turn the figure around, that means two thirds of the appeals were good, and that is after they came through a bank's initial credit process, were declined, and went through an internal appeals process.  I dispute the figure of one third of cases going into arrears, but even if it is used, two thirds of the appeals that came to us should have been granted credit in the first place.</p></speech>

Each bank has a different culture and feel.  It would be typical for any organisation.</p><p>  I did not ask the Chairman's question about conditions that are applied.  The trade organisations are finding conditions are being placed on lending by some banks, which is making it difficult.  This concerns life assurance and guarantees which may not be expected.  It is an ongoing debate.  A person can appeal to the Credit Review Office if the feeling is that conditions amount to constructive refusal.</p></speech>

I work with him in Belfast in trying to bring some of the good practices from here to the North.  Having seen what is being done here, they think they could do more in Northern Ireland.  There has been a minimum amount of appeals in Northern Ireland, at 65 in two years.  There is a reluctance to appeal by small and medium enterprises which apparently extends across Ireland.  The UK reviewer does his job differently as he examines the banks' internal appeals rather than intervening directly with borrowers; we are much more hands-on with small and medium enterprises here.</p></speech>

It is worth reiterating some points the committee may have heard before, such as that 99% of all businesses in the State are small and medium enterprises, SMEs, so they play a crucial role in securing employment and the economic recovery.  There is no overestimating the scale of the challenges they face, and we have divided those into five, which are cost of employment; the ongoing local government charges burden; an ongoing decline in town and village centres, especially spreading from the west to the east; weak consumer confidence and poor domestic demand; and access to finance.  SMEs tend to operate in the domestic sector and have consequently been hit hardest by the downturn.  The committee is probably aware of the recent ESRI study which made the point that we are unequalled in the OECD, excluding Iceland, in the level of peak to trough decline in domestic demand, with a fall of 20% since the downturn began in 2007.</p><p>  We were asked to address sources of finance and the Central Bank distinguishes between bank credit flows and non-bank alternatives.  As the committee is probably aware, we contend that the main sources of finance are direct Government interventions; bank lending, which is the most crucial and largest contributor; and individual or group investors and other alternative sources of funding.  Each of these present specific challenges for SMEs.</p><p>  With regard to direct Government interventions, there is the microfinance fund and the partial credit guarantee scheme, which are worthwhile and welcome.  We campaigned for the partial loan guarantee scheme when it was initiated.  Our view has always been that this is about getting people to look up, look out and go down to the bank to fill in a formal application, with a proper set of accounts, and go about the process of securing bank lending.  That is the big game in town when it comes to financing.  The partial loan guarantee scheme, while worthwhile and beneficial, has seen a tenuous drawdown.  That is not necessarily a criticism but it concerns what we are discussing.</p><p>  Data from a recent survey carried out by our colleagues in Cork Chamber of Commerce indicate the number of businesses reporting difficulties in managing cashflow continued to rise throughout 2013.  That relates to a lack of working capital, which has had an impact.  As the downturn progressed, many Government schemes were initially about investment capital when the big challenge was working capital, as slow payments by everybody affected all business.  It was the big issue.  We are looking forward to the next Red C survey this month as the sense we are getting on the ground is that investment demand is up in a significant way despite being pretty sanguine in the past. We are looking forward to seeing what that means in future.</p><p>  The Cork survey also indicated that 68% of all businesses do not think there has been any major improvement in supports for businesses and SMEs over the past 12 months.   That should be of considerable concern for the Government, given the amount of rhetoric and effort put into new schemes.  There is an awareness issue, and I know Mr. Trethowan from the Credit Review Office was before the committee earlier.  It has had multiple advertising campaigns and we have profiled them but businesses are still not aware of this issue.</p> <p>That is a training challenge and we all have a role to play in that regard.</p><p> We recognise that the microfinance fund has been established.  However we note the statistics show that fewer than half of all applications are approved and the impact on job creation, while welcome, is limited.  Accordingly, we would recommend the expansion of the scheme to a broader range of businesses beyond Microfinance Ireland, MFI, just in terms of giving more options for businesses.  We have also made a number of recommendations regarding the loan guarantee or partial credit guarantee scheme.  They include increasing the level of guarantee, because at present the level of guarantee is quite low and is often not enough to get a credit application approved; increasing the number of financial products and sectors available for support from the scheme, because currently facilities such as overdrafts and restructures are excluded along with a number of sectors such as agriculture, and given that working capital is one of the core vital issues, we would see that it has a role to play in helping that area; removing the requirement to apply for a bank loan and have it rejected prior to availing of the scheme, which should not be strictly necessary in that if people want to avail of a scheme set up by taxpayers, they should be enabled to do so; and crucially, an increase in the term of the guarantee to at least five years, given that many business loans are for periods that are longer than three years, with five years being a typical period.  Accordingly, we believe the term length of the guarantee needs to match normal loan provision.</p><p> Bank lending remains one of the most problematic areas for SMEs.  Our view is that the successive surveys of Mazars and its successor, Red C, undertaken and commissioned by the Department of Finance with a significant number of participants - approximately 1,500 - are the most statistically accurate surveys available.  They are not opt-in surveys; the businesses were contacted.  That is a crucial issue in terms of getting the best possible result.  We look forward to the survey for October 2013 to March 2014 that will come out on 12 May.  The results from the most recent survey bear repeating.  In the six months to September 2013, there was a marked improvement in the trading conditions for Irish SMEs with improved turnover, profit and staffing levels across different sizes and types of SMEs.  However, more than one in four companies remain in challenging conditions.  That is symptomatic of the overhang of the downturn, but it is worth noting that we are seven years into the downturn, so if those businesses have survived, they must be doing something right.</p><p> At this stage, rather than resulting in an increase in credit demand, these improved trading conditions have led to a reduced level of demand among SMEs in general, as working capital demand for struggling smaller SMEs reduces.  Sentiment among SMEs for the future remains cautious, which could be interpreted as meaning that this apparent reduction in support demand has not as yet been replaced by growth demand.  Our view is that the commentary from which we quoted on the last survey will change because our sense is that growth demand will be a lot better in the next six month report.</p><p> The overall approval rate for those seeking credit has improved.  That may be as a result of those in more financial difficulty not seeking credit at this time as trading improves.  The banks have also increased the number of credit decisions in the agreed timeframe and ensured that fewer SMEs can claim they were not told why they were declined.  However, SMEs are claiming that more conditions are being attached to agreed credit.  While demand is down, there has been a continued improvement in the perception of whether banks are lending to the sector.  Significant gains were evident in the last report.  However, the belief that banks are not lending remains an issue, with a significant minority - 7% - of SMEs not applying for credit because they believe banks are not lending.  That is disheartening.  Our view is that SMEs should get training to fill in loan applications properly, get the data they need in terms of cashflow, make a formal application and, if it is rejected, they can go to the John Trethowan organisation, the Credit Review Office, and make the proper appeal.  It is disappointing that some firms are discouraged from even doing that but that is what is happening according to the commentary we hear.  We contend that the only sure way to address the issue is to encourage businesses to complete the full loan application process and, if they are rejected, to appeal to the Credit Review Office.</p><p> Solid progress has been made but businesses that have banked or are currently banking with banks exiting the Irish market face a refinancing opportunity or threat.  That is a major challenge for the discrete number of businesses that are in such situations.  The big challenge is to ensure the remaining banks in the market have the appetite to take on those businesses.  Unfortunately, there are not many statistics in that regard but, anecdotally, some banks are more aggressive than others in terms of the write-downs being offered as they exit the market.  That is both an opportunity and a threat.</p><p> We have consistently profiled and supported the work of the CRO around Ireland and throughout our network.  However, it is difficult to ignore the fact that despite the best efforts of many organisations and even the advertising campaigns, the number of appeals to the CRO is very low.  The committee has heard the statistics in the past hour.</p><p> In terms of alternative sources of funding, we recognise that angel investors, crowd funding and other sources of finance can help SMEs survive, grow and develop.  That said, it is our contention that, while welcome, they will play only a relatively small role in the business funding landscape.  One sector in which we see huge opportunity - we profiled it in our last pre-budget submission - is the enterprise investment and incentive scheme, the successor to the business expansion scheme, BES, and also the seed capital scheme.  We will complete a submission on the issues later this week and we will profile them in our pre-budget submission.</p><p> The other big take-away from our perspective is in the training sector.  It is clear there are still skills gaps in too many Irish SMEs.  Given the changed financial landscape, businesses have to upskill their financial analytical skills to enable them to talk the talk regarding securing new bank finance.  We note that the national training fund, NTF, is gathered via a compulsory levy on all employers of 0.7% of salary paid.  That amounts to approximately &euro;350 million per year.  The vast majority of the money is currently devoted to training for employment.  Virtually no funding is available to employers to upskill either their management teams or staff.  That does little to assist firms at a time when they need it most.  Accordingly, we continue to call for moneys to be made available under the NTF to be ring-fenced to support owner-managers and their management teams and those who are specifically in employment to upskill themselves on cashflow analysis to enable firms to carry out the required cashflow analyses needed to complete a full and comprehensive loan application and talk knowledgeably to their banks.</p><p> We will talk about procurement in greater detail.  The Government could give consideration to paying automatically the relevant interest surcharge for late payments made not just by public service Departments, but also by sub-entities of Government, such as the HSE, which I use just for the purpose of giving an example.  In that way we could support businesses in their everyday cashflow, thereby reducing their working capital requirements.  If the Government automatically paid the surcharge, it might be very beneficial rather than expecting a business that is selling into the entity to ask for the surcharge, which can be difficult when it is a significant customer.  That is our perspective on the matter.</p></speech>

This is a personal view but retail banking will have to be treated as a strategic utility in the future.  A strategic utility has different types of growth rates expected of it and regulated for it.  Given that we have a population of 4.5 million people, there is not a huge amount of room for a whole lot of players in that area.  I note that even in the mobile phone market, despite the best efforts of the regulator to drive competition, ultimately, we are rapidly moving towards three families of mobile phone companies in Ireland.  That type of thing happens with such networks.  It is more important to have a regulatory environment that ensures best practice and fair practice for all consumers rather than necessarily chasing extreme competition or multiple competition.  Part of our challenge in the downtime was things like the 100% mortgage and everything else that kicked in in the mid-2000s that drove other more conservative banks to chase the market and we ended up having to pay for it in significant amounts in latter years.  Clearly, the case for additional enterprise-specific skills and enterprise-specific loan skills is quite compelling.  As a network we have not come down officially on a perspective on it but the ICC was a worthwhile institution that did good stuff when it was <i>in situ</i>and merits review again.  We have three significant players and some niche players left in the market.</p> <p>We do not have the level of diversity and competition we had ten years ago.  If one takes the view that deposit-taking banking is a strategic utility, one might feel that the current number is a more credible number to have.</p><p> I think I have answered the question about new forms of banking such as angel investing.  Regarding the low appeals ratio, I think part of the issue is that seven years into the downturn, there has been a huge throughput of businesses that have hit the wall, unfortunately, and gone bust.  The businesses that are still alive are alive for a reason, which is that they have the guile, the product and the customers to keep them alive.  I am sure they have relationships with banks that involve some forbearance.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about appeals to the Credit Review Office.  Many of those involved in SMEs know they are running good businesses, but they have bad balance sheets because of previous property investments they made.  They now have to choose between going bust and grinding it out.  The businesses to which I refer are in grind-it-out mode.  The real challenge will be presented in the next 18 to 30 months if businesses that need investment capital to help them to grow and sustain themselves are still encumbered with significant asset debt from their investments in the early or late 2000s.</p><p> The issues I have mentioned are driving the relatively low levels or ratios of appeals.  Many businesses know they need to fix and grind down the challenges in their own balance sheets.  We are seven years into the downturn, thankfully.  It is to be hoped that many of the businesses with which we have interacted are still here.  If they are, they will have seven more years of their loans paid off, just like households that are paying off mortgages.  I think that is probably the big driver in this regard.</p><p> I do not suggest that the Credit Review Office has not played an important role.  It has played an important role in terms of being there as an appeals facility.  It is important to be able to avail of the services of a referee if necessary.  However, it could be fixing solutions earlier in the process.  I do not say that to criticise the Credit Review Office for the low level of take-up.  I do not believe there is a fear of appealing from the perspective of businesses.  That is my personal view.  I refer the committee to the issues I mentioned earlier.</p><p> I cannot put a price on the quantification of late payments right now.  It is more a question of the principle being established.  To be fair to the central government Departments, they have speeded up their payment times significantly.  We are saying that it is a question of making sure their sub-entities do the same.  There is no better way to get that process going than to impose a cost penalty on those who do not get the cheque out the door or, more helpfully, make an electronic payment.</p></speech>

During the discussion with the head of the Credit Review Office, I made the point that the lack of credit, the difficulty around credit and the debt distress that exists in the Irish SME structure comprise a big problem.  Four or five years into this process, I am shocked that this problem is persisting even with the delivery of solutions such as microfinance and the establishment of the Credit Review Office.  The level of demand for those solutions has not increased, for a start.  People have very good insights - there is anecdotal evidence of why these solutions are not being used - but we do not have a more solid, tangible or concrete understanding of exactly why the level of take-up is so low among everybody on both sides of the table.  That understanding does not exist in the Department and it does not exist in the Credit Review Office itself.  That has to be tackled if people are to be able to measure the real reasons and deal with them.</p><p>  Mr. Murphy made a valuable point about one of the major problems with this whole process.  There is a lack of skills in the banking sector when it comes to SMEs and there is lack of skills in SMEs when it comes to the banking sector.  I suggest that the local enterprise offices should be used as a major platform to deliver those skills across the whole enterprise sector.  I know the county enterprise boards delivered a great deal of training to start-ups in the past.  Once a business has started up, it very seldom plugs into the county enterprise board structure again unless it needs a specific skill.  Maybe there should be a strong push to get the local enterprise offices to deliver these financial skills to businesses for the purposes of developing healthy functioning businesses and helping them to understand and engage properly with the credit world.</p><p>  It is a big shock that cash flow is still getting worse, even at the so-called end of the crisis.  It is a big difficulty.  Does Mr. Murphy have any figures with regard to the cash flow experiences of businesses?  How many businesses are falling off or closing as a result of cash flow issues?  Mr. Murphy alluded to the debt distress issue when he suggested that a foot is being placed on the neck of future investment.  People like Professor Morgan Kelly have spoken about the possibility of many SMEs being pushed off the desk, with regard to their functioning, if the policies of the ECB change.  What is Mr. Murphy's understanding of the depth of debt distress within SMEs?  How is the reduced capacity and reduced refinancing within banking affecting the members of Chambers Ireland?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, the vast majority of SMEs in Ireland are trending towards being micro-businesses rather than being medium-sized businesses.  As they operate in the domestic market, their customers are mostly domestic consumers whose pockets have been raided significantly over the last eight years as we have sought to balance the national finances.  That is not leading to a great deal of expenditure.  It is striking to examine the statistics showing how many car sales are still paid for in cash, as opposed to debt finance.  It was clear to anyone who listened to "Morning Ireland" this morning that consumers have taken a major shock and are now saving before they spend.</p><p>  The other unquantifiable is the rhetoric about raising the retirement age, which is probably endorsed by all of us.  If that happens, consumers will have to fund their pensions for longer than they did before now.  If people have to do more precautionary saving, this will have a direct effect on local domestic expenditure.  The low level of take-up is intimately related to the low level of demand, which is intimately built on confidence.  As confidence is finally improving, thankfully, we will see further demand in that area in the future.</p><p>  We have welcomed the arrival of the local enterprise offices.  Many chambers worked very closely with the city and county enterprise boards.  We look forward to that practice continuing in the future.  We believe the local enterprise offices should work very closely with the local business representative organisations that have the necessary links.  That would be better than the offices doing this work directly themselves.</p><p>  The big challenge for the owners and managers of SMEs is to decide whether to trust local enterprise office employees, who work for the local authority, with their accounts, given that their businesses will be taxed by that local authority next December.  That is a perennial challenge that we are going to face.  How open will the officials be when businesses want to talk about these things?  I have to say that is a big question.</p><p>  Our view is that if businesses are paying &euro;350 million into the national training fund, some of that funding should be ring-fenced for them to access and they should be able to choose what is best for them in securing training.  They do not want somebody in a local enterprise office who might not have ever run a business to tell them how to best improve their cash flows.  Our view is that the real issue is the need for a fund that businesses can access to be put in place.</p><p>  The big issue with regard to cash flow is how it is funded.  If one encounters an uptake in demand, one will have to order more stock so that it can be sold.  That is where cash flow becomes a little more strained.  As the demand for one's product increases, one has to wait for payments.  It might seem paradoxical to suggest that part of the reason cash flow is more constrained might relate to the upturn.  That is where working cash flow becomes a challenge.</p><p>  I guess the real way to look at the issue of debt distress is to examine the official reports the banks have produced setting out the levels of SME debt distress they have on their accounts.  It is a big challenge.  I hope the position in this regard will improve as asset values increase.  They are increasing at present, particularly in the Dublin and east coast region, in parts of Cork and in other strategic parts of the country.</p> <p>Those statistics are out there and are equally a big challenge.  Equally, the banks will tell us that given that their operations are predominantly domestic-focused, they have a vested interest in keeping these businesses going.  We need further consumer confidence and consistent consumer spending, as well as fewer raids on consumers&rsquo; pockets through more taxes.  With growth and employment, we will start to get a more balanced economy.</p></speech>

He said an appeal does not always go through the books and that the office would speak to a bank on a customer&rsquo;s behalf on the q.t. to get a decision changed.</p><p>  Does Chambers Ireland see a potential for credit unions to be a source of finance for small businesses?  As a credit union and a small business would be an integral part of a community, there would be more knowledge of the business&rsquo;s prospects.</p></speech>

It could not be a local district credit union.  Credit unions were originally about freeing customers from moneylenders.  It was about lending money for someone to buy shoes for their children at Christmas, not lending &euro;30,000 in working capital to a business.  It would have to be very targeted and there would need to be a high level of professionalism in a credit union to enable it to lend such sums.</p></speech>

There might be better ways of doing it rather than a credit union doing it directly like through a fund.  The BES, business expansion scheme, was successful and Butlers Chocolates, for example, grew on the back of that.  That might be a better way of going about releasing this money rather than getting a predominantly volunteer-run and community-driven credit union involved in making credit decisions on businesses.</p><p>  That is my personal view but Chambers Ireland has not consulted on this as a network.  There are chambers and credit unions of scale that may well have the human capital and capacity to get involved in lending.  However, it would want to be extremely well-targeted and regulated.  The most recent report from the credit union regulator has stated there are challenges for them in professionalising their outputs in that area.</p></speech>

In our deliberations, we have heard from LinkedFinance, Mr. Peter O'Mahony and Mr. Marc Rafferty.  We have heard some good news stories about crowdfunding and the like.  Applications for such funding can be filled out in 37 seconds online.  These sources seem to be doing something right but it seems to me there is not a significant take-up of them.  How well aware are small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, of the opportunities of alternative sources of funding?  It seems alternative sources of funding have taken off in other countries.</p></speech>

These are all additional helps which will assist in broadening the landscape of funding available.  My core point, however, is what do we call success in crowdfunding?  What is a number that has a massive reach in how it would affect the market?  My sense is that getting to &euro;500 million in crowdfunding would be a massive achievement for crowdfunding but even that is not going make an enormous impact on the credit availability landscape.  While welcome, it would not change the feeling on the ground when it comes to availability.</p><p>  More can be done to increase business awareness.  We will be bringing Microfinance Ireland around the chambers network with a series of road shows this year.  Microfinance Ireland would have worked with other entities last year but was not getting the same pick-up.  It has now come to us and we will profile its service through our chambers boards.  That will be a good conduit to local communities.  One talks to the board which is often reflected in local media coverage.  The board would typically have leading businesses in the area.  To be fair, we, along with other organisations, participated in preparing the document Your Business, Your Bank which covered the basics which all of us, banks and businesses, may have forgotten in the noughties such as that character and credit history matters.</p><p>  There may well be a case for a proper marketing-communications plans to be devised for this.  This involves money being spent and many Departments, rightly from their perspective, do not want to spend money on such exercises.  If one looks at the roll-out of the single European payments area, SEPA, and the marketing plan funded by banks and overseen by a committee embracing banks, marketers and Central Bank of Ireland staff, it has achieved much and the recognition of SEPA has been significant.  Whether it is for Intreo or other work-related schemes, Departments, which spend billions of euro a year, claiming they do not have money for marketing-communications plans means there will be failure in the activation of those schemes.  </p></speech>

Eircom is rolling out a significant spend on broadband roll-out across the country and we have done approximately 25 events with it throughout the country profiling it to our chamber members, which has gone very well.</p><p> Microfinance Ireland will do something similar, targeting a discrete number of a particular type of chamber that might have a higher preponderance of SMEs, addressing their boards, talking about the product and profiling it in local channels thereafter.  We can do that with many others.  We have offered to do likewise for some of the new schemes emanating from the Department of Social Protection and others.  The appetite of the Department of Social Protection and others to spend money on marketing and communications is for them to decide.

We have approximately 12 or 13 lines of revenue including events, publications, commercial partnerships, patronages and, crucially, subscriptions from our members.  Given that our members are affiliated chambers, which have memberships, our subscriptions are a relatively small part of our revenue and therefore we have to earn revenue through other sources.  While funding is a challenge, Chambers Ireland is a very cost-effective operation and should be a key channel into communities around the country.

It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode.  They need to be switched off, as otherwise they will interfere with the broadcasting equipment, which means that we will not be able to broadcast the proceedings.  Apologies have been received from Senators Colm Burke, Catherine Noone and Kathryn Reilly.</p><p>  I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  Members will be aware that this is Europe Week and the event is being marked by a number of debates both in the Houses and in committees, so it is appropriate that the Minister of State is with us today.</p><p>  The first item on the agenda is a discussion on the forthcoming General Affairs Council meeting, which the Minister of State will attend in Brussels next week.  The main item on the GAC agenda is the preparation of the June European Council.  I understand the agenda for the June European Council has not yet been finalised but I am sure it will address issues such as the European semester, justice and home affairs, and climate and energy.  The European Council may also have to take decisions relating to the appointment of the next President of the Commission.</p><p>  We will then discuss the forthcoming European Parliament Elections, which as we all know will take place on Friday, 23 May.  I am sure many members are deeply involved in the campaigns that are under way.  We are interested in the Minister's views on the issues at stake, the national and European campaigns, the role of the European political groups in the campaigns and voter turnout.</p></speech>

I will start by giving an update on the forthcoming General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels.  As the Chairman has indicated, I will comment on the forthcoming the European elections across our Union, and the political and economic backdrop against which the elections are taking place.  Of course, any wider reflection on Europe and the discussion today must also recognise the great change that has taken place in the Union and consider the successful enlargement of our Union.  I was delighted to speak earlier today at a special conference in Dublin Castle, at which Deputy Eric Byrne was present, marking the historic 2004 enlargement which took place on 1 May ten years ago and reflecting on the future political, economic and security challenges of the European Union.  The Greek Presidency is also arranging a short ceremony to mark the ten year anniversary at next week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council.  I will be delighted to participate in this.</p><p>  The 2004 accession reunited Europe after years of artificial division.  As members will all recall, on 1 May that year, Ireland hosted a Day of Welcomes in the Phoenix Park for the 25 member states and those countries in negotiation to become members.</p> <p>The late Seamus Heaney was commissioned to write a poem for the occasion entitled Beacons at Bealtaine.<i></i>In his poem, Heaney exhorted us to &quot;move lips, move minds and make new meanings flare&quot;.<i></i>I hope that we have risen to that call but we must continue to do so.<br />We can be proud of the development of our relations with the countries who entered in 2004 and since.  Our people-to-people contacts have never been stronger.  Today, we are proud to count many people originally from the countries that joined the EU ten years ago as part of our Irish community.  Our economic relations have also gone from strength to strength.  Ireland's goods exports to central and eastern Europe were worth nearly &euro;2.2 billion last year which is three times what they were worth in 2004.<br />Meanwhile, EU enlargement continues to drive transformation and anchor stability in the countries of south-east Europe aspiring to EU membership.  Later this week, I shall attend an EU ministerial conference looking at how we can encourage the next wave of candidates and potential candidates, from the western Balkans, on their path to EU membership.  The pull and influence of the EU is helping aspirant countries implement democratic and economic reforms, improve the role of law and respect for human rights and helps them overcome the legacy of their past.<br />The last General Affairs Council was held in Brussels on 18 March.  The Council, which was followed by a lunch with the President of the European Council, focused on the preparation for the March European Council conclusions.  The crisis in Ukraine was unsurprisingly uppermost in people's minds.<br />There was also an extensive exchange of views on the Commission's communication on the Rule of Law Mechanism with differing degrees of enthusiasm for the proposal among member states.  It was agreed that the communication warranted a further, more substantial discussion at a future General Affairs Council meeting, possibly in June, when council conclusions on the Commission's proposal could be considered.<br />Apart from the enlargement ceremony, the main item on the agenda next Tuesday is the preparation of the June European Council.  This will be the first ministerial engagement, in advance of the June meeting, of Heads of State and Government and we expect to agree on a draft agenda.  Further and more substantive preparatory work will be done at the June General Affairs Council.  At present, I expect that the June European Council will focus on the European Semester, climate and energy and the adoption of new strategic guidelines on justice and home affairs, as well as relevant foreign policy issues.  It is likely that the Heads of State and Government will also discuss the appointment of the next President of the Commission and any other appointments.  The June European Council will conclude the 2014 European Semester by endorsing country specific recommendations for member states.  These will then be taken forward through the different national budget and policy cycles.<br />The committee will recall that we had a very constructive engagement on the European Semester on 1 April in the context of settling our national reform programme.  This was then finalised by the Government and submitted to the Commission in mid-April.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, also had an important exchange with the finance committee on 15 April regarding the submission of our Stability Programme update.  We currently expect that the Commission will present its draft country specific recommendations on 2 June.  This is an issue to which we will return at our June meeting.<br />Members will also recall that the March European Council held a first policy debate on the framework for climate and energy to 2030.  Heads of State and Government agreed that they would take stock of progress made on these issues in June, with a view to taking a final decision on the new policy framework by October.  In light of the situation in Ukraine, the Commission was also asked in March to prepare a detailed analysis on Europe's energy security and to propose a comprehensive plan to reduce energy dependency for consideration in June.  Meanwhile, intensive work is continuing at technical and political level, involving also the Environment, Energy and Agriculture Councils.<br />I will now turn to the justice and home affairs strategic guidelines.  A key focus for Heads of State and Government in June will be the adoption of strategic guidelines to direct future work in the area of justice and home affairs over the coming years.  The guidelines will succeed the Stockholm Programme, the current multi-annual justice and home affairs work programme that expires at the end of this year.  Their adoption will be the culmination of a debate that has been ongoing at ministerial and senior working party levels since July 2013, and which has also included the submission of formal written contributions by individual member states in late 2013.<br />The Presidency has indicated that it will present a paper for discussion at the June Justice and Home Affairs Council, after which a document will be sent to the June European Council that will take on board the views of justice and home affairs' Ministers.  It remains to be seen what exact format the document will take or how detailed it will be.  However, there is wide agreement among member states that following the development of an extensive legal architecture in the justice and home affairs area over the past 15 years, the next phase should focus primarily on the implementation, evaluation and consolidation of the existing legal framework rather than on a lengthy shopping list of new legislative proposals.<br />While the Irish Government shares this view, we and other member states have also recommended that the guidelines should be flexible enough to permit further legislative action, where there is clear and objective evidence, that this is necessary and that any additional costs are justifiable.  Ireland's official written submission on the issue, a copy of which has been shared with the committee, identified a number of areas of co-operation that we believe should be considered for further development.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has highlighted many of these areas in the course of discussions at Justice and Home Affairs Council and elsewhere.<br />The June European Council is also expected to agree further concrete measures in the area of Regulatory Fitness or REFIT which refers to the work that is being carried out by the Commission at the moment, to ensure that we have the right level of regulation in different sectors of our economy and society.  This is an important emphasis that has been established over recent months and involves: withdrawing unnecessary proposals; simplifying what is already in place; and repealing what is out of date.  It means reducing transaction costs for the businesses that can and will create new jobs.  I hope that I have given the committee a flavour of next week's discussions.<br />Let me turn to our second agenda item which is the European elections and the broader European backdrop.  As the Taoiseach has noted, this month's European elections are the most important for Ireland since we joined the EEC four decades ago because the European Parliament matters like never before.  It is also because, in the coming months and term, its influence in the formation of EU legislation and the direction Europe takes is poised to be greater than ever before.<br />As members of the committee are aware, the Lisbon treaty has substantially enhanced the role and powers of the Strasbourg Parliament.  Co-decision is now the EU's standard legislative practice, meaning that Parliament has a significant say in the formation of almost all EU legislation. </p> <p>Members of the committee should consider its output over its current term.  It included 45,000 legislative amendments, of which 16,000 were adopted, 2,091 committee reports on issues ranging from the Common Fisheries Policy to the role of the troika in European Union programme countries and more than 22,000 votes in plenary session, leading to the adoption of 2,583 texts, including 970 legislative acts.  These numbers tell only part of the story.</p><p> The range of policy areas over which the Parliament exerts influence is just as telling.  To take a few examples, the Parliament played an essential role in determining the EU&rsquo;s multiannual financial framework.  It contributed to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and in its final session last month, it voted through legislation enacting the single resolution mechanism, the banking restructuring and resolution directive and provisions on the preferential treatment of depositors, all of which are critical steps in the creation of banking union.  The next Parliament will take equally critical decisions on everything from Europe&rsquo;s environmental and climate change commitments to what I hope will be a historic free trade agreement between the United States and the European Union.</p><p> One of the Parliament&rsquo;s first and most important tasks will be to consider the European Council&rsquo;s nominee for the Presidency of the European Commission.  The steps from the elections to this critical vote and from thence to the final appointment of the Commission are worth considering, given their relevance to all that will follow in this term.  All 28 member states will hold their elections between 22 and 25 May.  Provisional results should be available quickly, with final results to be confirmed in June, in the course of which newly-elected MEPs will meet and constitute their political groups.  During the same period, the Heads of State and Government will consider their nominee for the President of the European Commission with a view to reaching a decision at the June European Council.  This consideration will take account of the results of the European election.  The Parliament will hold its first plenary or constitutive session between 1 and 3 July.  This will be dedicated to the formal constitution of the Parliament, with the new MEPs set to elect the President of the Parliament, 14 Vice-Presidents and six quaestors, as well as the chairs and vice chairs of the committees.</p><p> Assuming the Heads of State and Government select a nominee at the June Council, the Parliament would be expected to vote on the proposal at its second plenary session, which is scheduled for 14 to 17 July.  When the Commission President has been elected, the Council, in agreement with the President, will adopt the list of Commissioners designate.  Commissioners designate will then be called to appear in public before the relevant European parliamentary committees.  After this screening process is complete, the President will present the full College of Commissioners and its programme at a plenary session of Parliament, which will then vote its consent to the Commission&rsquo;s appointment.  If all goes to schedule, the new Commission should take office on 1 November.</p><p> While this timing is provisional and somewhat uncertain, it is absolutely clear that the upcoming elections will substantially alter the Strasbourg and Brussels landscapes.  As for what shape the new Parliament will take, current polls suggest the two main political groups, namely, the European People's Party, EPP, and the Socialists and Democrats, S&amp;D, are closely matched.  They also point to a significant increase in the representation of the far right, far left and eurosceptic parties.  Indeed, indications are that anti-EU parties might secure as many as a quarter of all seats and may top national polls in several member states.  All of this could mean a more volatile, fragmented and polarised European Parliament will emerge.  However, as several commentators have suggested, it also is possible that the result will mean those parties in support of the EU will end up working more closely together than ever before.</p><p> Whatever is the case, the growth of euroscepticism is a worrying trend which, if left unchecked, could threaten the legitimacy of the European project.  The fact that anti-EU voices have gained support through the economic crisis is of course unsurprising.  In times of uncertainty and especially in times of high unemployment, the attraction of simplistic solutions should not be underestimated.  While the promise that the challenges of a globalised world can be overcome by nation states retreating into protectionism can provide comfort, it is simply untrue.  The reality is much more complex.  Globalisation has changed the game for nations.  It requires that we work together and this, as I have said a number of times, is what I believe the contemporary rationale of the EU should be, that is, by working together we can achieve more in a changing world than we could on our own.  If the arguments of euroscepticism are to be debunked and the legitimacy of the Union maintained and enhanced, it is essential that this truth be demonstrated to voters.  I believe this is best achieved through our response to the crisis, by restoring stability and delivering jobs and growth throughout the continent.</p><p> I will conclude with some thoughts on this work with regard to Ireland&rsquo;s work with the European Parliament.  More than most, perhaps, Ireland has special cause to recognise the importance of this rapidly evolving institution.  Its Ministers and officials worked closely with the Parliament in preparing for and delivering Ireland's EU Presidency.  In the 18 months prior to the Presidency, there were more than 35 visits by Irish Ministers to the Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg.  During the Presidency, Ministers participated in more than 70 debates in committee and plenary while at official level, Ireland held almost 350 trilogues with MEPs.  This engagement has left the Government with a clear impression of the Parliament&rsquo;s significance, a valuable insight into its workings and a strong network of influential contacts.  Since the Presidency, the Government has looked to continue this positive engagement.  A Minister has travelled to Strasbourg each month for most plenary sessions.  I myself have already attended twice and will continue to so do in the coming months, as will other ministerial colleagues.</p><p> This engagement in the early sessions of the new Parliament will be critical in reinforcing Ireland's existing connections and in developing new ones.  This is all the more vital given that the turnover of MEPs is set to be especially pronounced as just 336 current MEPs are seeking re-election, which means that more than half of the 751-member Parliament will be new.  Many important figures are retiring, including group leaders Hannes Swoboda and Joseph Daul, as well as influential committee chairs Sharon Bowles, Malcolm Harbour and Klaus-Heiner Lehne.  The scale of change and the growing powers of the Parliament make it essential that the 11 MEPs the Irish people elect this month, whatever their political background, are active and engaged from the outset.  While Ireland's share of the Parliament is relatively small, the influence of our MEPs in advancing and protecting our national interests at EU level can be significant.</p><p> I also wish to emphasise two recent and important examples in this regard arising from different areas of European Parliament activity.  If one considers the role the European Parliament and its MEPs in committee played in the latter stages of the design and negotiation of the structures for banking union, it is a clear example of the role of the European Parliament in negotiations and discussions that are vital to the Irish national interest.  Another example relates to the role the European Parliament now plays in areas such as consumer rights and health policy.  I was present in Strasbourg for the votes the European Parliament took in plenary session on the proposals for plain cigarette packaging.</p> <p>That decision by the European Parliament provides a tangible example for people of the impact of the consumption of such products on their health.  Perhaps such tangible examples in the areas of health, consumer policy and the rights of consumers provide a clearer example of the impact and role the European Parliament plays in our daily lives than, for example, a discussion on the proposed banking union which, while vital and of the highest priority for our national interests, sometimes does not exhibit itself in the daily lives of our citizens in the way changes in areas of consumer policy and health policy might.  Both of those are vivid examples of the role of the European Parliament.  That is the reason we have had Ministers attend nearly every session of the plenary sessions in Strasbourg since our Presidency and I have undertaken much of that travel myself.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I will do my best to respond to any comments or questions the members may have.</p></speech>

I salute his huge work in this area and the effort he is making to do the job very well.  I want to raise a few questions or observations.  First, the likelihood of an historic free trade agreement between the US and the EU is welcome and will bestow many benefits on this country, but one of the risks of such an agreement is that it could damage our agricultural sector.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's comment on that and what steps he might be able to take to help us protect that sector in the face of a trade agreement.  That is very important to the people I represent and for our economy.</p><p>  Second, the Minister of State rightly cited the situation in Ukraine as being grave and he spoke of the need for Europe to develop its energy capacity and reduce its dependence on imported energy resources in certain sectors.  It appears to us as observers that the situation in Ukraine is deteriorating by the hour and by the day.  Will the Minister of State comment on the situation there and what steps the EU collectively can take to deal with it?  The situation there is very depressing and appears to be getting worse.  I would be heartened to hear a view to the contrary but it seems that is the case.</p><p>  The Minister of State made a good observation regarding euroscepticism.  I note from some national polling data in the media across the water that, frighteningly, UKIP is polling extremely well.  That brings up the question of the risk of the UK opting out of the European Union by, first, having a referendum - as it will - and, second, by opting out of the Union.  I know the Minister of State has been proactive in this area and he is concerned about it.  What ongoing steps is he taking to use our good offices and influence to ensure that sanity will prevail in the UK?  The implications of such a change for the Border area I represent are quite frightening.</p><p>  The Minister of State made a good point, and it is important to get it across and get it onto the national agenda, namely, that the European Parliament has much increased powers and is a very relevant body and legislative assembly relative to its previous status.  While I do not expect him to comment on individual candidates, I believe he would agree with me that this makes it incumbent upon this country to elect candidates to the European Parliament with proven records, parliamentary experience and with the capacity to contribute to this country's welfare abroad, irrespective of from what side of the political divide they come.  It certainly suggests to me, and I know it is difficult for the Minister of State to comment on this, that there is no room for electing people who lack experience and who simply grandstand and produce platitudes with no capacity to back up what they say.  We need to elect very experienced people with parliamentary, and indeed ministerial, experience.</p></speech>

On the General Affairs Council, GAC, meeting and the work it will do in the preparation of the agenda for the June European Council and with particular reference to the foreign policy element, is there any potential to discuss the situation that is developing in Nigeria where Islamic militants, the Boko Haram group, have kidnapped in excess of 200 young female children from a school and the leader of that group has indicated that he intends to trade them into slavery?  That is an appalling situation and one on which Europe should take a stand under its foreign policy remit.  Clearly, the United States has taken a very public stand on it and I would hope the European Union could certainly play a role.  There is room for active participation here rather than soundbites or platitudes because, clearly, this group is not going to respond to commentary from the United States from the President's publicity machine or from his public relations side and neither will it respond to similar outpourings by various different state leaders across Europe.  Is there a potential for some level of support that could be provided to the Nigerian Government in an effort  to try to deal with the situation that is evolving?</p><p>  On the European elections, while I share some of the concerns of my colleague, I do not believe any of us is in a position to lecture the electorate in advance of elections and we must await the outcome of the democratic process.  My concern around the issue of the disengagement with the European project by citizens across the member states and the development of support for UKIP and others, and perhaps for some within this jurisdiction, has more to do with a belief by the majority of citizens that Europe has not been working for them to the extent that it might.  While the Minister of State spoke about the polarisation developing between the two bigger parties on the one hand and the extremes on the right and the left, the fact of the matter is that, effectively, the two big parties do not appear to have been delivering, particularly for countries that have suffered to the greatest extent.</p><p>  To take the example of our own country, many of our citizens believe the ECB has taken political guidance, especially from members who would be aligned to the EPP and, in particular the direction, to some extent, from the German central bank whereby we have been forced to pay all the senior bonds, which has impacted very significantly on the services and level of taxation Irish citizens have had to endure.  In addition to that and while I do not want to be political, promises were made in June 2012 when the parties in government believed a decision had been taken that would effectively be a game-changer in terms of the way in which our finances were structured or restructured.  We are still waiting for flesh to be put on the bones of that decision.</p><p>  I accept that banking union is a slow beast and that it will take some time to put the architecture in place but, notwithstanding that, our citizens are looking on and they still see the austerity programme, which I accept was necessary, although some do not, to resolve to some extent the crisis that has developed across Europe.</p> <p>The prospect of light at the end of the tunnel, in terms of giving back to the State some of the moneys committed to the pillar banks, which is often referred to in the context of retrospective recapitalisation of our banks, has not come to pass.  That is not necessarily the Minister of State's fault but somebody is holding out.  If people saw European member states working together to deliver better outcomes for countries like Ireland and for citizens, it would make it easier for those of us who are anxious to maintain and develop the European project to explain during elections how this State benefits.  People are currently saying to us that all we appear to be doing is making good the gambling debts of others.</p></speech>

I thank him for his detailed presentations and I agree with most of what he has said.  In regard to his new engagement with those who will be elected to the European Parliament from the far left and the far right, it constitutes a worrying trend in European politics that people seek simplistic solutions and often adhere to slogans that are attractive.  We have experience of that in Irish politics, not least in the Irish Parliament.</p><p>  Does the Minister of State agree that we must start looking more closely at justice and fundamental rights issues in the European Union when it comes to, for example, hate crimes, xenophobia and anti-semitic outbursts?  The European Union must hold firmly to its fundamental beliefs and the basic human rights that accompany them if we are to be able to argue strongly against the hatred that is being delivered by UKIP and others.  This weekend my daughter brought back some UKIP propaganda from its election campaign.  We are lucky in Ireland that we do not yet have an extreme right wing party propagating that type of hatred.  Does the Minister of State agree that some of the solution to curtailing the ultra-right, in particular, and whatever goes with the ultra-left, which has been around for a long time, involves measures in the area of justice and fundamental rights to deal with hate crimes?</p><p>  In regard to the decision to speed up the association agreements with Georgia and Moldova, what is involved in the agreements we are bringing forward?  While I appreciate that we must pay particular attention to Georgia and Moldova in light of the unfolding situation in Ukraine, I am concerned that by rushing this process we will be creating an agreement that we cannot stand over.</p><p>  Ukraine is a country in crisis.  For the past two years I have been critical of the European Union's position on Ukraine.  I have argued that it was never treated as a unitary state but there is no point in rehearsing my views because they are on the public record.  I maintain contact with people in Ukraine.  I was involved in two sessions in eastern Ukraine and I have very good friends there.  Does the Minister of State agree that the danger arises that Russia, with its 40,000 troops on the border, is creating an atmosphere that could destabilise the region and that those separatists who want to become part of the old Soviet Union do not really represent the desires of the people of eastern Ukraine?  Is there a danger that Russia's use of language depicting Kiev as a threat will ultimately leave those who are currently occupying buildings as the meat in the sandwich between the politics of Russia and the politics of Ukraine?  I understand that many people in eastern Ukraine do not support the separatists who are currently occupying buildings.  There are historic parallels, not least in Ireland, in which people's emotions were built up to the point where they marched behind the loudspeaker with the tricolour flying or became terrorists because their emotions were milked.  Is the Minister of State aware that the separatists severed social media, television and radio links in eastern Ukraine and that the people of the region are almost exclusively dependent on Russian television, which is further exploiting the emotions of eastern Ukrainians?  Does he see any sign that the Russians will not invade but will instead do everything they can to organise factions to destabilise the country in advance of the presidential elections due to be held shortly?</p></speech>

There is growing evidence of serious euroscepticism.  It has existed for years but it is now a growth industry.  The very openness of the European Union and its institutions encourage and accommodate such scepticism.  European and national institutions are apparently incapable of dealing with it, however.  A crunch time will eventually come when the hard right and the hard left come together in common cause.  I hope that during the term of the next European Parliament, the new institutions will make a special effort to address the issues fuelling euroscepticism.  During past referendum campaigns, we have encountered the various homes of euroscepticism in our neighbouring country and across Europe.  Those involved have said nothing to us that would in any way endear us to their policies.  They have repeatedly said whatever suits the audience in their home countries in order to bring them to national prominence.  Unfortunately, that is the way these matters work.  Unless something is done to examine the causes, of which there are many, and the extent to which they can be addressed, the problem will remain.  There is no use listening silently to somebody who comes forward with an outrageous or ridiculous suggestion.  The presumption is that the speaker in those circumstances is correct.  Somebody else will pick up the argument and it goes on from there.</p><p>  The EU-US trade agreement to which Deputy Reilly referred could have major significance for this country.  I have repeatedly spoken about that agreement in this forum and elsewhere.</p> <p>It is essential the European negotiators recognise that they must negotiate, having regard to the welfare of all European countries and not for the benefit of one at the expense of others.</p><p> Ukraine has been an issue for some time.  I am disappointed by the extent to which the European Union has found it possible to engage with the situation there.  I know there are difficulties and to interfere internally in a country is very difficult, but European countries have not been at one on this issue over the past three or four months.  That is a weakness that is recognised by the Russians and by people who have other interests in Ukraine other than national interests.</p><p> My colleague referred to messages of hate.  Incitement to hatred legislation in Europe is totally inadequate.  There have been numerous outbursts of hatred directed at various groups of people in society.  Incitement to hatred legislation has not done, or is incapable of doing, anything about it or is inadequate.  A careful look should be taken at all incitement to hatred legislation in member states and at EU level to ensure this kind of thing is addressed.  Otherwise it will go on and will be like an all-consuming fire.</p><p> We must not forget that the war in Somalia was started as a result of an apostle of hatred who sent out the same information again and again, targeting groups of people on a local radio station, and succeeded in revving up the tension to such an extent that it boiled over.  We know the consequences of that.  Let nobody tell me we are sophisticated enough in Europe not to allow that kind of thing to happen again.  Anything can happen.  Murphy's law will always prevail in that if it can happen, it will happen.</p><p> I pay special tribute to my colleague, Deputy Dooley, who was very entertaining in his appraisal.  He very adroitly managed to mince along the economic footpath much like a mannequin at a fashion show, avoiding all the possible pitfalls and responsibilities that were there and carefully avoiding any responsibility which anybody previous to the current Government had in regard to the situation the current Government and the people of this country have had to shoulder.  Lest anybody be in any doubt, I mention that the people of this country and both parties in government have taken on themselves the problem of resolving a most impossible task, an issue that was almost beyond the bounds of comprehension.  It was in the minds of many of us that the country would not survive and that we would be facing an economic Armageddon for many years.  The fact that did not happen is a great tribute to the Irish people who solidly decided what they were going to do and made the sacrifices, tough as they were.  The Government had the resolve in very difficult times and it faced a lot of criticism and negativity.  It stood up and did its job, which was very difficult to do.</p><p> Do not forget we have just been talking about propaganda and what it can do.  It can undermine a lot of things.</p></speech>

I refer to the country specific recommendations as part of the European semester.  This is our first experience of that post the bailout.  What can we learn from other countries' experiences?  Will any particular issues be raised with colleagues about their experiences over recent years in that area?</p><p>  A number of members commented on the situation in Ukraine.  Do the problems there make it more important for us to expedite expansion to the east and that we open those chapters for accession countries and expedite applications?  I refer to the Single Market in terms of energy.  Given the ongoing tensions in Ukraine and Russian influence, is the Single Market for energy now more important in terms of energy security for the European Union?</p><p>  In regard to the European Parliament elections, the Minister of State said that more than half of the MEPs in the European Parliament are retiring, which I did not know.  Obviously, there is a much lower number in Ireland.  I think one of our MEPs is retiring.  Why does the Minister of State think that is the case across the European Union?  Is it because of a perception of lack of powers?  Obviously, there is not a lack of powers.  Is it as a result of travel?  Does the Minister of State think this election will be a temptation for protest votes rather than, as other members have said, electing real legislators who will play an important role for their countries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014050600007#F01400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive report.  I echo one of the points raised by Deputy Kyne.  In light of the situation in Ukraine, the Commission is preparing a detailed analysis of Europe's energy security with a view to proposing for consideration in June a comprehensive plan to reduce energy dependency.  I find that somewhat troubling because I would not have thought the situation in Ukraine was one that could not have been foreseen in any wider geopolitical analysis, in particular given that there has been a threat to the gas supply from Russia in the past.  It is of concern that we do not have a more robust energy security policy.  Is the Minister of State confident that the comprehensive plan proposed for consideration in June will be one which will go down the road of improving Europe's energy security which I would regard as a very fundamental issue in light of the very fragile recovery of the European economy in recent times which could be very significantly undermined by a significant rise in the cost of energy, for example?</p><p>  I refer to the European Parliament and the issue of European identification and the identification of the citizen with the citizens' Europe.  The enlargement of the European Parliament and the strengthening of its powers were part of a strategy to improve citizen engagement with Europe.  To some extent, that has been a failure.  On previous occasions, we have discussed not only that with the Minister of State but the rise of euroscepticism and the consistent failure of European citizens to engage with Europe.  It is almost going in the wrong direction.  The engagement of citizens with Europe is becoming weaker rather than stronger.</p> <p>I wonder if there is an extent to which the European Parliament - although it has had more powers - is actually becoming unwieldy and fragmented.  The Minister of State made the point about the significant number of current MEPs who are not seeking re-election.  More than half of the new Members will be new.  Given the importance of political groupings in the European Parliament with such a large number of Members, is this a serious issue in terms of undermining the capacity of the European Parliament, to do its job and to communicate with the people of Europe about its work?</p><p> EU enlargement is another issue of concern to me.  The Minister of State and I have differing views which we have debated in the Seanad.  I am not as confident that this is the time to engage in wider enlargement, particularly, given the geopolitical situation with regard to Ukraine.  The expression, "Do not poke the bear", comes to mind.  I question whether in light of the rise of euroscepticism and parties to the far right and far left we should consider whether it is time to have and to hold and to consolidate rather than to continue on an enlargement path.  I fully understand that there are countries who aspire to EU membership and of course I am not suggesting that we should never proceed along the road to enlargement but I think there is a case to be made to slow down this situation, particularly until we can see some serious progress on the Ukraine and the stabilisation of the relationship between the EU and Russia.  Is there any merit in that situation?</p></speech>

I did not seek to apportion blame within this jurisdiction.  I think the Minister of State will appreciate that I was trying to be a bit more reflective about what is happening across Europe rather than getting into the "who did what, when and where" in this instance.  It is a wider European debate about the capacity of the community method to prevail at a time of crisis, that helps to reduce the necessity to become nationalistic and seek to build borders instead of breaking them down.  That is the point I have been trying to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014050600008#G00800"><p>Excellent.  I thank the Chairman.  A full range of issues have been raised, everything from models to quarterbacks.  I will do my best to respond to each question in turn.  A number of consistent themes made an appearance and I will deal with those.</p><p>  My colleague Deputy O'Reilly asked about TTIP, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership which is the opportunity for a trading deal between the European Union and America.  He referred to the sensitivity and concern that exists in our agricultural community and sector about that deal.  I assure the Deputy that we are fully aware of the concerns of people about a likely deal and the impact on different sectors of our economy, in particular in light of the extraordinary performance the same sector has delivered for our economy in recent years and also for the wider community and society.</p><p>  Deputy O'Reilly also asked me about the process of the deal.  The EU Commission is the lead negotiator for the European Union.  At each stage of discussion and negotiation with its counterparts in America it reverts back to the Ministers to give them an update on the negotiations.  The deal will then be agreed by the Ministers and, as I mentioned in my contribution, the European Parliament will play a decisive role.  I emphasise that the Government and the Ministers involved are very much aware of the concerns articulated by the Deputy.</p><p>  On the Deputy's point about euroscepticism and what may or may not happen in the United Kingdom, my view is that there has been a change in the composition of the euroscepticism we are witnessing at the moment compared to a number of years ago.  The kind of euroscepticism that was present in the European Union for much of its existence focused on changing the terms of participation of countries within the European Union.  Many parties or commentators in the past who may have been associated with the term, "eurosceptic" were supporters of the concept of the European Union but had great concerns about how their countries were participating in it.  We are now seeing some new dimensions of that kind of political outlook among many prominent political parties who were against the European Union as it is currently organised and against their countries being in the Union, parties which were opposed to the kind of growth of interdependence and interconnection.</p><p>  In my view the next Parliament will play a very significant role.  Opinion polls are only polls but it is likely that this view will be articulated in greater numbers than in the past in the very forum that is meant to legitimise or offer greater legitimacy to European integration and in the very forum that will have more power than it has had for most of its existence.  If those numbers were to be elected to the European Parliament it will pose different consequences for how the European Union will work.  </p><p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about the United Kingdom referendum.  There is a possibility of a referendum under the next British Parliament, depending on who will be in government.  Until those hypothetical situations materialise, it is very important for us to be aware of the difference between political debate in the United Kingdom and what a future British Government might do.  I wish to affirm the importance of our membership of the European Union and the fact that we will continue to be very durable and positive contributors to the European Union.  That is our objective in the years to come.  I hope that were such a referendum to take place that the United Kingdom would continue to occupy a similar role.</p><p>  I will reply to the points outlined by Deputy Dooley.  He raised the awful situation in Nigeria and the number of children involved.  If that crisis is to be discussed by the European Union it will take place in the Foreign Affairs Council rather than in the General Affairs Council.</p> <p>That discussion will take place in the Foreign Affairs Council rather than General Affairs Council.  It is likely that it will be discussed in some form given the scale of the issue, as Deputy Dooley noted.  I will revert to him with a note on the issue as I am unable to confirm when the discussion will take place. </p><p> Deputies Dooley and Durkan expressed views on the bank debt, to which I propose to respond by making two points.  The scale of the repayments to bondholders arising from the bank debt was heavily influenced by the breadth of the bank guarantee.  The decision by the Government of the time to introduce the guarantee framed much of what followed.  It is important to emphasise this point when seeking to apportion blame in debates about the bank debt.  The decisions on the breadth of the bank guarantee and amount of bank debt covered were taken in Dublin.  </p><p> Deputy Dooley asked where we stand now.  Progress has been made, for example, in eliminating the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  The Deputy also asked how we will deal with the portion of the national debt that arises from the costs of supporting the banking system.  As the Government has stated, once the banking union becomes operational in the next 12 to 24 months, it will continue to pursue the option of retroactive bank recapitalisation.  I have no doubt the Deputy will continue to hold the Government accountable for doing so.  That is the framework within which we have addressed this issue.  Progress has been made on the promissory notes and we will address the issue of retroactive bank recapitalisation in that framework.</p><p> I fully concur with comments on the need to protect the Community method.  Maintaining the bargain the underpins citizen support for the European Union requires a level playing field for countries in respect of the issues that matter to them.  The implementation and maintenance of the Community method is essential in this regard.  The Community method is basically the quasi-judicial role the Commission plays in certain areas of decision-making and its function as the initiator of European Union legislation.  It is extremely important that these roles are maintained if current levels of support for the European Union are to be sustained.  There is a tension on this point.  I have seen much polling on political attitudes towards the European Union.  Most recently, an American polling organisation, the Pew Research Center, surveyed levels of support for the European Union in various member states.  I was struck by the finding that the majority of European Union citizens continue to understand that an entity other than the nation state is required to deal with problems that extend across many countries.  We are all aware, however, that the level of support for the European Union is declining.  </p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne referred to the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, and the absence of legislation on hate crime.  My view of this matter differs slightly from that of the Deputy.  The European Union is examining legislation on hate crime in various member states and the way in which it is being implemented.  The rule of law initiative put to the previous General Affairs Council by Commissioner Viviane Reding addresses this issue.  This morning, I attended the launch of the Crocus programme, which is designed to remind Irish schoolchildren of the horrors of the Holocaust and the role xenophobia and the abuse of the freedoms we take for granted can have in creating an environment in which hate of the other occurs.  As Deputy Byrne is aware, the scale of the horror and damage done in the Second World War was one of the catalysts for European integration.  </p><p> I concur with Deputy Eric Byrne on the importance of having in place robust legislation on hate crime, xenophobia and the terminology used to describe racial minorities.  That being said, in many cases, strengthening hate crimes legislation is not the best response to the political forces about which the Deputy expressed great alarm.  The best response is good political debate.  As we experienced at this meeting, when one somebody raises a point with which one disagrees one challenges them.  In my statement on accession in Dublin Castle this morning I noted that passion and certainty in political life in Europe cannot be confined to the extremes of politics, namely, the far left and far right.  When defending the values we hold dear, we, on the centre left and centre right, must show the same type of certainty as those who are intent on removing these values.  This is a better response to the issues the Deputy raises than legislative action.  </p><p> On Georgia and Moldova, it is planned to proceed with the association agreements with both countries.  The agreements have been initialled to a varying degree already and it is planned to strengthen our relationships with both countries.  I will revert to this issue when I respond to Senator Hayden who raised related questions.  The reason we are continuing with the current approach to both countries is that their elected governments have indicated a desire to continue with the process.  The European Union will continue with the current approach for as long as the governments of the countries in question wish to do so.  It is important to acknowledge the progress that is being made on visa liberalisation with some of these countries. </p><p> I touched on the point raised by Deputy Durkan on our response to extremist political opinion in Europe.  As I indicated, we must respond by engaging in debate, questioning extremist points of view and presenting facts.  </p><p> Deputy Durkan also raised the varying levels of engagement with Ukraine.  Countries are expressing varying levels of concern about the impact an escalation in the crisis could have on them, for reasons of geography, trade and so forth.  While such concerns are understandable, I have been struck by the level of unity maintained to date in the statements and measures taken by the European Union thus far.  Many people believed it unlikely that unity could be sustained on Ukraine.  In acknowledging the varying impact the crisis will have on different countries, I should note that the European Council, Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council have thus far adopted all the positions they have taken on Ukraine with unanimity.  All member states have agreed to the stance taken by the European Union.</p> <p>The Deputy's concluding question was on the role of incitement to hatred in legislation and I have already touched on that.</p><p> I fully agree with Deputy Kyne's first point.  I believe the European semester is a very important change in Irish domestic governance and governance within the European Union.  I thank the Deputy for raising a question on it.  I was pleased to appear before the committee a number of weeks ago to discuss the issue.  I spoke at the Institute of International and European Affairs on this process last Friday morning in an attempt to draw more public attention to it.  In my experience, if we do not keep on explaining what we are doing, fiction grows around it and it then becomes a real challenge to explain what the Government is doing while working with our partners in other countries and in the European Commission.</p><p> In terms of lessons to date, I have not yet had an opportunity to ask the Ministers I deal with on the General Affairs Council for their observations on the process, but I will do so on foot of the Deputy's question.  It is worth emphasising the breadth of involvement that the European semester means for how governments deal with them.  We are so used to much of our engagement with Europe being measured by things such as deficit levels, debt levels, structural deficit levels and so on.</p><p> I encourage members of this committee, anybody listening to this hearing or anybody who has any interest in European and Irish politics to look at the national reform programme that is available on the Department of the Taoiseach's website.  This indicates how we will engage with the European Union through the European semester.  The breadth of policy areas included within it is very striking.  It covers everything including levels of participation in secondary schooling, the environment, an area we have already discussed, and all the economic stuff with which we are more familiar.</p><p> The fundamental difference for Ireland is that up to this date much of the high-profile engagement we have had with Europe has focused on the consequences of decisions that have been made.  However, the semester process looks at policies and decisions in all those different areas that then influence and determine economic growth, social inclusion, debt levels, and deficit levels.  It is a fundamental change in how we are engaging with Europe.</p><p> I believe we should be open about it not only because it is our duty to be open about it to the people, but also because this was the subject of so much discussion in different referendum campaigns in which we have participated.  Given that this is a consequence and this kind of engagement is very much in line with the spirit of, for example, the fiscal governance treaty, I believe it is very important that we talk about it as openly and as frequently as we can.</p><p> I will deal with the Deputy's comment on Ukraine when I deal with the point Senator Hayden put to me.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the number of MEPs who are retiring.  I understand there tends to be a high degree of turnover in the European Parliament anyhow.  There are MEPs who might be going back to politics within their own national domestic political system, not to mention all the other things that would happen in terms of retirement.  The Deputy asked if I believed the level of change at the moment is as a result of concerns MEPs have regarding lack of influence of the European Parliament.  My genuine assessment is that it is not.  In fact, MEPs are very much aware of the level of influence and power they have at the moment.</p></speech>

I believe people can protest strongly against the direction the European Union is taking and still be effective legislators.  They just have a very different outlook from mine, which is their right and what makes politics work.  All I hope is that the people, who get elected to the European Parliament on the back of opposing the EU or how the Parliament uses its powers, will still participate fully and use all the powers the European Parliament has at its disposal.  It matters greatly to Ireland and our national interest in different policy areas, and it matters to the European project.  Given the amount of debate that is going on and how hard people are working to get elected to the European Parliament, I am sure they will participate with great vigour if and when they get elected to that Parliament.<br />Senator Hayden asked about energy independence.  When considering that, we should acknowledge the amount of progress that has already taken place in trying to increase Europe's energy security.  For example, mechanisms are now in place to allow reverse-flow exchange of energy between countries, which means that gas or whatever the energy is can go in both directions through infrastructure.  A significant amount of work has taken place to ensure that happens.  We should consider the amount of additional physical interconnection that is now in place between different member states versus where we were when other crises took places in Ukraine.  Considerable progress has taken place, but much remains to be done.<br />The Senator asked if I was confident that would happen.  I am certainly more confident that it will happen because it is now clearer than it ever was previously what the larger forces are that could affect Europe's ability not only to access energy but to access energy at a price it can afford.  Both of those are very important.  Based on the discussions in which I have participated, there is crystal clear awareness of how important that is now, while acknowledging progress that has already been made.<br />The Senator asked if the size of the Parliament is an impediment to it using its powers effectively and increasing its political legitimacy.  Based on my dealings with it, I would say that it is not an impediment because of the amount of work that is done in the committee structure within the Parliament.  I am struck by what is happening in this term of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, perhaps for other reasons.  The people who are performing roles within the committee structure of the European Parliament have acquired significant influence and a large role in terms of how the European Parliament does its work.  Either consciously or otherwise, they have dealt with the point the Senator raised, which is how a body with 751 Members can possibly operate efficiently.  That has been dealt with through an extremely impressive committee system that operates in a very focused and professional way, much of it depending on the role of individual <i>rapporteurs</i>.<br />The Senator spoke about caution regarding future European engagement and enlargement.  She acknowledged that we would have differing views in that regard.  Thank God for that; how else would any of this work?  Why do I have a different role in relation to the role that the European Union can play outside its current borders by the offer of either European Union membership or closer association with the European Union at a point in the future?  The most important example of that at the moment is with what is happening in Serbia and its relationship with Kosovo.  The Belgrade-Pristina agreement is an extraordinary agreement between two countries that have had great mutual difficulty in the past and still do now.</p> <p>So much of that agreement was secured, if not all of it was secured, through the role the European Union can play in influencing and projecting soft power outside of its own boundaries.  We have seen already in the 1990s the difficulties and the significant consequences that can be caused for all of Europe by difficulties and volatility in central and eastern Europe.<br />If one were to ask me why should the European Union continue to engage with countries outside of its borders and conscious of some of the points Senator Hayden made, the best example I can offer is the extraordinary progress that has been made in that part of Europe to which reference was made due to the role of the European Union.  We are very pleased to welcome our friends from Croatia who recently joined the European Union.  I have heard many politicians from that part of Europe speak recently about the difficulties they have had and they say that the most important structural charge in that part of Europe versus the position they were in ten to 20 years ago is that the region is now a positive contributor to stability as opposed to what it would have been in the past.  That is I believe due to the role the European Union has played.  I very much look forward to debating this and continuing to do so in the future.  This is what the people we represent care about.  It is very important that people can see the different sides to the argument, that both sides can hold views that are different in some respects, but are genuinely held, on the role of the European Union.<br />As to whether we should slow down the integration process in response to that kind of concern, it will not surprise members to hear me say that I do not believe we should, but what we need to emphasise is that we have a very different integration process from what we had a few years ago.  As the nature of integration for current members of the European Union deepens and changes - what is happening in Justice and Home Affairs is an excellent example of that - it means that what we ask future member states to accede to and become members of has changed and because of that the integration process has changed.<br />If we were to compare the integration process that Croatia has just completed, and contrast it with what happened in 2004, not to mention what we in Ireland did more than 40 years ago, I need hardly tell members that is a comparison of night and day.  Different dynamics have kicked in to the accession and integration negotiation.  The discussion and negotiation that the European Union would have with other countries may have changed but I do not believe they have slowed down or should slow down because of concerns that people would have regarding enlargement as an objective <i>per se</i>.  I continue to believe that it is as important as it has ever been.</p></speech>

This section amends section 33 of the 2004 Act which sets out the principles under which the HSE is obliged to deliver its service plan and gives the Minister the power to issue directions to the executive to take specific measures to implement the plan.<br />The Bill amends this section to achieve two objectives.  The first is to require the executive to implement the plan and manage the services within the net determination notified to it by the Minister.  The second objective is to reinforce the expenditure control mechanisms which will replace the system currently in place by virtue of the HSE having its own Vote.</p> <p>This has been achieved through the first charge principle.  Under this principle, if the HSE exceeds its budget in one year, that deficit is the first charge against the following year's approved budget.  If the HSE has a surplus, it will be allowed to carry over the surplus into the following year.  These changes are necessary because the HSE will no longer have its own Vote and therefore will not have the legal constraints that apply under the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1866 to 1998.  The new provisions impose expenditure control mechanisms.  Under section 34(<i>a</i>) of the Health Act 2004, as inserted by this Bill, the new provisions will also impose obligations on the director general to ensure the HSE operates within its budget.<br />I am bringing forward this amendment in the interests of proper governance and accountability.  The amendment provides that the HSE will only be allowed to carry over a surplus with the agreement of the Minister for Health and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The purpose of the amendment is twofold.  Its first purpose is to ensure that in managing its resources, the HSE has the incentive to balance its budget as far as is practicable.  The amendment ensures there is no automatic impetus within the system for the HSE to build up surpluses.  Given that the carryover of any surplus will require the agreement of two Ministers - the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform - the dynamics of the system will encourage the HSE to aim to achieve small surpluses in order to meet its obligations to work within the budget set by the Minister and the obligations imposed on the director general under the provisions set out in section 34(<i>a</i>), which I mentioned earlier.<br />The second purpose of this amendment is to ensure the legislative framework governing the health sector is in line with Ireland's commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact, which was strengthened and reformed by means of the EU legislation commonly known as the six-pack as adopted in November 2011.  One of the key additions to the pact was the introduction of the expenditure benchmark, which has the objective of limiting the growth in general Government expenditure to the medium-term potential growth rate of GDP.  Additional Government expenditure above the expenditure benchmark is allowed if it is adequately financed through matching revenue measures.  In order to ensure compliance with the benchmark process, the Government has set general Government expenditure ceilings and ministerial expenditure ceilings for the next three years.  These ceilings are defined in terms of gross expenditure; that is, all moneys that are supplied out of supply grants and appropriations-in-aid plus money paid out of the Social Insurance Fund and the national training fund.  The Government expenditure ceiling is calculated to be consistent with the expenditure benchmark.  The Government decided to underpin the principle of ministerial expenditure ceilings by putting the mechanism on a statutory basis in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013.<br />The purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to ensure the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has to give his or her final consent to any carryover of savings.  This will avoid any possible conflict with the 2013 Act and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's responsibilities in respect of setting ministerial expenditure ceilings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014050600003#B00200"><p>I have given careful consideration to this Bill.  I indicated on Second Stage that I saw the question of whether we had two allocations - one to the Department and one to the HSE - as a technicality.  This Bill seeks to create a single allocation and places the Minister in a pivotal role in relation to the subsequent reallocation across all the service needs.<br />I wish to set out the backdrop against which we are working.  I have calculated that by the end of this year, the amount of money that will be available for our health services will be &euro;4 billion less than the amount of money that was available in 2008.  That is a phenomenal figure.  Others might argue that the shortfall will be even greater.  My calculation is based on the most reasonable outworking.  The Minister has signalled that a further 2,600 staff will be removed from the health service during the course of this year.  That reduction will be on top of the reduction of 12,500 that has taken place since 2007.  That will make a total of 15,100.  I accept that I am open to correction with regard to some of the smaller numbers contained within the greater numbers.  That is the figure that has been cited time and time again when people have been talking about the reduced size of our health services by the end of the year.  The cuts in the amount of money available to deliver on people's health care needs and the number of staff available to ensure that delivery is safe and effective are phenomenal.<br />Under the HSE divisional plans for this year, it seems that hospitals are being expected to function as they did last year even though their budgets will have been reduced by &euro;200 million across the board.  I am particularly, but not solely, concerned about the impact this will have in the hospital context.  I am very worried about what we are witnessing.  The hospital issue is at the heart of the amendment proposed by the Minister.  The many struggling hospital sites in this country are already facing an average reduction of 4% in funding this year.  That is not small change on top of everything they have had to contend with.  I refer, for example, to the front-line care figures that have been indicated by the Minister.  The HSE has confirmed a projected decrease of 25,000 in the number of day cases this year.  It has said that the number of inpatient treatments will decrease by 3,000 during 2014.  These reductions will have a deleterious impact on access to health care over the course of the year.<br />I would like to give a little example of how unrealistic the national service plan and the divisional plans are.  One of the targets set in the plans involves reducing by 4% the delayed discharge of patients from acute hospitals, even though the allocation for nursing home beds has been reduced.  I contend that this will mean many more older people will have to remain in acute hospital settings for longer periods of time.  This will add to the significant problems that exist currently.  We cannot function without adequate nursing home provision and adequate numbers of step-down and rehab beds.  They are simply not available in sufficient numbers.  It has been signalled that the situation will get worse over the course of this year.<br />I have described this Bill as primarily a technical one.  Nevertheless, I am very concerned about section 10 of this Bill, as set out on page 7 and to which the Minister's amendment relates.  The clause that this amendment would immediately follow, which proposes the insertion of a new section 33(<i>b</i>)(3)(<i>a</i>) in the Health Act 2004, would mean that an overspend in any one year would be carried over to the following year as a charge on the budget of that entity, facility or hospital.  I think that is an horrific situation.  If Supplementary Estimates had not come on stream over the last few years, I cannot for the life of me imagine what it would have been like to try to sustain services at hospital sites where those involved have not been able to work within the very restrictive budgets that have been allocated.</p> <p>If, despite the best efforts of all concerned, an overspend is to be carried on into the next year&rsquo;s allocation, it will put hardship on top of hardship for front-line service providers and hospital managers, as well as having a serious impact on patient care and safety.  It is an absolutely horrific proposition and nightmare scenario that cannot be faced.  There are many other facts I could share.</p><p> It is a fantasy to suggest there could be a scenario of an underspend.  I cannot for the life of me imagine that could present at any of our hospital sites.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment seeks to write in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform into this process.  He or she, depending on who is in office at the time, will have a say-----</p></speech>

I always do, including the Minister's.

I have taken the time to go through it and, as always, try to find a way of improving it.  I cannot with this section and, accordingly, I oppose it and the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.  We are building a nightmare scenario if we allow overspends to pile up year on year, adding to the serious problems our hospital sites are already experiencing as a result of underprovision over recent years.  Will the Minister recognise that what is being provided for in this section will result in serious crises in the future?</p></speech>

I believe the Department of Health has taken a disproportionate number of cuts over the past six years when compared with other Departments.  It is important we examine how we can renew staff in the health system and the allocation of resources.  We are at a point in the health system where staff are not being renewed and a generation of health workers, such as speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists, are opting to go abroad.  I accept there was a need for a recruitment moratorium but health is a demand-led system.  Unlike Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I do not mind if we overspend on health.  To me it is about a service for those who require access to treatment and facilities.</p><p>  Why did we need a Supplementary Estimate for the Health Vote?  It was because people needed access to treatment and facilities.  I am concerned at how we can sustain services and, more important, how we can develop and grow resources with the patient at the centre.  I believe members of this committee will be up to examining the budget allocation for the health services.  The committee can examine how it can work this into its work programme.  It is time to recognise that health took a significant cut in its allocations for pay bills and funding.</p></speech>

Is there still scope for cutting back on the administrative side in health or is that a fallacious view?  I support the Chairman on the provision of front-line services.  Clearly, we need as many of them as possible.  We need to be concerned if we are losing front-line health professionals to other countries.</p></speech>

It is true we took &euro;23 million out of that budget but it was to create new and more innovative home care packages which will benefit a far greater number of people and keep them at home, which is where most people wish to be.</p><p>  I am hugely grateful to the tremendous work done which has led to the remarkable progress in our health services.  That is down to the men and women who work in our health services.  It is one of the few services that is 24-7 and is demand-led.  No health professional worth her or his salt would turn away a patient in need or acute distress.</p><p>  While we have had an 8% growth in population over the past six years, there has been a 20% reduction in the health budget and a 10% reduction in health staff.  It has been said elsewhere that the only place that has had greater cuts than this country has been Greece.  Our health service has not fallen over but, in fact, has improved.  It has not improved to where we would all like it to be but it has improved as evidenced by a 34% reduction in the number of people who had to endure long stays on hospital trolleys.  Up to 99% of inpatient treatments are carried out within eight months, which I accept is still too long.</p> <p>That 95% of outpatient appointments are now within a year is still far too long, but given that up to last year they were not even measured we can certainly thank the men and women working in our health service for extraordinary progress.</p><p> I have spoken about reforming our health service and we all know about the black hole which is supposed to be in health.  In opposition, I stated not another bob would be given until we found the black hole, and we have done so.  A total of &euro;4 billion is gone and there is no more black hole.  I would love somebody to show me where it is because it is not there, and the men and women who work in our health service also know it is not there.  We can only go so far and we stated that our reform plan has a number of stages.  We must make what we have as efficient as we can, after which we will continue the reform to break up the HSE from being a provider and procurer and create a split between procurer and provider.</p><p>  An integral part of ensuring we get the right outcomes is to have a national pricing office for health.  I met the German Minister in Greece last week to organise help from our German colleagues and we are very fortunate that a gentleman from there, who has Irish connections, is willing to come over because we need someone independent to set the price for procedures.  Otherwise, hospitals will accuse the Department of paying too little, the Department will accuse the hospitals of charging too much, the professionals will accuse both and each will accuse the other.  We need an honest broker and evidence-based pricing.  There is no doubt or question in my mind that we pay far too much for certain procedures.  Committee members will have heard me state this previously and I will not go into it all over again.</p><p> I am inclined to state enough is enough and that the health service can take no more.  It now needs time to continue its reform so it can become more efficient.  We have achieved a huge amount despite all of the challenges we faced and it is not fair to our staff to ask them to take even more cuts.  I stated in the HSE service plan that the priority of all priorities is patient safety and I will not preside over an unsafe system or health service as a Minister for Health, as a doctor or as a parent, and nobody in this room would either.</p><p> The moratorium was necessary to make certain achievements and it is not being implemented in an inflexible way.  It is being implemented in a manner which allows us to get the skill mix right.  Committee members will have heard me ask why in one hospital there are nine nurses per health care assistant and in another similar sized hospital there are 2.8 nurses per health care assistant.  There is clear room for change.  Other reforms which need to be introduced include expanding the roles of the various people who work in the health service.  In the Chairman's constituency of Cork, physiotherapists screen all of the orthopaedic referrals and can deal with 50% of the cases without the patient having to see the surgeon.  There is a host of measures we can take and we are taking them.</p><p> Deputy Dowds mentioned the scope to cut back on administration but I believe we are very near the end of this and there is not much scope left.  To be quite frank, we have cut approximately 16% centrally.  When people speak about administrators, they must remember it includes those who work on wards.  If there is no ward clerk, it will be far more expensive to pay nurses and doctors and it will not be cost effective.  We will keep examining the model of care and refining it, which is what any good system should do as it should be dynamic.  The clinical programmes have led the way in this, supported by the special delivery unit.  The problem with the HSE in the past was that we never managed to transpose excellence from one part of the system throughout the entire system.  The new hospital groups will be a huge part of addressing this because instead of dealing with 49 different hospitals, we will have six hospital groups for adults and the paediatric hospital group.  It will be much easier to get a message across and exchange information.  There is only so far we can go before we start to compromise patient safety and we are coming to this point.  I send a loud warning to those who would have us go further.</p><p> Last year, the Supplementary Estimate was relatively small at &euro;200 million out of a budget of &euro;13 billion.  To put this in context, and Mr. Smith will correct me if I am wrong, the daily spend is &euro;35 million so it was only four or five day's expenditure.  This is in a demand-led scheme.  This year alone, we have had a 33% rise in attendances with a huge rise in admissions.  These are sick people who need to be admitted.  Everybody knows how hard it is to get into hospital and those who are in hospital are ill.  We want to reduce the average length of stay and we have much more work to do in this regard.  We can certainly make much more progress.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was concerned about the section itself.  Section 10 is a critical control mechanism to replace the vote control in place at present.  There will be a charge against the HSE budget and it will be a matter for the HSE to allocate resources according to priorities.  I set the priorities in terms of the broad outline of the HSE service plan, but I am not involved in the day to day workings of the system or in operational matters as these must be left to those on the coalface.  I am very pleased the special delivery unit has managed to give a voice to those at the coalface and takes on board some of what they have to say.  They do not agree with all of them but what they do agree with, which make sense and is priced appropriately, is done.  Many more incentives will come into the system to help people on the front line shape the way they work because they deal with the problems day in day out and have the best understanding of them.</p></speech>

My concern is that section 10(b)(3)(a) provides that if the amount of net expenditure incurred by the executive in a financial year is greater than the amount determined by the Minister for that year, the executive shall charge the amount of such excess to its income and expenditure account for the next financial year.  The entities which have, by some language, overspent will be required, and there is no other way of doing this, to carry forward the burden.  We will pile up a problem year on year.  I can only imagine what the case would have been if we did not have the rescue packages of Supplementary Estimates over this past series of years and the burden was laid on each individual hospital site year on year, with the consequent reduction in its capacity to spend over a 12 month period.  What would the story be like at this point in time in May 2014?  It would be very serious.  We must examine how this will work its way out in practice beyond the adoption of this legislation.  I fear it will have serious implications in the short and medium term, and beyond, without correction and address.</p><p> With regard to the Minister's amendment, the idea that entities in the health services would underspend is fantastical.</p> <p>It is fantastical, the idea that entities within the health services would underspend.  I cannot identify where that might present in the current year.  A Minister for Health, of whatever hue, at Cabinet has enough of a battle to fight to try to protect the health services in the determination of its share of the overall Exchequer funding without having subsequently to allow the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have a further say on where there might be, in the most remote prospects, an underspend.  That is too much.  My real concern is with the section and what it is doing in terms of building up a big problem for us all in the future.</p></speech>

One cannot have a situation where those who do not make the effort to control their budgets are rewarded while those who make Herculean efforts get no reward, that is, the latter get no increase because they kept to their budget while those who did not bother to keep to their budgets get more money the following year and their base keeps rising.  We cannot have that situation.  Equally, there are better times ahead and we can see that.  Employment is going up, unemployment is falling and confidence is returning to the economy.  That will mean there will be less call on health, which is demand-led, in terms of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, into the future.  The ongoing reforms, particularly through the new GP contract - which is a whole new kettle of fish - place more emphasis on prevention and chronic-illness care in the community and should mean fewer hospital attendances and admissions.</p><p>  To give the committee some startling facts, 2,000 beds in our hospital system out of a total of 11,500 beds are occupied every night by people suffering from an alcohol-related illness or injury.  Countless tens of thousands of beds are occupied every year by people with cardiovascular, lung and other diseases caused by smoking.  I do not think it is unreasonable to look to the day when, if we can get the public health message across and educate our people on the dangers of alcohol and smoking and prevent our children from taking up smoking or abusing alcohol, there will be less need for major budgets for our health system.  I know that day may be some time off but it is coming.  </p><p>  Finally, decisions regarding the Supplementary Estimates are made by the Government as a whole; they are not made by the Minister.  Section 10 does not preclude the Government from making those decisions.  It is a standard provision which gives the Department of Finance the final say and that has always been the way.  I would prefer to have the final say but if each Minister had the final say the books might look a bit funny at the end of the year.  We all have to operate within budgets and the fight, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has said, is to make sure we get a proper budget that reflects the need to provide a safe service.</p></speech>

The Bill refers at a later stage to functions vested in the organisations which will be combined under the legislation but it is important that the functions are defined in the definitions section.</p></speech>

Prior to that year each individual Act which contained a reference to functions also contained a standard definition of functions.  This was repetitive and therefore a decision was made to include this definition along with many other standard definitions in a revised Interpretation Act.  The Interpretation Act definition of "functions" is found in Part 2 of the Schedule and includes "powers and duties, and references to the performance of functions include, with respect to powers and duties, references to the exercise of the powers and the carrying out of the duties".</p><p>  In any event the proposed amendment is problematic in that it refers to the Human Rights Commission Act, which will be repealed, and to the Employment Equality Act, the relevant parts of which will be repealed.  It does not refer to the Equal Status Act, but most importantly it does not refer to the Bill which we have before us.  Therefore, if we accepted the Deputy's amendment we would have a definition of functions which did not cover any of the very many functions being given to the human rights and equality commission under the Bill.  I am sure this is not what is intended.  I hope this explanation satisfies the Deputy and that the amendment will not be pressed.</p></speech>

There is a difference in the interpretation of the definition between the enforcement role of the human rights commission and I think the narrower interpretation should be confined to sections 36 to 39, inclusive, and section 41 to allow for as wide a role as possible for the work of the human rights commission as defined in Part 3 of the Bill.</p></speech>

The definition in section 2 gives the Commission a mandate to promote human rights in the widest sense, not limited to Irish law, or to conventions that we have ratified or to any existing international convention.  The Commission can seek to develop and promote new human rights standards and its discretion in that regard is unfettered.<br />The definitions in section 29 deal with legal and enforcement powers and accordingly it is appropriate that it refers exclusively to human rights that are recognised in Irish law.  I should mention that my departmental officials met with the Office of the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, ODHCHR, in October 2012 as part of the consultative process with that office, following publication of the general scheme of the Bill.  At that meeting the officials explained that the rationale of having two separate definitions was to give the new body every possible freedom to work towards the enhancement of the human rights environment in Ireland.<br />Were the legislation to include a single definition of human rights, there would be little option but to limit it to the narrower definition.  The model chosen for the legislation seeks to give the Commission the freedom to promote human rights on as broad a basis as possible and reflect new and normative developments at an international level in its work.  We are also giving it a mandate to monitor compliance with specific human rights standards enshrined in Ireland's legislative framework in accordance with the rule of law.  The intention was to allow the Commission to be creative in its promotion of human rights principles as broadly understood, but to observe the rule of law in the area of enforcement of standards.  The ODHCHR noted that this approach seemed very close to how the High Commissioner of Human Rights sought to describe her own role, relating to the protection of clearly defined rights and the promotion of broad human rights principles.  The ODHCHR states that the &quot;two definitions&quot; approach is a new best practice model, which it would encourage other member states to adopt.  We are going further than other member states in their comparative legislation.<br />On a philosophical level, this rationale for two definitions of human rights in the Bill turns on a key distinction between two conceptions of human rights and equality, the first being the broader conception is rooted in the law of human rights as it ought to be.  The IHREC can invoke principles of political morality to advocate what the law ought to be in the State.  Those principles may find expression in different sources including proposals advanced by international organisations or civil society groups.  The important thing is that the IHREC exercises its own independent critical reasoned principled judgment.  The intention of the Bill is to set in motion a potentially constructive dynamic to promote the development of creative human rights and equality thinking on new challenges in the field.  This conception of human rights and equality has the potential to take the State beyond the confines of the law as it is on the basis of a reasoned argument about what the law ought to be.  This wider conception of human rights would allow the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to act as an architect, coming up with plans to construct new human rights protections.<br />Second, the narrow conception of human rights serves a different function under the Bill.  Here the Irish human rights and equality commission is not an architect but a builder which applies existing standards.  It applies the law as it is, that is, as it has been planned and enacted by the legislative architect.  As a law-applier, it can use various powers to enforce the law and promote compliance.  It applies the law that actually exists.  This is important because the Bill cannot vest discretion in the IHREC to &quot;legislate&quot; novel obligations that have no basis in existing law, or to conduct enforcement actions that would involve the unfair retrospective application of <i>ad hoc</i>norms, which citizens have not been given fair notice of and which Deputies as members of our national Parliament have not legislated for.<br />However, the idea of human rights in the Bill does not restrict what the commission can do.  The Irish human rights and equality commission can seek to develop and promote new human rights concepts, it can encourage the State to sign and ratify specific international agreements but it cannot seek to enforce rights that have not been incorporate in Irish law.  <br />There have been calls for one unified definition of human rights in the Bill.  Human rights are of course indivisible and inviolable, but the technical devise of having two definitions does not challenge that principle in any way.  If we had to have just one definition, as I said earlier, it would have to be a narrow definition and be confined to Irish law and to those rights that are recognised under Irish law as human rights.  I think this would be a retrograde step and the commission would lose much of its ability to be creative in the promotion and advocacy of human rights.</p></speech>

The human rights commission cannot override the Constitution by effectively legislating for something that the Houses of the Oireachtas have not legislated for.  An international convention may give voice to or detail what are perceived to be new human rights that states are not obliged to sign up.  It would be open to the human rights commission to advocate that the State be a signatory and that domestic legislation be enacted to incorporate within domestic law those human rights.

The Government will, bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be further examined in this context.  The measures<br />brought forward would ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Irish Government will&mdash;(a) maintain and promote a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within the North of Ireland, and<br />(b) continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions in the island of Ireland.&rdquo;</blockquote>As I stated on Second Stage, there is considerable concern about the impact of the proposed amalgamation of the Irish human rights and equality commission in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Minister is aware of the opposition within Unionism to the human rights and equality agenda.  There is a responsibility on the Minister and the Government to ensure equivalence so that all citizens on the island of Ireland who voted for the Good Friday Agreement benefit from what it promised.  The proposed amalgamation is clearly not in line with that Agreement.  There is a human rights commission in the North, but this proposed new commission will not have the full range of powers in the North.  There is a view that this is about resources and cost savings.  It is certainly not about empowerment of the citizens.  When it comes to human rights and equality and the Good Friday Agreement, there needs to be equivalence across the island of Ireland.<br />This amendment reflects our core objection to the legislation.  If our concern is not addressed in the way we suggest we must oppose the Bill.</p></speech>

The intended effect of the amendments he is proposing is to bring the merger of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission to an end.  It will not surprise Deputies when I say that I am opposing these amendments.</p><p>  The text in amendment No. 3 is technically inappropriate for legislation.  If the Government were to take forward actions on the lines suggested, these would either be matters for policy and allocation of resources or otherwise issues that would need to be addressed in legislation.  One does not put into legislation that the Government should bring forward proposals that may require legislation.  Instead, one just gets on with implementing the policy programme of the Government of the day and, where this requires legislation, such legislation is brought forward in the ordinary course of events when it is ready.</p><p>  In this case we are merging the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  I consulted the then Northern Ireland Secretary of State at around the time this proposal was announced.  I assure the committee there are no adverse implications for our commitments under the Good Friday Agreement or for our relationship with Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The equivalence of protection relates to substantive human rights law and not to questions of institutional structures which will always operate differently in different jurisdictions.  Our body of human rights law, under our Constitution, is at least equivalent to that which exists in Northern Ireland.  The amendment proposed in that regard is devoid of substance.</p><p>  The merger will create a body that is, as I have said on previous occasions, greater than the sum of its parts and that will be better equipped by this Bill, once enacted, and with the additional staff and financial resources that I have been able to secure in 2014, to protect both human rights and equality rights in a cohesive way.</p></speech>

The intention of the amendment is to delete the words &quot;while respecting diversity and the freedom of each person&quot; from the subsection.  The reason for doing so is to save us from potential discrimination because it could hamper the work of the commission in terms of looking at discrimination issues that may arise.  For example, it could include the freedom to discriminate as part of &quot;the freedom and dignity&quot; of the persons involved.  If they felt that there was a freedom, the provision could be used as a defence, under the legislation, in terms of any investigation that takes place.  Therefore, the Bill will be strengthened by the removal of the provision.  The provision could be used as a defence in the case of a cultural issue, for example, within a certain community.  It would allow whatever practice being investigated to be continued even though it may not be acceptable to the wider community within the State.</p></speech>

I think that respect for diversity and respect for the freedom and dignity of each person is of fundamental importance to the work of a national human rights institution.  This is not, I can assure the Deputy and members of the committee, some kind of deep code for allowing certain types of discrimination or human rights abuses to continue.  I think that should be clear from the very strong functions we have vested in the commission, as well as from our substantive equality legislation and human rights protections.  Simply, it is language that recognises that we exist in a diverse and increasingly diverse society where acceptance of difference and of the rights and freedoms of other people is a cornerstone of the liberties and democracy we all enjoy.  As I frequently have said on other occasions in other contexts, we should celebrate difference and embrace it, not fear it.  This is a crucial and important point and is very relevant to this particular provision.</p><p>  I will, however, take a look again at the wording to see if these two important ideas might be expressed in a different way and, if so, I may bring a Report Stage amendment to this paragraph, arising out of the issues the Deputy has raised.  I suggest that the Deputy might agree perhaps to hold the amendment back for Report Stage where we can revisit the point.  I am certainly happy to reflect on it but I think the approach we are taking accords with the appropriate intent and principles that should be applied by a human rights institution.</p><p>  The Deputy made the point that it might allow certain individuals to behave in a particular way a majority does not necessarily applaud or approve of or a majority may fear.  On occasions, majorities fear difference and they fear people doing things differently or conducting their lives differently when in real terms their so doing poses no threat to the wider community.  If anything, while human rights is about protecting the wider community, it is also about protecting individuals and minorities within the global community to ensure that because they are different, they are not oppressed.  I think this particular principle sets that out well.  As I say, I am happy to reflect on it to see is there is some different phraseology.  I should say to the Deputy that this phraseology has been put together with great care based on advice from the Attorney General's office.   Having regard to what we are seeking to achieve, it would be quite odd if a body that is not merely a human rights commission but also an equality commission were to interpret this in a manner that would produce the consequences the Deputy suggested.</p></speech>

Given that the majority of cases under the Equality Acts and the Equality Tribunal are appealed to the Circuit Court, the amendment seeks to broaden the number of bodies or courts to which the commission can apply to have the <i>amicus curiae </i>provision recognised.  The amendment seeks to include the Equality Tribunal, the Labour Court, the District Court and the Circuit Court.</p></speech>

This is unnecessary.   The commission has the power to assist parties appearing before the Circuit or District Court, or the Labour Court, or the Equality Tribunal.  The concept of <i>amicus curiae</i>relates to the superior courts where issues of constitutional interpretation or importance may arise and it is not relevant to these other courts and tribunals.  For that reason, the amendment is opposed.</p></speech>

I cannot understand the reason this amendment was not ruled out of order as it actually imposes a charge on public bodies.  All public bodies should carry out a human rights assessment on new policies and programmes to ensure they comply with the human rights laws of the State.  It should be incumbent on all public bodies to reflect the ethos of human rights and should proof their policies and projects before they commence.</p></speech>

The commission will assist public bodies to comply with the positive duty, including by producing guidelines and codes of practice as outlined in section 31.</p><p>  With regard to the suggestion that section 42 should be amended to include an enforcement mechanism, I think this approach is misdirected.</p> <p>I have been asked why we cannot have an enforcement mechanism in a situation where a public body refuses to reflect human rights and equality duties in its strategic plan and annual report.  I remain to be convinced that we need a new enforcement regime or recourse to the courts here.  I think this recommendation downplays considerably the importance of our national Parliament.  Annual reports and strategic plans of public bodies are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That being so, the commission is well placed, once it has developed a good working relationship with Oireachtas committees, to address any such instances.  No Minister or indeed CEO would want to be in the position of explaining to the Oireachtas why a particular public body took a stand against complying with its statutory obligations.  For a CEO to be in here explaining why the body refused to reference its human rights and equality rights obligations in its strategic plan would be a very uncomfortable and unlikely position in which to put oneself.  Instead of focusing on thinking about taking a mechanistic, legal approach to compliance, it would be much more fruitful to see this provision as a positive opportunity to bring about real reform within the public sector by adopting the approach of active engagement successfully pursued by the Equality Authority in its workplace relations work with social partners.  There is potential to use the positive duty function to persuade and promote best practice by highlighting good examples to which other bodies could aspire.  </p><p> The working group that I established to advise me on practical issues relating to the merger recommended this specific approach to the creation of a positive duty on public bodies.  It went on to recommend that a formal review of the operation of this section be undertaken by Government in consultation with the human rights and equality commission after a period of three or five years.  I am happy that such a review should take place.  The review should assess the effectiveness of the public sector duty in securing improved human rights and equality outcomes and in assisting public bodies to pre-empt problems on an evidential basis.  The evidence could be gathered by way of an independent evaluation commissioned jointly by the Irish human rights and equality commission and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The review should also assess whether there is a need to modify or develop these recommended arrangements, including whether there is a need to institute a formal review and monitoring mechanism and the question of integration with other regulatory assessment procedures on the basis of the evidence.</p></speech>

I believe it is important to strengthen the positive duty to ensure that public bodies carry out human rights-proofing on their policies.  I believe this should be included in the legislation and will, therefore, be pressing the amendment</p></speech>

It seeks to insert a compelling rather than enforcement mechanism to ensure that public bodies comply with sections 42(1) and 42(2) of the Act.  It seeks to ensure that public bodies human rights-proof the work they carry out.</p></speech>

Such a process cannot substitute for the ongoing responsibility of any public body to manage its functions effectively or for the ultimate responsibility of the Government and this House in our democratic system to make political choices - sometimes hard choices - on the allocation of resources within the parameters required by considerations of prudence, Ireland's EU obligations, the budgetary decisions as between levels of expenditure and taxation and as between retention of income by those who earn it versus redistribution to those in need via the social welfare system and other measures of the democratically elected Government of the day and to the approval of the national Parliament.  The reality is that resources are limited and additional expenditure demands or costs arising, for whatever reason, would have to be paid for through expenditure reductions elsewhere or through the raising of additional revenue.  Nothing in this amendment can change that reality or be of any help to Government in making the difficult decisions that it was elected to make on behalf of the people as we work to restore our economic sovereignty.  I am opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge all of the assistance we have been given and the work undertaken by members of the new human rights commission and the Equality Authority and by those who were on the working group which assisted in the creation of this legislation and addressed various issues which we touched on today.  I wish to mention that I will be bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage to make the director the Accounting Officer for the commission's Vote.  This had already been agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as has the creation of a separate Vote for the commission which is important because that will make it clear how much money is being allocated to the human rights and equality commission annually, rather than it being subsumed within other allocations that go to the Department of Justice and Equality.  This amendment will further underpin the commission's independence.  I would also like to give formal notice that I may bring forward several other amendments.  There may be an amendment to section 10(1) following our debate on amendment No. 4 relating to paragraph (e) of that subsection.  In section 29 on page 22, "equality remuneration term" should read "equal remuneration term" but there is a typographical error.</p> <p>I will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to correct this.  I also thank the Irish Council for Civil Liberties for bringing to my attention this particular point.  The ICCL also has suggested that the title of Part 3 be changed from "Enforcement" to "Enforcement and Compliance", as better reflecting the substance of Part 3.  This also is a suggestion I will take on board on Report Stage.  While I am informed it does not need a formal amendment, I will take it on board.  Amendments also may be brought forward to sections 34 and 36 in respect of the periods of time referred to, following and subject to further consultation my Department is undertaking with the Equality Tribunal.  I am anxious to ensure that any concerns that have arisen in that context will be met.</p><p> I wished formally to put members on notice and again will conclude by thanking them.  I apologise to the Chairman for being late on the previous day.  I was meeting an individual with an issue, of whom some members are aware, who has experienced difficult and stressful circumstances in life..  It started later than anticipated because I was delayed in the House on a Topical Issue matter and I wished to give it as much time as was appropriate and not to cut it short.  I apologise for being late for that meeting and I thank the Chairman and members for agreeing to reschedule the meeting so rapidly to this afternoon.</p></speech>

The Clerk of the Seanad has supplied all organisations with a list of the key points from the various submissions which Members wish to discuss.<br />The format for today's meeting is as set out in the programme supplied to witnesses and Members.  The first three groups will each have a ten minute slot to be followed by a question and answer session for approximately 30 minutes.  Some groups propose to share their ten minute slot, so to be helpful, I will remind the first speaker when he or she has one minute remaining.<br />By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p> The first person I call to make a presentation is Dr. Liam Thornton.  He has approximately ten minutes and I shall remind him of his time at the nine minute mark.  I ask him to proceed and he is most welcome.</p></speech>

I am a lecturer in law at UCD Sutherland School of Law.  I thank the committee for inviting me here and giving me the opportunity to discuss Ireland's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the system of direct provision for asylum seekers in Ireland.<br />The UN Human Rights Committee has made clear, in its general comment No. 15 on the rights of aliens and general comment No. 31 on the nature of state obligations, that asylum seekers enjoy all the same rights under the ICCPR as nationals.  As members have had the benefit of my full submission I shall speak briefly on some of the points.  Before outlining some of my key concerns it might be useful if I briefly summarise what direct provision is for the committee.<br />Direct provision is the system utilised in Ireland to provide meals and accommodation to those seeking refugee status, subsidiary protection or leave to remain in Ireland.  Asylum seekers are only entitled to a direct provision allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child per week and the rates have remained the same since 2000.  Asylum seekers are legislatively prohibited from working on pain of criminal conviction and possible imprisonment.  Asylum seekers are entitled to a medical card.  Children of asylum seekers and asylum seeking children are entitled to education up to leaving certificate level.  There is no compulsion on asylum seekers to remain in direct provision accommodation but if they leave, their direct provision payments of &euro;19.10 or &euro;9.60 per week will be withdrawn.<br />The committee has asked me to look at the right to equality, the right to private and family life, the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment and the system of direct provision.  All human rights are interdependent and indivisible in nature.  A violation of economic, social or cultural rights can lead to violations of civil and political rights, in particular rights under the ICCPR.  Asylum seekers in Ireland live in a system of near cashlessness for years on end.  Generally, asylum seekers are unable to cook their own food or decide what children should have for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Children must share rooms with adult relatives.  The house rules provide accommodation centre managers with significant levels of control over everyday aspects of the lives of asylum seekers.  I argue that the level of social control that asylum seekers are subjected to goes beyond any other type of institution whose purpose is the social care of asylum seekers.<br />The numbers in direct provision and the length of time people remain in direct provision continues to be a matter of concern.  Over 86% of all asylum seekers have been in direct provision for 12 months or longer, over 15% of all individuals in direct provision have been there for over seven years, 43% of individuals in direct provision have been in such accommodation for five years.  Some 1,666 people, or just over 38% of all those in direct provision centres, are children.  I ask the committee members to consider the extent to which prolonged cashlessness, coupled with significant intrusion in private and family life, could be seen as significant violations of the right to equality, the right to respect for private and family life and inhuman and degrading treatment under the ICCPR.  I must also point out that there is no legislative basis for direct provision, rather it is run on an administrative basis.  From freedom of information documentation that I have had access to I am concerned that the system does not comply with the rule of law.<br />The human rights committee is responsible for assessing Ireland's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It will also be aware of Ireland's other obligations, in particular under the international Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made clear in general comment No. 19 on the right to social security which states: &quot;asylum-seekers, and other disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups, should enjoy equal treatment in access to non-contributory social security schemes&quot;.  There are now more people in direct provision in Ireland than in prison here.  The system of direct provision is inhuman and degrading and violates the right to private and family life.  Any system that replaces direct provision must ensure that human dignity and human rights are of central importance and that the rights of all of those who seek asylum are respected, protected and vindicated.<br /><b></b>The final point that I shall address is the complaints mechanism.  The human rights committee has raised issues with the mechanism in its list of issues.  The complaints mechanism in place lack independence and there is no form of independent review or oversight of this internal complaints mechanism.  Part 4 of the house rules and procedures for asylum seekers in direct provision outlines the complaints procedure in place, and also issues relating to standards of the accommodation that asylum seekers can expect and what the appropriate behaviour of residents should be.<br />The Government has insisted that the internal complaints mechanism is adequate.  Due to sustained media coverage, inspection reports for direct provision accommodation centres have been released for all to access.   Despite recommendations by Dr Geoffrey Shannon, the Free Legal Advice Centres, the Irish Refugee Council, NASC, the Irish Immigrant Support Centre that is based in Cork, that HIQA be responsible for independent inspections and complaints mechanisms, they have not been followed.  A transparent complaints mechanism, independent of the Reception and Integration Agency, needs to be established.  The issue has been highlighted in the list of issues and is something that the State needs to be aware of and have a response to for the human rights committee.<br />In summation, I believe that the system of direct provision violates a number of core rights, in particular the right to private and family life.  I believe, in certain circumstances, the standard of accommodation and longevity of an asylum seeker's stay in direct provision could potentially be inhuman and degrading.  Also, it fundamentally violates the right to equality under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  That is my core message that I ask the committee to consider.  I am happy to answer any questions members have on direct provision and Ireland's obligations under the ICCPR. </p></speech>

I am joined by the acting chief executive officer of the Irish Human Rights Commission, Mr. Des Hogan.  Both of us are happy to take questions, at the appropriate time, following a few short introductory remarks.</p><p>  The opportunity to speak to the committee is timely as the draft legislation to merge the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority into the new Irish human rights and equality commission is before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In our observations on the draft legislation we called for a strong liaison with the Oireachtas to be a concrete feature of the legislation.  I shall outline why such a move is important.</p><p>   The new Irish human rights and equality commission, as the independent statutory body charged with promoting and protecting human rights and equality, is a natural partner for the Oireachtas in supporting the role of Members a legislators.  In addition, it can act as a check and balance on the Executive and its power.  This derives from a range of functions which we carry out from public engagement, development, education and training, litigation and compliance to our research policy and practice work.  </p> <p> One of our functions is to engage regularly with the Oireachtas by commenting on draft legislation from an equality and human rights perspective and this has been a feature of both the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority's work to date.</p><p> Currently, the Irish Human Rights Commission is recognised by the UN as Ireland's national human rights institution with "A" status under the UN Paris Principles, bridging the international and national human rights framework recognised by the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union as a key actor.  It is important that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, Bill 2014 and the budget and resourcing that underpins it ensures that the new commission continues to receive this recognition.  This is equally so under EU law in so far as the Equality Authority is Ireland's specialised body under EU equality directives.</p><p> As the committee may be aware, the Irish Human Rights Commission, as Ireland's national human rights institution, is entitled, and indeed expected, to provide a shadow report under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and will appear before the Human Rights Committee in Geneva in July of this year.  Our shadow report is not yet finalised and I am speaking today about our structural role rather than about the content of our concerns on the State's compliance, although we can address some of those questions, if necessary, in the question and answer session.</p><p> The committee will be aware that in 2008 Ireland was criticised by the Human Rights Committee for not properly resourcing the Irish Human Rights Commission and it recommended that the State should strengthen the independence and capacity of the Irish Human Rights Commission to fulfil its mandate effectively under the UN Paris Principles.  It is important that in this current review in July the State can unequivocally demonstrate its support for the new human rights and equality infrastructure in the State.</p><p> In this regard there are some elements of the draft legislation which we hope can be improved on by the Seanad during its passage through the Oireachtas - we are aware it is currently before the Seanad.  While a strong commitment to the proper funding of the body in the years to come will be important, when we consider how co-operation between the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Oireachtas can improve we need to consider what has worked and what has not worked, and how the statutory body responsible for equality and human rights can assist the Senators, as parliamentarians, in upholding human rights and holding the Executive to account.  Here we are fortunate in so far as it is increasingly recognised, under a number of international benchmarks, in particular the UN Paris Principles, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, PACE, and the Belgrade Principles, and the upcoming report of PACE through the work of their colleague on the committee, Senator Katherine Zappone, that parliaments and the NHRIs must work together if we, as a society, are to properly uphold the rule of law and human rights and equality standards.</p><p> For our part, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is keen to build stronger links with the Oireachtas.  We have recommended that on the parliamentary side a dedicated committee be established to examine equality and human rights matters with structural linkages to other committees.  We have also recommended that section 23 of the IHREC Bill should be strengthened to add references to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission regularly meeting with parliamentary committees under procedures to be agreed and to promote law and practice relating to the protection of equality and human rights by respecting the independence of the commission and noting any capacity constraints.  One other area we can offer to parliamentarians is in training to State bodies and parliamentarians on human rights and equality.</p><p> I am happy to take questions.  Dr. Hogan and I are at the committee's disposal.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Malone" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600004#C00500"><p>I am the executive director of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  I have been asked to comment on the State's reply to the Human Rights Committee list of issues that it is &quot;not possible&quot; to remove the reservation on Article 10(2) of the ICCPR and on the implications of such inaction for younger persons on remand or in detention.  As Senators will be aware, Article 10(2) contains two important provisions.  It is about the segregation of the accused from the convicted and about the separation of juveniles from adults.<br />It is important to look at why we have this principle and why it is so important to separate juveniles from adults because that goes some way to eliminating the implications of inaction when it comes to this article.  The first point is the nature of children's needs.  Children are different.  The general comment of the Committee on the Rights of the Child states:<blockquote>Children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development, and their emotional and educational needs.  Such differences constitute the basis for the lesser culpability of children in conflict with the law.  These and other differences are the reasons for a separate juvenile justice system and require a different treatment for children.</blockquote>The second issue is protection from harm.  Children are particularly vulnerable and it is for that reason that the European Prison Rules provide that, &quot;young prisoners shall be detained under conditions which as far as possible protect them from harmful influences and which take account of the needs peculiar to their age&quot;.  Indeed, the Committee on the Prevention of Torture has also found that: &quot;regardless of the reason for which they may have been deprived of their liberty - juveniles are inherently more vulnerable than adults.  In consequence, particular vigilance is required to ensure that their physical and mental well-being is adequately protected&quot;, and further: &quot;to accommodate juveniles and unrelated adults together inevitably brings with it the possibility of domination and exploitation&quot;.<br />The third reason for separation of juveniles and adults is the potential criminogenic effect, and also the fact that children are particularly amenable to rehabilitative treatment, and segregation from adults provides the optimum situation to rehabilitate and, ultimately, for children to reintegrate successfully.<br />It can be stated why it is so important to separate the accused from the convicted.  It is a founding principle of the criminal justice system that one is seen and treated as innocent until proven guilty.  That principle is recognised in the different regimes in place for both convicted and unconvicted criminals, and it goes without saying that children on demand should never be housed with those who have been convicted under sentence.<br />Having looked at why this article is so important, the next matter is to look at what has been Ireland's position in regard to the article.  Ireland's reservation to the article was entered in 1989.  We are one of only 15 state parties out of 168 who have entered a reservation in respect of Article 10.  The wording of Ireland's reservation is important.  What Ireland stated was:<blockquote>Ireland accepts the principles referred to in paragraph 2 of article 10 and implements them as far as practically possible.  It reserves the right to regard full implementation of these principles as objectives to be achieved progressively.</blockquote>Ireland stated categorically that the value and validity of those principles is not in question.  The only reservation Ireland entered is the pace at which such change can be achieved.  That was in 1989.  In 2014, there are still children detained in Wheatfield, albeit in specialised units.  It is an adult prison.  There are two remand prisoners remaining in St. Patrick's Institution, an institution which has been described in the past as an obscenity.<br />Looking at the list of issues for the fourth periodic review, the Human Rights Committee asked the State to clarify whether it will review the reservation and, if not, indicate why and identify the remaining obstacles.  In Ireland's reply, while the State confirmed that all reservations are kept under review and it remains committed to the implementation, it reiterated that it is &quot;not possible&quot; to withdraw the reservation but, unfortunately, it did not provide a statement of the obstacles to the withdrawal of that reservation.<br />I have been asked to consider the impossibility of the withdrawal of the reservation.  There are two points to make in regard to that.  It goes without saying, and Senators will be aware, that legally, it is, of course, possible to remove any reservation from an international treaty.  It is provided for in Article 22.  Indeed, Ireland has withdrawn other reservations.<br />The second, and more important, issue is whether Ireland can realistically meet the requirements of Article 10.  It is also clear that with ongoing political will and adequate resources it is certainly possible to meet them.  We know it is possible because after many years of campaigning from organisations such as the Children's Rights Alliance and the IPRT, we are well on our way to doing so.  There has been capital investment in Oberstown and an important decision to close St. Patrick's Institution.  That was a significant step towards guaranteeing the separation of juveniles and adults.  Equally, there has been some movement in the separation of remand and convicted prisoners.</p> <p>Although a significant minority continue to be kept in non-segregated facilities, the majority of remand prisoners are confined to segregated facilities in two prison sites.</p><p> Our submission is that it is both legally and practically possible.  I make the point that when one considers fundamental human rights principles and when one talks about what is possible or impossible, it is rarely a reflection of true capacity.  The difference between possible and impossible often is really a product of political will, of the availability of resources and of the decision to allocate resources to those who are considered to be the most deserving and the most important.  I noted that in the very beginning of the just-published national policy document for children, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, Nelson Mandela was quoted.  It repeated his statement "there can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children".  My point is that to maintain the reservation in effect provides an open-ended timetable to the State regarding the fulfilment of these principles.  If there can be no greater revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children, the maintenance of this reservation to a key human rights provision, which is not only about children but about children who are imprisoned - the most vulnerable in society - this is not at all a positive reflection on Ireland.  While it should be frankly acknowledged that much progress has been made in this area, we are not there yet.  Consequently, the position is still that the formal withdrawal of this reservation would demonstrate concrete commitment to ending this practice of combining juveniles and adults together.  Moreover, it would ensure the continuing progress in the protection of fundamental human rights for the juveniles in the criminal justice system.</p></speech>

At this point, a question raised by Senator Cummins remains outstanding.  Having mulled over in his mind what I am sure is an appropriate answer for him, I will allow Dr. Thornton to respond first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.395" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Liam Thornton" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600005#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and thank Senator Cummins for the question.  There has been some progress.  At one point, more than 8,000 people were in direct provision centres, while at present, slightly more than 4,000 people are in these centres.  There were approximately 6,000 people in 2010, which has now fallen to 4,000.  The main mechanism to ensure that people do not have a prolonged stay within direct provision centres is an excellent process to determine whether a person is entitled to refugee subsidiary protection or some other leave to remain.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has been attempting to bring into force the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which hopefully will ensure that the time spent in direct provision centres will be as minimal as possible.  Even allowing for that, there still are significant questions and concerns regarding the warehousing of individuals applying for protection within one centre for many months and years on end in circumstances in which family life cannot be enjoyed, where parents cannot determine what food their children will eat or at what time they will eat it and where children may not have school friends over.  The key process needed is a reform to a more rights-based status determination process.</p><p>  However, I believe this must be coupled with a system that respects the fundamental rights of asylum seekers.  As to whether there is anything in place that can make reference to best practice, I refer to the European Union's recast reception conditions directive, which is not applicable on the State.  It provides asylum seekers with a right to work, if a decision has not been reached in the first instance on an asylum decision, within six months.  It also provides certain other rights that asylum seekers currently do not have in Ireland.  I also welcome the Senator's comments on HIQA, if there is anything to those comments that I can add.</p></speech>

Ms Malone spoke of the separation of prisoners and the IPRT is particularly concerned by the number of children who are in Wheatfield Prison.  I must confess that I am not familiar with the different prisons but does the trust require the State to go on a prison-building campaign?  Is there not different segregation within prisons anyway to take care of the different categories of prisoners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Malone" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600005#D00500"><p>The first point to make is our position always is that prison always should be a last resort.  Moreover, penal expansion has not proved itself to be particularly effective where that policy has been pursued.  It is quite clear that it always assists, when one is in a position in which prisons are needed, to have an allocated prison for remand prisoners who have not yet been convicted.  As for children, however, it has been shown time and time again, through research of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and others, that for children the focus must be on a therapeutic environment.  The plans for Oberstown potentially will go a long way towards achieving that.  When the plans for Oberstown were revealed, it was hoped this would be a real opportunity to provide a state-of-the-art facility for children where the focus was on therapy, education and rehabilitation.  The key point is that children are very different from adults and require substantially more support.  Hopefully, Oberstown will achieve this but at present, children still are being detained in Wheatfield, which is an adult prison.  While it is correct to state that this is in a dedicated unit within Wheatfield, none the less the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, has made a clear point that it simply is not appropriate for children to be detained in an adult institution, albeit within a specialised unit.  We want all children to be detained in an appropriate therapeutic facility.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, however, our society has more and more juvenile criminals who aim to become gangsters and who are following on lines no one would wish them to follow.  While I accept what Ms Malone is saying, I refer to children of different ages.  Where should children be, other than in Wheatfield?  Should they be in Oberstown?</p></speech>

In fact, it was necessary to reduce the provision at Oberstown because there was not as much need as had been expected.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust hopes this will continue, that is, where alternatives to imprisonment are used, where imprisonment is used as a last resort and where diversion is used.  The latter in fact is the answer because as far as I can see, it does no one any good to end up in the criminal justice system.  The answer is to deal with the issues as they arise.  Prevention and early intervention is the most cost effective and successful way to ensure that children stay outside the criminal justice system and achieve as much as they can and contribute to society.</p></speech>

With this report, members of the Council of Europe Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination are trying to add value to this treaty body process as lawmakers.  It is new territory for them to an extent and they are delighted to have the witnesses help them with that issue, as they try to think about what are some of the things they wish to say to the United Nations Human Rights Committee about what is the most urgent priority, in terms of response to the Government's report on these issues.</p> <p> I have two questions for Dr. Thornton.  He ended his contribution by calling for the advocacy of an independent complaints mechanism in regard to the direct provision process.  I note, as he did, that the Government in its response to the issue of an independent complaints mechanism, which was raised by the UN Human Rights Committee, stated that in the Reception and Integration Agency's view there is no clear model that is being cited as to what an independent complaints mechanism would look like and, consequently, from reading further on what the Government said, effectively, it is not going to proceed on that matter.  I want to hear what Dr. Thornton has to say in that regard.</p><p> My second question is in terms of Dr. Thornton's more general report, and he referred to this in his presentation, where he argues that the direct provision system that is in place is legally suspect.  Could he say a little more about that, as that is a strong statement and accusation to make?</p></speech>

I thank the three speakers for their contributions which were very interesting.  I totally agree with Ms Deirdre Malone that prison should be a last resort, but it is a fact that it is necessary from time to time for people who are classified as children to be detained for their own and for society's protection.  That said, I agree that should not be in a normal prison.  While I welcome the provision of the new facilities in Oberstown, I would like the capacity of the facilities to match the need, which is not the case at present.  Young people should not find themselves in an adult prison.  Anybody who has occasion to visit a prison knows what a traumatic effect it has on people visiting a prison and one can imagine the effect it has on a person who finds himself or herself incarcerated there.  Hopefully, we will never find that out.</p><p>  Under Article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, does Dr. Thornton believe that aliens have the same rights as residents and citizens?  Could he enlighten us as to how many people currently are in the direct provision system and what that costs the State in monetary terms?  I thank the delegates for their contributions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Liam Thornton" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600006#E00700"><p>I thank the members of the committee for their questions.  First, in regard to Senator Zappone's question on having an independent complaints mechanism, several groups have said that the Health Information and Quality Authority could be the body that would address complaints asylum seekers may have about the quality of accommodation, food or the behaviour of managers at accommodation centres.  The structure is in place that would permit HIQA to investigate those types of complaints.  It should be done independently of the Reception and Integration Agency because, as Senator Zappone noted, the Government's reply to the list of issues seems to have discounted any possibility of any independent oversight mechanism for complaints within the direct provision system.  I imagine the UN Human Rights Committee, by placing this matter on its list of issues, may be very concerned that if an independent complaints mechanism is not in place, a variety of rights under the ICCPR could be violated, such as issues related to access to justice and a fair hearing, and that may impact substantively on the rights to private and family life.  Conditions may also be inhuman and degrading and go against the right to equality.<br />I mentioned in my full report that the direct provision system is legally suspect.  I must be careful as there is a case before the High Court on the constitutionality of the direct provision system.  Therefore, I will speak in general terms and not with reference to anything that is going on at present.  Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, as amended, prohibits asylum seekers from being habitually resident.  Therefore, they are not entitled to any social welfare payments except for emergency needs payments.  From freedom of information documentation to which I had access, in 2006 and 2007, the then Secretary General of what was then the Department of Social and Family Affairs stated in a letter that the payment of &euro;19.10 per week to asylum seekers was <i>ultra vires</i>- outside the powers - of what is now the Department of Social Protection.  That letter was sent to the then Secretary General of the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who refuted that allegation, but the Secretary General of what was then the Department of Social Family Affairs stated there was no grounds for paying the &euro;19.10 per week because asylum seekers had been prohibited by the Oireachtas from being entitled to any welfare payments whatsoever.  It is on that basis I make to charge that the system of direct provision is legally suspect, that payments are being made without any legal authority by the Department of the Social Protection.<br />Senator Wilson mentioned the costs of the system.  Speaking from memory, I believe the cost of direct provision accommodation last year or possibly in 2012 was &euro;62 million.  I do not have a recent figure for the amount paid in direct provision allowance but I have seen figures from 2007, 2008 and 2009 that were in or about &euro;3 million, if my memory serves me correctly.<br />Regarding Senator Wilson's second question, the UN Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 15 on the rights of aliens and its general comment No. 31 on nature of state obligations, stated quite categorically that asylum seekers enjoy all rights under the ICCPR as nationals.</p></speech>

I recall at the time that there was a strong squeeze put on the then Government to provide services and there were queues in Dublin to access services.  What progress has been made since the late 1990s or in the last decade to provide better facilities in terms of accommodation and resources to deal with asylum seekers?  We have a history in Ireland of our people emigrating all over the world, but when there was a sea-change in the mid-1990s of people migrating here, we were not prepared for it and we found it difficult to deal with and to accept.  Can Dr. Thornton elaborate briefly on the progress that has been made?  Obviously, significant progress has been made but there is still a long way to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.422" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Liam Thornton" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600006#E00900"><p>As I mentioned, direct provision is 14 years old last month, having been introduced formally in April 2000.  As the Chairman mentioned, that was in response to a perceived large number of people claiming asylum and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stating what his European Union partners were telling him, that he would have to act and would have to ensure asylum seekers did not have any access to the welfare state.  That was coupled with significant pressure on housing in the country, which is also occurring as we speak.</p> <p>There was significant pressure on housing when the direct provision system was introduced.  There were approximately 10,000 asylum applications in 2000 but the figure for last year was fewer than 1,000.  It is somewhat understandable why the system developed as it did.  Over the 14 year period since 2000, the weekly payments of &euro;19.10, and &euro;9.60 in respect of children, have not changed.  For 14 years, there has been no change to the rate of payment for those who seek asylum under the direct provision system.</p><p> I must give credit where credit is due in that some progress has been made on facilities.  Generally, no asylum seeker will be without a roof over his or her head.  However, I wonder what the quality of accommodation and the standard of living made available, such as being forced to eat in a canteen every day, might do to individuals' mental health.  I know one individual who has been in direct provision for almost ten years.  Dr. Carol Coulter, in her family law review project, pointed out that the Child and Family Agency has had to become involved in a number of cases.  Mothers, in particular, are suffering significant mental health problems partly due to what they suffered in their countries of origin but also due to the isolation and desolation they experience in direct provision.  While it is positive that people have roofs over their heads we must examine the extent to which these provisions meet our obligations under the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p></speech>

We have not yet even achieved that baseline, however.  The Children's Rights Alliance has argued that we should examine closely the frequency with which we place children on remand.  When we use the world "remand" we sometimes forget this means that a child who has not been convicted of any crime is separated from family, school and friends while awaiting a trial.  He or she will be experiencing all the difficulties one inevitably experiences when one is detained.  Our first aspiration should be to meet the basic standard because were are not even at that point.  The second aspiration is to examine the frequency with which we are using remand and whether we are using it for the right reasons.  Are we using remand as a welfare alternative or only where it is absolutely necessary?  We need to investigate how necessary it is in the context of particular cases.</p></speech>

I suggest that the current and previous Governments have put considerable effort into developing the juvenile justice system.

We acknowledge that significant progress has been made in the last several years.  The decision to close St. Patrick's represented a huge step forward which we welcome warmly.  However, we must recall that the initial recommendation to close St. Patrick's was made by the Whitaker report of the 1980s.  We have had plenty of time to move forward and, while I welcome the progress that has been made, we are not yet there.</p></speech>

I note from the report by the Children's Rights Alliance that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has stated it will consider withdrawing the reservation following the transfer of all 17 year olds to Oberstown in the third quarter of 2014.  Clearly it is important that we do not remove a reservation without taking the practical steps to fulfil our obligation but maintaining the reservation indefinitely provides a timetable with no end in terms of meeting the obligations under the article.  It is now time, 24 years later, to bring it to an end.</p></speech>

The UN Human Rights Committee has given concluding observations on Ireland in 2008 and a list of issues last year.  The Government has given its response and the question arises of whether it meets all of the committee's concerns.  This is because Ireland has signed and ratified the ICCPR, one of the founding international treaties to which most states have signed up.  These are real questions and it would be interesting for us to learn the nature of Senators' interaction with the Executive in terms of the delegation that will go to Geneva, what it will bring there and what it will bring back.</p><p>   On the question of the commission, as the acting chairperson, Mr. Joyce, has noted, we are Ireland's A status human rights institution and we hope that when we are up for re-accreditation in over the next we will retain that status subsequent to our merger with our colleagues in the Equality Authority.  We have highlighted section 23 of the Bill in regard to proper resourcing of the commission.  This was a concern expressed by the UN Human Rights Committee in 2008 and the State will have to show how it is meeting that commitment.  There are two ways of meeting a commitment of this nature.  One could provide adequate on a year-on-year basis, underpinned by protocols or legislation.  We accept that it is not possible to set out the budget one wants in legislation but we have asked that the Bill be strengthened slightly so that it is reasonable.</p> <p>If it is subject to two Ministers having a kind of subjective view on what is reasonable and what is not, one may go in the direction of what we had in the past, namely, the budget cuts which are difficult to oppose when one is administratively linked to the Department imposing the cut and something which is not, in terms of best practice, in the Belgrade Principles and the UN Paris Principles.  From our perspective, we have very much welcomed the increase in budget we received this year.  The question will be whether that can be sustained.  Also, as we are going through a process of merger and amalgamation, by definition, we are not able to give the outputs we normally do in a normal budgeting year.  Our staff is much reduced so we would not be able to meet the pay and non-pay sides in this particular given year.  That should not be the baseline for future years but it should be a reasonable, stated and argued case which has the backing of Parliament so that we are either Ireland's A status national human rights institution or we are not.  That is the question and the one the UN will ask us over the next few months as well.</p></speech>

Dr. Hogan posed a question for us.  I suppose what we are doing - members may support me in this view - is shining a light on the issues.  We are not here to take on the Government.  We will present our report, which we hope to conclude in two or three weeks, to the Government following the work we are doing and the witnesses' submissions.  We hope the Government will take cognisance of the views expressed and that when it responds, some of the work we have done will be helpful to it.  That is the tenet of our work, namely, to shine a light.  When we issue our report, it will be sent to Government and it will be helpful rather than confrontational.  I thank Dr. Hogan.  If he wishes to stay for the next session, he is quite welcome to do so.</p><p>  We will now move on to the next session in our public hearing.  I welcome Ms Brigid Quilligan and Ms Susan Fay from the Irish Traveller Movement.  We will allow ten minutes for their submission.  We have already received their written submission, which has been studied and dealt with.  It is just a question of highlighting the issues they would like to emphasise and synopsise for the committee so we can move them forward.  There will be questions and answers following the submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brigid Quilligan" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600008#G00300"><p>I thank the committee for taking the initiative to hold these hearings and, in particular, for inviting the Irish Traveller Movement to discuss the issue of the State's failure to recognise Travellers as an ethnic group and the implications in the context of the State's compliance or otherwise with the ICCPR.</p> <p>I am a Minceir Beoir or Traveller woman from Killarney and I am the director of the Irish Traveller Movement.  The Irish Traveller Movement is a national membership organisation representing Travellers and Traveller organisation.  It was founded in 1990.  One of our core principles and one of the issues on which we were founded is to challenge the racism that we, as Travellers, face in Ireland and to promote integration and equality in Irish society.  One of the means by which it is necessary to achieve our objectives is for the State to formally recognise my people's distinct ethnicity.<br />Our presentation is divided into five broad sections: we will examine the relevant concluding observations of the UN Human Rights Committee under the ICCPR in 2008; we will examine the status of Irish Travellers in the British Isles; we will note the comments of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the State's failure to recognise my community's ethnicity; the managing solicitor of the Irish Traveller Movement, Susan Fay, will discuss the difficulties that she has encountered as a direct result of ethnicity denial; and we will examine recent developments, namely, the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence recommendation that my people be recognised as an ethnic minority group.<br />The first aspect I propose to examine relates to the concluding observations of the UN Human Rights Committee of Ireland's compliance under the ICCPR in 2008.  The committee stated that, &quot;The State party should take steps to recognize Travellers as an ethnic minority group.&quot;  Despite the 2008 recommendation of the committee the State continues its denial of my ethnicity.  Four years' later, in 2012, paragraph 793 of the fourth periodic report on Ireland's compliance under the ICCPR, states, &quot;Irish Travellers do not constitute a distinct group from the population as a whole, in terms of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.&quot;  The State provides no rationale for this assertion.  Flat denial of ethnicity is not consistent with the ICCPR.  It runs contrary to Article 27 of the ICCPR which sets out that in determining whether an ethnic minority exists objective criteria should be used.  <br />The second implication involves a situation of Travellers across the British Isles and the inconsistency of our ethnicity recognition.  It is widely accepted that my community satisfies the standard legal and sociological criteria for recognition as an ethnic group and it is recognised as such by the British and Northern Irish authorities, as being separate from non-Traveller Irish people.  The State's two statutory human rights and equality bodies, the soon to be merged Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority, have analysed the sociological and legal criteria and both have consistently concluded that we are an ethnic group and should be recognised as such.<br />The implications of the failure of the State to recognise us as an ethnic group is highlighted by the ridiculous situation whereby if I take the Enterprise train to Belfast and I pass through Dundalk, I am not a member of an ethnic group but then minutes later when the train pulls into Newry, I am.  This ridiculous situation also highlights the fact that denial of ethnicity runs contrary to the principles of equivalence contained in the Good Friday Agreement.<br />The Irish Government has never satisfied the burden of proof in its failure to recognise my community's right to self-identity or to identify it as an ethnic minority group.  This ongoing denial of an indigenous ethnic minority creates key challenges for the State's international reputation and seriously undermines its position as a member of the UN Human Rights Council.<br />As set out in our written submission, the Irish Traveller Movement's concerns in October 2012 were noted by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Pillay.  The chief of the indigenous and minority section of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, responded in writing to our concerns.  Her comments are worthy of inclusion on the record of this House.  She states:<blockquote>While there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a minority under international law, there are certain criteria that should be taken into account when discussing this issue, including the self-identification of people belonging to a specific group such as the Irish Travellers.  At the same time it is important to note that an existence of a minority is a matter of fact, not of law, as it was affirmed already in 1930 in the Greco-Bulgarian communities case before the Permanent Court of Justice.  Furthermore, the applicability of Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, inspired by this article, is not subject to official recognition of a minority by a state.  The official recognition by a state of a minority group, however, can be instrumental in securing all human rights to its members.  It can also contribute to the stability of a state.  OHCHR supports all efforts that would result in a higher protection of the human rights of Irish Travellers in Ireland and wider.</blockquote>I will ask the managing solicitor of the Irish Traveller Movement, Susan Fay, to outline some of her experiences in advising clients on their legal rights and the difficulties she faces with regard to ethnicity denial.</p></speech>

As part of my role in the Irish Traveller Movement law centre and in the ICCL steering group which is examining Ireland's compliance or otherwise with the ICCPR, it is wonderful to see the Seanad taking leadership in this matter.<br />I will speak as a solicitor in the Irish Traveller Movement law centre, about the advice I give people and the issues created as a result of the failure on the part of the State to recognise Travellers as an ethnic minority group.  Following on from what was set out in the written submission, ethnicity denial effectively creates, ironically, a two-tier equality system.  This means that in reality, there are ethnic and racial groups who are automatically protected by international human rights and equality directives and then there are ethnic groups such as the Irish Traveller community which are not protected.  This was clearly demonstrated by the fact that Travellers were not included in the Bill that became the Equal Status Act 2000.  As a result of significant lobbying on the part of the Irish Traveller Movement and other NGOs, Travellers were included but initially they were excluded from that legislation.  Similarly, Travellers were not included in the first incitement to hatred Bill 1989 but as a result of lobbying, Travellers were subsequently included.  Significant resources were used by NGOs in ensuring that Travellers were included in that legislation when, in our opinion, Travellers should be automatically included in human rights and equality legislation.<br />The failure to recognise Travellers as an ethnic minority group, despite the fact that it is widely accepted that Travellers are a <i>de facto</i>ethnic minority group, renders Travellers' human rights and equality as prescribed by international treaties subject to domestic political whim.  If history has taught us anything, it has taught us that such a position is dangerous and inconsistent with good human rights practice.<br />I note in the State's 2012 report under ICCPR at paragraph 794 that the State attempts to justify ethnicity denial by pointing to the fact that membership of the Traveller community is already considered a separate ground for the purposes of equality legislation.  It is worth noting that in the law centre we encounter significant difficulties when we are attempting to advise clients on the effect of a particular provision or provisions in equality legislation.  As many Senators will know, equality legislation was introduced in Ireland to comply with EU directives.  In advising clients on the terminology used in domestic legislation which is implementing those European directives, it can often be necessary to rely on European jurisprudence.  However, as Travellers are not recognised as an ethnic minority group, the rights of Travellers to rely directly upon the race directive or jurisprudence under the directive, can and has been challenged.  While I note we have been asked to comment specifically on Articles 1 and 27, while we are discussing equality, compliance with Article 26 of the ICCPR - this provision relates to equality - it is important to note that this article is crucial in respect of the protection it provides to Travellers.  The article is very broad.  It states:<blockquote>All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law.  In this respect the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</blockquote>I note that there is domestic equality legislation in place - the amended Equal Status Act.</p> <p>Section 14 of the Equal Status Act 2000 is problematic in that it allows other legislation to override the effect of equality legislation, thus diluting the effectiveness of the legislation and leaving the protections under equality legislation subject to political whim. </p></speech>

When the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for integration was being established, Travellers, despite being one of the groups that has experienced most discrimination over the years, were not included within the remit of the new office.  As many Senators will be aware, the Irish Traveller Movement and other non-governmental organisations made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last year.  The committee's final report, which was published two weeks ago, recommended that Travellers be recognised as an ethnic minority group.  The committee's support for our proposal was unanimous.</p><p>  Members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality took the initiative by taking time to visit Travellers on the ground and engaging with all those involved in this issue as part of a thorough consultation on Traveller ethnicity.  It was one of the proudest moments of my working life to be able to tell my 91 year old grandfather that elected public representatives had recommended that our people be finally recognised.  We are confident that the Government will do so.  It has never explained to my community and people, using objective criteria and international standards, the reason it denies Traveller ethnicity.  Six years after a United Nations Human Rights Committee issued a strong recommendation under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Government has not made any clear policy statement or commitment on this issue.  It has not set a timetable or published draft legislation.  Under the universal periodic review, UPR, process, the Minister for Justice and Equality indicated he was giving the matter serious consideration.  If the State takes seriously its human rights obligations, the time to act is now because promises do not mean anything until they are implemented.  Travellers need stronger protection and recognition.</p></speech>

Its unanimous recommendation on recognising Traveller ethnicity was a significant step.  This was the first time in my political career that the committee made such a forceful recommendation.  That is a very important development.</p></speech>

The conclusion of the report states that it was inappropriate for the State to reject the ethnicity of Travellers.  That statement says a great deal.</p><p>  What immediate steps does the Irish Traveller Movement recommend the State take to address the issue of Traveller ethnicity under its Article 27 obligations?  Some weeks ago, a committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association met representatives of Travellers, including members of Pavee Point, and it plans to meet Travellers in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The committee will draft a report in the autumn.  I ask Ms Quilligan to indicate what can be done under Article 27 obligations.  What does the Irish Traveller Movement recommend the State should do to address the issue?</p></speech>

I apologise to our guests for being late, which was due to being held up on the way from Galway.  I am sure Professor O'Flaherty will be familiar with that problem.  I welcome the debate and support the call made by the witnesses on Traveller rights.  This is an important occasion in that representatives of Travellers are present in the Seanad Chamber to bear witness to some of the issues that arise on the ground.  Given the number of issues facing Traveller communities, I am curious to find out what will be the four issues the witnesses will choose in response to Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's question.

I am concerned that recognising the Traveller community as an ethnic minority would be a backward step given the integration that has taken place over the years.  I worked previously in the personnel department of a business where I hired members of the Travelling community who integrated very well in the workforce.  They made such a fine contribution that most colleagues did not even realise they were from the Traveller community.  If we recognise Travellers as an ethnic minority, will we not further polarise matters?  Will people view Travellers as different and want to treat them differently?</p></speech>

Senators may wish to ask further questions if they require more information.</p><p>  On Senator Cummins's question as to what would be our recommendations, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has made concrete recommendations with which we concur.  This would only require the Taoiseach or Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement in the D&aacute;il formally recognising the ethnicity of Travellers.  There is nothing to prevent either of them from making such a statement tomorrow if they so wished as no legislative change would be required.  We strongly encourage either the Taoiseach or the Minister to make such a statement.  </p><p>  Our second recommendation would be to consult the national Traveller organisations, Travellers and relevant stakeholders on how to progress and roll out the recognition of Traveller ethnicity, identify what would be the implications and ascertain how best we could use available resources to make a strong impact.  </p><p>  The third step would be to inform international human rights bodies that Ireland had taken this step.  This would give a strong statement abroad that Ireland values its human rights track record and the human rights of one of its oldest indigenous minority groups.  </p><p>  Senator Paul Coghlan asked about the origins of Travellers and the idea of Traveller ethnicity.</p> <p>As far back as we can recall, we have been people who were nomadic with no literacy skills, so our history, like many indigenous and nomadic peoples, was an oral history and is an oral history.  Our history is passed down from generation to generation.  We think any recollection of our history was done maybe by monks or other religious people.  Like a lot of Irish history, that history was destroyed and very little of that before maybe the 1700s exists today.  However, we know that passed down from generation to generation is a story that is contrary to the popular belief that we are people who were made homeless during the Famine times, which is not true.  We were people who were nomadic for centuries.  We have our own language.  We have our own customs and way of life, which while similar to those of the Irish people of the time were still different.  Some of our names are very different from other Irish people's names.  Our history within our own families is very different.</p><p> There is evidence from different programmes that were done, for instance, blood of the Travellers, to show that Travellers have different DNA, at least tracing back for 1,500 years.  More research needs to be done into that in terms of identifying where we originated.  However, we know at least 1,500 years ago we were still a distinct separate group.</p><p> We have many real examples of racism.  I will speak about some discrimination I have encountered myself in terms of access to goods and services.  I live in Killarney and if I walk down Killarney town, I am instantly known as a Traveller.  If I seek to get a cup of coffee in some establishments or go for a drink - even though I am a teetotaller - in some establishments, I could be refused access to those pubs, clubs or caf&eacute;s.  They could simply tell me: "Regulars only or nobody here tonight."</p><p> If I want to book a children's party for my son and if they hear my name, they will tell me the venue is booked.  If I want to get my son into a particular summer camp and if they do not like my surname, they could tell me it is booked, and yet my friend with a different surname can go back afterwards and book a place for her son in it.  In terms of access to accommodation, Travellers throughout the country are finding it increasingly difficult to get private rented accommodation when they are known as Travellers.  Landlords will not rent to them.  That is just based on maybe some landlords' experiences with some Travellers, but not with all.</p><p> In terms of the education system, going back many years Travellers, colleagues of mine, when they went into school - even my own experience of my very early education although I have to put on record that I had a very good experience in school - were put into segregated education.  Some Travellers were taken from their homes in the morning in buses, brought into school, showered, changed in communal baths regardless of whether they were boys or girls and put into a segregated classroom.  That was their experience of education.</p><p> Looking online shows how we are discriminated against.  A simple Google search of "Travellers" will show people talking about Travellers as if we are all criminals, people calling for us to be killed, calling for women to be raped and calling for children to be shot.  I encourage those present when they go home today to do a Google search of "Travellers" and see what comes up.</p><p> Even being on a train or wherever, one will hear so many derogatory comments about Travellers and we constantly have to justify ourselves.  We do not enjoy the same rights as anybody else in Ireland.  This gentleman over here spoke about the jobs market.  If I went with my surname with all my qualifications and skills and applied for even a job in Dunnes Stores or any kind of mid-level job, I would probably not get past the interview process because people would see my name and I would be discriminated against.  That is an experience I can speak to of myself.</p></speech>

I would just say to the Senator that at the moment my people are slowly dying.  If one looks at the suicide rate, it is seven times the rate for settled people.  If one looks at the high level of unemployment and the low level of attainment in education, the Travellers the Senator spoke about more than likely, and no more than I had to do in the past, probably had to conceal their identity.  Maybe that is not so.  Maybe I am speaking out of turn, but I know that many Travellers throughout the country, to secure employment in the first place, have to hide their identity and pretend they are not Travellers.  We have supported people in employment cases around this in that when they are in employment they have to pretend they are not Travellers, much as somebody from the LGBT community would have had to do a few years ago and in some circumstances still have to do.  One almost hides one's identity.</p><p>  Things are so bad for us at the moment that we have to ask ourselves if they can get any worse.  We want recognition of our people.  We think that with recognition comes respect in order that we can write our own history and people can learn who we really are rather than being told who we are and set the record straight and start to change things.</p></speech>

It is a great honour to be here.  I am professor of human rights law at NUI Galway and also director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights.  I was a member and vice-chair of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which is the monitoring body we are discussing and which will review Ireland's report in July.</p><p>  Before coming to the topic on which I have been invited to speak, I join the other speakers in applauding this initiative by the Seanad, which is really international good practice.  We all recognise that Parliament plays a critical role in the protection of human rights and in the implementation of international human rights treaty standards, but it is more often acknowledged in rhetoric than in reality.  This initiative is a demonstration of a manner in which the Seanad is really developing good strategies around the role of Parliament from which other countries can learn.</p><p>  The initiative the committee has taken in convening these hearings and deciding to adopt a report is strongly supported by high level international policy documents.  For example, in 2011, the leaders of all the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies met in Dublin and adopted the Dublin outcome document, which contains numerous references to the critical role of Parliament for the operation of the system.  Much more recently, 27 Irish human rights groups met in Galway to adopt the Galway platform on human rights in Irish foreign policy, which again made strong reference to the role Parliament needs to play.</p><p>  Turning to what I was asked to speak about, I was asked to speak not so much about human rights issues in Ireland but rather on the broad process of what the human rights committee will do in the context of the report Ireland has submitted.  First, what is the human rights committee?  It is a body of independent experts elected by the states, including Ireland, that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It is a body that is elected periodically and on which all the members serve in an independent expert capacity - so they are human rights specialists and do not represent states.</p><p>  The committee carries out many functions, some of which were referred to.  The one of most interest for us today is the periodic review of reports submitted by states that are parties to the covenant.</p> <p>As I mentioned, Ireland submitted a report approximately two years ago and it will finally be reviewed by the committee in proceedings in July.<br />It is important to recall that the report by Ireland under the covenant is not a general human rights report.  It only covers issues of civil and political rights such as: the prohibition on torture; freedom from slavery; the freedoms of expression, movement and assembly; the rights of non-discrimination and equality; prison conditions; and so forth.  The first step was the submission of the Irish report two years ago.  A year ago the UN Human Rights Committee, based on what it read in the Irish report, developed the document that was mentioned this morning, the list of issues.  In essence, it is 26 or 27 questions that the UN puts to Ireland regarding issues it considers to be of particular concern.  The list of issues is, in a sense, an early indication of where the UN Human Rights Committee sees the existence of problems.  That list was responded to by the Irish Government in February this year in a lengthy written document in which it sought to allay concerns and provide the additional information that had been sought by the UN Human Rights Committee.<br />Side by side with this formal process, from when the Irish report was submitted and continuing up to now, there are submissions and interventions by non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and by the Irish Human Rights Commission.  There is no restraint on the number of submissions that can be made.  They will continue to be made to the UN Human Rights Committee up to the review in July.<br />It is on the basis of all of these materials - the State report, the NGO submissions, the response to the list of issues and, indeed, the report the Seanad Public Consultation Committee will adopt, which I hope and expect to be tabled at the UN Human Rights Committee, that the UN Human Rights Committee will engage in a dialogue over six hours with a delegation from Dublin appointed by the Government.  I have no idea who will be on the Irish delegation but, typically, these delegations are headed by Ministers or very senior civil servants.  There is no rule book, but they are senior serious delegations that include public officials from across the areas which are likely to be subject to discussion.  The six hour review in Geneva will be webcast, so it will be accessible and watched worldwide.  Side by side with that dialogue, there will be a number of sideline events organised by civil society and, if it so chooses, by Ireland's national human rights institution, the Irish Human Rights Commission.<br />About a week after the six-hour dialogue with the Irish delegation, the UN Human Rights Committee will produce the outcome document.  It is a terribly important piece of paper with a very dull title, the Concluding Observations.  In essence, it is the findings of the UN Human Rights Committee on the situation of these civil and political rights in Ireland.  This is a very detailed document.  Typically, it will be seven or eight pages in length and will raise 26 to 28 issues.  It will, in the first place, acknowledge achievements, but that is always a short section for any country.  It will then map out what it sees as the areas of concern and deliver to Ireland quite detailed and carefully crafted recommendations on how best to address them.<br />Ireland last went through this procedure in 2008 and I can give a flavour of the type of findings the committee adopted.  I will outline the recommendation on one issue, the then situation of the Irish Human Rights Commission.  Already in 2008 the first shadows were falling and it was clear that things were remiss.  The committee made a reference to the commission and engaged the role of the Oireachtas when it adopted a recommendation stating that the state party, Ireland, should strengthen the independence and capacity of the Irish Human Rights Commission to fulfil its mandate effectively in accordance with the Paris Principles and that it should do so by endowing the commission with adequate and sufficient resources and by linking it to the Oireachtas.  It is an interesting reference to the role of the Oireachtas and its relationship to the commission.  It is an example of the findings that the UN Human Rights Committee typically adopts.<br />There will be 26 to 28 areas of concern addressed by the committee and there is an element of prioritisation within that list.  The committee has a practice of identifying three issues which it sees as having particular urgency and with regard to which the UN will refer back to the Government time and again to seek information on what is being done to address the concerns and to implement the recommendations.  Again, by way of illustration and to give Senators a sense of the type of things that interest the UN Human Rights Committee, the areas of particular urgency it identified in 2008 included: the legislative framework to combat terrorism in Ireland - there was some concern about the looseness of definitions which might lead to abuse; the issue of prisons, which was the second of the three areas and referred to issues such as those which members heard about this morning from the Irish Penal Reform Trust; and, third, the lack of access for those who wished to have access to secular primary education in some parts of the country.<br />The committee will therefore adopt its conclusions with some prioritisation, and I cannot predict what the priority issues will be.  Then there will be what is by far the most important moment.  The formal process will end, but the work will begin.  It is then that the recommendations must be brought home and implemented.  As much as possible must be done during the five or so years before the UN Human Rights Committee will again review Ireland's record of compliance.<br />I will conclude my comments by speaking to the issue of the role Parliament can and might play in this process.  The first matter to stress is that Parliament has a legitimate role at every stage of the process, namely, in the period before the Irish report is submitted, in consultations as to its content and in commentary subsequent to and across each of the stages I have mapped out.  With regard to what specifically I might suggest as to how Parliament or the Seanad might engage around the review procedure, it can do what this committee is doing, which is to draw attention to and promote awareness of these procedures.  UN monitoring systems may be effective and significant, but they are also remarkably little understood and little known.  The Seanad potentially has a really important role in that regard.<br />Second, I suggest that the Seanad has a role in giving a voice to the human rights actors.  Some actors do not need its help to have a voice.  The powerful organisations will grab the attention of <i>The Irish Times</i>whenever they so choose, but there are other voices that are heard less.  Hearings such as these can play a role in that regard.  I was terribly moved to hear our colleagues from the Irish Traveller Movement speaking earlier.  I suspect that the situation of Travellers has probably never been put more eloquently in the Oireachtas than it was today.  That is a moment of great significance.<br />A third function I would suggest is the one this committee will undertake through its report, which is that of making its own substantive contribution to the proceedings of the UN, by not just facilitating the voices of others but adding the voice of Parliament, which is and must be a separate voice to that of the Government.<br />Finally, and perhaps most important, there is the role of Parliament in holding the Government to account.  There is nothing shameful in holding a government, no matter how good it is, to account on its commitments.  That is, above all else, the role of a body such as the Seanad.  It has numerous possibilities to do so in its engagement with Ministers and all elements of the Government at every stage of the process, including and most importantly after July next when the recommendations are brought home and there is an expectation that they will be implemented.<br />I will conclude with that.  I have distributed a pack with some materials.  It contains a copy of the Dublin II Outcome Document, which is the important policy statement adopted in Dublin in 2011 and contains at least three references to the role of Parliament.  Second, there is a copy of the Galway Platform on Human Rights in Irish Foreign Policy, which was a submission for the foreign policy review of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and which again reinforces the initiative the Seanad is taking.  The pack also contains a copy of the Concluding Observations adopted by the UN Human Rights Committee on Ireland in 2008.  The committee will be struck by the extent to which they remain of contemporary interest.  Finally, I included a small two page article by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, in which she discusses elegantly and clearly why this system matters, why treaty bodies make a difference and why proceedings such as the review of the Irish report can make an impact for the strength of human rights protection on the ground.</p></speech>

Will the committee take into consideration other international agreements such as the Good Friday Agreement and its outstanding issues?  Some people argue, for example, that the amalgamation of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority dilutes the responsibilities under agreements such as the Good Friday Agreement.  Does the committee look only through the lens of its UN remit?  Will the Aarhus Convention form a backdrop to its deliberations?</p><p>  I was not here for the debate on direct provision but I have campaigned passionately on it.  Some people might call it an Irish solution to an Irish problem and, many people would argue, not a particularly satisfactory one.  What type of reading can the committee take of such an issue, or the Traveller issue in Ireland, both of which are specific to a member state?  Can it make pertinent findings and recommendations to the Government although they would bear little relation to issues in other member states? </p></speech>

His advice and views as a former member of the committee are very helpful.  Towards the end of his contribution he said that it is important to add the voice of the Parliament to the process.  We are used to hearing what the Government and NGOs say but we will struggle with how to make our contribution distinctive as law-makers.  Much of that will have to do with the fact that we have a different type of experience to bring to bear as law-makers.  Does Professor O&rsquo;Flaherty have any other pointers or thoughts on how our report could be of most help and benefit to the committee?  We intend to support the Government in its process of trying to establish how best to implement its obligations.</p></speech>

If it were to stray all over the place with other treaties, it would go beyond its remit.  Using the covenant as a filter allows it to engage with any number of issues.  I understand that the Aarhus Convention deals with the environment, which has an obvious impact on civil and political rights.  To that extent, the committee would be extremely interested in environmental issues.  Other examples were given and the same would apply to them.</p><p>  The protection of civil and political rights provides a very broad canvas on which to review any number of issues that apply in Ireland, even where they formally exist as separate commitments under separate treaties.  Senators will recall that one of the first speakers this morning spoke of how the socio-economic situation can have an impact on the enjoyment of civil and political rights.  Through that prism, even issues concerning people&rsquo;s socio-economic status are of interest to the committee.</p><p>  Direct provision was considered in some detail this morning.  It raises so many human rights issues that I suspect it will be a prominent element of the dialogue in Geneva with the human rights committee.  It is a very disturbing practice, which is particularly bad in the context of developed states.  There are not many European states that operate a system as dehumanising as direct provision.  I expect that it will receive attention from the committee and attract critical commentary, not least because this is not the first time that the UN human rights committee has criticised the direct provision system in Ireland.</p><p>  In response to the question as to what is the distinct parliamentary voice, I can only venture some thoughts.  Parliament will have to decide what its voice should be but it seems to me that Parliament does not have to defend the institutions of government with the same vigour as government does.  It is entirely natural and appropriate for government to support its institutions and to present them in the best possible light.  That is not Parliament&rsquo;s business.  Parliament has the space to be a more critical friend of the institutions of State.</p><p>  Parliament is perhaps very well placed to examine the underlying and structural issues that impede human rights protection.  That is why the status of the Irish Human Rights Commission seems very pertinent and meet to the business of parliament, not least given the formal nexus the UN believes there should be between a human rights commission and a nation&rsquo;s parliament.  That was adopted in the Belgrade declaration last year.</p><p>  A parliamentary intervention might want to consider the protection of political space because if political space is not protected, many of the key human rights covered in the covenant are not guaranteed.  It is of interest to Parliament to examine the extent to which it is possible for any citizen to put him or herself forward for election and serve in Parliament in an effective fashion.  That links very closely with general issues of the protection of the freedom of expression, which some of us consider as almost the primordial human right.  Without expression, we have so little.  The Oireachtas might wish to examine that, considering that UN bodies have criticised Ireland for an excessively enthusiastic constitutional provision on blasphemy.</p><p>  The complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU and its European commitments will not be the primary focus of attention of the UN Human Rights Committee&rsquo;s proceedings because Ireland is the state party under review, not Europe.  The committee would go beyond its remit if it moved beyond the shores of Ireland.  There will be no discussion of any country except Ireland in the six-hour review.</p><p>  Where the issues of Ireland, Europe and human rights become terribly important and much more broadly, the role Ireland can and must play as a champion of human rights within the European Union are beyond the narrow remit of the review in July.  I will shamelessly draw attention again to the Galway Platform on Human Rights in Irish Foreign Policy which speaks at length on how Ireland in its foreign policy must not only honour its own human rights commitments, but also those which have been taken on board by Europe, and notes that Ireland has great potential to play a role as a human rights champion within the European community.</p></speech>

Ireland is fine with regard to procedural compliance, and it is as good as any of its fellow European states in delivering good and detailed reports and responding to the various requirements of the procedures.  I pay credit in that regard to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which does a fine job in marshalling Ireland's engagement across human rights procedures.</p><p>  With regard to formal substantive compliance, like any other country, Ireland is not uniquely bad or good.  It has problems, and they are the subject of these hearings.  We have heard about some very serious matters this morning.  I tend not to rank countries, as I do not find it helpful to say a country is more good or less good.  I spent eight years as a member of the UN Human Rights Committee and I reviewed the reports of approximately 85 countries.  One would be struck by the extent to which problems emerge in any country on earth, so it is probably not helpful to get into a comparative discussion but rather to acknowledge that, as is the case for any other country in the world, Ireland needs the help and support of review procedures like this.</p></speech>

No country wants to be embarrassed on an international platform, and the UN is getting very good at embarrassing countries which are egregious in non-compliance.  The issue will arise in forum after forum.  This is the review of the UN Human Rights Committee but there is also a review of a committee against torture and on the rights of the child, and it will repeatedly return to the same problems in a manner that most governments find, at best, embarrassing.  Egregious non-compliance would also be subject to review in a political body of the United Nations, the Human Rights Council, which also examines the Irish record on a periodic basis.  For example, other parts of the UN that would be very interested in issues of serious non-compliance would be the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who would make these issues her talking points on visiting Dublin.  There are also experts overseeing thematic issues of human rights in the UN - the so-called special rapporteurs - which deal with freedom of expression, adequate housing and extreme poverty.  There is no formal policing power but there is a capacity to embarrass, which democratic states like ours take seriously.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  The first group in this tranche of our hearings is Amnesty International.

The Government submitted its response on 24 February 2014.  In our submission to the committee, we highlighted some areas in the Government's reply which we believe the committee might usefully examine with a view to seeking further information and-or clarification from the Government in advance of the review.  Ireland's past involvement in extraordinary renditions is one of those issues.<br />While there may be no direct evidence that victims of renditions physically transited Irish territory, it is beyond question that Shannon Airport has been used as a stop-over point by the US intelligence services in rendition circuits.  We presented flight logs to the Government in 2005 showing that in at least five instances involving four known individuals, US aircraft used Ireland as a refuelling stop <i>en route</i>to or returning from rendition missions.<br />A 2007 diplomatic cable from the US embassy in Dublin was released by WikiLeaks in 2010 describing a December 2007 meeting between the then US ambassador to Ireland and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, which stated that the Minister &quot;seemed quite convinced that at least three flights involving renditions had refuelled at Shannon Airport before or after conducting renditions elsewhere&quot;.  We also know that the so-called assurances Ireland received from the US Government applied only to aircraft physically carrying rendition victims - no assurance has ever been given that the USA would not use Ireland as a staging post for rendition circuits.  The Government in its reply to the UN Human Rights Committee's list of issues says that &quot;no consent would be granted by the Irish authorities for the transit of an aircraft for the purposes of extraordinary rendition under any circumstances&quot;.  But it is quite clear that the US aircraft that used Ireland did not seek such consent, so that is of very limited value.<br />It is also beyond question that, under international human rights law, Ireland has an obligation to investigate what happened, and to take measures to prevent the further use of its territory or airspace for such purposes.  Victims of renditions have a right to truth and justice.  This has been communicated to Ireland by the UN Human Rights Committee, the UN Committee against Torture, the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the Irish Human Rights Commission.<br />The committee has asked us today to &quot;expand on what precise measures the State should put in place to ensure that aircraft suspected of involvement in 'extraordinary rendition' do not pass through the State's territory, and to investigate the previously alleged offences regarding Article 7 ICCPR obligations&quot;.  I must reply that the answer to the first part of the question lies in the second part.  The precise measures the State should put in place to ensure that aircraft linked to rendition do not transit Ireland can only be determined through the State's effectively investigating how this happened in the first place.</p> <p>The precise gaps in Irish law, policy and practice that enabled those aircraft to circumvent Irish law can only be revealed by an investigation with full powers and resources to compel data and information that might otherwise be considered sensitive or be hidden.  Amnesty International Ireland corresponded with previous Governments over a number of years.  We asked them to put in place adequate measures to ensure this would not be repeated, but to no avail.  In 2009, we published a briefing, Breaking the Chain, in which we set out a range of measures that might be considered.  Copies of this briefing have been circulated to the members of the committee.  Even though the briefing was published five years ago, it remains quite relevant, sadly.  In the briefing, we paid particular regard to loopholes or gaps that potentially exist in Ireland's civil aviation law.</p><p> The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 prohibits foreign "military" aircraft from flying over or landing in the State without express permission from the Irish Government.  It is not clear whether the section of the order that relates to aircraft engaging in "military service" covers aircraft owned, operated or commanded by foreign secret services, such as the CIA.  If this order does not include secret services, such services may freely abuse the automatic overflight and landing clearances available to civilian aircraft.  The USA's extraordinary renditions programme has used civilian overflight and landing procedures across the world by masquerading as civilian flights.  In many countries, the law provides that aircraft controlled by foreign secret services are viewed as state aircraft and are not entitled to use civilian procedures.  We still do not know what is covered in the law in Ireland.</p><p> It is made clear in Article 3 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation that the automatic overflight and landing permissions required under that convention are limited to "civilian aircraft".  It might be assumed that if our law in this regard were clarified, it would facilitate the Irish aviation authorities to demand from civilian aircraft making unscheduled stopovers the sort of information that would trigger suspicion of illegal activity.  This sort of information would include full details of past and future itineraries, or of the crew and passengers.  When we drew up our briefing, we were conscious that there may be domestic and international constraints on the sorts of measures we proposed.  That is why we submitted it to the then Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Transport and asked for considered responses to our recommendations.  We received no substantive response from either Minister.  The Department of Transport referred us to the Department of Foreign Affairs, even though the regulation of civilian aircraft is within its remit.  It is fair to say that the then Government had no appetite to engage with any of our suggestions.</p><p> As the committee is aware, the human rights committee in its list of issues has also sought information from Ireland on the "specific and concrete steps taken, beyond official assurances, to ensure that aircrafts used for the purpose of extraordinary rendition, whether they carry prisoners on board or not, do not pass through the territory of the State party".  It is disappointing that the Government's response merely refers to the possibility that "anyone with evidence which suggests that any person has transited an Irish airport as part of an extraordinary rendition operation [can] make this evidence available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so that an investigation can take place".  At least this response reveals that the State evidently has nothing further to report on this.</p><p> I would like to come back to the need for an independent investigation.  The human rights committee's list of issues also asks for details of any "measures .... taken to investigate past allegations".  The Government's reply does not cite any form of investigation, other than Garda investigations of complaints of suspicious aircraft on a case-by-case basis.  We can assume that no substantive or meaningful Government investigation has occurred.  The precise form of the investigation we are seeking must be independent, comprehensive, effective and timely.  The mechanism must have the resources and powers to compel the production of information.  The question of whether the mechanism to be used should involve the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or an Oireachtas committee with the necessary guarantees of independence from the Government's political parties, or whether an entirely new mechanism should be used, is a matter for discussion.</p><p> One way or the other, this issue will not go away until and unless an investigation is conducted.  The European Parliament's resolution of 11 September 2012 shows that this remains a live issue across Europe.  We must continue to remind the Government that the US renditions involved the international transfer of individuals in a manner that breached international law and resulted in grave human rights violations, including enforced disappearances and torture.  In the programme for Government, the current Government promised to "enforce the prohibition on the use of Irish airspace, airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law".  No concrete action has emerged from this commitment to date.  Amnesty International asks this committee to consider the recommendations we made in 2009 and raise them with the Government.  Such an initiative might yield further information that could be of use to the human rights committee.</p></speech>

We commend Senators on their engagement with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and thank them for consulting us in this way.  I am here to represent the Children's Rights Alliance, which unites almost 100 organisations that are working to improve the lives of children by ensuring their rights are protected in Irish law, policy and practice.  I intend to share my time with Mr. Paul Rowe, who is the chief executive of Educate Together, which is one of the alliance's member organisations.  In our submission to this committee, we raised a number of issues relating to children that are of relevance to various provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the issue of children in detention, which was discussed this morning.</p><p>  We have been asked to focus our presentation on the issues of school admissions, patronage and pluralism.  The work of the alliance would usually lead me to discuss these issues in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, but today I will explore them in the context of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  I will briefly explain what the human rights framework on this issue under the covenant says about religion and education.  The covenant obliges states to protect against discrimination on a number of grounds, including a person's beliefs, under Articles 2 and 26.  It goes on to specifically protect children against discrimination under Article 24.  It provides under Article 18 that everyone has an absolute "right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion".  The UN Human Rights Committee has interpreted this right as also including the right not to have a religion.  Paragraph 4 of Article 18 provides that states must "have respect for the liberty of parents and .... guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions".</p><p>  The UN committee also provides guidance on how religious instruction can be delivered.  It is noted that public education that includes religious instruction must make provision for non-discriminatory exemptions or alternatives that would accommodate the wishes of parents and guardians.  What has the committee said about Ireland, specifically, in this area?  As Professor O'Flaherty noted this morning, the committee suggested in its last review - in 2008 - that this should be a priority issue for Ireland and for the committee.  The committee suggested that because the vast majority of Ireland's primary schools are privately run and denominational, issues arise under Articles 2, 18, 24 and 26 for families that want their children to pursue a secular education.  The committee recommended that Ireland should increase its efforts to ensure non-denominational primary education is widely available in all parts of the country.  It is worth mentioning that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child made similar recommendations in 2006, as did the UN Committee against Racial Discrimination in 2011.  The State accepted recommendations on this issue under the UN universal periodic review mechanism in 2012.  It is also on the list of issues for the committee's upcoming review session.</p><p>  I wish to respond to the committee's question about the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance's remaining concerns in this area.  Parents and families of the majority religion in Ireland are well served by the school system.  The available denominational schools enable them to vindicate their right to have their children educated in conformity with their own convictions.  While this is to be commended, issues arise for children of minority or no faiths, whose families want them to be educated in a multidenominational or non-denominational environments.  This is a particular problem for families in many parts of the country where parents have little or no choice regarding where to send their children.  When this issue was last before the UN Human Rights Committee in 2008, well over 90% of primary schools were privately-run religious institutions in receipt of State funding.  Today, six years later, the situation has changed very little.  This does not reflect the dramatic demographic changes in the composition of Irish society, including in the area of religion, as identified in the censuses of 2006 and 2011.  This further emphasises the urgent need for the State to accommodate the rights of these families to education in conformity with their own convictions.</p><p>  The Children's Rights Alliance's annual report card series tracks the progress being made with the Government&rsquo;s commitments to children.  I hope all members have received a copy of our most recent report card, which relates to 2014.  In that document, we praised the positive developments in this area, including the engagement of the Minister for Education and Skills and his Department, the work of the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector and the completion of parental surveys to establish demand for change in existing patronage.  However, implementation of the divestment process has been slow.  It will be some time before a significant real-life impact will be felt by children and their families on the ground.  While we fully acknowledge the complexity of divestment for the institutions involved, we feel that the mechanisms being used to roll out divestment should be re-examined to identify the cause of the delay and to re-ignite the momentum to make progress with the process.</p> <p>It is only when the impact of divestment yields tangible results for families and children of minority religions or none that the rights of families and children can be said to be met and that the State can then be said to have discharged its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Rowe" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600017#Q00200"><p>I thank Senators for the opportunity to highlight the very real issues that continue to face families who do not have access to multidenominational schools.  Ever since the 1970s, Educate Together has been at the cutting edge of the tension between the rights of children and families on the one hand and the predominance of religious control of the education system on the other.  During this time, there has been a profound generational change of attitudes in the Irish population.  This change in values and beliefs is not reflected in school provision, however.  Accordingly, increasing numbers of parents are now compelled to send their children to faith-based schools against their conscience and lawful preference.  Over many years now, successive Governments have ignored this infringement of rights.</p><p>  There is ample evidence of the negative effects of the current imbalance.  The current protection that children can opt-out of religious instruction in denominational schools has been shown to be inadequate and utterly unfair.  Research has illustrated the issues that result from the practice.  Schools and teachers with the best of intentions cannot overcome the difficulties posed by the obligation to instruct children in one faith, especially since the rules require that a religious ethos should permeate the school day.  We need to listen closely to the voices of children from minority faith backgrounds.  They feel excluded, left out and confused in this context, as evidenced in research from the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism.</p><p>  It is fundamental to our world that children do not choose their parents or their family background.  It is, therefore, impermissible that they should be discriminated against on this ground in State-funded education.  This is particularly important to a modern democracy that has recently passed a referendum on children's rights and has as one of its founding concepts the cherishing of the children of the nation equally.</p><p>  We also need to listen to parents.  Many Educate Together schools receive ten times as many applications than they have places to offer.  A large part of our work is advocating on behalf of such families.  They want their children to attend a school where their belief background will be equally respected, where their children can flourish in an atmosphere of equality with those of other backgrounds, where they can avail of a comprehensive ethical education curriculum and where, if they need faith formation, it can happily take place outside the compulsory school day.</p><p>  Educate Together now comprises a network of 68 schools serving approximately 17,000 pupils.  This network is growing at an average rate of just over four schools per year.  This represents just 2% of the system, however.  This is far from the size of network required to address the needs of our society.  In 2012 and 2013, 44 areas were surveyed by the Department of Education and Skills to assess the need for change of school patronage.  In 28 of these areas, sufficient demand was identified for the Department to judge that change was not only necessary but also viable.  In 25 of the areas surveyed, the result favoured a transfer from Catholic patronage to Educate Together.</p><p>  As an example, Killarney is one of the 25 areas identified for transfer.  The report on the parental surveys shows that there are 12 primary schools under Catholic patronage in Killarney with no alternative provision whatsoever for those who do not wish to send their children to a Catholic school.  Nearly half of parents who responded to the survey said they would like to see provision reconfigured but, so far, no way forward has been identified.  In towns like Athlone, Cavan and Dundalk, parents have been campaigning for an Educate Together school for years.  These are all large, diverse towns with no Educate Together option available.  These towns have not yet even been surveyed, so we have a long way to go.</p><p>  We have to report that, although we acknowledge the objectives set in the current programme for Government and the efforts made by the current Minister for Education and Skills, departmental officials and some church leaders, progress has been very slow - painfully slow for families living in areas where there continues to be no choice.  These families cannot wait.  Their parenting is like a train that has already left the station.  They need resolution of this issue now before their children start school.  Strong political leadership is required to move this process forward and to ensure the rights of parents who have clearly expressed their preference can be vindicated.  We would call on everyone here to support parents, church leaders, the Department and schools to make lasting change happen in communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The current programme needs adequate funding if it is to succeed.  Educate Together has been working to establish its national network of schools for 35 years.  Despite rising levels of popular demand, the funding we receive from the State to open a new school remains inadequate.  We have to raise 90% of the funding we need to establish a new school in a community from private sources.  While we have made considerable progress through leveraging voluntary and community initiatives, as well as through fund-raising, a realistic funding framework now needs to be put in place to advance this vital work.</p><p>  We ask Senators to press the Government to fulfil the recommendations of the ICCPR and several other UN bodies such as the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Universal Periodic Review and the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of the Council of Europe.  These bodies have consistently advised the State to increase the availability of schools operating along the same guarantees of equality as are embodied in the Educate Together model.  There is an opportunity to make real progress now in the context of the current divestment process.  On behalf of families throughout the country, we ask Senators to show leadership and to lend their support to this process.</p></speech>

We intend to focus on the challenges faced with the implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 and the impact these will have on the State's obligations under Articles 14 and 16 of the ICCPR.  Our submission was developed in consultation with members of the National RehabCare Advocacy Council, NRAC, a representative body of people using the services of RehabCare, the health and social care division of the Rehab Group.  I am accompanied today by Mr. Aidan Hogan, chairperson of NRAC, and Mr. Francis Ducie, vice-chairperson.</p></speech>

I am the chairperson of the NRAC national committee.  NRAC is an organisation that gives a voice to people in RehabCare.</p><p>  The new Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 is very important because it will make it easier for people with disabilities to make choices and have more control in their lives.  NRAC&rsquo;s members sometimes need support with many things like their money, their social welfare, voting and paying bills.  Up to now it has been difficult for some people to get this help.  It can be hard for people to find out about their rights because they are not told about them in a way they can easily understand.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill is a very big document.  We think it is really important that when the Bill becomes law, people are told about it and given information which is accessible for them like Easy Read or Braille.</p> <p>Their families and services such as RehabCare will be able to help them with this.  The most important thing is that anyone who needs help making decisions will be able to find out what help there is.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.488" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Ducie" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600018#R00200"><p>I am the vice chairperson of the National RehabCare Advocacy Council, NRAC.  No one makes decisions alone and everyone needs help sometimes.  A few years ago, my mother passed away and I lived in the family home.  I had always wanted to live independently but I needed help to find somewhere that suited my needs.  We decided to sell the house and it was a very challenging time for me.  I had to buy a new apartment, get new furniture and move in.  I got a lot of assistance from my brother and sister.  I also had an advocate who helped me to make sure that people knew what my wishes were.  Now, I am delighted with my new life.  Before I was just existing and now I am much more positive.  My confidence has grown hugely.</p><p>  I am very lucky to have the support of my family.  When it is implementing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, the Department of Justice and Equality needs to make sure that the new supports reach the people who need them most, particularly people who do not have family support.  For a long time, decisions have been made for people with disabilities without helping them to understand.  Many people with disabilities and their families will need to learn that they have a right to have the supports provided for in the legislation which will help them to make decisions about their lives.  Advocacy is essential as it enables people to work out what they really want after they have weighed up all the options.  As they learn more about making decisions, people with disabilities might also find out they are much more able than they think.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sonya Felton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600018#R00300"><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill is an historic step forward for the rights of people with disabilities and people with mental health difficulties.  Fundamentally, the legislation will remove the all or nothing situation which exists, whereby a person either has full capacity or is deemed not to have capacity and becomes a ward of court.  Being a ward of court means one is no longer a person before the law, one loses one's self-determination and decisions about one's life are made by a court rather than with the support of family and those one interacts with every day.  People, their families and service providers have often been loath to raise their heads above the capacity parapet, fearing the ward of court process.  Instead they have muddled along, attempting to find a way around decisions, making decisions in a legal lacuna or simply not making decisions.<br />The Bill will therefore substantially improve the position of people with disabilities in Irish society and demonstrate Ireland's commitment to Article 16 by creating a system where all individuals are recognised equally as a person before the law.  It is imperative that this is implemented fully and effectively.  This will require active education and training of professionals, public information sessions, informative and easily accessible publications and guides and specific supports of individuals.  There are some good models in use in other jurisdictions.<br />Organisations such as RehabCare and others have been campaigning on this issue for many years, and we will be happy to support people in our services to understand the new systems.  There is considerable expertise in this sector and this should be utilised by the Department in overcoming some of the barriers to implementation.<br />Part of the difficulty in ensuring public understanding in the complex areas of decision-making is confusion about what is not included in the Bill.  Section 106 specifically excludes important areas of people's lives including marriage, sexual relations, voting in an election or a referendum, participation on a jury, divorce, dissolution of a civil partnership, placing a child for adoption and guardianship issues.  This will prevent people accessing the supports they need to make decisions in these areas.  While law reform is planned it is unclear when this will happen, and it is inequitable that people with disabilities will have to wait even longer for clarification of their rights in these areas.<br />Two of these areas are relevant to Ireland's performance under Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, which requires that all persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals.  There are three distinct areas where reform could significantly improve Ireland's performance in this area.  The Disability Act 2005 requires public service providers to deliver services and information which are accessible to people with disabilities.  The Irish legal system does not always discharge this responsibility effectively for those whose capacity may be in question.  In practice there have been instances where individuals with reduced capacity have not been given effective supports to give evidence at a trial and it has been found they do not have capacity to do so.  In one well-reported case, a young woman with Down's syndrome was deemed incompetent to testify in a case of sexual assault and the case was dismissed.  Effectively, the person against whom the accusation of assault was made did not undergo trial because the case involved the assault of a person with an intellectual disability.  This is a very unfortunate situation which queries our society's ability to deter crimes against people with disabilities.  Greater awareness and facilitation of the needs of people who have difficulty understanding is required within the legal system.<br />Another area where action is required is section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 which effectively criminalises two people who are defined as &quot;mentally impaired&quot; and who engage in sexual intercourse.  As a society we absolutely need to protect people with disabilities and mental health difficulties from sexual exploitation but for a person to be guilty of a crime because of an action of theirs, which another person without a disability can take freely, and which for other people is part of their fundamental rights and freedoms but which for a person with a disability is a crime solely by virtue of having a disability, is unacceptable.  The Law Reform Commission has published proposals for this area of law and these should be fast-tracked to complement the Assisted Decision-making (Capacity) Bill 2013.<br />The law on sexual relationships for people with disabilities has far-reaching impacts on attitudes and on the supports people receive regarding relationships, sexual and reproductive health and sex education.  For example, we are aware of two women with intellectual disabilities who last year went to take part in the State's cancer screening programme, CervicalCheck, but were turned away on a presumption they were not sexually active without ever being asked whether this was the case.  Ireland should not delay in its resolution of this issue as it is clearly at odds with our responsibilities under Article 14 and Article 23<i>, </i>which provides for the rights of the family, of the ICCPR.<br />Another area where action is required is with regard to jury participation.  There is an opportunity to ensure greater representation of people with disabilities in the legal system through participation in juries.  The Law Reform Commission has proposed reform in this area stating &quot;a person with a disability should be eligible for jury service unless, taking account of permissible and practical assisted decision-making supports and accommodation that are consistent with the right to a trial in due course of law, the disability would mean that he or she could not perform the duties of a juror&quot;.  The relevant legislative steps should now be taken to implement this recommendation.<br />I will briefly sum up our written submission to the committee.  There are steps that the Government should take as soon as possible to ensure we are compliant with the ICCPR, but most importantly because they will improve the lives of and opportunities available to people.  These include finalisation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013; reform of the law on sexual relations for people with disabilities; clarification of the legal position of people with intellectual disabilities voting in an election or a referendum; and enabling people with disabilities to participate in juries and take a greater part in public affairs.  Many of these issues can be resolved by new legislation followed by cultural and attitudinal change which will significantly improve the opportunities that people with disabilities can experience in our communities.</p></speech>

Ms Crowley made a powerful argument on the need for an independent investigation into the rendition case.  Over the weekend she may have heard the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, referring to this issue of rendition at a conference in the Burren in Ballyvaughan.  Her speech at the Burren law school was the subject of a report in The Irish Times yesterday by Ruadh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic.  Emily O'Reilly stated she felt it was an instance which showed the need for an office of guardian of the public interest to be established to prevent this type of issue from arising in the future.  Her point was there is nobody who could pre-emptively challenge the Government of the day on the practice of extraordinary rendition or another practice where there is a view the Government is acting illegally.  Does Amnesty International have a view on this question?  It is a slightly different question and is not with regard to investigating what has gone on but on a mechanism which could be established to stop it happening in the future.</p></speech>

Without the independent investigation or other forms of investigation, it is hard to reveal what is the most urgent action the Government could take to ensure not only truth and justice for those known victims of renditions in which Ireland was a staging post, but also non-repetition.</p><p>  On the other hand, we came up with a fairly solid set of possible recommendations on which we got no engagement at all with the Departments or with the Government more generally.  For example, the Cabinet committee established by the previous Government was meant to be a way for the Cabinet to engage collectively with the issues.  It committed to reviewing the adequacy of the civil and Garda powers in respect of checking aircraft going through Ireland and it met only three times and reported nothing.  Therefore, we are always a bit suspicious of anything that does not have the hallmarks of independence, adequate resources, particularly powers of compellability, guarantees of a comprehensive terms of reference and, most importantly, transparency.</p><p>  There are many actions that the Government could take short of an independent investigation.  We recognise that resources might always be an issue.  If the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport were to engage meaningfully in an assessment of the degree to which civil aviation law needs to be overhauled and the degree to which the powers of the Irish Aviation Authority and others can, and perhaps should, better request this sort of information from transiting aircraft, then that sort of transparency would work.</p><p>  In terms of another public interest mechanism, however, we look to the Joint Oireachtas Committee Public Service Oversight and Petitions perhaps or other forms of mechanisms that might have this public interest mandate because it is a matter of public interest.  If civilian aircraft were allowed to transit Irish territory en route to renditions, goodness knows what else they could have been up to.  It is a matter of ongoing concern, and in the public interest.</p><p>  In summary, we continue to call for an independent, effective and comprehensive investigation, but in the meantime we would very much welcome anything short of that which could compel this sort of information and interrogate the degree to which the Government has the resources already and needs further resources and laws in order to be able to ensure this sort of thing does not happen again.</p></speech>

He spoke as though Catholic education and schooling was the road to the damned.  I felt that was the inference of what he had to say.  Is he saying that children of no religion or other religions who happen to be in Catholic schools cannot flourish within those schools?  Knowledge - the arts, history, geography, music - supercedes what Mr. Rowe suggests is something that would close down children of different religions within the Catholic ethos.  I would like him to answer that.</p></speech>

He and Ms Quinn have put forward a strong argument about the lack of choice for parents currently.  That is the issue.  There are so many parents in Ireland who would like an alternative to a Catholic education for their children and for whom, as they stated, this is not available, with only 2% of primary schools currently under Educate Together.  I am somebody who has a strong interest in this and has set up a local school which is being inundated with requests.  As Mr. Rowe states, there is enormous demand for places in the small number of Educate Together schools nationally.</p><p>  As for my question, they acknowledged the positive engagement by the Minister for Education and Skills with this issue and the process of dialogue and consultation that has gone on with the surveys of the 41 areas, the national forum, etc.  What extra specifically should be done to speed up the process of divestment, the need for which, in fairness, the Catholic Church, particularly Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, has been cognisant of?  They have been to the fore of acknowledging the need for greater parental choice in education.  It is in everyone's interest that the process is speeded up and that we see more schools divesting and more parental choice.  How does one actually do this?  Given that there is a positive will within the Department for this, what are the practical steps we could recommend?</p></speech>

In terms of the Government's responses to the issue around patronage and pluralism, it really provides us with answers in the legislation in terms of admissions and refers to a White Paper on patronage.  I concur with Senator Bacik's point there.</p><p>  In terms of the concerns around the admissions, patronage and pluralism, one of the questions that the UN asks of the Government has to do with whether we need an independent complaint handling mechanism to resolve disputes between parents and schools.  Effectively, the State disregards the need for that.  It appears as if the State feels there is not a need for that as part of this process of ensuring implementation of our obligations in relation to pluralism.  I ask them to comment on that too.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Rowe" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600019#S01200"><p>In answer to the first question, Educate Together has never had an agenda against Catholic education or the right of parents to access Catholic education.  The problem is a situation where parents have no choice but to send their children to Catholic schools and this, universally, across the developed world, is recognised as a human rights violation.  Nothing in my comments should be interpreted in any way as criticism of best practice in Catholic education or criticism of Catholic education in its own right whatsoever.</p><p>  In answer to the second question, from Senator Paul Coghlan, the statistics that I quoted are from the Department and Education and Skills survey of parental preferences in the Killarney area and they are representative of that.  I can speak from personal experience that Educate Together has had groups of parents in the Killarney and Kerry area seeking Educate Together places for their children for many years and they represent consistently the fact that there is no choice and no opportunity for an alternative.  I stress that diversity, space for innovation, space for a change and space for independent initiative in the education system is a valuable attribute of any well developed education system.  A situation where the State continues to ignore fundamental violations of human, religious and intellectual rights in significant areas of the country is something which we as a society must address, and addressing this human rights issue is to the benefit of all, not least to the future vitality and health of denominational education in the country.</p><p>  To Senator Bacik's question as to what specifically needs to be done, we need to share with the Senators what really is the fundamental issue.  The fundamental issue in Irish primary education is the ownership of the real estate, the fact that 98% of the primary schools are privately owned and the legal lien over property which the Department of Education and Skills should have is extremely weak despite the fact that in most cases the State has provided 85% of the building cost of infrastructure and over many years and has provided well over 90% of the running costs of all schools.</p> <p>There is an issue here that must be addressed relating to the legal lien of a property and what rights the State has over its very high investment in that property over many years on behalf of the public.</p><p> On the fourth question, from Senator Zappone, Educate Together does not have a view that having an independent complaints mechanism in this area necessarily would move things forward.  Our view is that this is a Government programme and we recognise that in its programme for Government, the current Government has finally recognised this issue after many years of it being raised with the United Nations by organisations such as Educate Together.  We first brought this issue to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ten years ago.  However, the current Administration has recognised this issue, it is in its programme for Government and we would like to credit the work in the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector.  The fundamental problem with it is this is a Government programme with no resources.  For example, the reform programme for the water supply industry has a significant investment of State funds in order to implement it.  Unfortunately, the reassignment of patronage programme does not have a resource allocation towards it and the work done by independent bodies such as Educate Together or others is not resourced.  We must do this entirely on the basis of fund-raising or voluntary and community-raised resources and that limits its effectiveness and its impact.</p></speech>

At present, some schools come up with highly practical solutions and best practices to accommodate children whose families do not wish them to attend religious instruction classes.  This is something that can be done and those classes could be held at different times for different class groups to allow those students to attend other classes.  Consequently, there are some immediate steps that could be taken in the interim while the delay is ongoing.</p></speech>

However, I can tell the Senator that the response to the surveys was low but the sheer numbers expressed of those seeking change were highly significant.  In other words, those who expressed a desire for change and those who expressed the desire to avail of change were significant in 27 of the 28 areas of the review to give viability for at least one single stream of a primary school.  This would mean a steady flow of at least 28 children coming in each year over a significant period.  However, I must say to the Senators that while these are the figures expressed in these formal surveys, Educate Together's own figures indicate very much larger numbers than those expressed in the survey.  The survey was an online survey and was the first time the State had ever elicited the views of parents of a school type in the entire history of the State, which itself indicates some significance to the importance the State has given this issue over a number of years.  While there were learnings to be gathered by this survey process, I insist that in respect of what is Educate Together's knowledge of this particular issue, the results of the survey were a significant understatement of the extent of demand.  To give a practical response to that, Educate Together is in the position whereby if it had the resources and access to accommodation to so do, it could open 50 new primary schools this year, whereas we will actually only open six primary schools this year.</p></speech>

As for jury service, which also is a particular issue, is this not a step too far?  Is it not somewhat unrealistic to expect a person with profound hearing difficulties and an inability to read to be able to participate on a jury?

Obviously, there is a cost attached to this but it is one that would be valuable in providing greater equality in the legal system.  Moreover, it is not just people who are deaf as often it would be stated automatically that a person with other kinds of disabilities did not need to come or they could telephone to say they do not wish to come.  The culture has very much been that disability has excluded one or allowed one to get off jury duty.</p> <p>I am not sure that is the culture we would want.  Obviously, if people are unwell, sick or for whom it would be very difficult, we need a way for them to say "I cannot do this", but somebody should not be disregarded for jury duty simply on the basis of his or her disability.</p></speech>

As the delegates representing some of the groups were not present to hear the notice on privilege I read out earlier, it is important that I reiterate it.  Before we begin I want to draw the attention of witnesses to the situation in regard to privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  The first group in this tranche is the Immigrant Council of Ireland, represented by Hilkka Becker, to be followed by Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Transgender Equality Network Ireland.  Each speaker will have ten minutes to make a presentation.  As we have already got their written submissions, I ask them to crystallise or synopsise the critical issues they wish to put before the Senators.  On completion of their submissions, a question and answer session will follow.  I invite Ms Becker to proceed. </p></speech>

We have been asked to focus on two issues in particular in light of Article 8 of the ICCPR, the issue of lack of access for asylum seeking victims of human trafficking to leave to remain status and coupled with that the situation of victims of trafficking in Ireland with regard to accessing free legal assistance.</p><p>  As is set out in our written submission, the rights afforded to asylum seeking victims of trafficking versus other suspected victims of trafficking are not the same in that asylum seeking victims of trafficking have less access to safe and appropriate accommodation, education, training, employment and the possibility of acquiring longer term status in the State.  Victims of trafficking who are in the asylum process, who constitute 56% of identified victims according to the GRETA report - Council of Europe expert group's report, are precluded from the benefits of a formal identification by the competent authorities and from receiving any acknowledgement to the effect that they are suspected victims of trafficking under the administrative arrangements for the protection of victims of human trafficking that are Irish national arrangements, even when they co-operate fully with the competent authorities and the investigation and prosecution of the crimes committed against them.  </p><p>  The Immigrant Council of Ireland is most concerned that while under section 21 of the administrative arrangements, which relate to change of status and leave to remain for victims of trafficking, a person who has assisted the Garda and has held a temporary residence permit for three years or longer can apply for a change of status and be granted permission to remain in the State on humanitarian groups, but asylum seeking victims will not be able to accumulate these three years as they will not receive a temporary residence permit until after their asylum application has been decided negatively.  In its replies to the list of issues raised by the UN Human Rights Committee, the Government has stated in this regard that "the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking apply only to those who would not otherwise have permission to be in the State" and that "It is important to emphasise that an alleged victim of trafficking who applies for asylum under the Refugee Act ... has the equivalent residence rights and access to the same support services as a person in a Recovery and Reflection Period under the Administrative Immigration Arrangements". </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.534" nospeaker="true" time="14:55:00" ><p>This gives rise to two issues.  First, the response ignores that, subsequent to the 60-day period for recovery and reflection allowed to a victim of trafficking, that is a victim who is not in the asylum process, the individual concerned will then be granted a temporary residence permit under the administrative arrangement and, with that, a stamp four residence permit which enables him or her to access private rented accommodation, social supports, training and employment.  In contrast, victims of human trafficking who have exercised their rights to seek international protection are left in direct provision accommodation, which has been widely criticised, including by UN bodies such as the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD.  In its concluding observations in March 2011, CERD expressed concern about the negative impact that the policy of direct provision could have on the welfare of asylum seekers who can suffer health and psychological problems that in some cases lead to serious mental illness.  Particularly in regard to victims of sexual violence, direct provision should not be considered appropriate.  This point has been echoed by the Council of Europe committee.
Second, in the considered view of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Government's response that the administrative immigration arrangements for victims of human trafficking apply only to those who would not otherwise have permission to be in this State is the result of a misinterpretation of the requirement, at least, under the Council of Europe convention that resident permits are to be issued to victims who are either illegally present or are legally resident with a short-term residence permit.  We argue that while victims of trafficking who are in the asylum process are not at immediate risk of deportation, they do not have the type of residence permit that would satisfy the requirements of the convention.  We submit that as the permission to remain granted to asylum seekers under the Refugee Act will cease when they are transferred to another EU member state, when their applications are withdrawn or, most likely, when the Minister refuses to give them a declaration that they are refugees, this permission cannot be interpreted as anything other than short-term in nature.  Our view is supported by the fact that for the purpose of social welfare and pensions legislation, asylum seekers and persons who have applied for subsidiary protections are persons who shall not be regarded as being habitually resident in the State.  In the absence of a temporary residence permit being issued to a victim of trafficking, he or she will not be considered habitually resident in this State - I refer to an asylum seeking victim - and, therefore, will be excluded from social welfare services, including disability allowance, one parent family payments, carer's allowance and child benefit.
The Government stated in its response that a suspected victim of trafficking who has had his or her application for asylum rejected will be entitled to temporary residence permission under the administrative immigration arrangements at that stage.  In such cases, suspected victims are notified of the refusal of their asylum claims and their eligibility for temporary residence permission.  We are particularly concerned from practical experience that victims of trafficking who had been co-operating with the competent authorities throughout the processing of their asylum claims have received notification of intention to deport pursuant to section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 following refusal of their asylum applications, rather than being issued with temporary residence permits under the administrative immigration arrangements.  We submit this is not something that automatically happens.
We submit that the treatment of asylum seeking victims, as set out above, is in breach of Article 14 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Organised Crime, which states that nothing in the protocol shall affect the rights, obligations and responsibilities of states and individuals under international law, including in particular the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees, where applicable.
Similarly, Article 14(5) of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings requires that the granting of a temporary residence permit to a victim of human trafficking shall be without prejudice to the right to seek and enjoy asylum.  In situations where asylum victims are clearly at a disadvantage compared to those who are not pursuing claims for refugee status, even where they are clearly in need of international protection, they are discouraged from pursuing such a claim.  On that basis the current system in Ireland is in breach of the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution, as enshrined in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The second or ancillary issue that the Seanad committee raised with the Immigrant Council of Ireland is legal representation and access to justice for victims of human trafficking.  We are of the view that immediate access to legal advice and intervention is critical to ensuring that all victims of trafficking are fully informed of their rights and obligations at the earliest possible opportunity and are able to make an informed choice regarding their immigration status, where relevant.  Currently, and contrary to the information provided in the Government report, the Legal Aid Board's refugee legal service only provides legal services on certain matters to persons identified by the Garda National Immigration Bureau as potential victims of human trafficking under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  In other words, potential victims of trafficking are required to present to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provide at least basic details of their identity and situation before they are eligible for State funded legal assistance and information.  This is not in line with international requirements.
Furthermore, the services offered to potential victims of human trafficking are currently limited to information on the rights of a victim in a criminal trial, access to compensation and voluntary return to the victim's country of origin.  While the legal services currently provided to victims of trafficking in Ireland seem to meet the minimum requirements of the UN protocol, they fall short of the requirements of Article 15(2) of the Council of Europe convention, which provides for the right to free legal assistance and legal aid for victims in regard to compensation and legal redress.
Additionally, we wish to highlight that the response to the concluding observations of the UN Human Rights Committee currently contained in Ireland's draft fourth periodic report under the ICCPR fails to address certain matters raised by the committee which specifically affect migrant victims of human trafficking.  The committee had requested,inter alia, that an independent appeals procedure be introduced to review all immigration related decisions and stated that engaging in such a procedure, as well as resorting to judicial review of adverse decisions, should have a suspensive effect in respect of such decisions.  While it is acknowledged that work on a new immigration, residence and protection Bill is ongoing, the issues raised by the committee must be considered in the drafting of any such legislation in order to ensure full compliance with Article 13 of the covenant.  In particular, the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism to deal with immigration decisions not falling within the remit of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is the only way to ensure access to fair procedures and effective remedies for migrants and their family members, including victims of human trafficking.
Bearing in mind the focus of this presentation, the Immigrant Council of Ireland also submits that a decision made by a member of the Garda not to identify a person as a suspected victim of human trafficking, as well as the subsequent and consequential decision by the Minister for Justice and Equality not to grant the person a recovery and reflection permit or temporary residence permit under the administrative immigration arrangements, must also be subject to independent judicial review.  Currently, however, people seeking to challenge such decisions are required to resort to the High Court for judicial review instead of accessing a more efficient and cost-effective immigration appeals tribunal.  Access to justice for migrants is already limited in that the High Court, as part of judicial review proceedings, is not in a position to review the merits of a case and cannot deal with questions of fact.  Unlike an expert administrative tribunal, the High Court does not have the power to alter or vary an administrative decision and access to the court is severely limited by the 14-day time limit contained in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, as well as by the high financial risk applicants are taking because, in case of an unsuccessful outcome of their application, they may have to pay the legal costs of the State.</p></speech>

I would like to express my gratitude to the committee for inviting myself and my colleague, Ms Deirdre Duffy, today.  I echo the remarks made by others in congratulating the committee on taking this bold initiative to hold these hearings.  We express sincere thanks.<br />The Irish Council for Civil Liberties is Ireland's independent human rights watchdog with a consistent track record as a leader in international human rights reporting, including under the ICCPR, other UN treaties and the universal periodic review.  As the committee already heard, the ICCL co-ordinates a civil society coalition on the ICCPR comprising 11 organisations, some of which have appeared before the committee today.  I also refer the committee to two publications we have produced on treaty reporting.  One is our shadow reporting toolkit, giving organisations information for reporting on international treaties, and the other is our plain English guide to UPR, both of which are available to download from our website <i>rightsnow.ie</i>.  <br />I will lead off on the first matter we have been asked to addressed today, which is the article 26 implications for migrant victims of domestic violence.  My colleague, Ms Deirdre Duffy, will cover the second point regarding the role of national implementation mechanisms, which could support the treaty body system.  The response of Ireland to the list of issues refers to the immigration guidelines for victims of domestic violence produced by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INMS.  An initial difficulty presented in these guidelines, in particular for victims of domestic violence, is that they are not widely available and are only published in the news and events section of the INMS website and on the Cosc, the National Office for Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence website.  However, on a broader scale, migrants who are victims of domestic violence do not receive the same protections under Irish law as an Irish victim of similar violence.  For a start, the guidelines produced by INMS are just that - guidelines - whereas, as I set out in response to the list of issues, people in Ireland who experience violence have legal recourse and protections available under the 1996 and 2011 domestic violence legislation.  <br />The reality for migrant people who are present in Ireland on the basis of a residency permit, which makes their legal residency conditional on being a family member, is that if they suffer violence at the hands of their partner, the current system provides an additional barrier to their seeking protection.  Let us take the example of a woman in a violent relationship who has come to Ireland on a family visa and whose partner is abusive.  If she and most likely her children leave the abusive situation, she is no longer complying with the terms of her residency permit.  She must inform the Minister of her difficult circumstances and can apply for a change in status under the guidelines but there is no guarantee that her status will be changed, how long she will have to wait for a decision or what, if any, status might be afforded to her.  The guidelines are a discretionary mechanism.  For example, if she is given a stamp 3 status, she has no access to social welfare or many shelters assisting victims of domestic violence.  Indeed, groups working on this issue report that migrant victims of domestic violence are turned away from these supports.  In most cases, in order re-register, she will have to pay the &euro;300 Garda Immigration Bureau registration fee even where she is left penniless as a result of her separation.<br />As the committee may know, victims of domestic violence and abusive family situations often find it difficult to extricate themselves from the grip of the abuser.  For migrant victims this is compounded by a system which seeks to provide protection under the guidelines if they can be found rather than under legislation.  A victim faces an additional fear of deportation should she attempt to leave.  In our opinion this does not amount to equality before the law under article 26.<br />I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Deirdre Duffy, to address the second issue raised by the committee.</p></speech>

Similar to all treaty body monitoring, the ICCPR is a cyclical process whereby the ongoing obligations of states under the treaty are examined on a periodic basis.  As the committee will already have heard today, in particular from Professor O'Flaherty, Ireland signs up to these international obligations, agrees to be bound and periodically it submits reports and enters into dialogue with the  committee in question.  It then receives a series of recommendations on the gaps that exist in meeting its obligations under that particular treaty.</p><p>  Civil society also has an important role to play in this regard in giving information to the State, in giving information to the committee and in engaging rights holders in this process.  That description is the process in its simplest form.  It is a cycle of human rights reporting and monitoring and no one piece will ever reach its full potential without the other components living up to theirs.  Ireland's engagement with international human rights reporting is broadly positive.  We had an excellent experience of the first UPR examination in 2011.  However, there is one key aspect where we fall short time and again.  The weak cog in the machine, as we see it, is the implementation of recommendations.  In Ireland, this circle is rarely completed.  We see this in the repetition of recommendations made by the UN Human Rights Committee and other UN committees over the years.  </p><p>  On foot of Ireland's success in being elected to the UN Human Rights Council in 2012, the ICCL developed the legacy project to highlight the systemic impediments to the full implementation of UN committee recommendations and international human rights standards in Ireland.  We believe that implementation of UN recommendations at home is key to a country's capacity to promote and protect human rights abroad.  The legacy project is tracking the process of seven key impact areas throughout the term of Ireland's membership of the council.  These are issues which civil society groups and other human rights advocates have been progressing for many years.  In our opinion, it is a serious concern that the recommendations of UN committees and the UN Council - this opinion is shared at international level - often have not given rise to any change whatsoever in law, practice or policy or appear to remain permanently immovable.  For example, members will have heard reference today to the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.   There are numerous recommendations over the years from UN bodies on this issue.</p><p>  The rationale behind the legacy project is to track the progress of these specific issues which have already been spot lighted by the UN system to assist us in answering the following question.  If the UN reporting mechanisms have highlighted these areas where change is needed to protection human rights in Ireland, why has this not happened?  For example, Ireland signed, but has not yet ratified, the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities - the committee heard from the Rehab Group - and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, otherwise known OPCAT.  Reference to OPCAT is all the more poignant given that last week saw the publication of the McMorrow report into the tragic death of Gary Douch in Mountjoy Jail and the attending failures on behalf of the State in this respect.</p><p>  To explain briefly, OPCAT requires the establishment of a national preventative mechanism, NPM, which through its consistent inspection regime works to ensure places of detention meet international human rights standards and, therefore, deaths such as Gary's and other similar incidents could be prevented.  Despite signalling its commitment to OPCAT and receiving numerous recommendations from UN bodies to move to ratification, the Government maintains that an NPM which meets the requirement of the treaty must be established before we can ratify.  However, the situation we are in now is that there is no public information available as to the steps being undertaken by Ireland to progress the development of this mechanism.  We know the draft places of detention Bill is languishing in the lower end of the legislative priorities and little else in regard to the Government's priorities on this issue.  This leaves us in a highly unsatisfactory situation where ratification is not forthcoming due to a lack of domestic legislation and, as far as we are aware, there is no impetus to prioritise this legislation to comply with these international human rights standards.</p> <p> Turning to consider how this system can be improved, unless systemic change occurs to institutional domestic structures, it is very difficult to envisage how international human rights standards will be fully implemented in Ireland.  As such, the treaty monitoring cycle under ICCPR, which is the subject of today's discussion, will never really be completed.  However, the ICCL believes that implementation could be significantly progressed by the establishment of an institutional oversight mechanism.  We have in mind something akin to a multi-stakeholder platform which could monitor the realisation of treaty body and UPR recommendations at domestic level.  </p><p> I refer to examples in other countries which have various mechanisms.  Members will be aware of the joint committee on human rights in England and Wales.  In France, a body which monitors French compliance with international recommendations from the UN sits within the office of the prime minister.</p><p> As part of the legacy project, the ICCL is in the process of developing further research on the use of these oversight bodies.  What is clear from our initial soundings is that each country needs to devise its own mechanism suited to its particular legal and democratic structure.  I referred to the ratification of OPCAT, Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.  Ireland received a series of recommendations on this issue as part of its UPR examination.  Ireland led the way internationally in its engagement in the UPR and this engagement was highly regarded.  However, back in Ireland where the rights-holders are waiting for protection, to assist this process an interdepartmental working group was established to oversee Ireland's UPR reporting process.  This initiative was broadly welcomed by civil society, including the ICCL.  However, we have little or no information regarding the process of the implementation of UPR recommendations.  No information is forthcoming from this group and we are not aware of the work being carried out.</p><p> If we mean to take human rights seriously, implementation of treaty body recommendations must be our goal.  We believe that a multi-stakeholder implementation platform consisting of senior representatives from key operational Departments, civil society groups, the national human rights institution, perhaps Oireachtas Members and other relevant stakeholders could track and monitor the progress of these issues highlighted by the treaty monitoring bodies.  We envisage a structure such as this would be best placed in the Office of the Taoiseach.  Such a mechanism should be conducted in a transparent fashion.  </p><p> We foresee the Oireachtas as an additional layer of accountability which would serve to copper-fasten the process.  The implementation platform could be required to report annually to a relevant Oireachtas committee.  This creature could take a form suitable to our own political and democratic systems but in order to move beyond the current lacuna, we need to think of an effective mechanism to make these recommendations count; otherwise, there is no point.  Whatever form that takes - the discussion should be carried out in an inclusive fashion - the structure should be transparent, participatory and accountable to an external body.  At the moment we do not know how these recommendations are being progressed.  The legacy project will produce further materials on the concept of this implementation platform.  We would wish to incorporate the views of public representatives on the concept.</p><p> I wish to briefly address an additional matter which was not included in our previous submissions or in the Government's response to the list of issues.  The campaign group, Survivors of Symphysiotomy has recently joined the ICCPR steering group and we are happy to be working with the group to highlight its issues before the UN Human Rights Committee.  The group's call to the committee will centre in the main around the lack of remedy in Ireland for the wrongs suffered by women who had symphysiotomies carried out on them in Irish hospitals, potentially breaching their rights to be free from inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment and their right to privacy.  We have copies of the SOS submission to the human rights committee with us should Senators wish to have additional information.  We are happy to answer any questions from Senators.</p></speech>

TENI was invited here today to discuss how the lack of legal gender recognition negatively impacts transgender people under the age of 18, with reference to ICCP Article 16 obligations.  For those who are not familiar with the organisation, TENI is Ireland's national, non-profit transgender organisation.  We support transgender people and their families and we provide education and advocate for the rights and equality of this community.</p><p>  TENI works specifically on the introduction of legal gender recognition.  This is the process whereby trans people are seen as a true gender by the State and are issued with a new birth certificate.  The Irish State has an obligation under the ICCPR to legally recognise gender identity.  At the moment, Ireland is the only country in the EU that provides no such provision, despite the fact that Dr. Lydia Foy won her case to be legally recognised in her true gender in the High Court in 2007.  Ireland was declared in breach of its positive obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In 2008, the human rights committee called on Ireland to recognise the right of transgender persons to a change of gender by permitting the issuance of a new birth certificate.  Six years' later, Dr. Lydia Foy and the entire trans community are still waiting for the right to be legally recognised.</p><p>  The legal recognition of transgender people is integral to their health, safety and mental well-being.  The lack of recognition runs counter to Article 16 of the convention which states that everyone shall have the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.  The lack of legal recognition for trans people under the age of 18 can have a particularly negative impact.  Research shows that most people develop a sense of their gender identity, that internal feeling of being either male or female or something else, between the ages of three and five years.  Many transgender young people are aware of their gender identities at a very young age and increasingly they are expressing this and seeking support.</p><p>  In 2013, TENI was contacted 233 times by families in such situations.  These families often went through quite a difficult journey to get to that point where they were reaching out.  It is clear that this is a growing issue.  As one mother told me when speaking about her transgender son, "It is better to have a happy son than a dead daughter".  Unfortunately, this is really the current situation for young trans people.  TENI carried out a study last year in which we asked people about their mental health and well-being.  We found that 40% of our respondents had attempted suicide.  When we are talking about the mental health and well-being of the transgender community, particularly the young people, there is a very obvious link to legal recognition in being acknowledged for who one truly is.</p><p>  We have found that when young trans people receive support they are able to thrive.  The lack of legal recognition leaves people particularly vulnerable.  For instance, transgender young people are at a heightened risk of peer bullying.  The perpetuation of young trans persons' exclusion through the failure to legally recognise their gender identity reinforces stress and isolation.  For instance, one young trans man with whom we work was bullied for two years in his State school.  His mother eventually had to pull him out of the school and take out a loan to be able to send him to a school where he was able to live in his chosen gender, be referred to as Darren and be acknowledged for who he truly was.  In another instance, a young trans man is going to a school and he is forced to wear a skirt every day as part of the school uniform.  This is despite the fact that he is supported by his family and friends.  Unfortunately, his principal is not required to support or acknowledge his gender identity.</p><p>  In addition to these stories of people's day-to-day experiences, there is also a structural issue.  The refusal of the State to issue new birth certificates creates significant difficulties for trans people when they are applying for university.  Trans people often miss out on college placements because the CAO, the body responsible for assigning university places, is often unable to cope or to understand trans experiences.  One student who transitioned subsequently decided to re-sit the leaving certificate examination but because the documents were different and his name and gender were different, the CAO lost this, assumed an error had occurred and he was subsequently denied a placement.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we often hear these types of stories.  This is particularly important in a country where 10% of students at third level are under the age of 18 years.  The proposal under which persons under 18 years will not be able to secure legal recognition will leave such students in limbo, one which will have a negative impact on them for the rest of their lives.  </p><p> It is clear from our work that transgender adults face barriers to employment.  The study to which I referred showed that 49% of participants were not employed on either a full-time or part-time basis.  For this reason, it is particularly important that young transgender people stay in school and we are able to support them to go through this process in order that they will have a better chance of gaining employment later in life.  Unfortunately, this is often not the case.  One parent of a six year old transgender girl told us that her child faced so many challenges in school because of her gender identity and lack of support that she had to withdraw the child from school.  Her calls to the Department of Education and Skills went unanswered and she was forced to home school her child as she was not able to avail of the system.  This experience left her with severe stress and resulted in the child feeling excluded and isolated.  The absence of a directive, guidance, policy or legal protection is an explicit failure which must be remedied. </p><p> In July 2013, the Minister for Social Protection introduced a draft scheme of gender recognition.  As such, the Government is seeking to remedy this matter and introduce legislation quickly, which is a positive and welcome development, albeit one that has been a long time coming.  While we look forward to advancing this issue, unfortunately, the proposed legislation sets out criteria that include an age limit of 18 years.  As I outlined, this would leave many young transgender people in limbo because they will not be able to access their legal gender recognition until they reach 18 years.  The six year old child to whom I referred and young children in secondary school will have to wait for a long time and at each stop they will face significant barriers. </p><p> One positive development in recent months was the decision to refer the gender recognition scheme to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  The joint committee recommended that the legal recognition age be reduced from 18 years to 16 years.  This is a positive development which echoed the advice issued by the Ombudsman for Children who suggested that the age at which an individual could apply on his or her own be reduced to 16 years and that the parents or guardians of young people aged under 16 years would be able to apply for legal recognition on their behalf.  We hope the legislation will proceed on that basis.</p><p> I have spent much of my contribution speaking for young transgender people because we rarely hear their voices or those of their parents.  Given that transgender issues are generally invisible, it is important to speak of rights and how Article 16 affects transgender people but also in terms of day-to-day issues.  If legislation is introduced and the State advances the issue in a manner that protects the rights, dignity and privacy of young transgender people, we will have an opportunity to make significant advances.  We will also be able to provide these young people with an opportunity to move forward and have the best chance of becoming engaging and vibrant members of society. </p><p> To sum up, the legal recognition of transgender persons is integral to their safety, health and well-being.  The recognition of transgender people under 18 years is vital in promoting rights, dignity, privacy and access to education and the failure to provide for such recognition runs counter to Article 16.  Ireland can protect these young people.  There is an opportunity to introduce legislation that sets a precedent and truly respects the rights and privacy of these young people.</p><p> I thank Senators for affording me an opportunity to discuss this issue.  I will be pleased to discuss in greater detail how this works in terms of the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights and the other ramifications of legal recognition. </p></speech>

It is extraordinary that victims of trafficking who are in the asylum process have fewer rights than alleged victims of trafficking who are not in the asylum process.  Ms Becker set out clearly the reasons this is currently the case.  Would this anomaly be best fixed by applying the administrative immigration arrangements to victims of trafficking who are in the asylum process?  Is that a straightforward approach that would enable such persons to be issued with temporary resident permits once they had been identified as trafficking victims?  Is that the best way to resolve the problem?  It is not clear if this is simply an administrative anomaly or if there is a policy reason behind it.  Are the witnesses aware of the reason the system developed in this manner?  From what Ms Becker said, it appears to have developed somewhat inadvertently, although I am not sure if that is the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600025#Y00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  If we needed further reasons to review direct provision, Ms Becker has provided them, specifically in respect of victims of trafficking who are seeking asylum.  The figures Ms Becker provided are alarming.  I ask her to elaborate on the reasons for her statement that direct provision is not appropriate for victims of sexual violence.  While I have an idea as to what they may be, it would be useful to have them stated on the record.</p><p>  Another issue related to the direct provision system of serious concern to me is the children who are born stateless, as it were.  In some cases, children are born into the asylum system whose parents have been in the system for ten, 11 or 12 years.  Such children do not have Irish citizenship and I am not sure what is the position as regards citizenship of the countries of origin of their parents.  Is this a violation of their human rights?  I know the law was changed here to provide that such persons would no longer be entitled to Irish citizenship.  Is this process fair under the United Nations conventions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilkke Becker" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600025#Y00500"><p>Senator Bacik asked if the solution to the anomaly in the system lay in the current administrative arrangements and whether the current position amounts to deliberate exclusion.  I will respond to her questions in reverse order.  A concern has been expressed that bogus claims could be made concerning trafficking if we treated the victims of trafficking too favourably.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland does not share this concern as we have in place an administrative system that can deal with claims.  People would not put themselves through this process lightly.  Becoming or being recognised as a suspected victim of trafficking involves an excruciating and detailed process of interviews, as is appropriate, which forms part of a potential police investigation.  Where prosecutions follow, the victims of trafficking may present themselves as witnesses.  I do not agree that someone would lightly claim to be trafficked if he or she had not been trafficked.</p><p>  We do not necessarily believe that every victim of trafficking is in need of international protection in that not every victim of trafficking would qualify for refugee status.  Our concern is that those who are clearly in need of international protection are discouraged from accessing the mechanism that would otherwise be open to them.  The solution is for the administrative immigration arrangements to simply acknowledge that the permit granted under the Refugee Act does not live up to the standard required by international law.  As is done in other European Union member state jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, these arrangements should allow a parallel system under which full stamp 4 resident permits would be provided to suspected victims of trafficking while they are assisting with the investigation and prosecution of a claim.  They should be allowed, in parallel and where necessary, to apply for asylum and go through that process. </p><p>  On direct provision, we are echoing what we hear from clients.  For example, some of those being accommodated in mixed accommodation may be known to have been involved involuntarily in prostitution and might, therefore, be even more vulnerable to sexual advances and harassment within mixed hostels. </p> <p>Again it is something that has been echoed internationally and something that has been highlighted by the Council of Europe GRETA committee.</p><p> Given that this is the work of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, I am focusing on victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The people - predominantly women - we deal with would all be victims of sexual violence.  We should also not forget that there are, of course, victims of trafficking who are victims of labour exploitation.  When we concentrate on victims of sexual violence, clearly there must be women-only accommodation and organisations such as Women's Aid and Ruhama would echo this.  We need accommodation that provides more protection where women can recover in peace.</p><p> The question of statelessness is an entirely different issue.  Just not becoming an Irish citizen through birth, as we had until 2004, does not necessarily leave children stateless - they would ordinarily acquire the nationality of their parent.  This is an area in which the Immigrant Council also works.  We are concerned about children being left stateless where they cannot claim citizenship of their parents for one reason or the other.  That would be something that would fall under the right to private life basically - the right to recognition as a person - similar to being recognised as a transgender person.  That is the angle from which we would view the issue of statelessness.</p></speech>

I will paraphrase what they might have meant to us but were too polite to say - when it comes to our international obligations, we talk the talk but do not walk the walk in many cases.  They mentioned the monitoring role.  The Public Service Oversight and Petitions Committee was given responsibility for that because the Office of the Ombudsman found itself in a similar position in that it was laying reports before these Houses and nothing was happening with them.  The witnesses mentioned the Department of the Taoiseach.  Where do they believe that responsibility should sit?  When we made proposals to change the mechanisms of the Houses, we recommended establishing a committee that would basically mark the Department of the Taoiseach and be chaired by an Opposition Deputy or Senator.  Could such an Oireachtas committee be useful in checking that these obligations have been lived up to?  Could the Seanad take that legislative role of overseeing these international obligations on an organised basis and debate whether we are living up to that when the deadlines approach?</p><p>  I welcome that the survivors of symphysiotomy have become part of this group.  They have full support in the Seanad for their issues.</p><p>  On the issue of talking the talk and not walking the walk, we get frustrated when we raise issues relating to asylum, immigration, etc., and are told a Bill is in the offing or that the heads of Bill have been prepared.  There have been heads of an IRP Bill since 2010, but it has been stalled - we are told it is coming forward.  In an international scenario, if the UNHRC comes back and advises we need to move on this and the Government responds that legislation is in the offing, is that enough to kick to touch from a legal perspective and is it good enough?</p></speech>

It sounds like a complicated issue and it could be a multi-stakeholder implementation platform, etc.  The in-trays of the Department of the Taoiseach could become very full if all the various independent oversight, etc.,that we recommended were placed there.  I am not saying it should not be there.  Have the witnesses considered any existing structure that could be adapted to perform this kind of function?</p><p>  In the context of the report we will prepare, if we were to comment on this, is it something the witnesses believe should be studied and implemented by the time the next round happens; is it something that could be done relatively quickly or should a working group be set up to ensure this happens?  I would welcome a few practical suggestions on this aspect.</p></speech>

I will try to answer together the questions raised by both Senators.  In many respects the implementation of recommendations is very difficult for the Departments here because the way the portfolios are set out, responsibilities lie in different areas.  For example the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for international engagement, but implementation largely falls to Departments with greater engagement in domestic issues.  Without wanting to complicate the system or create another structure, there has to be a way to get the internal structures talking to one another.  That is why we suggest bringing them together in some form of platform.  As we know, resources are very tight in terms of priorities - not even money but workload and official responsibility.  To be fair to the officials already there, I do not believe it is a case of not walking the walk, in many respects nobody really knows who is in charge of what and it just has not been organised.</p><p>  The Senator asked about this happening on an organised basis and if we were to present our argument in a nutshell, which perhaps we should have done, that is exactly what we are getting at.  It just needs to be organised, but it also needs to be transparent.  We need to bear in mind that we are talking about human rights.  The rights holders need to sit at the centre of any human rights discussion.  We need their empowerment and participation.  That is why we are struggling and coming up against a system where we cannot seem to get through it.  We do not know what is happening.  We do not know who is moving where or how things are moving.</p><p>  I take the Senator's point about possible overload in the Department of the Taoiseach.  That may be seen as the Holy Grail these days whereby people feel if responsibility were moved in there, things might change.  There could well be a very important role for any aspect of the Oireachtas - for the Seanad, for a committee.  We are here today largely to inform the committee that our years of experience of working in this area have shown us that this is where we need to go.</p><p>  This is not something that can be solved overnight.  It should not be put on the long finger either because we will be in the same situation in four years unless we move it ahead.  While it is not something that needs to be expedited for this particular report, it would be excellent to hear a Government representative tell the UN committee in July that this was something it was considering.  That would show a major commitment on its part to implementation.</p><p>  In terms of an existing institution, we have our new national human rights and equality institution coming on board.  We have experts such as Professor O'Flaherty in this country.  I believe we can work through this and come up with something that is suitable to everyone and achieves our aims.  How we go about that needs to be very participatory, particularly in terms of the groups the committee has taken the time to listen to today.  Ultimately people such as Ms Becker and Mr. Giambrone represent the rights holders whose rights are being affected when these recommendations are not implemented.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that two Bills were introduced, one in 2007, which fell, and the second in 2010.  The committee made reference to this in its previous concluding observations.  It is fair to say that the committee would take a dim view if the only response the State provides was to state that more legislation was in the offing or the same legislation was in the offing again.  Although slightly amended, we now effectively have legislation straddling two Administrations.</p> <p>I think the committee will seek a timeline and it will express its disappointment that Ireland has not managed to bring that forward.</p></speech>

This issue has been recognised by the Oireachtas and we have received their written submissions, which will be incorporated in our report.  I do not wish to make a political point but is it not the case that it is a political decision to move that forward with a view to compensation and so forth?  Even though we are incorporating it in our report, it might be appropriate for them also to engage with the Government and the responsible Ministers.</p></speech>

It is obviously a political decision to move this on, but it is political as well as legal in the sense that these women have rights under the ICCPR to an effective remedy.  By signing up to that treaty the State has a duty and obligation to provide that remedy.  My understanding is that, at present, the redress schemes that are being suggested do not meet the requirements under ICCPR in terms of independent valuation and other matters.</p></speech>

My question is about the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, which has reviewed the provisions in the general scheme that the Minister, Deputy Burton, published last year.  I understand that Mr. Giambrone is happy with the recommendation made by the committee that the age would be reduced to 16 years.  Rather than duplicating the work of the committee, would he endorse or agree with the recommendation the committee made more generally on the scheme of the Bill?  Should this committee also refer to the joint committee recommendations, as that committee conducted a very thorough examination?</p></speech>

That is very powerful.  With regard to the recommendations of the committee on the Bill, I understand that a Bill is almost ready and awaiting publication.  We are still waiting.

It highlights the huge effects that the lack of legal gender recognition presents for young people under 18 years of age.  The Government is expressing its willingness to consider lowering the age of legal recognition to 16 years with parental consent.  Would he still have a concern regarding people under the age of 16 years and how might that be addressed?</p></speech>

I hope this committee would support the recommendation of the education committee on lowering the age of recognition.  I attended some of the debate on that and it was a full and vibrant debate.  It is a recommendation from the Oireachtas committee as opposed to the Government's policy, so there is some work to be done in that regard.  However, I hope that this committee will unequivocally support that recommendation and try to have it moved forward as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is a question of making ground on these issues.  Twenty years ago I doubt that any Member of the Oireachtas or an Oireachtas committee would have engaged on this, so some progress has been made.  Personally, I believe six years of age is a very tender young age.  If the legislation could be brought forward and provided for the age of 16 years rather than 18 years, as the education committee has recommended, you would be achieving a tremendous amount.  In my experience as a solicitor, I recall that in one instance in which I was involved offices such the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths were extremely facilitating, as was the Passport Office.  I am not saying there are no difficulties as I am aware that bullying is an issue, although I am not sure if legislation will resolve that.  I accept your comment that approximately 40% are in danger of committing suicide.  I have seen those figures and I believe they are correct, but I am not sure if legislation in itself will address that.  I believe there has to be a change in attitude by society in Ireland.  I found your presentation very accurate.</p><p>  Some progress is being made.  The big move for us is that the legislation as proposed could be put on the agenda and instead of being planned be brought before the Oireachtas.  We would very much like to have it brought before the Seanad, if that can happen in the lifetime of this Government.  I am not sure where it stands at present.</p><p>  With those observations I invite you to respond to the questions that were asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-06a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Broden Giambrone" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2014050600027#AA01100"><p>There were a number of questions and I will try to respond to all of them.  First, I will address your observation about a young person six years old, or even younger in certain cases, being so aware of their gender identity and how that is a tender age.  In these situations these tend to be young people who are articulating their gender identity over and over again.  They are young people who, in certain instances, if they are not able to be the gender they truly are, occasionally self-harm and threaten suicide.  These are children.  The issue is, of course, that it can be quite difficult to discuss.  Parents often have a great deal of difficulty supporting their children, because children are young and they articulate a variety of thoughts and feelings.  However, it is a very specific situation when a young person is saying it over and over again, often over the course of many years.  It is not a situation where these parents say, "My child has said they are a little boy, so therefore they are a little boy.  We will go through the whole process of changing documents".  It is a journey that the family goes through and when they are able to receive support, it becomes a much healthier process.</p><p>  We are very conscious that young people are in a vulnerable situation, but what we are talking about in terms of legal recognition is very much about supporting that young person to be who they are.  A legal recognition process can be an important piece of that.  It is not for every young person and certainly not for every family and for that reason I acknowledge there must be a process to ensure one is protecting the young people.  We often talk about protecting them in terms of not allowing them to do something whereas what we are talking about is protecting them with regard to their mental health and well-being and one can see how much better that gets when they are supported.  I believe legal recognition would be a big part of that, particularly in the cases where parents and guardians support their young child.  They know best what their child's needs are.  That is to give a little background in that regard.</p><p>  I agree that legal recognition will not change all the attitudes, but I believe it is very significant in the sense that it shows the State acknowledges that trans people exist.</p> <p>There is the political motivation and there are the practical issues I have discussed.  This will go a long way.  I am delighted to be able to sit here and speak about these issues because, as the Senator said, I do not think we would have been able to have this conversation five or even three years ago.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to address this committee and to have such a comprehensive discussion.</p><p> We are very happy with what the committee has recommended.  It went through a very robust process.  We and many civil society organisations, legal and medical experts, were involved.  The recommendations that came out of the process are quite strong.  I hope they will be seriously considered and taken on board.</p><p> While we are in favour of lowering the age to 16 it leaves people under the age of 16 in a vulnerable situation.  We advocated that between the ages of 16 and 18 individuals could apply for legal recognition on their own.  This is in line with other legislation in Ireland.  At the moment a transgender person can seek medical transition at the age of 16 without parental consent so it only makes sense to bring the legislation in line with that.  Otherwise, someone could physically change their body but is not legally recognised.  For those individuals under the age of 16 such as the six year old I spoke of, or others whom we know aged 12 or 13, waiting until they are 16 to be recognised is a long time too.  We urge the conversation to continue about how to support people under the age of 16.</p><p> The committee also suggested that guidelines be introduced in schools.  This is one of the most significant areas where young people face barriers and challenges such as peer bullying, exclusion, isolation or not being able to access education.  Having that in place to support young transgender people would be a way to deal with this if it is not possible to consider the recognition of people under the age of 16 with the support of parents or guardians.  I hope we can have this conversation in greater detail.</p><p> We are aware that the report on the general scheme of a Gender Recognition Bill 2013 from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection will go before the D&aacute;il this Friday at noon for discussion.  I am not aware of much beyond that or how far along the legislation is.  This is an opportunity to discuss these issues, to tease out some of the difficulties and to address the ways this may challenge people and to provide additional information.  I am optimistic that this is a positive step forward.  The committee&rsquo;s report was very good and hopefully this will have an impact on how the legislation is drafted and a Bill will come forward very soon.</p></speech>
