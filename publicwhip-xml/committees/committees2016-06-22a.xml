I remind members to turn off their mobile telephones as they affect the technology.  I welcome the members, particularly those who are newly elected and also the new members of this committee.  Some of those present, including me, were members of the previous committee.  I am looking forward to chairing this committee, which I believe is important.  Those involved with the previous committee will acknowledge it did much good and valuable work.  We may not have got as much credit and praise for the work we did as might have been expected but I still believe the committee did a lot of very good work.  With the new structures, this committee could be very effective in the future.</p> <p>  The committee will undertake to perform the functions set out in Standing Orders and report to the D&aacute;il on such aspects of expenditure, administration and policy of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and European matters as are within the remit of that Department.  I propose to go into private session to discuss the arrangements and format for today's meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed.  I wish him well in his new appointment and look forward to working in a constructive way with him and his officials in the coming period.</p> <p>  I remind members to turn off their mobile telephones as they affect the technology.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  We are meeting to consider the Revised Estimates for the year ending 31 December 2016, Vote 30 - Agriculture Food and the Marine, referred by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16 June.  As agreed to in private session, the meeting will follow the following structure.  A fixed time will be allocated to consider each programme, A to E, with the option of returning to a particular programme after each has been gone through if issues remain outstanding.  This will allow members with an interest in particular programmes to schedule their time and ensure the committee gives consideration to all programmes.  The timetable for the meeting has been circulated to each member.  I understand the Minister will make a brief statement.  I ask him to be as brief as possible and we will then get to the main points of the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, we express some disappointment at only receiving the facts and figures within the last 24 hours, despite our having requested the information ten days ago.  I mention this for future reference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#F00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  With regard to his last remark, we only became aware of the date for the Estimates meeting last Thursday.  We would have been anxious to facilitate the committee at the earliest possible date and we did, in fact, make offers of a departmental briefing to all the relevant spokespersons.  While I appreciate the time is a little truncated, there was no intention on my part or that of my staff to in any way hinder the effective work of the committee.</p> <p>  I very much look forward to working with the committee.  It is a novel experience for me to be sitting on this side of an Estimates process and I very much welcome the opportunity to be here this morning.  I look forward to working with the Chairman, his committee colleagues and the staff of the committee, of whose dedication and commitment to the sector I have known for many years.</p> <p>  I will commence by introducing my officials: Anne Derwin, assistant secretary; Paul Dillon, assistant secretary; Cecil Beamish, assistant secretary; Heber McMahon, principal officer; Kay Ryan, principal officer; and Martin Crowley, assistant principal.  I hope we can have an effective meeting and discussion of the Estimates.</p> <p>  I am very pleased to accept the invitation to meet the committee.  This is a valuable opportunity to review how we are progressing with the current challenges and opportunities presented across the various agriculture, food development, marine and forestry sectors and to talk about market prospects across these areas, as well as new investment opportunities for the coming year.  As the programme for a partnership Government identifies, agriculture is the heartbeat of the rural economy.  The agri-food commitments in the programme for Government align closely with both Food Wise 2025 and the agri-food actions in the 2016 Action Plan for Jobs.  I look forward to working closely with Cabinet colleagues who have responsibility pertaining to rural Ireland and with members of this committee.  I will particularly emphasise the importance of improving profitability at farm level through a focus on competitiveness, innovation and knowledge transfer; continuing the growth of the food industry through market development, consumer insights and innovation; and enhancing our existing strong reputation for food safety and environmentally sustainable food systems.</p> <p>  My Department has 65 detailed commitments in the programme for a partnership Government.  I have identified the following priorities for action: first, to respond to price volatility, including through initiatives and access to finance and taxation; and, second, to lead the implementation of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  In regard to market development, we must maintain existing markets and develop new markets.  In regard to the Common Agricultural Policy and other related EU actions, I will progress discussions with the European Commission on the detailed commitments on the CAP, Pillar 1, and on the rural development programme.</p><p>Environmental sustainability is a key issue in Irish agriculture.  We must ensure effective input into negotiations on new EU climate and energy policy to 2030 and to Ireland's first national mitigation plan.  On seafood and the marine, my priority will be to implement the Harnessing our Ocean Wealth strategy and the seafood development programme.</p><p> The agri-food sector is an important engine for growth in rural areas, providing valuable jobs to rural communities and contributing to the wider economy.  The sector continues to play a considerable role in our economic recovery and to prove its fundamental importance as a cornerstone of the economy and life of rural Ireland.  The sector remains Ireland's largest indigenous industry and provides valuable employment, particularly in rural and coastal areas, where few other job opportunities exist.</p><p> I am pleased to say the budget allocation for 2016 reflects a significant Exchequer recognition of the importance of the sector and demonstrates a further commitment to support for agriculture, food and the marine.  The Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounts to &euro;1.363 billion in 2016 - &euro;1.134 billion on current expenditure and &euro;229 million on capital expenditure, including a carryover of &euro;12 million in capital funding.  This represents an overall increase of &euro;109 million over the original 2015 Estimate and of &euro;38 million when last year's supplementary budgets are taken into account, and it takes account of new priorities, including the expanding new rural development programme and the seafood development programme.  In addition to the Department Vote, in 2016 Ireland will receive some &euro;1.2 billion in direct funding from the EU for the basic payment scheme.  This brings the combined investment in Irish agriculture, food and the marine to over &euro;2.5 billion in 2016.</p><p> I will move on to programme group A.  This programme focuses on progressing the economic development of the agri-food, forestry and marine sectors, including facilitating the achievement of Food Wise 2025.  The-----</p></speech>

The advancement of the elements of this programme requires effective participation in policy negotiations and developments at national, EU and international levels, and the development, implementation and review of the appropriate national strategic policy documents and policy positions.  State bodies are also provided with funding for their development, promotion, research, advice and training activities.</p> <p>  All of this is designed to ensure the Department has the capacity to engage in effective economic policy analysis and planning to underpin competitiveness, efficiency and development of the agri-food and fishing sector and the rural and coastal economy.  Overall, &euro;450.8 million has been allocated to the subheads under this programme in 2016 in pursuit of the priorities outlined in budget 2016.  For the seafood development programme, some &euro;36 million is being made available to my Department, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to fund the roll-out of schemes under the seafood development programme.</p><p>Bord Iascaigh Mhara is the main implementing body responsible for delivering supports to the fisheries, aquaculture and processing sectors and will be responsible this year for a seafood development programme budget of &euro;23.7 million.  To date, it has lunched eight schemes.  In the area of aquaculture two schemes are open - the knowledge gateway scheme and the sustainable aquaculture scheme.  In the area of seafood processing, three new schemes are open - the capital investment programme, the innovation and planning and scaling scheme and the new market development scheme.  In the fisheries area three new schemes are open - the inshore fisheries conservation scheme, the fisheries local area development scheme and the sustainable fisheries scheme.</p><p> Last month I announced the award of &euro;4.3 million to 51 beneficiaries under five of the schemes which will ultimately lead to an investment of &euro;21 million in the seafood sector this year and further grants will follow throughout the year.  Later this year, BIM will also launch a fleet decommissioning scheme and an engine replacement scheme which is an energy efficiency measure.</p><p> A key area of expenditure under the rural development programme is the beef data and genomics programme scheme which will have funding of &euro;300 million over its lifespan, &euro;52 million of which will be available in 2016.  This innovative scheme will have a strong cohort of more than 25,000 participants and since payments began last December, more than 21,500 farmers have been paid a total of more than &euro;39 million.  These payments are continuing on an ongoing basis as compliance with the 2015 programme is verified.</p><p> In regard to the horse and greyhound fund, the State supports both industries as provided through the horse and greyhound racing fund.  The 2016 budget for my Department provided for increased funding of &euro;6 million, or almost 9%, to &euro;74 million in the allocation for the fund - &euro;4.8 million for Horse Racing Ireland and &euro;1.2 million for Bord na gCon. </p></speech>

Let us start with programme A.  I call Deputy McConalogue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#H00300"><p>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  This is our first committee meeting.  I welcome also the Department officials.  I congratulate also Deputy Pat Deering on his appointment as committee chairperson.</p> <p>  The question I wish to put is on the beef data and genomics scheme.  According to the Minister's projects what is the likely spend for the year?  I am aware that &euro;52 million has been allocated to the scheme.  It has 25,000 participants and that the number predicted for the year is 27,000.  Is it the Minister's intention to reopen the scheme to new entrants?  Does he expect that &euro;52 million to be spent this year and, if not, how much of it does he expect will be spent?  Looking at the 2015 figures, initially &euro;52 million was allocated towards the beef data and genomics  scheme but only &euro;35 million was spent.  In the Supplementary Estimates, &euro;17 million was removed from the allocation because of an underspend.  Given that &euro;17 million was underspent last year, are we facing a similar underspend this year?  What happened to that underspend last year?  Will it stay within the overall spend between now and 2020 and will it be available to be reallocated to other schemes?</p></speech>

I will take the three questions together.  I call Deputy Martin Kenny to be followed by Deputy Willie Penrose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#H00500"><p>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment.  I congratulate also the Chairman on his appointment.  I wish to raise a couple of small points.  In his introduction, the Minister mentioned that in rural Ireland very few other jobs exist outside of agriculture which is one of the factors we are faced with all the time.  I am conscious that the beef genomics scheme payments make up a huge part of the farmer's income, particularly in the part of the country that includes my constituency, which has poor and marginal land, with very small holdings.  Farmers depend very much on all of these schemes.  Issues that arise all the time are the huge delays experienced by farmers in respect of these schemes and also the ability of farmers to access the national reserve scheme.  While many farmers at the outset were concerned about the beef genomics scheme, in particular, and had worries about its complicated nature, at the same time there are still many farmers who want to enter the scheme now and find it has been closed.  They want to make sure that happens.  If the beef genomics scheme is to reopen, when will it open and for what number of new entrants?</p> <p>  I am interested in the seafood area.  It was mentioned that work has been done in respect of aquaculture.</p><p>How many new licences have been issued for aquaculture?  I am aware there were issues around the bays in respect of getting environmental studies done.  How many of those studies have been completed and where have they been?</p></speech>

I call Deputy Willie Penrose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#J00300"><p>I have great respect for the Chairman.  I have another engagement at 10.15 a.m. but I will raise a number of issues to which the Minister can reply whenever he gets the opportunity.  I welcome the Minister to the committee.  It is great to see him here.  He has made a good start in the D&aacute;il and is forthcoming in responding to queries.</p><p>I am delighted to hear about the beef genomics programme.  I was probably the only member of the committee the last time who supported it.  While there was not 90% support for it, there was 120% support from me.  Some of the campaigns that were launched were less than becoming.  Some people were just creating political storms to gain credence about particular positions that were adopted.  Coming from the midlands I could see the value of it, 100%.  I know there were teething problems with various bits and pieces of it.  I want the scheme to be open to as many people as possible.  There was a doomsday scenario, nobody was going to enter it.  Everybody was talking about this but I held firm.  I know farmers on the ground as I probably deal with beef farmers probably more frequently than many.  </p><p>I have a number of queries across the programme.  Perhaps the Minister would take notes.  I beg the indulgence of my colleagues, I am not coming back to ask any more questions.  On programme C, has any progress been made in relation to farmers who had their lands designated special conservation areas, SPAs, for the hen harrier population?  I am aware &euro;70 million was allocated to local-led agricultural environment schemes.  When will a specific scheme be devised to accommodate the 3,700 farmers who were denied compensation promised to them in 2008?  This is not a midlands issue but concerns the Minister's county and possibly the Chairman's county because it affects the sterilisation of lands.  Given that what was done was illegal, there will be a court case at some stage.  I know a number of people joined GLAS<b></b>in order to alleviate their difficulties.  We have met these farmers here at the committee.  Surely a specific scheme over a long period, say, 15 years or so, should be devised.  It would allow them to go into the bank and borrow money on the strength of a 15 year scheme.  They could show they have money coming in every year and could repay.  It is time the issue was dealt with.</p><p>The Minister is dealing also with Teagasc.  The cohort of young farmers need a FETAC level 5 equivalent, similar to the old green certificate, in order to obtain the funding devised under the CAP schemes.  We have singularly failed to provide the necessary places.  There are some 3,500 applicants waiting to get in.  Education is very important.  There are a number of Teagasc offices across the country but what are we going to do to progress this issue?</p><p>Beef is a big issue.  I will be parochial about beef farming.  We cannot go into denial.  The animal identification and movement, AIM, database signals that there will be 80,000 or 90,000 additional cattle coming on stream in the autumn.  That will lead to pressure on prices.  That is the ultimate demand-supply situation.  Will the factories do their usual thing?  One can bet one's bottom dollar they will seize the opportunity.  What plans are in place to deal with the likely overspill in the market and what is being done to open up other potential markets, such as Egypt, Turkey, Iran or wherever?  Are there any developments in the Russian market?  What efforts are being made to reinvigorate the live export opportunities that would offer some opposition to the likely factory cartel that will rear its head at the first opportunistic moment for them?</p><p>Under programme A - electronic identification for sheep - I understand the Minister is quoted as saying that a new tagging scheme has to be part of the &euro;25,000 sheep grant scheme.  That would help the export trade in so far it promotes traceability.  Maybe I misread the Minister or maybe he was misquoted.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility for anybody to be misquoted.  That last time a similar type scheme was introduced it was for a 200 head maximum flock.  If electronic identification was introduced there should be no limit to its application across the sheep flock because they paid &euro;1.20 per head.  A genuine sheep farmer with a flock of 100 ewes or sheep would have to tag all his or her sheep.</p><p>A sheep farmer with a flock of 400 sheep would have to tag all of his or her sheep.  I think the scheme has to be targeted widely.  That is very important, otherwise, it will be increasing costs for producers.</p><p> There is concern about the prevalence of Johne's disease in dairy herds.  Has the Department plans to introduce targeted, additional bio-security or programme measures to combat or reduce the incidence of this disease?  Those wishing to expand their herds may have to resort to buying in animals.  Are we launching a battle to combat this disease similar to what was done in Sweden where they have achieved Johne's disease-free status for their herds?</p><p> Chairman, I am nearly finished.  Let me raise issues in regard to TAMS II scheme in programme C.  There are only 5,300 applicants to date.  I think a snail would move faster than the pace in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  With due respect to everybody who works in the Department, many of whom are colleagues who trained with me, when will the first payments be made?  I am delighted, and fair play to the Minister, that the categories of eligibility for the scheme were expanded, with the inclusion of sheep fencing as an investment item.  Can we put a bit of speed under the process?  It is no use introducing a scheme, which holds out tantalising supports for farmers, and expecting them to hold on.  </p><p> As I have said at committee meetings and in the D&aacute;il, the major issue for farmers is price volatility in the agriculture market.  It will be well into 2017 before there is any possible correction in the milk market.  The legacy issues are Russia and China, weather dependency, income growth.  A host of factors are at play, but the question is what can we do to try to help farmers in the interim?  My view is that we must try to focus on access to low cost credit for farmers.  The banks are playing puck, they are paying negative interest rates for money and are going to town on lending rates.  They can charge what they like.  The banks can borrow at 0.5%; even allowing them a 2.5% handling charge, they should be able to lend at 3%.  The Minister should be able to devise a scheme to allow farmers to borrow at attractive interest rates.  The SMEs and small shopkeepers should also be able to avail of credit at low interest rates, instead of paying 8% on overdraft facilities.  The same should apply to credit from the merchant co-operatives.  There is nothing cheap about what they offer.  They are there with their hankies, saying how well they are doing for farmers, but they are still charging interest rates that are up there with the best of them.  Our farmers are paying three times more than their European colleagues.  </p><p> Fertiliser costs are an issue that has been discussed by the IFA.  They have made some progress at European level.  Is the Minister co-operating with that campaign to get a reduction in tariffs and customs on fertiliser imports into the EU?  That could bring a further &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million into the pockets of farmers.</p><p> The Chairman has been taking a lead role on the issue of an independent retail ombudsman with attendant powers and duties, similar to what operates in the United Kingdom.  There is no use behaving nicely nicely with those boys, they just throw it back into your face, you need statutory powers to deal with them.  Allowing below-cost selling is a racket.  Of course there will be below-cost selling.  It is the old story, the big shops will locate on the outskirts of the town and there will be nothing in the middle as the local shops have closed.  What has wiped out the shops will wipe out farmers eventually.  We should look at the possibility of introducing a ban on below=cost selling, so that people can produce at a reasonable price and consumers will know they are getting a quality product.  </p><p> I thank my colleagues and the Chairman for facilitating me this morning.  I know the Minister will respond to my questions to the best of his ability.  If he does not have the answers, he can write to the committee.    </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#K00300"><p>There are some common themes running through the questions.  I will deal with the beef data and genomics programme.  I concur 100% with Deputy Penrose's comments in this regard.  With regard to the point made by Deputy McConalogue on funding, the important point to remember is there is a &euro;300 million commitment across the lifetime of the rural development programme.</p><p>In the context of it being a co-funded scheme, we will not leave a brown cent after us in the drawdown of that fund.  We will use all of that fund for the purpose of that heading.  As a result of the delayed establishment, the number of applications originally received as against the number of people who dropped out, there were various fluctuations in the estimated drawdown in 2015.  This scheme has the potential to revolutionise the beef sector in the same way the economic breeding index, EBI, has done for the dairy sector, with which many Members would be familiar.  I was asked whether it will be reopened.  That will remain under active consideration.  There is a commitment in the rural development programme of &euro;300 million across the lifetime of that programme.  We will use all of that fund in respect of the beef data and genomics programme.  Speaking from memory, originally we had approximately 29,000 original applications, we have approximately 25,000 now and we have commenced payments under it.  We will maximise the drawdown.  If the figures allow for the reopening of the scheme, my Department and I will look at it.</p><p> In regard to the points raised by Deputy Martin Kenny, I acknowledge that agriculture is the engine that will drive the economic recovery of rural Ireland furthest.  In fact a number of years ago when we faced a very difficult crisis, the then Government identified the key engines that would drive economic recovery, which in rural Ireland were agriculture, fishing and tourism.  In many respects because of the collaboration between the public and the private sectors, we have made significant progress in this regard.  It is appreciated in a community, like the one Deputy Martin Kenny represents, that we need to be vigilant.</p><p> On the issue of delays in payments, I was in opposition, questioning Ministers and officials on delayed payments.  It is very frustrating to be awaiting a basic payment or grant from the Department when merchants or agriculture contractors are waiting to be paid.  It becomes acutely embarrassing for farmers.  I have a number of observations in this regard.  Last year was particularly difficult because we had a transition to a new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payment system with which we had a number of teething problems.  It is acknowledged also that there is a resource issue and Members will see in the Estimates that there is provision for additional human resources in the Department.  While the staff will be spread across a series of areas in the Department, I have had negotiations with senior management on addressing prompt payment and the particular issues raised by the Deputy.  We have negotiated a charter of rights with farmers, which obliges the Department to facilitate meeting ambitious targets in respect of prompt payments.</p><p> I make the case that many of the difficulties that arise with regard to delays in the basic payments arise in particular from paper applications as opposed to online applications.  As Members will be aware, the online applications are facilitated with preliminary checks, whereas the paper applications, because of the obligation to put the applications on the IT system in the Department, do not get the benefit of those preliminary checks.  Many applications come in signed stating no change, but when the processing of those applications takes place later, problems are identified which results in a tennis match over and back between the Department and the applicant.  This delays the applications.  The ambition is to get to a situation within the next two years where we have 100% online applications in order that every applicant will benefit from the preliminary checks.  It is an ambitious target to get to 100% and I would be interested in hearing the views of committee members.  It does offer a very significant benefit to people who make the online application because they get the benefit of a no-penalty preliminary check on their application.  It will be difficult to reach that last cohort of people who still make applications on paper.</p><p>They are probably, by and large, people who are not IT savvy or who may have difficulties with access to broadband.  There are a combination of issues at play, including age.  That poses a challenge for us in terms of getting them engaged with the online system and convincing them of its benefits in ensuring prompt payment.</p><p> I wish to deal now with the hen harrier issue.  We will be submitting an amendment to the European Commission by the end of this month.  Part of it relates to the new sheep programme but it will also contain a proposal in respect of the hen harrier.  That is the preliminary work that must be done in this area.  Then we will need to develop the scheme and my ambition is to begin payments in 2017.  Those payments in conjunction with GLAS payments will bring us a long way towards the situation which prevailed prior to the suspension of the previous scheme of which many people were beneficiaries.  Many of these people are in my own constituency and I am very familiar with the issue.  I also know that other Members present are familiar with it.  It has been a very difficult period for those affected.  They were unfortunate in the manner in which the process developed when the previous scheme closed.  That scheme was very generous, involving payments of up to &euro;14,000.  However, a combination of GLAS payments and payments under the new scheme will allow us to get close to the situation which prevailed under the previous scheme and that should make a real difference.</p><p> Our amendment to the rural development programme must be submitted to the European Commission by the end of this month.  As I said already, part of that relates to the sheep programme and we are currently in consultation with the various stakeholders on the issue.  I have never said that electronic tagging would be a precondition of the scheme, but it would be remiss of me not to reflect, in the context of the consultations I have been having with the various stakeholders, the view which has been expressed strongly by the industry in the context of accessing new markets that electronic tagging is used in other jurisdictions with which we compete.  The point has been clearly made to me by those selling product and those in the markets into which we are attempting to gain entry that the lack of electronic tagging puts us at a competitive disadvantage.  Specifically, that point was made in the recent discussions I had with the US Ambassador and several of his colleagues on market access.  It is a point that comes up regularly and we would be burying our heads in the sand by refusing to acknowledge it.  There is significant potential in the sheep sector in terms of new markets and an expansion of the industry.  However, we must be able to compete with other producers, and traceability is a key issue in this regard.  Our product is as close as one can get to the origin green dream, if I can put it that way.  It is as close to a natural product as one can get but traceability is the final element which would give us a competitive advantage in respect of other markets.</p><p> On the issue of Johne's disease, Animal Health Ireland, AHI, is running a pilot project involving private veterinary practitioners.  This is a significant issue.  Johne's disease is a wasting disease with which Members will be familiar.  All the stakeholders under AHI have identified it as a priority area and a pilot project is under way at present.  It remains to be seen how the lessons of that pilot project can be mainstreamed, but AHI, which is funded by my Department, has been active in this area.  We have paid &euro;500,000 to date to AHI for work on Johne's disease.  The problem is recognised.  As Members will be aware, AHI is active in a number of areas, including Johne's disease, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR,  bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, and so forth.  These are issues of animal health that must be identified and tackled.</p><p>The Deputy also referred to Teagasc.  My Department sanctioned up to 77 additional staff in respect of Teagasc's education programme and the green certificate in particular.  Under the discretion allowed to Teagasc, it now has greater freedom to recruit to its advisory service.  We are making progress albeit it is an area we need to keep under review.  We have also given Teagasc some latitude in respect of how it allocates its own resources within the overall cap in terms of additional staff.  There is an ongoing review of the green certificate content.  International experts are involved in that review along with Teagasc's own advisory and education staff to determine whether the qualification, which is now of long-standing and of which I was a beneficiary many years ago, is up to the mark in respect of the challenges those now entering a career in agriculture face.  That kind of review is welcome and Teagasc has embarked on it.<br/><br/>There is no silver bullet to resolve the question of volatility.  I do not want to imply that the only area in which there are difficulties due to volatility is the dairy sector, but by coincidence I chaired yesterday my first meeting with the dairy forum.  We had a very useful discussion along all of the lines raised in terms of cost of credit and access to it.  I have met with the pillar banks on this issue also.  While we cannot buck the market in respect of ensuring an additional price is paid to farmers per litre of milk, we can do a great deal in other areas.  I have been active in this area of superlevy difficulties but I regret to say my efforts have so far been unsuccessful.  I have been in contact with the Commission whose argument is that it does not have the legal framework to give relief to that particular cohort of farmers.  There are 3,700 farmers who have difficulty in that area.  Although it is not a matter for Commissioner Hogan, we have raised at Council meetings the issue of the tariff on fertiliser, which we estimate could deliver a dividend in the region of &euro;14 per tonne.  That would be a significant cost reduction to the farming community.  I have discussed the matter with Commissioner Moscovici, who is French, and, one-on-one, with the French agriculture Minister.  I have been active in the area but I do not know if it will deliver.<br/><br/>Market access is another critical issue.  The Deputy mentioned markets like Iran.  I have met the Iranian ambassador in the last month.  Historically, we had very significant market access there.  We are now in a post-sanction era and the opportunities are there again.  There are still some difficulties in the area of banking which make things more difficult.  I had recent meetings with &Aacute;r-Nua which is now active in that space.  Certainly, it is a market we have identified given that there are 80 million people in Iran, but it is also a corridor of access to up to 200 million people in the wider region.  We see it as significant but we need to make more progress in that area.<br/><br/>On the issue of access to affordable finance, I salute initiatives by the likes of Glanbia in the MilkFlex area.  We have greater room to manoeuvre now in respect of state aids on financial instruments and my Department is actively exploring the options in that space.  We are going to appoint consultants to determine if there is market failure here.  The Deputy rightly makes reference to the variation in interest rates across the European Union.  The quarter 1 report from the Central Bank said the variation was from 2.2% in Austria to 5.8% in Ireland.  That is the difference between top and bottom.  We are appointing consultants to see if we can establish an <i>ex ante</i>market failure.  My instinct is that if there is one, it is in the area of interest rates.  That is where it is most identifiable.  On that basis, we will explore the options we can bring to the table on access to more affordable finance.</p><p>The issue is not one of access to finance, it is one of access to affordable finance.</p><p> One other point I make on foot of consultations I have had with the banks is that all of them are saying, &ldquo;Please come in and talk to us if you have a difficulty&rdquo;.  That is a good idea.  There is a cultural issue whereby most farmers tend to want to have minimal contact with their bank managers even when they are in difficulty.  They can head off some difficulties if they engage at an early stage.  Yesterday, we launched at the diary forum a new tool in terms of cash flow management and budgeting which is going out to every dairy farmer through the co-operative movement.  It will also be promoted by Teagasc through its farm walks.  We hope it will be a tool dairy farmers can make some progress with in terms of managing their finances and cash flow.  A combination of tax liabilities on foot of incomes earned when milk prices were much higher than they are now, the super levy and merchant credit is going to lead to a particularly difficult period at the back end of the year.</p><p> I appreciate that I have digressed but I want to make one closing remark.  If I have left anything out, I am sure people will tell me.</p></speech>

I appreciate that there must be a margin for industrial actors and my Department will work with the industry to facilitate the export of the maximum possible number of cattle because we need that safety valve to ensure the maximum return for beef producers.</p> <p>  A lot of issues have been raised.</p></speech>

It is not an affordability issue with finance, it is an access difficulty.  It is very important that the Minister accepts that affordability is not the issue here.  A good example is that of a farmer with whom I spoke last week.  He went to the bank for a loan to get him through the cash flow difficulties he currently faces.  The bank said there was no problem with that, but that in giving him a loan for the amount he was looking for, it would also bring his overdraft to zero.  He did not look for that, but that was what was offered.  When he did not accept it, there was no access available.  It is important that the Minister and his Department understand that it is not an affordability issue, but an accessibility one.</p> <p>  The MilkFlex scheme is one we should all promote.  It is a very good scheme.  I saw a figure recently that 45% of lending within industry across all sectors in the USA was non-bank lending.  This is the first occasion on which we are going down that route here.  I am very hopeful it will be a success, but we need to look at expanding it beyond dairy to other sectors of agriculture.  If the Minister and his Department could push the idea and cajole people to provide access to finance in other sectors, it would be very helpful.</p> <p>  When are payments likely to happen under the TAMS II structure?  People have had work done for months.  The Minister said he felt sorry for those who are caught.  People had the work done and the invoices are sitting on farmers' desks, but the grants have not been paid out.</p><p> I have two more issues to raise.  The biggest difficulty associated with the late payment of a single farm payment, the BPS payment, was related to the partnerships.  I believe they were left until the end in putting the payment structure in place.  What is the current position?  I ask that this not be allowed to happen again this year.</p><p> The figure for wages and salaries across all headings is 3%.  May I have a breakdown of the figure of 3%?</p><p> I have a couple of other questions to ask.</p></speech>

I wish the Chairman and Minister well in their new appointments.</p> <p>  Before I refer to programme A, I wish to make a point about the Minister's opening statement in which he referred to the importance of improving profitability at farm level.  Unfortunately, the current reality is that there is no profit level to improve.  Most farms are making a loss.  We talk about volatility, but we have seen no volatility in most sectors for a while now.  All of the pressure is and has been downwards.  My understanding of volatility is that it is a trend that goes up and down.  Unfortunately, all we see is farm incomes moving downwards.</p> <p>  Have the powers that be realised the extent of the crisis in the dairy sector?  There has been considerable investment in the past two to three years.  There is no point in my throwing stones at people, but I must state no one saw the dangers of increased production in northern Europe and the damage it would do to prices.  As a country, we need to start taking a serious look at ourselves.  We have been brainwashed into thinking we are the most cost-competitive producers in Europe, if not the world, but the reality, as I see it, in grain prices is such that we must stand back and ascertain how competitive we are by comparison with the rest of Europe.  The grain sector and the prices that will be received are another issue, but I do not know how grain farmers are managing to exist, given the price grain is making.  It looks like there will be another bumper harvest in Russia.  Given current prices, it appears that Germany and what I call the feed lodge units on the Continent are pushing yields to a great extent.  They are milking two and a half to three times a day.  They have Holstein cows with considerable yields.  The producers have a small margin per litre, if there is any margin at all.  We see it in the pattern of production.  The downward pressure on price is not curtailing production anywhere around the world to any serious extent.  Unless production levels are brought back, the Irish dairy sector as we know it will not survive. </p> <p>  I have had three or four men on to me in the past month who have been put under pressure by banks to sell land parcels.  This is June 2016 and we must have a recovery in 2017, but no one can see any possibility of a recovery, unless production levels drop by approximately 4% to 5% worldwide and there is no indication that there will be that kind of drop.  We talk about a work programme for the committee.  Farm profitability has to be top of the agenda and the message has to be hammered home at every opportunity.  </p> <p>  I worked with the Minister when he was on a different side of the table.  I accept that he has a good understanding of farming and comes from an area that is experiencing severe income difficulties.  He referred to the beef sector and said one should not talk down prices.  We do not have to talk down prices; it is being done for us by processors.  We are still in the month of June when prices should be peaking, but already factories have started to pull prices.  I sold cattle this weekend and they are talking about weight and age restrictions.  Cow prices are down by 10 cent to 15 cent per kilogram in the past ten days.  Cow prices have always been the barometer with which one can judge beef prices.  The UEFA European Championship is taking place.  It always creates a good market for manufacturing beef.  The Olympic Games are coming up in Rio de Janeiro.  Even with all of these positive scenarios, the factories are in the month of June already starting to reduce prices.</p><p>The harsh reality is that we have extra cattle during this back end.  Unfortunately, as dairy farmers try to bring some income through the farm gate, there will be extra cow cullings.  I am not trying to talk down beef prices but they are not at an acceptable level and they will drop.  We just cannot ignore that scenario.  This will put significant pressure on an already pressurised sector.</p><p> With regard to live exports, we have heard of markets opening here and there, but there are no cattle moving.  There was an announcement on Turkey a week or ten days ago in respect of lighter cattle.  We have heard about access to markets being announced for the past 12 months to two years but, unless we see cattle moving, beef farmers will not have confidence.  I obviously welcome the opening of markets but, unless there is movement of stock, the problem will not be solved.  The recently announced Turkish market will not do anything for the crisis approaching this back end.  Unfortunately, once the kill goes over 30,000 heads, the factories will do what they always did and try to trample farmers into the ground, as Deputy Penrose implied.</p><p> I question the commitment of Bord Bia to the live export trade.  I was a member of Bord Bia for six years and sat on the board.  I question whether it has real commitment to the live trade.</p><p> Profitability at farm level must be the paramount concern of this committee.  If one were to talk to farmers about Harvest 2020, Food Wise 2025, increased production, increased export levels and the benefit of agriculture to the rural economy, one would want to be very near the door.  With the income pressure currently on farmers, one would want a very good life assurance policy to be doing it.</p><p> With regard to the section the Chairman wants us to focus on, I welcome the ring-fencing of the &euro;300 million for the beef genomics scheme.  We should reopen it.  There was a lot of bad press at the time in question.  Beef farmers now see that their neighbours are able to access the scheme.  If it were reopened, more people would apply.  Any money that can be brought into that sector must be welcome.  I thank the Minister for saying he will do his best to spend the money over the lifetime of the plan.</p><p> My final question relates to the horse and greyhound racing fund and the discussion on the sale of Harold's Cross and the potential this has for Bord na gCon to reduce its debt.  If that sale does not go ahead, what will be the implications for the budget of Bord na gCon?</p></speech>

In the 2015 outturn document, it is stated that the programme created 145 jobs through the grant announcements.  This is a bugbear of mine because there is no requirement for jobs to be created in order to get a grant under the programme.  I fail to see why jobs are continually linked to these programmes.  It is very frustrating for me and those I represent because our experience of the seafood development programme in Donegal is that it shrinks the number of jobs.  This is because factories have used it to rationalise and modernise, which has actually reduced the amount of work available.  From talking to BIM, I have learned there is no requirement to create jobs to get grant aid.  There is simply a question in the application process that asks how many jobs might be generated.  A number is filled in.  When the announcement is made, it is stated that, for example, ten jobs will be created.  Job creation should not be attached to the seafood development programme.  Let it stand on its own.  The idea that jobs are being created is wrong and should not be furthered.  With regard to the schemes that have been introduced, we can get the information from BIM at a later stage to determine the exact position.</p> <p>  On the Natura bays, could the Minister give us an update on the appropriate assessments?  How many bays have been dealt with in respect of the aquaculture applications?</p><p>In the 2015 outturn for jobs in the agri-sector, seafood and forestry, there was a decline of 1,000 jobs nationally in the sector as against 2014.  Will the Minister comment on whether a trend is starting or what is the reason for the decline?  There was a decline in 2015 in the number of jobs in the agrifood, forestry and seafood sector of 1,000 nationally.  Can the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#R00500"><p>This is a follow-up question which I hope the Minister will address when replying to the other questions.  It concerns the beef data and genomics programme.  Will the Minister elaborate in a little more detail?  He indicated that &euro;300 million has been allocated to the programme and that it is his intention to ensure it is spent on the programme during the course of the CAP.  The programme involves a five-year commitment on behalf of farmers.  As I indicated, the budget last year, which was the first year, was &euro;52 million but only &euro;35 million was spent.  Therefore, there was an underspend of &euro;17 million.  The allocation for this year is &euro;52 million.  That is predicated, according to the Minister's figures, on 27,000 farmers having signed up to it.  In his contribution, the Minister indicated that 25,000 farmers have signed up.  On the basis that there are 2,000 fewer farmers, for whom the Minister had set funding aside to pay, I expect there will be an underspend this year.  We had an underspend last year and a likely underspend this year.  The CAP runs up to 2020.  The commitment for farmers who sign up to the programme is five years.  For anybody signing up now, the five years would run beyond 2020.  If the Minister says he will spend that &euro;300 million during the CAP programme on this particular scheme, I do not see how he can do that.  Therefore, I cannot see why he is talking about reopening the scheme to further entrants at some stage and that he is keeping it under review.  I thought he would have been reopening it now.  I do not see how he can spend the full &euro;300 million on the scheme by the end of 2020.  Will the Minister elaborate on how he sees himself meeting that commitment?</p></speech>

There was an extra allocation for the commission for the economic development of rural areas, CEDRA, this year.  What will it be spent on?  Regarding late payments under the basic payments scheme last year, one of the big bugbears for people who had an issue and who could not contact the Department was when there was a change of staff.  Will that issue be addressed in the event of difficulties arising next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#R00700"><p>I have pieces of paper all around me.  My apologies to Deputy Martin Kenny who raised an issue about aquaculture licensing, an issue to which Deputy Thomas Pringle alluded.  If I do not have some of the data I will get back to the Deputy.  My understanding of the issue around aquaculture licences is that much of the difficulty we face arose from a European Court of Justice decision in 2007.  Since that time we have been endeavouring to meet the terms of that European Court of Justice ruling.  To date, the necessary appropriate assessments have been completed under the habitats directive in respect of 509 licence applications and assessment is pending in respect of 328 applications.  I am considering whether a review of the licensing arrangements is needed.  I acknowledge that in respect of the potential of aquaculture, we are only scratching the surface.  Deputy Pringle will be aware of the significant potential that offers as an industry.  Statistics brought to my attention graphically illustrate this in respect of farmed salmon.  Off the coast of Norway, 1 million tonnes of farmed salmon is produced per annum.</p><p>Scotland produces 130,000 tonnes of farmed salmon per annum compared to between 12,000 and 15,000 tonnes produced here.  Clearly, therefore, the industry has significant growth potential.</p><p> No one suggests we should not farm the land.  A difficulty arises in reaching the full potential of sea farming.  I acknowledge that in respect of aquaculture, it must proceed in a manner that allows the industry to coexist with other local interests, specifically tourism.  We need to examine this issue to identify whether we can increase the industry's potential, especially the significant employment opportunities it offers. </p><p> The Deputy referred to the job content of the &euro;240 million seafood development programme.  I recently sanctioned some of the funding under this programme.  On a visit to an enterprise involved in producing prepared meals, I found it interesting to see boxes of imported farmed salmon stacked in a corner.  This example graphically illustrates the potential of the industry to displace imports.  Many of the job opportunities available in this sector are in processing fish that are currently exported in an unprocessed state.  While I accept that some fish types need to be exported in an unprocessed state, there are significant employment opportunities in fish processing. </p><p> I accept the Deputy's point that some of the investment must be made in new technology and increasing efficiency.  Ultimately, however, we are talking about value added.  The Deputy is not suggesting that any industry should turn its back on the potential to become more efficient.  Sometimes this comes at a cost to job creation.  In the long term, however, if we can grasp the full potential of the sector, it will increase employment, especially in coastal communities.</p><p> As has been noted, Bord Iascaigh Mhara's website provides abundant data on the various programmes it operates.  The scale of funding available under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, is significant.  We can, in conjunction with the licensing arrangements in the aquaculture side, achieve significantly more than we have been achieving thus far.</p><p> To return to the point Deputy Jackie Cahill made on volatility, profitability and so forth, I do not propose to dwell on the profitability issue in respect of the recently published Teagasc farm survey because it is what it is.  While I appreciate that the landscape in 2016 is very different, we have been in this space before.  In 2009, milk prices were at or below current prices.  We must acknowledge that volatility involves ups and downs.</p><p> Deputy Cahill also referred to grain prices and our competitor markets.  Yesterday, Ornua made an interesting presentation setting out its market analysis.  One of the issues it signalled in respect of interventions in the marketplace was that skimmed milk powder interventions have resulted in the removal from the market of approximately 2.5 billion litres of milk.  This is a significant policy instrument which we will obviously continue to monitor in respect of whether further tonnage is required.  The amount of skimmed milk powder going into intervention has increased to 350,000 tonnes.  I appreciate that peak milk has been reached and it will probably not be necessary to avail of this instrument as milk production tapers off.  However, these instruments are available.  </p><p> Deputy Cahill also raised an issue regarding cattle prices.  A host of markets for live exports are open, including Libya, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Serbia, Algeria and, most recently, Turkey.  This does not mean that cattle will move because a whole series of variables need to fall into place.  For example, the price for cattle must be right, currency fluctuations must be favourable and boats must be available.  My Department is a key player in respect of the licensing of boats and we insist on the highest standards in respect of animal welfare.  The bad publicity associated with an inappropriate incident could quickly close down the live exports market.  We have the highest standards and nobody complains.</p><p> The State can open these markets but it is up to the industry to respond.  The current price is above the average price here.  I appreciate the point the Deputy makes about recent price dips in respect of cull cows and so on but the price is above the EU price at present and that makes it difficult for exporters to make their margin.  They will only act if there is a return for them.  It is an area, of opening markets, in which we must remain vigilant, not just in the live export trade but in respect of other market opportunities for processed beef.</p><p> I will now address issues in regard to the horse and greyhound fund in respect of Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium.  Under the horse and greyhound fund, the departmental funding is an 80:20 split.  Bord na gCon has a well documented financial problems.  We had an Indecon report, which identified some of the issues and charted a blueprint for the future.  I appreciate that Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium is part of that.  I am not privy to the detail of it but I know from in-house discussions that the sale of Harold's Cross stadium is under active consideration.  An issue in regard to the sale of the stadium is that the price will be impacted on by the local authority zoning of the area.  I understand that it is under exploration at present.</p><p> The Chairman asked what is covered under CEDRA.  There is an increase in the allocation, which is up to &euro;1.5 million.  That covers the Acorns programme, which is female entrepreneurship as well as the social farming initiative.  I had a very interesting experience at the Bloom Festival where I met a participant of that social farming initiative and where people with a disability get a placement on farm holdings.  I spoke to a sponsor and a beneficiary and it was an enlightening and uplifting experience to hear at first hand the benefits of the initiative.  It could be mainstreamed if we work through other disability organisations.  Very often the commentary we hear on placements for the disabled is that the placement that is provided is in many respects meaningless, with a lack of engagement.  By contrast, with this social farming placement programme, albeit I had an engagement with only one sponsor and beneficiary, was very positive.  The individual could not speak enough of the project.  We also have funding under that programme for local markets, artisan food producers and so on.</p><p> My Department is not the lead Department in respect of CEDRA, but we fund some elements of it.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, would have responsibility for funding much of the programme.  Under the rural development programme we access the Leader funding but we are effectively a postbox for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p><p> I understand the non-expenditure of the full amount of the beef data and genomics programme in 2015 was due to the scheme being up and running later than anticipated and the level of approvals not matching the provision which we had made for the scheme.  We had made provision in budget 2015 but we did not spend the amount of money we anticipated we would.  However, we are committed to spending it.  There were issues of late compliance.  For the benefit of Deputy McConalogue I will read from the briefing note.  For 2015, the first year of the programme, the allocation was &euro;52 million.  However, payments are expected to total &euro;35 million, yielding savings of &euro;17 million.  This is primarily because of a significant percentage of applications not having confirmed completion of their requirements to submit performance data on calves up to five months of age due to the timing of calving on their holdings and hence there was a delay in the draw down in 2015.</p><p> The most important point I can make is that the &euro;17 million that was unspent carries over into 2016.</p><p>The exact numbers under the scheme - let me check that I have the data-----</p></speech>

In the overall scheme, the commitment is &euro;300 million.  If one looks at other schemes that have wound down, for example, REPS 4, we are still paying some money out under it because of the delay in applications and some hang-over issues, even though the scheme is closed and has been gone for quite a while.  There are still some delays.  The commitment, which is absolute, is that the &euro;300 million will be used in the beef data and genomics scheme.  I think members will agree that notwithstanding the initial wariness of the scheme, for want of a better term, there is an acceptance that it can deliver significantly in a host of areas in terms of improving the genetic composition of the herd, climate change objectives and so on.  The absolute commitment is that not withstanding the accounting procedures in respect of not having the expected drawdown in 2015 along with the roll-over of &euro;17 million into 2016, the equivalent in the overall scheme is that the &euro;300 million is available for the beef data and genomics programme.  I can arrange to get a more detailed note to Deputy McConalogue, if he wishes, on the exact financial manoeuvres that have seen the late drawdown, the additional roll-over into 2016 and the commitment in the programme over the lifetime of the rural development plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#U00800"><p>There is &euro;300 million for the beef data and genomics programme out of the overall CAP programme, which was to run until the end of 2020.  Because the genomics programme is a five -year programme, once one enters it, one must participate in the programme for five years.  As the Department has already underspent and there are fewer than five years at this stage to the end of the programme, is the Minister saying that some of that &euro;300 million will run past the end of 2020 into 2021, 2022?  If so, it will run outside the timescale of the current CAP programme of 2015 to 2020.  That being the case, the overall spending on the CAP programme over the 2015 to 2020 period will be reduced by the amount the Minister allowed to run over into 2021-2022.  It would mean a lesser commitment from the Government in respect of the CAP programme than was originally committed to.  The point I make is that it is exceptionally important the overall funding allocated to CAP at the outset is spent by the end of 2020.  If there is an underspend in certain programmes inside that period, that money should be used and spent or reallocated as required to other initiatives.  Should people enter the beef data and genomics scheme next year which will run into 2021-2022, the payment for the 2021-2022 beef data genomic payment should come from the subsequent CAP.  The run over should not mean that the overall CAP envelope up to the end of 2020 is reduced.  I do not see how the Minister is insistent that he will spend the &euro;300 million on the beef data genomics programme that has been allocated to it.  I simply do not see how that can happen logically unless the Minister spends some of that &euro;300 million in 2021-2022.</p></speech>

We need to get some things clear.  The &euro;300 million is the budget line commitment, which we are committed to ensuring over the lifetime of the rural development programme will be available under the beef data and genomics programme.  It is the case - in fact a detailed analysis of the Estimates today will show that in other areas - that sometimes schemes run over the fixed term of the development programme.  For example, we are still paying out under REPS 4.</p><p>Nobody is suggesting - I know that the Deputy is not - that because of late compliance issues we should say we are not paying the farmer.  That is not the way the scheme works and we want to facilitate as many people as possible.  What we are saying is that we had provided for greater numbers, that funding of &euro;17 million was not drawn down because of late compliance issues and we rolled the money over.  That is the reason &euro;52 million is available in 2016.  If we were to reopen the scheme to further applicants - the point made by Deputies - we would be paying them beyond the envisaged end date for the majority of schemes under the rural development programme. That is the normal provision.  The Exchequer pays and the Commission makes a refund after we expend the money.  We are still obtaining receipts in appropriations-in-aid from the Commission and they may well spill over.  Administratively, these are never clean boxes.  We will spend the sum of &euro;300 million.  The sum of &euro;17 million was carried over because of late compliance issues.  If we were to reopen the scheme - a question I was asked earlier and which is under active consideration - it would be to make sure we spent the &euro;300 million.  It is inevitable that some people will go beyond the five-year period envisaged ending in 2020.  The track record of the Department, regardless of who sits in my chair, is second to none in maximising the draw-down and not leaving money behind under the rural development programme or any previous such programme.  We maximise the draw-down and will do so under this scheme also.  It is logical that if we were to reopen the scheme, it would run beyond 2020.</p></speech>

In other words, did they benefit from the original funding or did it come from the &euro;300 million for the current programme?  That is an important point.

The crisis in 2009 was short lived and thankfully prices bounced back very quickly.  Production costs have since increased substantially, but, unfortunately, current price supports have not increased.  They are at a level which does not reflect the cost of production.  The third difference is that the level of investment on Irish dairy farms is far higher, while the level of debt is far higher than it was in 2009 due to planning for the abolition of quotas.  As a farmer, I would welcome abolition of the fertiliser tariff, but if one examines the price paid for fertilisers, it correlates with the level of farm profitability.  In 2009 fertiliser prices dropped significantly.  We now see them dropping because farmers are reducing the amounts they are purchasing owing to the fall in income.  There is definitely a cartel in operation when it comes to fertiliser prices.  I would, therefore, welcome abolition of the tariff, but I worry that when prices recover, the vendors of fertiliser will charge what they think farmers can afford.  I would welcome an examination of the feasible price of fertiliser.  The price follows our ability to pay rather what it is worth.</p></speech>

Somebody might depart from farming and then gets an off-farm job.  He or she might term himself or herself as an employee but might still be farming on a part-time basis.

We faced choices in the Department.  We could have slowed down the roll-out of individual programmes.  We went with the maximum possible roll-out at the earliest possible date.  We are struggling to put in place the appropriate back-office arrangements to deal with it.  Payments are to start in July in respect of the specific matter that was raised.</p> <p>  I think Deputy McConalogue tabled a detailed parliamentary question on approvals last week.  Since the reply to that question was issued, the number of approvals has increased significantly.  They are going out on a daily basis.  I acknowledge that if we are to be criticised for anything, it is for ambition to get the schemes open to people at the earliest possible date.  We are commencing payment in July.  If there is a specific application that is stuck in the system that needs approval for winter housing or pollution control measures, the Department would look at those on an individual case by case basis where necessary.</p></speech>

In a past life, I sat on the farmers' charter group.  There were always specific timescales put in place on the farmers' charter.  I respect that the commencement of TAMS will cover a number of schemes, but if one makes an application, there should be a timescale within which the application has to be dealt with and the same should be the case when one is approved for payment.  That is the way the farmers' charter used to work in the past.  It has gone out the window as regards TAMS II but I think we need to put a strict timescale in place.  I presume the farmers' charter group meets on a regular basis.  Departmental officials used to be obliged to come before that group and defend the Department's payment record.</p><p>We need to get that operating again for TAMS, regardless of whether it is 30 days, 42 days or whatever is the agreed timescale for approval of applications and payment after work is completed.  Given the cashflow problems, there should no delay in payment for jobs of work done.  That is critical.  People are in dire need of those grant payments.  When payment starts in July, I hope it will be made quickly and promptly to all those who have been approved.</p></speech>

A monitoring committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Se&aacute;n Brady, is charged with the ongoing review of the charter.  The committee is supposed to meet four times each year.  We aspire to meet but we do not always do so.  The staff in the Department aspire to meet.  There are resource issues as I alluded to earlier.  Difficulties were associated with the transition period to a new basic payments system from the single farm payment.  One of the issues that gave rise to the greatest number of complaints was AEOS.  Those complaints arose on foot of the complexity of the scheme.  The Department is committed to the highest standard of service delivery to customers and the farming community.  I know the frustration felt by a farmer who telephones the Department and is unable to pursue his inquiry to its logical conclusion and who then, when he telephones a week later, must deal with a different person.  I have discussed this issue in-house.</p> <p>  Members will note in the Estimates a provision for staff costs and improvements in respect of expenditure in that area in 2016.  It is worth bearing in mind that in the period 2008 to 2015 there was a 28% reduction in staff numbers in the Department.  That is a very significant staff reduction at a time when the range and complexity of schemes was moving in the other direction.  We have reached a critical situation and we are beginning to rebuild capacity in some critical areas.  I hope that will lead to service improvements in payments to farmers.  Obviously, the farmers' charter of rights is always there as a stick in respect of our in-house performance.  I am committed to working towards having the best systems in place.  Some of that will flow from the increased provision in the budget for staff improvements.  It is a modest improvement.  It provides for 200 staff in the 12 months period who are filling gaps in critical areas.  That is one of the critical areas.  I have been in Portlaoise in the direct payments offices and have discussed this issue with the key staff involved.  I hope we will not have a repetition of those delays at the back end of this year.</p> <p>  Overall, it is worth bearing in mind that the overwhelming majority of farmers receive their payments promptly.  However, there is a core residue.  If a farmer is of that core residue, he or she will telephone Deputies Cahill, McConalogue, Martin Kenny and Pringle or the Chairman and they will all be chasing the issue.  We need to put in place a system that obviates the necessity for that kind of a merry-go-round and that will allow farmers to utilise a direct access point and prosecute their inquiries effectively.  That is the ambition and that is what the charter is about also.</p></speech>

A total allocation of &euro;218 million has been made under this programme for 2016.  The programme represents the country's key defences against animal and plant disease threats through the implementation of food and feed safety monitoring, inspection and control programmes at primary producer and processor levels and by promoting and enforcing enhanced animal and product identification to support food safety and animal health and welfare.  It also contains the various animal and fish disease control and eradication programmes in order to make significant progress towards eradication of certain diseases, promote high animal welfare standards and secure compliance with regulations.</p> <p>  Significant progress has been made with regard to the costs associated with the TB and brucellosis eradication programme in recent years.  Required funding has fallen from &euro;62.5 million in 2008 to &euro;30.3 million in 2015.  Within that figure the cost of the TB programme itself has fallen from &euro;55 million to &euro;30 million.  The reduction in expenditure is largely due to the fact that the number of reactors fell by almost 50% between 2008 and 2015 from 29,900 to 15,200.  The incidence of other animal diseases and associated costs has also generally seen a reduction.  While these improvements are welcome, we cannot be complacent.  This year, &euro;218 million has been allocated to programme B, &euro;83 million of which is directly related to food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes.  </p> <p>  In budget 2016, additional funding of &euro;0.6 million has been provided to support the voluntary welfare organisations.  This brings total funding for this area to &euro;2.7 million for 2016, an increase of over 27%.  In addition, funding of &euro;2.8 million has been allocated to assist local authorities in reducing the incidence of horse abandonment and in advancing horse projects for urban and Traveller horse owners.  </p></speech>

Our milk and beef sectors are grass based which is unusual in the EU and yet we have one of the lowest milk prices of all member states.  The price does not reflect the high standards we are expected to meet.  That feeds into the whole issue about the very strict controls that we have in place which is what programme B is all about.</p> <p>  I wish to make a comment in the context of the various animal and fish disease control programmes.  The Minister spoke earlier about the potential of salmon farming in Ireland but we must be careful not to compare ourselves with places like Norway or northern Scotland where very deep fjords provide a very safe environment for fish farming.  The west of Ireland is a totally different environment and there are very serious dangers posed by escapes in the context of disease control.  While I understand that aquaculture may have potential here, we must be very cautious.  We cannot compare ourselves with other countries which have an entirely different environment.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on catching that person out and the full rigours of the law should be brought to bear on him.  Such behaviour does serious damage to our reputation and persons engaged in such activity should have no mercy shown to them.  They can do serious damage to our economy.  We can argue here about different aspects of policy but people engaged in that kind of activity should be given no quarter.  I hope that the full rigours of the law are brought to bear in this case.  </p><p> On bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, and the eradication scheme, I cannot understand how some herd owners have been allowed to keep positive animals on their farms.  We had a three year programme for BVD but it does not look like we will fully eradicate the disease in that timeframe.  The fact that people have been allowed to hold positive animals and have not been forced to dispose of them makes a mockery of the scheme.  It is also very annoying for their neighbours.  Unfortunately, in this, the third year of the scheme, people are reporting BVD positive animals for the first time and that should not be happening.  If we are going to have a disease eradication scheme operating through Animal Health Ireland we need strict regulations and must insist that if animals are positive, they must be taken out of the system.  It defeats the purpose of the scheme if herd owners are allowed to keep positive animals which are a source of disease.  A lot of money has been spent on controlling BVD but the failure to eradicate it is undermining farmers' confidence about entering any future schemes.  If Animal Health Ireland is to embark on another pilot programme, farmers must have confidence in it.  The retention of positive animals on farms is ridiculous.</p><p> On the TB figures, it is great to see the reduction in the number of TB reactors.  The programme that was undertaken a number of years ago to control the badger population and limit the spread of TB through wild life has yielded positive results in terms of the reduction in the TB reactor numbers.  However, in County Wicklow there is a serious problem with the deer population, which is running rampant.  Some farmers have even changed their farming practices because they find it impossible to keep bovines now, due to the permanent restrictions on them because of TB as well as the cost of keeping animals over the winter.  We must face up to this serious issue.  Deer can travel long distances and are very hard to contain.  The size of the deer population in Wicklow must be taken seriously because it is indisputable that deer are infected with TB.  How the deer population became infected - whether it was through badgers or some other means - is immaterial to farmers.  The fact is that the deer population is infected, the herd is growing and the problem must be tackled.  If we do not deal with it in Wicklow, it will spread to other parts of the country.  We must keep the deer population at a realistic level and if deer are causing a TB problem for farmers then a programme similar to the one for badgers must be put in place.  It has worked with badgers but the issue with deer has not yet been tackled.  It is a problem that we cannot ignore any longer.  </p></speech>

I acknowledge that there is a specific issue in Wicklow.  In fact, the incidence of TB in Wicklow to date this year is 5.67% which is well ahead of the national average of 2.73%.  I note the point Deputy Cahill made in respect of the possible contribution of deer to that increase in TB incidence.  There is a non-statutory Irish deer management forum in which the Department and other stakeholders are participants.</p><p>We see that forum as the appropriate place to deal with this, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which has responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the agency that will issue the licence for a cull if it is deemed necessary.  It is an issue on our horizon in the Department.  We are conscious of the correlation between the significant increase in the problem of deer with regard to the management of conventional agricultural practices and the increased incidence of TB.  We see the deer forum as a way of progressing that.  I will keep the Deputy informed of developments in that regard.<br/><br/>The Deputy also referred to the issue of BVD, bovine viral diarrhoea.  This was referred to earlier in respect of Animal Health Ireland and Johnes disease.  The initiative in which Animal Health Ireland has been involved has made significant progress.  The herd incidence of BVD dropped from 0.66% in 2013 to 0.33% in 2015.  That is progress but I appreciate there is a problem in respect of persistently infected animals, PIs, remaining on some holdings.  In 2014, we introduced an <i>ex gratia</i>payment to encourage the disposal of PIs.  In terms of appropriate and proper health management of their herds, farmers should embrace this initiative.  PIs are a danger not just to their herd&rsquo;s health but also to neighbouring herds.  That is why the Department has stepped in with this <i>ex gratia</i>payment.</p></speech>

If we restricted those farms which have PIs from moving animals, they would be forced to deal with it. I accept a carrot was held out but some of these farms did not avail of it.  I had two farmers on to me who had PIs for the first time this year.  They put it down to PIs being kept on a neighbouring farm.  I am disappointed that after three years of the scheme, farms are being freshly infected.  If we are going to run schemes like this to tackle a specific disease, if PIs are found on a farm, farmers cannot be allowed to decide for themselves whether they are removed.</p></speech>

We did introduce an <i>ex gratia</i>payment in 2016 to fund the removal of animals.  No one is going to make much money on the scheme but it does help.  I appreciate the difficulty for any neighbouring herdowner whose herd becomes infected through no fault of his own.  However, we would not want to overstate the significance of the incidence either, which currently stands at 0.33%.</p><p>The recent detection of clenbuterol proves the benefit of the investment the State makes in traceability and inspections, which are the cornerstone of the industry which we seek to promote, protect and see prosper.</p><p>That this incident was detected and dealt with effectively is good.  The Department was led on the matter primarily by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in terms of consumer safety.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s frustration that somebody would recklessly put the entire industry in the spotlight.  I am pleased, however, that the Department&rsquo;s monitoring, surveillance and traceability systems stood up to scrutiny.  I cannot say too much about the topic because it is the subject of ongoing investigation, but the Department will pursue the matter appropriately.</p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny raised the issue of our level of compliance.  The subtext is that we are always the good people in Europe in complying with all of the regulations, but the reward is that we have the lowest milk prices in Europe.  The Deputy is conflating two issues.  As an island nation which produces a lot of food across many ranges, we have to export 90% of it.  Accordingly, we have to have the highest standards.  In terms of the commitment of primary producers to origin green labelling and reducing our carbon footprint, it is critical to our marketing initiative because it gives us a cutting edge in the prices we can seek and as we seek to add value in the food chain.  We export 90% of our dairy produce.  Many of the markets across the European Union which are paying higher prices for milk are substantially domestic markets.  They do not have the cost of getting their product to, say, the United States, the rest of Europe or emerging markets in China.  Our second largest market for dairy produce outside the United Kingdom is China.  We have the associated costs.  Even at a time when the Chinese market has slowed, we have increased our footprint there, particularly for infant formula, but we can only do it if we are the best in class.  I do not believe we should make any apology for being best in class in meeting the minimum standards required by the European Union.  We should also give ourselves an additional edge in the marketplace with our origin green, carbon footprint programmes.  If we did not have all of this, what would the price be?</p></speech>

There needs to be some acknowledgement of their frustration.  When we send people to market our product, we need to know how we can move up the food chain to get a better return for the farmer.  Farmers in Ireland see themselves as putting in all of the work but everybody else making all of the money.</p></speech>

The people who feel most cheated in the food chain are the primary producer and the consumer at the other end.  There is an initiative by the Commission from which we expect to receive a report at the back end of the year.  The European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, has said he might be able to bring forward proposals early in 2017.  In February the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation introduced new regulations to strengthen the position of the primary producer in dealings with the multiples.  This is an area in which ongoing vigilance is required to ensure they are working and having the desired effect.  That was the intent behind the legislation.  I take the Deputy's broad point.  We have to be conscious of the fact, however, that we are an island nation and need to get 90% of our product, whether it be dairy, sheepmeat or beef, to the market.</p> <p>  On Deputy Thomas Pringle's inquiry about the inspection regime, in terms of animal health, it is pretty much standard.  It covers meat plant supervision and the detection regime, about which we spoke with reference to clenbuterol.</p><p>In the area of plant health, for example, we have surveys of horticultural nurseries, garden centres, public parks, private properties, etc.  We are involved in a range of activities in that area to try to ensure we protect that sector, which is a significant employer.</p></speech>

The key strategies underpinning this programme include the implementation of the rural development programme, the protection of the agriculture and fishing environments through environmentally friendly systems, the implementation of environmental cross-compliance standards and processes, and the improvement of income levels of farm, forest and marine enterprises through policy schemes and services that help sustain the rural and coastal economy.  In pursuit of the priorities outlined, budget 2016 has provided &euro;494 million in 2016 to the rural development programme.  The rural development programme will see an investment of some &euro;4 billion in Irish agriculture over the years 2014 to 2020 and it is a key support for rural areas.  Rural development programme schemes provide vital investment in the rural economy, prioritise agri-environmental protection and support the incomes of family farms.  Overall for 2016, &euro;494 million has been provided for investment under the rural development programme.  This figure is up from &euro;439 million in 2015, representing an increase of over 12.5%.</p> <p>  Some 196 million has been made available for agri-environmental schemes, including REPS, AEOS, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and organics.  Some 38,000 farms will benefit this year under GLAS, which encourages farmers to farm in a more environmentally sustainable manner.  This scheme will ultimately support up to 50,000 farmers and require funding of &euro;250 million per annum in future years.  I will be opening the scheme to new applicants in the autumn.</p> <p>  Almost &euro;36 million has been allocated to TAMS for 2016.  This will provide funding for the young farmer capital investment scheme in addition to dairy equipment, organic capital investment, pig and poultry investments, the animal welfare safety and nutrients storage scheme, and the low-emissions slurry spreading scheme.  Sheep fencing is now included as an investment item in TAMS II and it can now be applied for in the current and subsequent tranches.</p> <p>  A total of 5,578 applications have been received under the three tranches to date.  Approvals and part approvals have been issued in respect of over 2,289 of these cases and are continuing to be issued on an ongoing basis.  Importantly, the TAMS IT payment claims system is currently being finalised, and payments will commence in the second half of this year.  Approval has also been sought from the Commission for a scheme to specifically target the tillage sector, with support for appropriate investments.  Formal approval is expected by the end of this month, and the scheme will be available for online applications soon after that.</p></speech>

Serious restrictions have been placed on them in the use of their land.  From where will the funding come and when will it be introduced?</p> <p>  On the ban on forestry in conservation areas, the hen harrier has been mentioned.  Where there is forestry at various stages of development in these areas, there is evidence appearing which suggests the hen harrier might flourish.  If we were to meet our afforestation targets while being banned from planting in areas of conservation, it would be extremely hard to meet the targets.  I would like to see research into whether having forestry at different stages of development could work in providing a habitat for the hen harrier.  If so, it would add greatly to our ability to meet our afforestation targets.  The land in question is extremely suited to forestry, but with the ban on forestry, the land is devalued.  If it could be proved that the hen harrier could be accommodated by having forestry at different stages of development, it would be a great advancement for the areas in question.</p></speech>

In County Leitrim 17% of the land is under forestry.  I believe the figure is probably closer to 20%, given the amount of land that has been planted recently.  Afforestation, in itself, is fine.  It is productive and generates an income for many people who plant their land.  However, the difficulty is that in rural communities it just wipes out the people and we end up with no people living in an area.  When I look out my front door, I note that there is probably one small section of the horizon in which no trees meet the skyline.  I once counted nine families who were living on the farms in question but no one is living on them anymore.  This means the rural community is deprived of life.  For every 1,000 acres of land planted, one long-term sustainable job is created.  A tree that takes 35 or 40 years to grow is cut into timber in 20 minutes in the sawmill.  The labour intensity associated with forestry is so low that there is no work available.  Although there is an income for the person who owns the land or, in many cases, the companies that buy it - that is another issue - afforestation is a total disaster for rural communities and a disaster in sustaining the social fabric of rural life.  It is a problem that needs to be examined and dealt with in some way.  I am not suggesting we need to slap a ban on forestry or anything like it, but we need to examine its effect on the future of the communities living in the areas in question.</p> <p>  Although afforestation reduces the carbon footprint and has other positive features, it is very negative for the communities that live in the areas planted.  Something ought to be done to ensure we can keep rural schools open, rural communities active and the traditions of rural Ireland alive, if we want to cherish it.  We have to choose whether we want to maintain it.  Afforestation is destroying it where I live.  This issue needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  On land designation, TAMS and the new sheep fencing scheme, farmers are contacting me to state that, because their land has been designated, they are not allowed to fence it.  Therefore, their sheep are getting out onto the road and the county council is writing to them to ask them to fence their land because the sheep are causing accidents.  One sector is stopping people from fencing the land, while another is offering grants for fencing.  Some common sense needs to come into play in this regard, particularly where roads run through commonages.  A way needs to be found to square the circle.</p><p>I have a number of issues with the level of spending on agri-environmental schemes which include the REPS and the AEOS.  I wonder whether the funding for the REPS and the AEOS comes from the current or the previous CAP envelope.  This goes back to my point about the beef data and genomics scheme, that should the scheme run until  2020-21 and 2021-22, there would be no underspend on the projected spend under the current CAP programme.  The treatment of the REEPS and the AEOS is instructive in that regard.</p><p> In the reply to the parliamentary question I tabled last week it was stated that of the &euro;52 million that had been allocated for the REP scheme, just over &euro;30 million had been paid out in 2015.  Of the &euro;20 million allocated for the GLAS scheme, just &euro;11 million had been paid out.  However, there was an overspend of &euro;8 million under the AEOS.  Is it expected that there will be underspend this year and, if so, how will the money be utilised otherwise?  Will the Minister indicate his intentions on how to get more farmers involved in the GLAS scheme?  Does he expect the number of farmers participating in it to reach the 50,000 mark?</p></speech>

Onn the REPS payments to which I alluded in respect of the beef data and genomics scheme, it is a carryover from the previous rural development programme.  If the beef data and genomics scheme overruns, we have secured funding under the current programme.  If we were to reopen the scheme, it would run to 2021 and the payments would be made from the current envelope.  This goes back to my point that the overwhelming objective in the Department is not to leave one brown cent unclaimed under any of the co-funded schemes.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny raised a number of points about forestry.  I, too, represent a rural constituency and have been down this road before.  I know the emotion generated at public meetings where neighbouring landowners may wish to expand their holdings, but we must be very careful because an individual landowner has the right to sell his or her land and for every willing seller, there may be a purchaser.  </p> <p>  It is interesting to look at the profile of those investing in forestry.  I know that there is an inference in the debate on forestry in County Leitrim that it is "outsiders" or those involved in "big business" who are coming in to buy land.  In 2014, 96% of the investment made in forestry in the county was made by farmers and 4% by non-farmers.  In 2015, 81% of the investment was by farmers and 19% by non-farmers.  The Department cannot tell a landowner that he or she is not entitled to plant his or her land.  The scheme is open, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria.  Forestry is a critical component of the infrastructure used by the State in the context of climate change carbon sequestration.  As committee members know, the agriculture sector will have to carry its proportionate share to reduce the carbon footprint.  It is in that overall context that we have a great story to tell about the commitment made by the farming community generally, but forestry plays a critical part in the reduction of carbon levels.</p> <p>  Forestry generates significant employment, in planting, maintenance, harvesting and the building of forest roadways, as well as in the case of thinnings.  Medite has a significant new investment in Belview Port in Waterford.</p><p>We are benefiting from the downstream employment opportunity created by forestry.  It is displacing imports.  That is something we must be cognisant of as well.  We have a significant commitment to the industry.</p></speech>

Farmers are planting their land.  What we see is that a farmer with 100 acres decides to plant all of his land and so he or she ceases to farm.  They give up farming their marginal and poor quality land as they can make more from the forestry grants than they will make from farming the land.  That is the difficulty.  They then move away and there is nobody left in the area.  It is not an argument about whether forestry is good or bad, but the social and long-term consequences it has on the rural community.  That is the argument I want examined.</p> <p>  In regard to employment generated by forestry, I see most of the work is on mounding land for forestry and the people who have digging machinery do this work, and there is a bit of work in thinning and maintaining the forestry, but if one divides the work over the length of time it takes this crop to grow and mature, it generates a very low level of employment.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  Nobody is disputing these facts.  The problem that people have is that forestry sterilises the landscape and it will never produce anything other than the trees.  The trees require low level labour intensity.  There are vast areas of the country, whole townlands where nobody lives anymore.  That is the death knell of rural Ireland.  We see that mass afforestation in my part of the country will cause significant problems.  I accept all the positive arguments but the negative it has for the communities in which we live is the problem.  What are we going to do about that problem?  How can we ensure we can have other industries and other business that will maintain and sustain people to want to live and stay in these areas?  Can there be other incentives put in place?  There are significant incentives for people to plant land, yet there are few incentives for alternatives.  That is the challenge presented by afforestation.</p></speech>

In the programme for Government there is a commitment to review the impact of the forestry sector in rural communities.  I think the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as well as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have a role to play in that context.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine does not target any specific area.  It is the case that the return on investment relative to other farming opportunities, forestry would have significant advantages.  Deputy Kenny made the point that the problem arises where the farmer decides to plant 100% of his holding.  In fact some of the incentives offer significant encouragement to do the opposite, in terms of lower stocking densities, retaining their basic payments and so on, which the non-farmers would not benefit from.  </p> <p>  We are committed to a review of the area.  I appreciate the heat generated by that issue.  I have been in that space.  There is a range of issues at play, the right of the individual, who is the landowner, the strong constitutional and legal protections in respect of property owners and the right to farm their land, whether that is farming by livestock, by cropping, growing trees and the schemes on offer.  In fact, there is a slight skewing of the schemes in favour of people who remain some way involved in agriculture.</p><p>It is important to bear in mind the statistics in respect of who is planting in Leitrim.  One also has the benefit of downstream employment, something I forgot to mention in my headlong rush to highlight what is happening in Waterford port.  We have Masonite in Carrick-on-Shannon.</p></speech>

Deputy McConalogue had a query.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#GG00400"><p>Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of re-opening the GLAS scheme and I have dealt with his specific query.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny raised the issue of fencing.  In certain circumstances, there may be a requirement to get either planning or a certificate of exemption from the local authority.  In particular, that proviso may apply where replacement of existing fencing is required but that is a matter for the local authority.  Recently, my Department announced that fencing for sheep would be grant-aided under TAMS.  Again, fencing is an issue for the local authority.  I imagine, but I cannot be specific, that a letter of exemption from the local authority may be granted in cases where fencing is being replaced.  Fencing virgin territory, which is land that has never been fenced, may run into issues of planning approval.  I imagine that local authorities would adopt a pragmatic approach to the matter.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill raised the issue of the hen harrier, which I have dealt with previously.  As I said, we hope to submit a rural development amendment to the Commission by the end of this month.  Our ambition is to have the scheme up and running by 2017.  Through a combination of the new scheme and GLAS, we want something approaching equivalence to what existed previously for the landowners who face significant restrictions.  The GLAS scheme provides payments for designated Natura 2000 lands and there is prioritised access to GLAS in respect of those lands.</p></speech>

Evidence has come forward that the hen harrier can live in places that have different stages of forestry.  It would be desirable to allow that to happen rather than have a complete ban on an SAC.  As Deputy Kenny pointed out, if SACs were available for planting it would alleviate some of the problems that he mentioned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016062200002#GG00600"><p>All those issues form part of the long awaited threat response plan.  I am disappointed it has taken this long to get the plan finalised.  I take the point made.  It is interesting, in respect of the most recent survey on hen harriers, that the number of breeding pairs is still in decline notwithstanding all of the efforts made to date.  I know the hen harrier is a wonderful bird.  I have engaged with people who have their lands designated to protect this species and realise their work is informed by the objective of preserving the species.  At some stage, it may well be that science and research will conclude that something is amiss in respect of our endeavours to protect the bird.  One can see from the history of the planet that not every species survives.  I hope that the hen harrier can survive and prosper but we need to accelerate our endeavours to conclude the threat response plan.  We must see where that leads.  In the interim, my Department is doing everything possible in respect of amending the rural development programme and getting a scheme up and running in 2017.</p></speech>

The key policies driving this programme include providing farm income support through the implementation of the areas of natural constraint scheme and maintaining high standards of financial management, as verified by reports from the audit committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General, FEOGA - the certifying body - and EU auditors.  In budget 2016, &euro;200 million has been allocated to areas of natural constraint under the rural development programme, an increase on the initial allocation of &euro;195 million in previous years.  This funding will continue to support farmers farming in disadvantaged areas and will generate important multiplier effects in local economies.</p></speech>

If so, when will he give a commitment to do so?  Considering the financial pressure that farmers are experiencing, it is important that the commitment is given earlier in order to reassure them that the payment is on its way.</p> <p>  A commitment has been given to increase areas of natural constraint payments by &euro;25 million in budget 2018.  Will the Minister bring that increase forward into next year's budget?</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill and many other members mentioned the massive income pressure faced by farmers.  The dairy sector, in particular, is under severe pressure at present.  Does the Department have the ability - on foot of a request to Europe - to provide low-interest bridging finance to farmers?  Such an initiative would enable farmers to pay merchant bills and having to produce underneath the cost of production.  Will the Department introduce a scheme to provide low-income finance to farmers?  Will the Department engage with Europe to put a structure in place to deliver such a scheme?</p></speech>

There has been a certain amount of development over the years because much of this country has been designated as a disadvantaged area.  I come from an place that has very marginal and mountain lands.  The people there are very much of the view that increased designation is necessary and should happen in areas where it is needed most.  Farmers in these areas face the greatest struggle in order to make a living because the lands are the least productive - we have the longest winter and the soil condition is very poor.  It has been stated that an extra &euro;25 million will be made available next year.  I hope this money will be given to farmers who farm marginal and mountain lands.</p> <p>  Can the Minister tell me whether there is funding available for biomass production?  Alternative crops can be CO2 positive but they are short-term in nature and more labour intensive.  Is there a plan to introduce an increased level of support for biomass production?</p></speech>

We are pursuing, with the Commission, the possibility of facilitating the earliest possible payment of the basic payments scheme.  The earliest possible date allowed is 16 October.  We have raised the matter with the Commission but have not received an answer.</p><p>There is no prospect of the &euro;25 million being paid in 2017.  It will be paid in 2018, as per the programme for Government.  As Deputy McConalogue will be aware, regardless of how the &euro;25 million is apportioned between less and more severely handicapped areas, it will not make up for the cuts previously introduced.  It is a step in the right direction, but it will not take us back to where we were.</p><p> Regarding the point that more severely handicapped areas should have the first call, a review of disadvantaged areas is under way on foot of a European Commission decision.  It covers criteria in terms of the biophysical composition of lands, the slope, the drainage and so on.  The question of how the &euro;25 million is apportioned could fall into the outcome of that reclassification process.</p></speech>

What of his engagement with the Department of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys?  A White Paper on renewable energy has been produced.  A part of the problem for willow growers is finding a market for their product.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, a renewable heat incentive was introduced for the use of willow and other products.  In their experience, rewarding those who used the product seemed to be a more successful way of creating a market than giving capital grants for the installation of appropriate boilers.  A number of willow growers are struggling to find markets because of the lack of businesses and domestic users that have suitable boilers.  Will the Minister elaborate on this issue?  While we need to promote this work, it is essential that we view it in the round so as to ensure that there is a market once the product is produced.</p></speech>

We had a willow project, but it did not attract much interest.  We had a sum total of four applicants.  It was different to the conventional forestry programme in the sense that we did not pay a premium, but an establishment grant, because the harvesting period was much shorter.</p> <p>  I appreciate the Deputy's points about the benefit to municipal heating systems and so forth.  That said, it is one thing to grow willow, but it is another to have somewhere to send the product.  We need a full roadmap, not just for the product's growth, but for an outlet once it has been harvested.</p><p>Before we put our toes back in the water, we are anxious to ensure the scheme works.  It might be seen as a more appropriate forestry option in some of the communities to which Deputy Martin Kenny referred because there is a much shorter rotation.  We are considering the matter.  Our initial foray was not successful, with a total of four applicants under the scheme.</p></speech>

We are in consultation with farming organisations and are exploring what we can do on this matter.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which used to be the National Pensions Reserve Fund, are involved in providing lower cost loans for the farming community.  Some 21% of their investments to date have been in the primary producer sector, in particular, farming but also fisheries and forestry.  This space has only been open to us since the April Council's decision.  We are pursuing the possibilities in that regard.</p></speech>

They come from a variety of sources, the most important of which is the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, under which the rural development programme, RDP, is co-funded.  This year it is expected receipts amounting to &euro;239 million will come from that source.  Other receipts are related to charges for inspections and certification services.  There is some &euro;15 million from the European Union to meet the veterinary costs incurred under the eradication programmes; almost &euro;7.5 million from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, and &euro;14 million in departmental staff pension levy contributions.</p> <p>  Looking ahead to the remainder of this year and 2017, I am conscious that a number of challenges will be faced.  They include the Brexit vote which is to take place tomorrow in the United Kingdom, the continuing poor returns in the dairy sector, price volatility in the beef and pigmeat sectors, access to finance, programme for Government commitments in respect of a new &euro;25 million sheep scheme and the ongoing roll-out of the RDP and the seafood development programme, SDP.  Some 800,000 Irish jobs are either directly or indirectly dependent on trade in the economy.  Therefore, free trade agreements are important to us.  With the United Kingdom as our largest trading partner, the significant potential negative implications of a Brexit for the Irish agrifood sector are clear, as evidenced by the findings of reports conducted by the ESRI, Teagasc and others.</p><p>It is difficult to predict with certainty precisely what these impacts would be.  Possible consequences are foreseen in a number of areas, such as tariff and trade arrangements, EU budget standards, customs control and our fisheries sector.  My Department and I are continuing to reflect on these matters and are engaged in ongoing consultations with Government colleagues to ensure there is a coherent whole-of-government approach to the issue.</p><p> Ongoing low international dairy prices are expected to have a negative effect on dairy farm incomes in 2016 following several good years.  Increased price volatility has been experienced in other sectors in recent years, particularly beef, and is currently being experienced in the pigmeat sector.  I have met Commissioner Hogan several times and made proposals to him in response to the current market circumstances.  These include increasing the percentage of basic payments that could be paid in advance - a suggestion made by Deputy McConalogue a moment ago - introducing a further targeted aid package similar to that which was introduced last September, and increasing the volume limit for fixed-price intervention skimmed milk powder, to which the Commissioner has agreed.  Other suggestions I have made include the removal of custom tariffs and anti-dumping duties on the importation of fertiliser and an effort to resolve the veterinary issues which block trade with Russia.  I assure members that I intend to remain in close contact with the Commissioner on these proposals in the coming weeks.</p><p> Food Wise 2025 and the programme for a partnership Government contain prioritised actions aimed at improving access to finance as well as taxation responses to price and income volatility.  Access to finance is the lifeblood of a functioning economy and is essential in helping to develop and support small and medium enterprises, SMEs, across all sectors, not least agrifood.  I know from Central Bank data that the sector continues to be a significant component - almost 24% - of all new lending.</p><p> Liquidity at farm level is of concern.  Last week, I met the chief executive officers of two of the main banks and urged them to be aware of the need for flexibility in the context of increased income volatility.  The support of the banks is crucial, both at an individual customer level and for the sector and the economy generally.  As well as flexibility during the current market difficulties, I asked the CEOs to continue to help farmers and SMEs develop and prosper.  To facilitate this, I highlighted that both the availability and the cost of credit are crucial issues and that the prepared consumer food sector has identified access to finance as a particular issue.</p><p> The programme for a partnership Government provides for an allocation of &euro;25 million to the sheep sector in 2017.  This reflects the importance the Government attaches to the sector and its contribution to the rural economy.  The scheme payment is based on a proposed payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe.  The proposed scheme will be submitted to the European Commission for approval shortly as part of an amendment to the rural development programme.  Consultations are ongoing between my Department and the relevant stakeholders on the details of the scheme but have not yet concluded.  I am conscious that the scheme will have to take into account the range of challenges that exist in the sheep sector.  Particular account will be taken of the differences in management between lowland flocks and hill flocks.  It is my intention to make this scheme available to as many active sheep farmers as possible to allow the sector to avail of the opportunities identified for it in Food Wise 2025.</p><p> A key driver for increased resources in 2017 will be the rural development programme, RDP.  The programme will be the subject of an affordability review later in the year by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While my Department has not yet seen the terms of reference for the review, we will emphasise the importance of the programme to the rural economy and agriculture and seek to ensure that the maximum possible funding, in line with the agreed expenditure under the RDP measures, will be made available over the course of the programme to support investment and prioritise agricultural development and family farm incomes.</p></speech>

First, we will meet Professor Alan Barrett from the Economic and Social Research Institute.  We will then meet Professor John McHale, chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  He will be accompanied by Mr. Michael Tutty and Mr. Seamus Coffey who are members of the council.  We will also meet Mr. Robert Chote of the UK Office for Budget Responsibility.  He is in transit.  This is the final public meeting of the committee.  We can incorporate the issues arising from it and the replies due from Ministers into the series of recommendations that will form part of our report to the Sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform.</p> <p>  The main part of our report will involve recommendations.  The working paper circulated last week contained many of the recommendations to be considered.  To avoid confusion, we will use the working paper as the basis of our work.  Next Tuesday, 28 June, members will go through each recommendation and have an opportunity to add new recommendations, in addition to considering the document circulated.  Further amendments arising from what we heard yesterday and what we will hear today will be circulated to members in advance of the meeting on Tuesday.  Members should contact the clerk if they wish to introduce new recommendations.  We plan on meeting at 4 p.m. and it is likely that we will need to have another meeting on Wednesday.  It is also possible that we will need to meet again on Thursday in order that we can finalise the report.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I welcome the delegates, including those in the Visitors Gallery.   I draw their attention to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  I welcome Professor Alan Barrett from the Economic and Social Research Institute.  He is joined by Mr. John Palmer from the Department of Finance and Mr. William Beausang and Ms Sarah Swaine from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I invite Professor Barrett to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The task of redesigning the routes and mechanisms through which the Oireachtas can provide for greater scrutiny of the budget has the potential to yield considerable benefits.  As greater parliamentary scrutiny presents an opportunity for more evidence to be demanded in support of policy proposals, this, in turn, should lead to better policy outcomes.  For this reason, I am happy to contribute to the committee's deliberations.</p> <p>  I am here in my capacity as director of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  Therefore, most of my remarks will relate to the ESRI's current role in the budgetary process and its possible roles in assisting the Oireachtas in the future.  However, I have a direct personal interest in the ongoing process of redesigning the budgetary process, as I was one of the original members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, on which I served from 2011 to 2015.  I also chaired the first national economic dialogue in 2015 and will act as chairperson again next week when the second such event is convened.  When I take questions from members of the committee after my opening statement, I will be happy to reflect on the possible lessons which can be taken from my experience in the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the national economic dialogue.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about the specific role of the ESRI in the budgetary process.  According to its mission statement, its goal is "to produce economic and social research that informs public policymaking and civil society".  In this way, a large proportion of its research has a broad relevance for budgetary scrutiny.  For now, I will focus on the direct inputs which arise from two models that were developed by the institute and are maintained by us.  I refer to the macroeconomic model which was formerly known as HERMES and is now known as COSMO and the tax-benefit model which is known as SWITCH.  The SWITCH model which is used to assess the distributional impact of tax and social welfare changes is based on a large-scale representative sample of Irish households and allows us to calculate gains and losses across income distribution.  It is critical that the model is based on a large-scale sample.  In the absence of a tax-benefit model, analysts need to look at examples of households.  However, it is impossible to know if the examples chosen capture large or small proportions of the population.</p> <p>  The SWITCH model is used by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance, typically in collaboration with the ESRI, to simulate the distributional impact of tax and welfare changes.  The ESRI tends to publish a distributional analysis of the budget in the days following the Budget Statement.  The model has also been used in numerous research papers.  The most recent example is a paper published last week which compared financial incentives to work in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I should note that the SWITCH model has the potential to be used in proofing the budget along a number of dimensions.  I refer, for example, to poverty proofing, gender proofing and disability proofing.  As the model is based on a large-scale representative sample, it is possible to draw conclusions that cannot be drawn from an analysis of example households.</p> <p>  I now propose to discuss our model of the macro-economy.  We are in the process of retiring one model which was known as HERMES and introducing a new one which is known as COSMO.  These macro-models have typically been used by the Department of Finance to conduct sensitivity analyses of budgets' central forecasts.  Such analyses are published as part of the budget documentation.  In budget 2016, for example, the ESRI simulated how the headline economic figures would change if global GDP growth turned out to be 1% lower than forecast or if the household savings rate turned out to be 1% higher than forecast.  The Department of Finance also draws on the ESRI&rsquo;s macro-model to simulate the effect of policy changes where the effect is large enough to be captured at the macro-level.  For example, this year&rsquo;s spring economic statement included a simulation of the effect of income tax reductions on employment.  The macro-model has also been used in studies which seek to estimate the types of taxes which have the most detrimental impact on economic activity as measured by variables such as employment and GDP.</p> <p>  While the HERMES, COSMO and SWITCH models provide the platforms for the ESRI&rsquo;s most direct inputs into the budgetary process, many other strands of our work are relevant.  Some of this work is undertaken as part of joint research programmes with Departments.  I will use two examples to illustrate this.  Since 2015 the ESRI has operated a joint research programme with the Department of Finance.  Under this programme, we have conducted work on the relationship between corporation tax rates and foreign direct investment.  The findings were published last week.  The relevance to policy debates on taxation should be clear.  We are about to begin a project on wealth taxes, using newly available data for wealth which were collected by the CSO on behalf of the Central Bank.  I should note that one of the objectives behind this research programme is the generation of greater analytical capacity in the economics of taxation in the ESRI and the Department of Finance.  </p> <p>  We also have a joint research programme with the Department of Health.  The best known output from this programme was the report on universal health insurance published last year.  Under this research programme, we are working to develop a projection model for health expenditure.  It is hoped this will allow the Department to assess more accurately the impact of issues such as population ageing and unmet need.  The ESRI is also undertaking work on GP usage which will be important in estimating the likely cost of extending free GP care.</p><p> The institute is actively engaged in research across a wide range of other areas which are relevant but I will mention just one more for now.  For a long time, we have conducted evaluations of training and employment programmes and we continue to do this.  The most recent example was an evaluation of the back-to-education allowance and the results were striking, with little evidence of improved employment prospects for participants.  The policy conclusion was not that the programme should be ended.  Instead, the evaluation prompted questions about how the programme might be improved to meet its targets.</p><p> I mentioned at the outset that, from my perspective, one potential benefit from greater Oireachtas scrutiny of the budgetary process will be a greater demand for evidence in support of policy proposals.  Putting this another way, I see Oireachtas scrutiny as being another dimension in the move towards more evidence-based policy-making.  For this approach to yield benefits, it is important that the evidence used is generated through rigorous analysis.  In that context, the ESRI is eager to ensure that the research that we are conducting is readily available to the Oireachtas and communicated directly to members.  Our funding model makes it difficult for us to undertake substantial pieces of work unless the work is funded.  However, we are eager to co-operate with members and the proposed budget office as part of a general national effort to increase analytical capacity in our public administration with the overall goal of achieving better outcomes for our citizens.</p><p> I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

He has laid out some of the technical capacity and the two models that the ESRI develops and maintains.  Over the past five years I have contacted the ESRI many times seeking budgetary analysis and information on things like distributive analysis.  I have used such analysis, as have many other Members, to look at the regressive or progressive nature of recent budgets.  What can the ESRI do that others, specifically the Departments of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, cannot?  What quantitative and qualitative capacity does the ESRI bring to the table that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will not develop or that the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance do not possess?  What value does the ESRI bring to the table in the context of this new world of budgetary scrutiny?  I hope there will be better budgetary scrutiny.  What role does Professor Barrett believe the ESRI should play in this new budgetary regime?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.197" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#D00300"><p>In terms of what the ESRI can do that others cannot, my simple answer relates to the level of data analytical capacity within the institute.  Let me give some broad figures.  The institute has about 100 employees, 60 of whom are high-level researchers.  Some 50 of these researchers have PhDs - they are economists, sociologists and psychologists.  The ESRI's data analytical capacity is above and beyond that of any other organisation.  Part of what we do in terms of using data analytical capacity is generate the sort of models that I have described.  For example, our macroeconomic model was developed in conjunction with the Central Bank and a Department of Finance official is working on it with us.  The model is, nevertheless, very much led from within the ESRI, partly because we have a tradition of working in the area for about 35 years.</p> <p>  I have outlined data analytics and the generation of models but I shall go a littler further.  One of the things the institute is always eager to do is to ensure that a portion of its work is published in international peer reviewed journals.  Very often, when one says that to a public policy group, it sounds as if it is a group of academics who are indulging themselves but it is not as simple as that.  It is critical, from an ESRI perspective, that we publish our findings in high-quality journals and outlets in order to demonstrate that the work we are doing is of the highest international standards.  Some of the organisations mentioned would not have a culture of publishing at a high level.  I am not saying that every piece of the ESRI's work must be published in a peer review or anything of that nature.  It is very much part of the culture of the institute to be doing the work at a very high level and, of course, from an independent perspective.</p><p> A number of organisations around town are research institutes and think tanks.  The institute has no ideological backing, background or anything like that.  We try and go at the work in as pure a data analytical way as possible, bringing as little ideological baggage as possible.  Independence is critical.   In summary, there is a technical capacity, a constant drive for quality, an independent dimension and a critical mass argument.</p><p> In terms of what the role of the ESRI should be, as far as I am concerned it is an extension of what we do.  The institute's mission is to produce research for public policy and to inform civil society, which we take as informing debate.  As far as we are concerned we want to continue doing what we are doing.  Our joint goals are research excellence and policy impact.  We often distinguish ourselves from universities by saying that universities are sometimes interested in research as an end in itself but for the institute, research must have a policy dimension.</p><p> To the extent that we are producing work that is of relevance, if it was not relevant we would be very worried.  I estimate that between 70% to 80% of the ESRI's work should have meaning for the process of budget scrutiny.</p></speech>

Therefore, sometimes the work is useful to legislators but sometimes it is not or sometimes we would like extra pieces.  For the new committee that will be in place, there will inevitably be a set of prescribed analysis that it will need.  Let me give an example.  Yesterday, this committee met the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The delegation suggested that equality proofing, be it gender, poverty or human rights proofing, should be done by Departments for various reasons.  I suggested to the commission that somebody should play the role the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, plays with the Department of Finance and DPER.  In other words, validate the analysis.  The IHREC is one group that could potentially build up the capacity to do so.  The ESRI is the other obvious group that has the technical capacity to take the analysis from the Departments, put it through the hopper, come back to the standing committee and say, for example, &quot;70% of a matter is great but we question 20% and 10% is flat out wrong.&quot;  Obviously the ESRI carries out the main distributional analysis that we all use.  That role could be easily extended.</p><p>Professor Barrett has described the ESRI's <i>ad hoc </i>relationship with the budgetary process.  He has said that the ESRI does good work and that the nature of the ESRI's remit means the analysis will, hopefully, be useful to the committee and the Oireachtas.  My sense is that the committee will need more formalised arrangements with some analytical body as well as with the Departments.</p><p>Does Professor Barrett think that the ESRI is well placed to enter into a service level agreement with the standing committee to say, &quot;Yes, we are going to provide you in January with this, in March with this and in September with the following.&quot;  Does he believe that the ESRI has a useful role to play in this process?  Does he believe that the ESRI can play a useful role in equality, poverty and human rights proofing?  Did Garret FitzGerald set up the ESRI to provide a second view apart from the Departments?  I heard it was Garret FitzGerald at an interview.  Be that true or not, does the professor believe that the ESRI is well positioned to play a quality assurance role for the standing committee when it comes to equality proofing what comes out of the Departments?</p></speech>

The ESRI was not set up by Garret FitzGerald but by Dr. T.K. Whitaker.  When I became director of the ESRI one of the fun things that happened was that I got access to a whole load of files on the history of the institute.  I could have spent hours going through the files but I disciplined myself not to do so.  Garret FitzGerald was certainly involved in correspondence around the time.  Let me outline Dr. Whitaker's thinking at the time.  The institute was set up around 1960 and formed part of the Lemass-Whitaker revolution.</p><p>There was a recognition on Dr. Whitaker's part of a need for greater analytical underpinning to economic policy.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, was generating a great deal of data, but there was not a natural pool of people to conduct the analysis that fed into policy.  Dr. Whitaker set it up.  He was the leading public servant in Ireland at the time and possibly the greatest of the 20th century.  The first director of the institute was Professor Roy Geary, Ireland's greatest statistician of the 20th century and possibly ever.  The twin pillars of the institute were research and policy excellence.  I am sorry for the diversion, but the Deputy triggered it in my head with reference to Garret FitzGerald.</p><p> The Deputy began by saying that our research agenda was driven by ourselves.  That is not entirely true.  I will take a second to describe how the institute works.  We have an annual budget of approximately &euro;9 million, some &euro;2.5 million of which comes in the form of the block grant from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We use this grant-in-aid to perform certain actions, such as the simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model, the macro model and short-term forecasting.  The balance of our funding - approximately 60% - is partly raised through the research programmes that I mentioned as well as commissioned work.  In our research programme with the Department of Finance, the Department makes available a budget of &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000 per year and a steering committee comprising ESRI and departmental officials agrees the research projects that will be conducted over a two-year or three-year period.  It is a rolling cycle of research projects.  The Department tells us that it needs work to be done on X, Y and Z and we, as researchers, tell it that data are available to say something interesting on same, there are no interesting data or it is not a tractable problem.  There is an iteration.  This is how we respond to requests for research.  Likewise, we have research programmes with the Departments of Health and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and we work with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Defining the research agenda is interactive.</p><p> The relevance to this committee is that there would be the capacity for the institute to engage and determine whether we could provide more tailored research.  I hate to mention the grubby issue of money, but the institute's funding model is such that I do not have a team of people at Sir John Rogerson's Quay who have spare time.  They are typically doing work under the grant-in-aid or in response to the research requests to which I referred.  There is scope to engage with the committee, but a funding stream would need to be attached to it.</p><p> Previously, the SWITCH model was used for proofing.  Approximately one year ago, a paper considered the gender impact of the recessionary budgets, austerity budgets or whatever one wants to call them.  This is a track record on which we could develop.</p><p> Typically, we have not been a watchdog for the work of others.  I will be very honest and say that we would be slightly concerned about doing that.  This might sound precious, but we have a sense of how this sort of work is to be done properly.  Consider my comments on the importance of basing work on large-scale representative samples so as to give a real sense of the impact of certain measures across the population.  There are ways of doing this.  What the institute does is in line with what bodies like the OECD do.  I am worried that the committee might set us the task of overseeing someone else's work where we might have a different perspective of how the work should be done.  The idea of overseeing someone's work or commenting on it might exist in principle, but I will raise that concern.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the SWITCH model is quite old.  Does the ESRI have plans to update it?  I appreciate that this would require funding, probably from the Government.  Some work has been done on a more real-time model.</p><p>What would Professor Barrett describe as the strengths and weaknesses of this model?  For instance, certain distributional factors are included while others are not.  If a deprived area gets a new school, it does not count under the SWITCH model even though the impact on the children's lives is significant.  There are other, more concrete, examples.  I have never fully understood the rules of what the ESRI counts in and out.  Will Professor Barrett give us a picture of the situation?  His reference to the back to education allowance was probably a good example of the difference between researchers and politicians.  A great deal of money is spent on the allowance annually, amounting to more than &euro;200 million in the Department of Social Protection.  The ESRI's report was critical of the allowance because it did not seem to lead to people immediately getting jobs.  The response from many Deputies was that the allowance was important because it could, for example, be accessed by lone parents and the educational attainments had a value in themselves for a lone parent and his or her children, given that they are the people most at risk of poverty, but this is not captured in some of the types of analysis conducted by the ESRI.  This follows on from the previous question.  While I appreciate Professor Barrett's point that the ESRI does not have the job to be political, even with a small "p", it is analytical.</p><p> Down the years, I have seen a particular criticism of something that has led to a divide between the political perception and the analysis, namely, community employment.  As a consequence, when the crisis hit Ireland, everyone with a briefcase who came to advise us from outside read all of the ESRI's reports, which were not flattering towards the likes of community-based employment schemes even though many Deputies from across the political spectrum favoured them strongly because they saw the local impact.  Being able to put forward a range of views is important, but the ESRI could play a valuable role for the committee in explaining matters from an economic perspective.  The institute's staff are mostly economists and social researchers whereas we, as a political committee composed of diverse elected politicians, might view matters differently.</p><p> With the exception of the Department of Social Protection, I am unaware of any Department conducting pre-budget and post-budget distributional analyses of the budget on a continual basis, yet it is one of the suggestions that has been discussed at this committee.  Does Professor Barrett believe it is feasible for a range of Departments to conduct these analyses?  The Department of Social Protection's social impact analysis is partly based on the ESRI's SWITCH model work.  If it could find its way into some of the committee's analysis, it would be useful, but we would probably need a great deal of technical advice as to what would be desirable to be received from Departments so that, in theory, a budget's distributional impacts generally and on specific Departments could be analysed broadly.  On budget day, the initial pre-budget impact analysis could also be published.</p><p>This was mentioned by a lot of people in the discussions we have had to date.  Does Professor Barrett see that as being feasible?  Would the ESRI have a role to play in assisting the Departments and the budgetary oversight committee in that analysis?</p></speech>

On the point about the switch model being outdated, the switch model is continuously updated.  The dataset used is the European Union survey on living and income conditions, which is collected in Ireland and throughout the rest of Europe and that data is constantly fed in.  When I made the point that the model was developed and maintained, a significant amount of the ESRI investment on this, using the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform grant-in-aid, is in ensuring that the data is up to date.  We have had discussions with a range of Departments to see if the funding for switch can be increased to allow for a quicker updating and also for the pooling of data across waves.  We are in a pretty good ---</p></speech>

The survey is collected every year.  If one starts adding waves together, so that one is not just dealing with one year's data in the model but two or three years' data, that means that one has much bigger sample sizes and can start looking at, for example, the effect of welfare payments that are received by a relatively small group of people.  I can give one example that came up recently, which I hope is a good example.  An examination of the effect of housing-related payments was difficult with the original switch because such payments are not like unemployment or pension payments.  The number of people involved is smaller and therefore the data was not so robust but the additional data work that has happened there is going to allow for richer analysis.</p> <p>  Deputy Burton asked a broader question which is an interesting one, on the advantages and disadvantages of switch.  I have already touched on the advantages in terms of the fact that there is simply no other way to get that population-level sense of the distributional impacts if one is not doing switch-type analysis.  That advantage is clear.  The downside, of course, is what is not included although we have tried to extend things.  One of the big innovations we are working on at the moment is the issue of medical cards, for which I should give my colleague Dr. Tim Callan and his team credit.  The issue of medical cards has now come on the agenda.  The Department of Health will become a co-funder of the switch model with a view to factoring in medical card entitlement and impact.  That is a very significant addition -----</p></speech>

If the person living in house No. 1 on a street has a medical card while the person living in house No. 10 is working in a low-paid job but does not qualify for a medical card, on the switch model, the only income for the person in house No. 1 that is included is that from the Department of Social Protection but the value of the medical card to that person, who may have a spouse and two children, could be &euro;400 to &euro;500 per year, particularly if there are medical conditions involved.</p></speech>

For a very long time the primary funder of the switch model was the Department of Social Protection which did not go near things like medical cards and so forth.  Now that more Departments are getting involved, those sorts of issues are being included.  The other thing that switch was previously not very good at was capturing issues around indirect taxes.  This is very important because we know from research that I and others have done that indirect taxes are typically more regressive than direct taxes.  Therefore, when we were doing the analyses but not picking up the indirect elements, there was an omission.  That said, these are weaknesses that can be plugged and there is a very active programme of work under way to make sure that they are plugged.</p> <p>  There is a bigger criticism that can be made.  The critical thing that switch tries to get a handle on is distributional impact and whether budgets are regressive or progressive.  One could make a budget look very progressive by introducing, say, a 98% tax rate at the higher end and increasing all welfare payments by 100%.  That would be a very progressive budget ---</p></speech>

I just glanced in that direction and saw a smiling face.</p> <p>  That would look good from a distribution perspective but some people would question whether a budget like that would have economic impacts that are worth discussing.  At that level, one wants to have interactions and parallel analysis using the macroeconomic model and the SWITCH model.  I have heard people criticise SWITCH on that basis, namely that it can give one a particular outcome but that it is partial.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned our analysis of the back to education allowance scheme and criticisms of that.  Just to be clear on that, the Department of Social Protection asked us to do a study to determine the employment effects of the back to education allowance.  The ESRI was asked a very clear question and had a contract to deliver on that.  We answered that question, which was that the allowance had very little impact on people's employment.  We said in the report that there were multiple reasons for having such a programme and that it may be doing spectacularly well in other dimensions but we were not asked to look at those other dimensions.  If one thinks in terms of a committee, I can imagine a politician who is very enthusiastic about the back to education programme and believes it is wonderful because it does A, B and C, where A might be generating good pathways back to employment.  I believe there is value in even partially looking at and interrogating whether programmes are doing what they claim to do.  There was a similar issue with regard to community employment schemes.  For a long time there was a narrative around community employment that suggested that it was an employment programme.  I could say that the ESRI said but the ESRI never says anything - ESRI researchers write their reports and are responsible for the content.  The ESRI simply publishes material and gives it a stamp to verify that it has passed refereeing processes and that the institute believes the analysis is sufficiently robust.  The ESRI itself never says anything.  On community employment, the researchers said that the scheme was not an effective way of getting people back into mainstream employment.  That was all.</p> <p>  The last point I would make is that one of the research programmes currently under way at the ESRI is with Pobal.  To come back to an earlier theme about research and why it should be more interactive, the ESRI has being doing evaluations with Pobal.  That organisation has raised a very important point with the ESRI.  We have been looking at the effect of Pobal programmes on individuals.  Let us say for example the question is whether a particular Pobal programme helps to get people back into the labour market.  However, Pobal is very interested in the community-level impact of what it is doing.  Pobal has come back to the ESRI, told us that what we are doing is really good but have asked us to develop tools and mechanisms that will allow for an assessment of whether certain programmes are having a community-level effect.  We are now talking to Pobal about how this might be done.  That is a really positive example of us producing research output, engaging with an agency which asks us to do more and then the ESRI trying to do that.</p> <p>  The last issue raised concerned various Departments doing lots of analyses-----</p></speech>

A budgetary committee would need information that is useful and not just bits of information that are supportive of particular positions.  There is an argument to be made for ensuring that any budgetary oversight committee which will be discussing the evidence on a particular policy proposal will at least agree on the single piece of evidence that it wants to deal with, as opposed to having multiple pieces of evidence.  That could be tricky however.</p></speech>

Does the Department of Finance rely on the ESRI's model or does it have its own model?  What model does the European Commission use?  How does the ESRI relate to the European Commission in terms of any modelling analysis the latter carries out?  Is the model we use - set up by T.K. Whitaker, which was an interesting piece of history - matched by other similar sized countries in the European Union, like Austria, Finland or Denmark?</p><p>What do they tend to use in terms of economic research analysis?  How much of the ESRI's research analysis, particularly that relating to the Department of Finance, takes place <i>ex ante</i>rather than looking at decisions after the fact?  As a specific example, what involvement did the ESRI have in analysing the spring economic statement, which was published yesterday?  What involvement did it have in analysing the earlier stability programme update before it was published?  I was interested to hear that the ESRI has 100 staff.  How many staff did the ESRI have five years ago and ten years ago?</p></speech>

The Department of Finance does not have its own macroeconomic model of the Irish economy.  It has historically relied on the ESRI model.  To be clear, it made an input into the development of the original HERMES model approximately 30 years ago.  An official from the Department is working with us on the development of the COSMO model.  It does not have its own model.  We lead the model that is used, although it has an input into that model.  I am aware that part of the Department's rationale for having an official working closely with us is that this person can do their own runs of the model.  Typically, we have done those runs for the Department.  On the question of how countries internationally organise their------</p></speech>

We do not tend to engage in a model-on-model sort of interaction with the European Commission.  When Commission officials come to Dublin to do assessment exercises and forecast rounds, etc., they meet representatives of the ESRI and we discuss the output of our model.  The Commission certainly has its own models.  I think one of them is called the QUEST model or something like that.  I am not necessarily aware of conversations between the ESRI and the European Commission on modelling issues specifically.</p></speech>

Funnily enough, we were very critical of some of the things done by the Commission.  Needless to say, there was a general recognition during the economic crisis that everybody's economic models had performed very badly.  One group might have been saying its model did not perform quite as badly as another group's model.  I might be missing something, but I am honestly not aware of ongoing debates on that issue.</p></speech>

This was a sort of academic concern for a very long time, but it has taken on a new reality under the new fiscal rules.  While the Deputy is right when he suggests there was criticism regarding a specific issue, I do not think the criticism necessarily related to broad modelling issues.<br/><br/>Deputy Ryan's second question related to economic research in other countries.  There is no single model on this.  Some of the larger countries have multiple models with various different sources of funding.  The United Kingdom has two research institutes that mirror the ESRI.  Both of these agencies - the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - tend to draw on Government funding through competitive grants.  The UK system is a little different from the system in Ireland.  The CPB in the Netherlands is an independent but fully state-funded statutory organisation that does everything the ESRI does, as well as many things that are proposed for the budgetary office.  For example, it does costings of budgetary programmes and election manifestos, economic forecasting and a range of other activities.  There is no sort of single model that applies.<br/><br/>The Deputy also asked whether our analysis is <i>ex ante</i>or <i>ex post</i>.  The vast majority of what the ESRI does would have an <i>ex post</i>dimension.  When a particular policy or programme is operating, we typically use data to see what is, or what has been in the recent past.  The exception to that is our input into something like the spring or summer economic statement.  I will explain how it works.</p><p>The Department of Finance asks the institute to use the macro model to run a whole load of simulations.  I touched on this in my opening statement.  A simulation might relate to the impact on Ireland of GDP in the global economy being 1% lower than it is or the effect on this country of an interest rate increase.  The Department will have a sort of central forecast on which all its numbers hang and we look at the possible effects of various sensitive-type issues on that.  The Department asks us to do policy simulations and to ask &quot;What if&quot; questions.  This requires us to look at the effects of major tax changes, for example.  Capital expenditure often arises in this context.  We might be asked to assess the impact of a doubling in the public capital programme, for example.  I will explain how it tends to work.  After the Department of Finance has contacted us, one of my colleagues will work quite intensively for a week or two.  It is very often the case that just one or two of the simulations run by the ESRI make it into the budgetary documentation.  There is a sense that a lot of thought goes into this work, but the set of material that appears is quite condensed.  There would be a good degree of <i>ex ante</i>work at that level.<br/><br/>Historically, the European Commission was one of the biggest generators of <i>ex-ante</i>analysis.  In the era when a great deal of EU money was being spent in Ireland, the EU was very good at demanding that we did <i>ex ante</i>evaluations of moneys that were to be spent.  The ESRI worked on these programmes at a sectoral level but also at a macro level.  I started at the ESRI in 1994.  One of the first studies I worked on was published in 1997.  The project was led by Patrick Honohan.  We put together figures as part of one of the major evaluations of all EU structural spending in Ireland in the 1990s.  There was great discipline in those exercises because they forced Departments and others to think through what the effects would be and whether the sort of expenditure that was being talked about could be justified.  I have often thought that one of the unfortunate things about European money drying up, apart from the money going, was that some of this intensive evaluation culture left us.  It is still there, but it is not applied as rigorously as it previously was.  Others have spoken about this as well.<br/><br/>The Deputy also asked about staff numbers.  While I can provide the numbers, this issue is slightly complicated by a particular decision that was taken by Senator Reilly when he was Minister for Health.  The ESRI had a significant number of people - between 20 and 25 officials - collecting hospital-related data.  The then Minister decided that work would be taken from the ESRI and given to what ultimately became the Healthcare Pricing Office.  We lost 25 people, in a sense, at that time.  We have been building up ever since.  I could give the Deputy figures, but they would not illustrate neatly the underlying situation in the ESRI.  I should say the ESRI was not subject to the public sector employment embargo that affected other offices.  Its independence meant it could carry on hiring in recent years.  Its grants and pay levels were cut and various things happened, but it was not subject to the employment embargo.</p></speech>

Regardless of what kind of budgetary committee is set up, it will have to deal with the spring economic statement in some way.  I will not ask for the ESRI's view on this because it does not have a view.  What is Professor Barrett's view on how we deal with that data?  Sometimes there are conflicts between what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council tells us, what the Department of Finance tells us and what the Government then presents in the spring economic statement.  It was announced yesterday that there will be approximately &euro;660 million available for current expenditure.  That does not, however, take account of the standstill position, on which the ESRI has commented in the past.  I think it said, in the context of last year's budget, that welfare increases of &euro;450 million would be needed to manage the standstill position, which is based on indexed payments.  It seems there is some kind of consensus on moving beyond indexation of tax bands or social welfare payments.  I think this is a way to suggest that there is more flexibility than is actually the case.</p><p>In terms of proper budgeting and dealing with the evidence and data, is that an appropriate stance to take or should the standstill position or indexing be factored into the way data are presented to us?</p></speech>

The development of the new model partly related to the need to plug that particular gap.  The financial side, therefore, has now been factored into the model.</p> <p>  I am not sure there is a right or a wrong answer to this.  The institute has typically in its analysis indexed all welfare payments to wage increases in its thinking about the budget.  That was the standard approach we took.  It may be partly driven by the fact that the institute for a long time was involved in the measurement of poverty and reporting on poverty statistics.  It is a simple point that if wages are increasing in the economy and welfare payments remain constant, increased poverty is being engineered into the system given poverty is defined as a proportion of average wages.  Researchers in the institute always had trouble getting their heads around a scenario where there was non-indexation while wages were increasing, but they would have to stand over a position that poverty could be increasing when it was a clear objective of Government to reduce it.  It always struck me as somewhat inconsistent to say there should be zero indexation but any indexation is a proactive decision to provide.  There are different positions on it.  I have had this discussion with colleagues in the Department of Finance who always make the more legalistic point that when the Minister stands up on the day of the budget, it is a decision to increase and it is not automatic.  There is not necessarily a right and wrong answer but the key point is the committee needs to have analytical capacity, either in the heads of members or provided to them by someone in a support role in order to put them in a position to tease out the different positions that will be presented.</p> <p>  These are complicated issues.  The worst of all worlds is where people are not explicit about the assumptions underpinning the figures they are talking about.  To talk delicately about the issue that blew up during the election campaign in respect of fiscal space and precisely how much money is available, nobody was necessarily saying anything that was incorrect but people were not being completely explicit about the assumptions underpinning the figures they provided.  There is a sense that members need to be well informed enough to know what are the questions they should ask.</p></speech>

Presentation of data is crucial.  Professor John FitzGerald's comments to the banking inquiry were insightful.  He said models do not get the answers wrong; it is the individuals who use the models or who do not understand them that get the answers wrong.  Giving a model to someone who does not understand it is similar to giving a box of matches to a child.  There is an expectation in society that approximately &euro;600 million will be available for current expenditure.  Should it not be the case that - while it is ultimately a Government decision - a standstill position would require X amount of this to be absorbed?</p> <p>  We are well familiar with what the ESRI does and we have our ups and downs in respect of some of its analysis.  It is interesting that the question that is put sometimes reflects the way the answer is given.  Professor Barrett has experience of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the ESRI and the national economic dialogue.  If he was to write the report we, as a committee, are tasked with, which is to make recommendations on how a budgetary committee should be established and the establishment of an independent parliamentary costings office, what priority recommendations would he make?</p></speech>

I do not know what vision members have of how this will pan out.  The potential added value relates to the fact that the budgetary process is carried on behind closed doors to a certain extent at the moment.  Members will be in a position to publicly ask people to justify whatever choices they are making.  To interrogate, it comes back to information and the quality of the committee's investigation will be heavily dependent on the quality of the information that members have to hand.</p> <p>  I have talked about what the ESRI does.  We do a good job at providing good information.  It may be partial.  For example, it may be that we have been asked to study something in a particular way but it is based on good, rigorous analysis.  Members need good quality information that they can use but they should not become totally fixated that the only issues floating around are demographic pressures and inflation.  The budget relates to between &euro;50 billion and &euro;60 billion worth of expenditure and taxes and so on.  At the National Economic Dialogue, people constantly said we cannot raise tax on labour because that is bad for jobs.  Perhaps that is true.  For example, if 1% was added to the marginal tax rate, what would that do to jobs?  That is an empirical question.  Sometimes, a mantra is put out there.  Somebody like the good Deputy might have suggested that corporation tax should increase and perhaps it should, but at least the ESRI published analysis last week which showed that if that was done, this is what we estimate the impact would be on foreign direct investment.  The Deputy may say that is a price worth paying or he may disagree with the analysis but at least he has a piece of work that tries to set out and answer the question and provide evidence on the issue he is dealing with.  My vision of what the committee should be doing is bringing public forum evidence to bear.  When the evidence is not there, members will ask people to justify the choices they are making.</p></speech>

I welcome the entire process and it is good that it is being opened up.  We have to figure out how best to establish that process to achieve the maximum transparency and the most comprehensive debate in the run-in to producing a budget.</p> <p>  Professor Barrett made a point about not having ideological baggage and so on.  One of the issues Nyberg pointed out in his report was that contrarian thinking was not taken seriously.  That was an understatement in the context of the failure of all sorts of models and think tanks to see what was coming in 2008 and to understand how severe it could be.  ESRI staff put their hands up and said they did not recognise the extent of the banking and financial crisis.  How can we be sure the same is not happening again and that contrarian thinking is still not being marginalised within the ESRI or anywhere else?</p> <p>  When I studied economics for the leaving certificate, the entire book by Noel T. Palmer was about market theory.  There was one page on Marx's labour theory of value and it just said it was wrong.</p><p>They just went on to enunciate the Smith and Ricardo outlook.  Can Professor Barrett assure me that the contrarians get a fair shot?  </p></speech>

I concede that the institute did not see the full extent of what was coming down the road but we published Professor Morgan Kelly's paper on housing.  I know that it was Morgan Kelly's and UCD's work but the institute published the paper.  Why?  I remember that he submitted the paper to our quarterly economic commentary - we sometimes publish work by outsiders.  We read his paper and thought it was an interesting and important piece of work.  We did not agree with the findings but we published it because we thought it met the type of analytical standards that the institute appreciated.  In that context, surely we deserve some credit for having done so.  We came under an awful lot of pressure about publishing the paper but it was important, from the independence perspective of the ESRI, that it was published.</p></speech>

I can develop the point even though I have given a simple answer.</p> <p>  I will take a second stab at explaining.  As much as 98% of what we do is analysing data sets.  We do not sit around all day theorising about market economies, Marx and all those sorts of things.  Typically, we get a data set and then we figure out what the data is telling us about whatever issue.  Let me give the example of a policy evaluation of the back to education allowance.  In that case one has data and one tries to hammer it out.</p> <p>  Everything that comes out of the institute is peer reviewed.  That means two or three people within our building will read people's work.  We often send it to outside reviewers as well and say, "Is the analysis of the data up to a good standard and are people drawing the correct conclusions on the basis of the results, as presented?"  I cannot give the committee a cast iron 100% guarantee that everything is always kosher because people are human.  People can make mistakes in data analytics and people's interpretations can go wrong.  What I can say is that the institute has tight quality control devices to make sure that the analysis of the data and the presentation is as truthful as can possibly be imagined, which to me is pure.  We are not funded by any particular people on the left or the right.  We are, on occasion, criticised with people saying, "You are funded by the State so that must mean the institute is at its beck and call".  To explain, I refer to the back to education allowance or the publication of Morgan Kelly's paper.  I always have the view that the institute does not set out to annoy anybody in Government circles.  I always think that there is something healthy about being criticised because if we did not fall out with Departments periodically, and if they did not like what we said, then we would not be doing our job.  The Department of Social Protection has accepted what we have done.  Various agencies over time, if one produces results that are very critical of them, tend not to be too pleased, needless to say, but that is the institute doing its job. </p></speech>

The professor has said that the institute deals with data and has certain models, which implies that there is not much in terms of subjective analysis.  Is that what he is saying?  Is there debate?</p></speech>

People are really put through their paces within the institute.  No piece of work comes out of the institute unless it has been reviewed by two or three people.  We are the Economic and Social Research Institute so we have a pool of sociologists who perhaps have different disciplinary perspective on matters.  I am not saying we get it perfect or anything like that.  There are notions that sometimes exist about us and the Deputy may have heard better descriptions than me.  We are not a right-wing organisation.</p></speech>

I had the following conversation with somebody from the Department of Social Protection who once attended one of our review meetings; I will not name the person.  She said she was absolutely amazed at how robust the discussion was over a piece of work.  I refer to a situation where a researcher has produced a piece of work that has really been kicked around and asked to justify the conclusions reached.  The Department had funded the work and one of its officials attended the refereeing meeting.  She commented on how robust the debate was.  She then assumed that half of the group would not talk to the other as they left the meeting but realised that everybody went to coffee together.  Robust debate is considered part of one's role in the institute.  I often say that the people who work in the institute have a role to play in terms of writing the reports but they also have the important role of commenting on other people's reports.  I shall outline one of the areas where this arises, and I may meander ever so slightly.  People say that the ESRI could be run virtually, that we do not need to have an office and everybody could work in their own office but send their work in.  However, another important dimension of the ESRI is its ability to have a collection of people who work together, interrogate people's work and feed off one another.</p></speech>

I am afraid that the models do not take enough account of human experience, which kind of follows Deputy Burton's comment.  Should the models include surveys of target groups?  The people affected should be asked how something will impact on them, rather than just use statistics and figures.  I often think statistics and figures can be limited in what they say about the impact on human beings, which is after all what this is really all about.</p></speech>

I will make sure an invitation is sent directly to the Deputy.</p> <p>  The Deputy does not understand that even economists have feelings but I will not rehearse the discussion we had on this once before.  I agree with him that only so much can be captured in a model.  He needs to understand that economists are, increasingly, looking at a whole range of indicators, including notions of well-being.  It is becoming a big part of what we do and I shall give a personal example.  My most recent economics paper is on the mental effects of retirement and was published a few weeks ago.  In terms of what was the dependent variable that I was interested in, and we have used Trinity's TILDA data, The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, we are looking at whether people's depressive symptoms increase when they retire.   </p></speech>

Does he envisage the ESRI not having a formal relationship with the new committee as such?  Does he see it giving information or advice at particular intersections in the fiscal and budgetary cycles without, in fact, having a formal relationship?  Would the institute need significant additional capacity such as 100 staff to adequately assist the committee and resource it if a formal relationship was required?  It is now significantly bigger than it was before the crash.  There was criticism of it in the run-in to the crash.</p> <p>  Professor Barrett has stressed that data are crucial.  I had a similar experience to that of Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett when I brought before the last D&aacute;il my High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill which the Government refused to advance.  At the time, I was of the view that there were large gaps in the data available, especially data indicating the level of interaction with Revenue.  Is there a web of information which we do not have but which other countries&rsquo; budget committees do?  In Norway everybody knows what everyone earns and how much wealth everyone has.  Is that something we should try to advance?</p></speech>

There would be no problem if the relationship involved relatively minor inputs such as ESRI staff presenting on various issues.  That is part of our public good remit.  If the committee wanted to have pieces of work done, that would be possible and we would be happy to engage in those discussions.  I hate mentioning money, but that is an issue that would accompany it.  I am not allowed to go back to headquarters unless that message is well understood.  We can have discussions and there are possibilities.</p> <p>  There is an issue as to whether data are being collected.  The situation in Scandinavia is different because there is the tracking of individuals.  I attended a presentation recently with the head of the Danish statistics office.  He said their census was run by two guys and that it took them about one week to complete.  They do not have to go out and count everybody because they have data for everybody.  They have phenomenal data which are collected over time.  They are not just for their income and wealth but also their engagement with the health system and so forth.  They have very different ways of doing it for historical reasons.  We do not have that level of data available  .However, more data are being collected over time.  The wealth issue is one on which we typically did not collect data in Ireland, but that gap is being plugged through the Central Statistics Office and the Central Bank.  From an ESRI perspective, we find the CSO very accommodating.  Subject to the rules of data protection, it generally tries to facilitate us with data it has available.  If the data are available, we have good access to them.  </p> <p>  Professor John McHale and his colleagues will talk about their more direct interactions with the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

It could also provide a valuable input at two other stages in the budgetary cycle.  Up until now, its representatives have appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform twice a year, in December and June after publication of the council&rsquo;s fiscal assessment reports in which the autumn budget and spring SPU, stability programme update, are assessed.  A third appearance by them following publication of the council's pre-budget statement in mid-September could also be useful.  The statement sets out the macroeconomic and fiscal context for the forthcoming budget and discusses the council&rsquo;s view of the appropriate fiscal stance.</p> <p>  Although the council favours publication of the summer economic statement at the same time as the SPU in April, the role of its pre-budget statement would be enhanced in the new system if the timing of the summer economic statement was similar to this year.  Given the greater Oireachtas focus on the national economic dialogue, this is a fourth stage in the new budgetary process where the council would welcome the opportunity to provide an input.  It could play an important briefing role at the dialogue by providing the macroeconomic and fiscal context for discussion at this event.</p> <p>  Our written submission deals with two other issues.  The council would like to emphasise the importance of informative medium-term fiscal forecasts to underpin the proposed new budgetary process.</p><p>We need the data and forecasts, including those of the Department of Finance, to be published before we can carry out the assessments.  That is why our two key reports thus far came out after the SPU.  When the information is available, we need time to analyse it, but we bring out our analysis as quickly as we can.  It comes out in early June.  Following the budget, we carry out a series of statutory assessments and the report comes out in late November or early December.<br/><br/>The third appearance we suggested following our pre-budget statement has somewhat more of an <i>ex ante</i>flavour to it in terms of our recommendations, particularly on the fiscal stance.  However, it could also be more constructive because it would follow on from the summer economic statement and the mid-term expenditure report.  We can have most value when we are actually commenting on specific publications or documents, but we certainly would be open to having the engagement earlier.  In recent years we have produced our pre-budget statement in September.  It would make sense to have it earlier, potentially in August, but still following the mid-term expenditure report and the summer economic statement.  Beyond this, we would be open to suggestions on how we could be of even further help to the committee.  If other appearances would be useful even earlier in the process, while recognising our key function is carrying out the various statutory assessments, we would certainly be open to making them.  Our goal is to be as supportive as we possibly can.  We would be very happy to discuss suggestions members might have on when the committee would like to receive input from the council.</p></speech>

Let me outline my understanding from our discussions with the Department of Finance and others involved in the process.  There was a question about whether the Oireachtas committee could be involved in the stability programme update in advance of being published and considering the question of when it could take place.  There are tight timelines.  Data are required in March for the first quarter returns.  My understanding of the process is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was directly involved with the Department of Finance in the process of shaping in advance of the stability programme update being written.  In that case, the council&rsquo;s work is <i>ex ante</i>with the Department.  My question is whether we can include the Oireachtas in the <i>ex ante</i>assessment of what the stability programme update might be, even if there is a tight timeline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#T00300"><p>One of our functions is to endorse the macro-economic forecast, not the budgetary forecast, on which the stability programme and budget are based.  We do see the Department's forecasts in advance of their being published and we then undergo a very rigorous endorsement exercise.  We produce our own benchmark forecasts as part of that process, which we use for comparison purposes with the official forecasts.  However, the Department has made important points on the need for reasonably up-to-date data in order to produce its forecasts.  It is only in March that the national accounts for the previous year are available.  To try to produce forecasts in advance of having the data would lead to lower quality forecasts.  Even when we receive the forecasts, the timelines are very tight because they are produced only after the data become available.  In terms of forecast provision, it would be difficult to bring it forward.</p> <p>  The main issue is not so much the timing of the SPU but the content.  If I were in the members' position, it would be a matter of trying to get as much detail as possible on the actual policy plans contained in the SPU and associated spring or summer statement, depending on the timing.</p><p>As explained in its reports, the projections made in the SPU have recently contained limited detail on the Government&rsquo;s envisaged policies and do not fully incorporate the costs of maintaining existing public service levels and real benefits.  Yesterday&rsquo;s summer economic statement goes some distance towards incorporating envisaged Government policies in official forecasts by showing the path for revenue and expenditure in a scenario where the available net physical space is used.  However, it is still not clear how this is to be reconciled with the estimated costs of simply standing still in the provision of public services and maintaining the purchasing power of social protection benefits.  In the absence of informative medium-term forecasts for revenue, expenditure, the deficit and the debt, the capacity to have a meaningful Oireachtas input in advance of the budget and SPU would be severely limited as policy debate would be based on unrealistic technical projections for the public finances.  The reform of the budgetary process should be accompanied by a move to provide more informative medium-term forecasts on a stand-still basis, as well as by a forecast that includes the impact of the Government&rsquo;s envisaged tax and spending policies.  Such plans are needed for effective management of the public finances, as well as being a requirement of the EU budgetary frameworks directive.</p><p> While the proposed parliamentary budget office, PBO, could play a valuable role in the budgetary process, its precise design and functions need to be carefully considered to ensure its effectiveness.  The committee could consider a PBO, the role of which would lie somewhere between the current proposal for a PBO with limited functions and one with a more extensive remit.  A PBO that is well resourced but with a degree of discretion and strong independence seems to be a better model compared to the one proposed.</p><p> Summing up, the council believes it could play a valuable supporting role for the Oireachtas in augmenting the two current appearances by its representatives before the Oireachtas with a third in September following publication of its pre-budget statement.  In addition, it could contribute to the new budgetary process by providing a briefing for the national economic dialogue.  To allow meaningful Oireachtas participation, the proposed changes to the budgetary process need to be underpinned by the provision of informative medium-term budgetary forecasts.  </p><p> The council is grateful for the opportunity to share with the committee its views on the proposed new budgetary process and welcomes members&rsquo; questions and feedback.</p></speech>

My general understanding of the OECD review of the budgetary scrutiny process is that there is a need for more timely intervention by the Oireachtas in advance of decisions being made as part of the process.  As we heard in an earlier presentation, such open scrutiny would improve the public policy approach to budgeting.  Is it not possible in order to inform the process, rather than having a meeting in December after the budget is published and a meeting during the summer after publication of the summer economic statement, to have dialogue between the committee and the Fiscal Advisory Council in the interim period, possibly in April before publication of the stability update or in June in advance of publication of the summer statement or the national economic dialogue?  A meeting held in advance might improve the quality of that dialogue.  Similarly, the idea of having a meeting in September in advance of the more final budget negotiations makes sense.  If we are to have a third meeting which would be good, could we switch the date to make it part of a live process?</p> <p>  I was interested in what Professor McHale had to say about the need for better forecasting in the medium term.  I do not know whether he heard Professor Barrett from the ESRI.  What is the difference between forecasting and modelling?  Is the model the tool to deliver forecasts?  Is Professor McHale saying we need to use that model as part of this process to deliver forecasts?  Is there another mechanism for delivering the forecasts he is considering?</p></speech>

Its function essentially is to provide a number of assessments and endorsements.  Thus, it has a certain <i>ex post</i>focus.  We assess the budgetary forecasts.  We also assess and endorse the macro-economic forecasts.  We assess the Government&rsquo;s fiscal stance on the basis of whether it is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management.  We also assess compliance with fiscal rules.</p><p>It should be noted that we have been quite critical in recent reports of the lack of information on medium-term plans in the stability programme update, SPU, and last year of the content of the spring statement.  There has been considerable progress in the summer statement.  One of the problems in the past was that the medium-term forecasts, that is, the budgetary forecasts, were developed based on the scenario of no policy change.  Even though last year it was indicated that the intention was to use the available fiscal space, the medium-term forecasts put forward were based on none of that fiscal space actually being used, which led to very uninformative medium-term forecasts.  There has been a substantial advance in the summer statement which includes medium-term forecasts that are based on the Government's plans in terms of the use of the fiscal space.  However, I think more detail could be provided and, from the point of view of the scrutiny role of this committee, the more information that the committee has on Government plans the better it will be able to do the job of scrutiny.  The committee must avoid a situation where it is being asked for suggestions that may or may not be taken into account.  However, the more it knows what the Government is planning to do and the more that information is built into the forecasts, the more effective that scrutiny role can be.</p></speech>

It is not just about the volume of information, it is also about the quality of that information and whether we obtain the information we really want.  There may have been a perception in the past that certain Departments, in an attempt not to see any action by a committee, might provide large amounts of information to ensure that nothing would happen.</p></speech>

It is a balancing act and I recognise that there are certain limits to the level of detail that can be provided.  In its draft document, the committee notes that there is certain detail on tax measures that one would not want to announce in advance because it could lead to a behavioural response.  All of those things would have to be taken into account.  There is a happy medium where the committee is given a broad outline - but still more detail than was present in the summer statement - with adequate costings around that.  That would allow for a more constructive debate to take place post-SPU.</p></speech>

One does not need a model to forecast.  One can put one's finger in the air and come up with a number.  I think, as Professor Alan Barrett suggested earlier, if one has a number, one must be able to justify it.  One of the justifications for it is that one has some solid background to it.  When it comes to trying to make forecasts for the economy, one would look at past patterns and relations between different variables and see what one might get from that.  The model produces a number but one will have to sit down and question whether it makes sense.  There is some subjective basis to it but one is moving from a situation where one at least has a sound theoretical base from which one can question what is happening in the economy and one can then make a judgment call either up or down  One needs a starting base to begin with.  In recent years, modelling on the Irish economy has improved but it is still not, and never will be, perfect.  There should be a complementarity between modelling and forecasting.  A model should feed into it.  However, there is some subjective element to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Tutty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#U00600"><p>I will comment on Deputy Ryan's point on the SPU.  In case it was not quite clear, the only part of the SPU that we see in advance is the medium-term forecasts.  We do not see the rest.  We only see the medium-term forecasts a week or two before the actual publication.  We are not way ahead of the rest of the world in terms of knowing what is in the SPU.</p> <p>  In terms of having too much information, what we are saying in respect of the medium term is that we should have what is there at present, namely, the no-policy-change approach, a standstill position showing everything, including indexation, and what the Government intends to do in terms of the overall aggregates.  Those three simple pieces of information give one a lot of meat to get into.  I do not think what we are suggesting would swamp the committee at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#V00100"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Mr. Tutty's final comment was very helpful.  Yesterday, we had a reasonable example of what happens, the Department of Finance telephoned about an hour before the release of the document.  We were invited to the Department of Finance.  Those of us who read the newspapers or engage in social media had the privilege of reading a summary and commentary on it.  I do not know how constrained the officials are in the Department, I know they are present, but other than getting the actual document on which there was an embargo of one hour into our hands, I did not see any particular usefulness to the exercise.</p> <p>  As I understand it, but I may be incorrect, the budgetary oversight committee is to have a role in the scrutiny, and is to be in a position to do some analysis in a summary way, of the information flows on a timely basis.  It would be very useful if we had details of the Irish budget, similar to the way on a previous occasion the German Bundestag had details of the Irish budget, which shocked people in this country, but was entirely routine in Germany.  How do we arrive at a position where as the committee develops, we are provided with the documentation and information that we can then analyse on the basis that we have been discussing?  That would be very helpful.</p> <p>  I think it applies as much to capital expenditure as to current expenditure.  Having come out of a very difficult period and moving into recovery and an expansionary period, how do we get quality information on how the capital spend is going?  The Fiscal Council of Ireland does the medium-term forecast.  We need information flows as that is very important in how the economy grows.</p></speech>

Returning to my previous response to Deputy Eamon Ryan, the great advantage of this new process is that we are getting away from the big bang budget approach where we did not know anything until the Budget Statement was made.  I think the whole period should be looked at.  Getting documents in advance of publication is less important, particularly if there is a very short time advantage as Deputy Burton described in the case of the summer economic statement; what really matters is the content of the documents themselves given that one has a period of time to apply scrutiny.  There are two issues, timing and content.  I would think that ultimately it is the content that matters, even if one does not have a particular advantage in terms of early access to the documents.</p></speech>

For example, would it be useful to have a percentage analysis of changes which do not tend to be in the published documents but which the Department probably does automatically on their programmes?  The members of the committee should not have to sit down and re-analyse or have somebody in the budgetary office re-analyse what is probably in a programme in the Department anyway.</p></speech>

It may be the case, however, that certain underlying background data are not included in the final document, partly because the Departments want to make it accessible and do not want to swamp the public with data.  It may be very important, however, in terms of the committee's role in scrutiny that data are provided in an accessible manner.</p></speech>

Mr. Tutty laid out very well what one would ideally like to see in terms of a medium-term plan.  One of the things we have been pushing strongly for is that the forecasts be provided based on an estimate of the cost of what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council refers to as standing still while continuing to provide the existing level of public services and maintaining the purchasing power of benefits.  Beyond that, the more detail that can be provided in terms of the different aggregates the better.  From our point of view in terms of accessing forecasts, we do not need so much disaggregated detail to assess the forecasts.  However, in terms of the committee's particular role in assessing the plans and perhaps making alternative budget neutral suggestions for the plans, it seems the more detail the committee can get, including on the capital side, the better.</p></speech>

We have not been asked to do so again this year and perhaps there is an argument that it is not necessary every year.  However, given the amount of work we do on the fiscal rules and fiscal space, we could usefully provide a briefing at the dialogue to all participants, including members of the committee.</p></speech>

The council suggests the model for the parliamentary budget office, PBO, should be somewhere between the current proposal and a model in which it plays an extensive role.  Will Professor McHale elaborate a little on that suggestion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#W00900"><p>One can think of a spectrum of models for the parliamentary budget office.  It seems to us, and this was also evident in the OECD report, that what is being proposed is at the less ambitious end of the spectrum.  In particular, under the current proposal, the office would not have direct responsibility for or capacity to do its own costings, even though it would have an important role in the validation of costings coming from Government.  Clearly, it would have very important roles in terms of analysis and validation.  On the other hand, in the election campaign it seemed that some very ambitious models of the office were proposed.  Under these, the office would have almost unlimited demands placed on it in terms of costings from various bodies.</p> <p>  One thing that is clear from international comparisons of different types of independent fiscal institutions is that costing work is extremely resource intensive.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council can run on a relatively lean model because the nature of its mandate is such that the various assessments do not require many people to do them.  However, providing costings and analysis of specific policies and proposals is an extremely resource-intensive activity.  Much of this detailed specific analysis is done by the ESRI.  Professor Barrett discussed this earlier.  The ESRI is a substantially larger body than the proposed model for the PBO.  </p> <p>  We believe there is potentially a middle ground that would show more ambition than the current model.  It is important that the new body have real capacity to do costings, even if, for the most part, it outsources much of that costing responsibility to the Government, which does a significant amount of it already.  To be able to validate costings, it is necessary to have the capacity to do it oneself and also to do the cost-benefit analysis and micro-simulations of policies.  It is important also that the body have a degree of discretion.  The Congressional Budget Office in the United States is required to cost all legislation.  It also receives a large number of information requests to cost various proposals and has a degree of discretion in this regard.  Depending on its resources and recognising the level of resources required to perform this function well, it does not have to accept all requests.  It could be worth considering some sort of middle ground.</p></speech>

It is specific in terms of the overall budgetary forecasts, in other words, the macro-forecasts to which I referred earlier.

I do not know if I have ever pointed out to Professor McHale that when Deputies ask questions about corporate tax, the most recent figures supplied to us are from 2011.  This is extraordinary when one considers, for example, that &euro;2 billion in corporate tax suddenly appeared last October and nobody knows the reason this happened or whether it will happen again.  These are large numbers which could have a significant impact on the revenues available to the State.  When Deputies seek to get to the bottom of the issue and ask questions about whether this revenue will continue to be generated, the reason for it and how it fits into the pattern of corporate tax receipts over time, the information is either not available to us or we are provided with information from 2011.  Does something need to be done to ensure Deputies have access to up-to-date information?</p></speech>

However, one of the issues is that the relevant information is not available.  We receive the monthly Exchequer returns which means it is known within two days that money is being collected.  The issue then is how this came about and how quickly Revenue can compile the data.  Companies do not submit their final tax return until nine months after their year end.  They pay their tax in advance and make an estimate of how much tax is due before their year end.  They do not submit their final return to Revenue until nine months after year end.  This means that companies which had their year end at the end of December last year will not submit their tax return until September.  These returns then have to be processed and all the information must be put together, which can take another nine, 12 or 15 months.  There is, therefore, a lag of two and a half years, extending from the end of the year when the Exchequer shows the money being received to the point at which Revenue is able to publish details on how it was collected.</p><p>Revenue published a letter last year that gave broad indications of where the money was coming from.  The simple reason companies are paying more corporation tax is that they are making more profits.  While we might not have great detail on it Revenue provided a break down by sector, in rough terms, of where the money came from and the type and size of companies that were paying the money.  One can go through the tables and see the gross profits, deductions allowed and how much tax was taken.  The starting point was much higher.  One issue is timing.  The information takes time to come in and be collated.  While it would be great if it came out quicker, it is not possible.</p></speech>

When companies submit their preliminary tax, they tell the Revenue how much tax they think they owe and they pay 90% of it.  They do not provide great detail.  Companies must file a very detailed corporate tax return nine months after their year end.  We could not get any additional information much quicker, unfortunately.</p></speech>

It would be very helpful for us to understand the pattern over time, not just what we are proposing in any given year in terms of adjusting tax and expenditure, but to see how it fits into an overall pattern.  Is the information available in a digestible form and should it be included in such statements, which it is not?</p></speech>

The committee was established to examine arrangements for budgetary scrutiny.  Rather than having everybody getting in each other's way and having so many bodies examining different things, we must work out a structure in which there is a real input at particular times with the committee when it is established.  IFAC's role is to independently assess and publicly comment on whether the Government is meeting its stated budgetary targets.</p><p>I would like to hear from IFAC about where it fits into the structure.  If not today, could witnesses think about it and make a submission on where they see IFAC's role? We will have a parliamentary budget office and inputs from the ESRI, IFAC, the Department and so on.  I am afraid we will all be chasing each other.  At what point should people come into play?  Perhaps, the witnesses could, in due course, give it some thought.  When the committee is properly established and is doing its job and working with the parliamentary budget office, where does IFAC fit into it, regarding having a real input at a particular time?  IFAC is charged with a particular responsibility in its establishment.  Would it have its input at a particular time of the year, for example?</p></speech>

We see ourselves interacting with the committee, twice a year now, and potentially three or four times per year.  As Professor McHale outlined at the beginning, our role comes after certain events rather than before them.  We are more limited in what we can do for the committee before the stability programme update, SPU, comes out or immediately before the budget.  The one area where we could, perhaps, get more involved is our pre-budget statement, if it can be brought forward to an earlier time than mid-September, which is when it comes out and which is late in terms of the committee's deliberations on what should be in the budget.</p> <p>  We need inputs from the Department and the Government for our work.  We need to know what their projections and plans are and we can then assess them in terms of how they fit with the fiscal rules and what flexibility is there.  The Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform should supply the committee with the basic information for its deliberations.  We should also receive this input for our deliberations, and we can then help the committee to comment on or interpret them.</p> <p>  This is where the parliamentary budget office comes in.  In some of the proposals at the time of the election there was a suggestion that IFAC might become the parliamentary budget office.  We did not see it as being a suitable role for us and the Parliament has gone down a different road in terms of establishing a separate parliamentary budget office.  The committee should look to the parliamentary budget office to see how it can help the committee better.  The parliamentary budget office will be on site here, dedicated to looking after the interests of all the Deputies and Senators.  Our input will come at specific times.  We cannot play the role of holding the members' hands throughout the year and helping them with every step along the way.  The parliamentary budget office should be developed to play this role.</p></speech>

There have been many submissions about IFAC taking on the role of costings, which I was never 100% convinced of.</p><p>I think it could interfere with the independence of the office.  One is then dealing with political parties and elections which could take away from it.</p><p> Three options have been spelled out.  Will Professor McHale explain how he sees option 3, the hybrid option, working in terms of it not being a clearing house but being able to do independent costings of budget proposals?  When one speaks of independent costings of budget proposals, is that independent of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform or is it approved by the parliamentary budget office?  Is it the case that the office would have access to the information, as suggested, and data from all Departments, including the Revenue but they could decide that is under-providing and have autonomy in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#AA00200"><p>In terms of independence, the parliamentary budget office is a body that would not take instructions from Government.  It would not take instructions from Parliament either.  It would be an independent body and would have a very clear remit and set of responsibilities, for instance like the Congressional Budget Office in the United States which very much protects its independence.  That would be critical.  In the hybrid model the idea is that it would have the capacity necessary to do the kind of analysis that would be asked of it by the Oireachtas, that is analysis and policies, including cost benefit analysis but also the ability to do costings, including various costing tools, such as expertise in micro simulation.  The point I was making is that it requires resources, that cannot be done on a shoestring, if one is to do it properly.  At the same time, one cannot expect it to meet every demand that is placed on it for a costing, particularly when one is costing specific measure or doing a cost benefit analysis of specific measures.  Sometimes that can be extremely complicated as Professor Alan Barrett discussed earlier.  It is as the Deputy describe some sort of hybrid model that would retain the advantages of having a strong capable office, but not move so far in terms of the demands placed on it that it becomes unworkable.</p></speech>

Also one does not want to have too much duplication so that a lot of costing goes on within Departments and one would want to build on that.  In many cases it may be that one is validating the costings of Government.  I know the Deputy will be talking to the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility in the United Kingdom who does a lot of this work, but do not underestimate the level of expertise and the resources required to do this well.  I worry as I look at the model that it looks like it will be resourced at quite a low level even when it reaches steady state.  I suppose the message, as we look at the international experience, is to recognise how resource intensive costing and associated budgetary analysis is.</p></speech>

The Department will have a very strong view that there will be no second set of costings.  The Department of Finance costing are the costings.  The Department of Public Expenditure costings are the costings and the question is then what does one do, as Professor McHale mentioned - is it just a clearing house, where one filters these costs through or is there a validation?</p> <p>  One of the issues I have been trying to get to the bottom of is the cost of abolishing the USC.  This has been debated for the past two years.  We have costs provided to us by the Department of Finance on a number of occasions that it would cost &euro;3.7 billion because that is the amount it would cost to abolish the USC this year.</p><p>However, the Department of Finance tells us a phased abolition of the USC cannot by costed, even when we give it the figures by how much we want to reduce it year by year.  The Department can tell us how much it will bring in each year, up to &euro;5.4 billion by 2021, but it cannot tell us the cost of abolishing the USC on a phased basis.</p><p> Using that as an example, does Professor McHale believe that when the Department of Finance says it knows the USC will bring in X amount each year up to 2021 and knows if it abolishes it in 2017, it would cost X amount but phasing it out in the way described, the independent costing units would have the ability to come in and say that can be costed or assumptions can be made that can provide costings, because every costing is based on a certain assumptions?</p></speech>

This could be with a model where, for the most part, it is a validation exercise where the more detailed work is being done at departmental level but to play that validation exercise and where necessary go beyond it, one needs a certain level of capacity and that requires resources.</p></speech>

The Office for Budget Responsibility in London has come out and said in regard to the election campaign that there was a massive abuse of data by some of the campaigners.

We need to be careful in terms of the amount of data we have and the presentation of data.  I agree 100% with Professor McHale in regard to the standstill position that should be presented.  It gives a false reading by the Department when it does not include that data.</p> <p>  I was at the engagement with the Department of Finance of Finance yesterday and I put the following point to it, namely, the argy-bargy between IFAC and the Department of Finance in regard to the fiscal space, because it is deeply frustrating for me as finance spokesperson.  That is my language but Professor McHale will suggest there is no argy-bargy and that everybody agrees.  When I put it to the Department that we should include inflationary cost for non-pay items, it said that should not happen and that it is the responsibility of Government to manage budgets and, therefore, within a budget envelope, inflationary costs should be dealt with within that envelope.  The reality is that when one is dealing with a health budget where so much of the budget is for pay, there will be health inflation.  Will Professor McHale comment on that given the fact he said there should be three sets of data presented, the no-policy change, the assumptions based on the policy intentions of the Government and the standstill position.  Given the Department of Finance's view that it should not happen, what is his view on that?</p> <p>  In regard to Professor McHale's interview on " Morning Ireland" where the committee and the public learned what was in his report, I feel he was pulling his punches in that interview but we will have a chance at the finance committee to scrutinise that a bit more.</p><p> Regarding the data on the size of the fiscal space in the context of a stand still position, the position of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, continues to be that it is in the region of &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion and not the &euro;8 billion that the Government claims.  However, the data that underpin those assumptions have never been released, to my knowledge.  If we are to have an informative debate and discussion based on quality information, we must have the engagement that Professor McHale is suggesting with IFAC on a more regular basis during those set pieces and the data that underpin the assumptions of the council must be provided to us.  The IFAC is giving its projections for this year, to which I subscribe, but the Department of Finance is saying something completely different.  There are figures floating about but nobody is getting to the bottom of it at the end of the day.  One body is saying X because it is assuming Y, while another is saying A because it assuming B.  The data that underpin all of that must be made available.  The council's reports continually suggest that we are not providing adequately for demographic changes but to my knowledge, and Professor McHale can correct me if I am wrong, we have no data to show what provision we should be making for demographic issues.</p><p> I will leave it at that.  While I am being critical now, I believe that the IFAC has a huge role to play in terms of the rules and the budget.  Outside of the set pieces, members of the committee should, if possible, be able to draw on the expertise of the IFAC on an ongoing basis, albeit within certain limitations.  We received a briefing document from Department of Finance officials yesterday on the summer economic statement.  On examining it in detail, I noted that &euro;3 billion of the fiscal space was being allocated to the contingency fund every year which should, over three years, amount to a &euro;6 billion fund but Table 3 in the statement shows that there will only be &euro;3 billion in the fund.  How does that work?  These are questions we need to be able to ask the IFAC because the debate is going on but we do not have accurate information.  We had statements on it yesterday but we have no expertise to draw on in terms of how the figures are being presented, used or abused.</p></speech>

First, the council absolutely accepts that legislation related to something like increasing social protection benefits is drafted at the time of the budget.  However, one must distinguish between the point at which the policy decision is made and the process of forecasting.  One must, as part of the planning process, have good forecasts for what will happen over the next number of years.  If one has a set of forecasts based on the assumption that there will be no change in benefits at all or no wage increases post the Landsowne road agreement, then such forecasts will have very little value.  Therefore, the idea is that one develops certain conventions, recognising that these are not policy commitments but outlining what it would cost to keep benefits constant in purchasing power terms.  In other words, one outlines what it would cost to ensure that spending keeps up with demographics so that one maintains the same level of provision of public services.  One makes those sorts of assumptions, recognising that the Government may do something different like, for example, increase benefits by more or even less than the rate of inflation or freeze them if it is dealing with difficult fiscal circumstances.</p> <p>  It is necessary, as part of the planning process, to produce good forecasts and these can be called no-policy-change forecasts.  What we are saying is that informative no-policy-change forecasts would be developed on a stand still basis, outlining what it would cost to continue to do what is being done at present while completely distinguishing that from policy.  We do not accept the criticism that until they are passed in the budget, one cannot talk about them because they are for two different purposes.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Doherty that there was some confusion about our estimates of fiscal space in advance of the election campaign.</p></speech>

Essentially the point we were making, while largely accepting the net fiscal space number produced by the Government - we produced our own for internal purposes which was broadly in the same ball park - was the stand still one.  We were pointing out that a substantial chunk of the fiscal space would be required just to stand still.  We probably made a tactical error in doing the subtraction because then there was another number for the fiscal space floating out there.  It would have been better to say this is the net fiscal space figure, the Government did a good job in estimating it and this is the amount of it that would be required to stand still.  Then parliamentarians and others would have had better information in terms of understanding what the real scope was for truly new initiatives beyond what was being done already.  That would be important information from the point of view of scrutinising Government plans and coming up with alternative suggestions.  In a sense, the two points are linked.</p> <p>  In terms of providing information to the committee, we are completely non-political and have to tread carefully.  We try to respect our mandate but certainly at the level of the secretariat of the council, we are very open to talking to anyone about technical details, which is what I think Deputy Doherty is talking about.</p></speech>

The second half of page four and all of page five of IFAC's submission pretty much nails the analytical opportunity.  It is the bit that is missing.  Deputy Doherty, myself and many other members of the finance committee begged the last Government for that information.  We asked the Government to show us what the fiscal space was before policy changes with socio-demographics and inflation included and what it proposed to do.  We also asked it to tell us how what it proposed to do, on an item by item basis, would affect the available fiscal space.  We could not get any movement on it in five years.  The way the council has laid that out on pages four and five is spot on in terms of the information the Oireachtas and the standing committee will need to do their job.</p> <p>  My first question is simple and relates to the SPU.  There is a debate as to how much time the committee would get with the draft SPU before it is sent off to the European Commission.  The proposal from the Minister is five to ten working days, as I understand it.  </p></speech>

It was suggested that the committee would take the draft SPU at the same time as the council but two reasons were put forward by the Minister for not doing that.  The first was that the IFAC might change the SPU and, therefore, the committee would be given information that might change and the second was that things change and that the less time we have it, the more accurate the information contained therein.  I do not accept either of those arguments and would like to hear Professor McHale's view as to whether they are reasonable.  Would the council have any issue with the committee getting the SPU at the same time as the council, with the obvious caveat that it might make recommendations to change some elements of it?</p><p> The second question is on the budgetary office.  Professor McHale has laid out three possibilities in terms of costings - one is that the budgetary office does all of the costings; another is that it acts as a clearing house; and the other possibility is in between those two.  There is an interesting debate about who should do the costings.  From a cost perspective to the Oireachtas, staffing a parliamentary budget office to do independent costings of the Departments would be very significant.  There would be very serious duplication implications because they not only have to be able to cost taxation measures but other measures like transport, health care, social protection and broadband.  Professor McHale has laid out three possibilities.  The path of least resistance is that the Departments would continue to do the costings and the parliamentary budget office would provide quality assurance and some air traffic control.  For example, if Deputy Boyd Barrett and I were looking for largely similar costings, the budgetary office might be able to do one for us.  What is Professor McHale's view on this?  Is there any issue with the Departments doing the costings and having the parliamentary budgetary office acting in a co-ordination and quality assurance role?</p><p> My final question goes back to what has been raised a number of times on the amount of information.  The Commission's annual growth survey was published in December, followed by the SPU, which was then followed by the spring economic statement.  Somewhere in between all of that were the Estimates and Revised Estimates and after that the taxation papers.  After that there will probably be some pre-budget document and then there will be the budget.  The budget is laid across three separate places - taxation, social protection and expenditure.  It goes on and on and there are many different moving parts.  Is it possible to bring all of it together?  We do not have a comprehensive document with both macro and micro data in it.</p><p> On page 4 of his submission, Professor McHale laid out the amount of budgetary space available if we do nothing; what happens if we account for socio-demographics and inflation; and what the Government is proposing to do.  It then moves from a macro view to a micro view that gives the ten big ticket items, for example a change to the minimum wage and health care.  I have a concern that the committee will drown in well-intentioned information.  All the bits are in different places.  The Estimates, Revised Estimates, social protection and taxation are all in different places.  Is it possible to start consolidating this to a master document that would allow a committee get its collective head around the entire position?</p></speech>

Mr. Michael Tutty mentioned earlier that we do not get the SPU early.  We only get the macroeconomic forecasts because our function is limited at that point to endorsing or not endorsing those macroeconomic forecasts so that is all we see.  We get a spreadsheet and we get a detailed presentation from the Department of Finance which is the same presentation that members get.  It has been stated we are in a privileged position and see the SPU in advance but we see it at the same time as everybody else.  Deputy Donnelly should not get hung up on the timing of access to the SPU and getting it a bit earlier.  The Deputy mentioned page 4 of our submission and the focus should be on the content of the SPU rather than on getting that content early.  Members of the committee will then have a period of time before the budget is passed to really scrutinise and potentially influence what will happen in the budget.</p><p>There still seems to be an awful lot of time involved.  In those weeks before the SPU, a plan is being set out but the decisions are not really being made at that point.  The emphasis should be on the content rather than the timing.  There is a process and a budgetary cycle which cannot all happen at the same time.  The Deputy is almost trying to get away from that with the big-bang-budget approach of detailed plans and forecasts early in the year to avoid information overload so members can absorb the information they need.  The Deputy makes a very good point about that but to have time to really influence the budget requires a staged process.  Trying to come up with one master document would seem to be difficult in that regard.  </p><p> The Deputy is right that the details of the division of labour between the budget office and the various Departments would have to be worked out.  The model would probably involve a lot of the work still being done by the Departments and the worry is that the model is very under-resourced.  It should be a strong, independent body with a very strong reputation.  There are international models and the Office for Budget Responsibility, OBR, in the UK is a very good example, about which the committee will be hearing soon.  It requires strong leadership, potentially international leadership, and it has to be well-resourced, with access to expertise including secondments.  It also requires very strong access to information.  Attention must be paid to the foundation of the office because the way it is established will have a huge effect on what kind of office it will be.  I worry that there is too little ambition being shown at the moment to put it in place on a very solid foundation.</p></speech>

The PBO needs to be able to assess whether measures look reasonable or not and be able to go back if it does not think they are.  It has to be able to go beyond just the static costings of a measure to see what further effects it has beyond the first round effects so it can simulate its effect on the economy as opposed to just the basic tax effect.  We have to look at what more the budget office can do apart from the static costings that come from the Departments.  The committee should look at whether it needs to do a cost-benefit analysis of things that goes well beyond what the Departments give.  It seems from the proposals that the budget office would merely be passing on things they get from Departments rather than playing a real role in helping Deputies to understand what is going on or what more they can do.</p></speech>

It is a great pleasure to be here.  Perhaps the easiest thing to do would be to say a bit about the functions of the Office for Budget Responsibility, OBR, and how the costing role, in particular, fits in.  The OBR was established in 2010.  Our tasks are fourfold.  Twice a year, we produce five-year-ahead forecasts for the economy and the public finances.  In contrast to many other countries, the British Government no longer produces projections of its own.  In some cases, independent fiscal bodies comment on the Government's numbers.  In some instances, they produce parallel sets of numbers which can be compared.  In the UK, the OBR produces the official numbers and it is then for Ministers to respond to those in setting out and explaining their policy decisions.  We use those five-year-ahead forecasts to assess the British Government's progress against the domestic fiscal rules it has set.  It is not our job to say whether those rules are sensible or whether the Government should aim to hit them at any given moment, it is our job to say whether the Government has a better than 50% chance of hitting them as they stand.  </p> <p>  The third element, which leads directly to the issue of costings, is that we scrutinise the costing of individual measures included in budgets.  We have a thing called the autumn statement, which is supposed to be different but, to all intents and purposes, is just a second bite at the same cherry and a mini-budget.  The Treasury submits a list of policy measures that it is considering at the time of each of these statements.  It submits costings to us so if it is a tax measure, it will be analysis done by the revenue and customs department and if it is a social security measure, it will be done by the Department for Work and Pensions.  We look at that and have an iterative discussion.  All of this takes place confidentially before the budget is announced.  At the end of the day, we have to say publicly whether we agree or disagree with it or that the Government did not give us enough time or information to reach a considered judgment.  It is important to remember that because we are producing the forecast and the forecast necessarily has to include the impact of any measures that have been announced, if we did not agree with the Treasury's estimate of what a particular thing is going to cost or raise, we would have to put our own number in to have a comprehensive forecast that stands in its own right.</p><p>Although formally speaking the process of scrutinising the costings is somewhat separate from the forecast, in fact we are producing a forecast.  The Government is announcing policy measures and we must incorporate those in the package we produce.  </p><p> The second round effects came up in earlier discussions and are the knock-on effects of measures on the economy and on the fiscal forecast.  We tend to look at the second round effects of the package of measures as a whole.  An average budget or autumn statement might have 50 to 80 measures and we would take an overall view, taking into account the fact that some are giving with one hand and some are taking with the other.  There will be some measures that put inflation up and some that push it down.  There might be some measures that affect the cost of capital in one direction or another.  We do not provide a second round effect estimate for each and every measure.  We look at that in the aggregate as part of the process.  </p><p> The fourth and final thing we do is to produce long-term fiscal projections over a 50-year rather than a five-year rise, which many fiscal councils do.  This brings in demographics and issues of that kind such as the evolution of a student loan system.  We look at the measures of the public sector's balance sheet which allows one to bring in more elements of risk as well as the central forecast.  </p><p> In the role we have been given, we are confined by legislation to analysing only the current policy of the current Government so we do not look at alternative policy measures that are put forward by Members of Parliament or by political parties.  Since the OBR was created, there has been a long-running debate about whether we should take on the sort of role that the Dutch fiscal council has, which involves carrying out an explicit analysis of election manifestos and what their net effect on the public finances and the economy would be.  That would be very largely a costing exercise and the decision so far has been that we should not play that role, although, for example, the chairman of the Treasury committee in the House of Commons still thinks that we should and is trying to push water up that particular hill.  I think the letter that I sent to the chairman of the Treasury committee when this issue was raised has already been circulated to members of the committee.  The letter dealt with some of the pros and cons and the practical issues that would be raised by that, some of which came up implicitly in the discussion the committee has just had with Professor John McHale and colleagues, for example, where ownership of these things lies or whether one is reliant on the expertise in Departments.  We are a relatively small office of a maximum of only 30 people over the next few years.  </p><p> In terms of the costings and some of the discussion about what we should look at, we do not look at the costing of individual measures, for example, a new aircraft carrier programme or whether we should build an exciting new railway line connecting the north and south of the UK.  As a reflection of the fact that the Treasury keeps very tight control of the aggregate amount of expenditure on what one might think of as public services and capital investment, when we are doing our forecasts we reach a judgment on whether those aggregate totals are going to be overshot or undershot and by how much.  This allows one to bring in some departmental intelligence, for example, it is a bad winter and the health service is having problems or the country is fighting a war and there is additional expenditure of that sort, but we do not do a bottom-up forecast regarding what we think everything the defence or transport Departments have said they are going to do will cost.  There are elements of the costing function that some fiscal councils and parliamentary budget offices do which we do not even touch in our more limited scope.  I will leave it there and I am happy to expand on any of it.</p></speech>

The Government sets out plans for departmental capital so that would be mostly departmental capital spending with some resource current spending.</p><p> Implicitly, it has set out plans through to 2019-2020, and indicative plans for a bit further ahead for the Department of Transport.  If this thing has to be built it will take a chunk out of the Department of Transport's budget and some of the rest of the budget might not be so finely detailed, leaving members with the task of drawing conclusions as to what is left to spend on other things.  We would not want to focus on that because, historically, the Treasury sets limits for public expenditure in those sorts of areas, sometimes moving them if it thinks it has more or less money to play with, but it tends not to break them by mistake.  We take what it says about the aggregate capital budget, which would include something like HS2, and reach a judgment whether, given the near-term information, it is likely to overshoot or undershoot this year and in other years years for which it has plans.  We would not, however, say that we think HS2 will overrun by 50%.  If we did reach that view - and this is possible given that we are fundamentally concerned about the state of the public finances - the question would be whether to borrow more or spend less on something and that, ultimately, is a political decision, not an economic one.</p></speech>

We would take the overall public services expenditure envelopes over five years and assume that, if there were to be inflation shocks over that period, the Government would have to deal with them or change policy.  If inflation turns out to move other than we anticipated the most obvious area it would show up would be in our estimates of debt interest costs because those that are linked to the retail prices index can be a source of near-term forecast volatility as a result of those sorts of changes.  In our long-term projections we take explicit account of things such as demographics.  Our working definition of an unchanged policy over the longer term, where the Government has not stated what that policy is, would assume that expenditure on most areas of public service is constant as a share of GDP but adjusted for the representative age of the population.  If the population is getting older we assume we will have to spend more as a share of GDP on those things that elderly people are more likely to consume such as health care and long-term care.</p></speech>

Does he meet them regularly?  Do they have a legal entitlement to a flow of documentation from him?  Can they ring somebody in his office if they do not understand something, such as a line about health etc?</p></speech>

In our case the Treasury is powerful relative to the rest of the executive in setting budget policy.</p><p>In a sense, we have been set up primarily to take politically-motivated wishful thinking out of the analysis the Treasury uses to publish its plans, rather than to help parliamentarians consider alternative policy options.  Our relationship with members is very much focused through the Treasury Committee, the committee of the Lower House which is responsible for looking at the work of the Treasury, the Bank of England, ourselves and other economic agencies.  They take oral evidence from us after each budget and autumn statement.  When the Chancellor of the Exchequer stands up and announces his budget statement, we have already spoken to them about it and, as soon as he sits down, we publish a report on what our forecast for the economy and public finances would have been had the Chancellor done nothing and, then, on the impact of all the measures he has just announced.  We give a pre-measures and post-measures forecast, which are published literally as he sits down.  Two hours later, I hold a press conference explaining the forecasts and taking questions from anybody who has them.  As that happens, the House of Commons goes straight into a debate on the budget without waiting to read anything we or anybody else has said, something which has always slightly puzzled me.  Nevertheless, it is a tradition that members get straight into the fight as soon as the Chancellor has sat down.  There could be scope for a more informed relationship with a wider range of parliamentarians who are interested.</p><p> The relationship at the moment is primarily mediated by the Treasury Committee, which takes evidence from us after each Budget Statement and autumn statement, typically some four or five days afterwards.  They start off taking evidence from our equivalent of the ESRI and private sector economists. Then they hear from us and, within a relatively short period, from the Chancellor and Treasury officials.  We get very few direct inquiries from members outside that committee but we stand ready to be helpful where we can.  There is a lot of interest from Opposition spokespeople on welfare or the economy and we are happy to deal with them.  We are required to lay our core publications before Parliament, which is a formal process of literally handing over hard copies to Parliament within a particular timetable so we are limited to publishing some of the big publications when Parliament is sitting.</p><p> The Treasury Committee has a veto over the appointment of myself and my two deputies.  The finance Minister recommends somebody to do my job but the Treasury Committee has to approve it and the finance minister cannot sack me without the approval of the Treasury Committee.  This feature is common elsewhere but it is rare in the UK for a committee to have such a formal role, rather than simply the ability to question people who have been newly appointed to jobs and to discuss their merits etc.</p><p> The House of Lords, like the Seanad here, has a more limited constitutional role in financial issues and it is much more rare for me to be asked to speak to the Economic Affairs Committee of the House of Lords.  The fact that the interest of parliamentarians is not more widespread may be due to a need to communicate better but it is also a result of the fact that, normally, the executive gets the budget it wants.  Parliament occasionally amends it but often not very substantively.</p></speech>

As I understand the role of his office, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in developing his or her budget, has some taxation items and some expenditure items.  The Chancellor relies on the OBR to give aggregate impacts of a package of measures.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Chote" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#KK00300"><p>Yes.</p><p>It is an iterative process.  For example, six to ten weeks ahead of a budget we would start working on a baseline forecast of what would happen to the economy and the public finances if there were no change in policy.  Simultaneously, the Government will provide us with what is known as a draft scorecard, which is a list of measures that it is thinking of announcing, most of which would be specific tax and welfare transfer measures, plus decisions on the overall size of the spending envelope for public services.  As I said, it would not come to us on issues such as the purchase and cost of aircraft carriers.  </p><p> As the budget gets closer we go through successive iterations in finalising our pre-measures forecast.  We also go through a process of examination of the list of measures provided by the Treasury.  Typically, a lot of the measures provided eight weeks out will have dropped off the list as we get closer to the budget - in part, perhaps, because during the course of our discussions on a measure and the likely cost the Treasury may take the view that it is not something it would be happy with.  The Treasury has never yet publicly pressed ahead with publishing a costing estimate that it knows we did not support.  It is more likely that it would drop a measure rather than do that.  Some measures will come on relatively late in the process, such that there is a nail-biting period in terms of the loss or gain of particular measures from or to the list.  We set clear deadlines by which the Treasury needs to inform us of a measure that is substantive enough to affect the economic forecast and another deadline in respect of other new measures.  We also allow a little wriggle room in relation to measures it has already told us about.  For example, it may want to change a tax rate from, say, 11% to 12% or something like that, which involves no great analytical content.  </p><p> The final process is a pre-measures forecast.  We can then say what the post-measures forecasts would look like once all of this has been taken into account.  At the end of the day, the Treasury can choose what forecast it wants us to publish for the public finances, or it can choose the policies, but it cannot choose both simultaneously unless we think the two are consistent.  There is a choice to be made.  We do not get up on budget day and surprise the Treasury.  We will have had this discussion beforehand and will have set out our view of what particular measures will cost or raise.  We then reach an aggregate view on whether a package is a net giveaway and is therefore likely to result in a boost to the economy and to activity in the short term, or whether it is something that is likely to push measured inflation higher or lower.  As I said, this is done at an aggregate level rather than measure by measure.</p></speech>

There is one DEL for capital spending and another for current spending.  It will tell us its aggregate capital and resource DELs, which are then used in the forecast.  The only adjustment we make is an aggregate over- or underspend against that DEL, which we would base on recent history, intelligence from the Treasury, intelligence from Departments and knowledge.  For example, we might know that there has been unexpected military action and that therefore some of the contingency reserve has been already spent, and that information would be taken into account.  What we do not do is produce a bottom-up forecast that shows that total spending equals aircraft carriers plus high-speed train plus nurses plus so on and so on.  It could be done that way, but that is a reflection of the fact that the Treasury carries a big stick.  There are strong incentives for the Treasury and Departments in aggregate not to overspend, and they do not.</p></speech>

The Office of Budgetary Responsibility, OBR, was established at a time when the Government was starting a substantial fiscal consolidation programme, although not quite as substantial as the Irish programme.  It was clear that the fiscal consolidation programme was premised on spending plans which would not maintain the quality and quantity of public services but it was Government policy to achieve that level of spending.  We could in principle have said that we did not believe that was politically and economically feasible for Government to deliver that share of GDP to be spent on public services spending but we did not do that.  Frankly, had we chosen to do so, it would have been hard to come up with a firm analytical basis for it.  What we would have been saying is that the Government has made a decision to pencil in a set of overall spending plans that most people are likely to conclude would not imply maintaining a given quantity and quality of public services but we are in a fiscal consolidation and that is what the Government has chosen to do.  Historically there is no reason to believe that if that is what Government says it is going to do, and it tries to do it, it will not achieve it.  It is not for us to look at value for money or the outputs obtained from the inputs.</p></speech>

The OBR provides the service for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  What mechanism is available to Opposition MPs or Opposition parties to have their budget or policy proposals costed and assessed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-22a.366" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Chote" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAB2016062200002#MM00300"><p>In some cases, they could ask parliamentary questions.  For example, if they proposed to introduce a measure which proposed to raise income tax rate X to Y they could table a parliamentary question or an inquiry to the House of Commons Library.  One often finds that some of the costing elements of manifesto packages are basically what MPs or parties have been told in response to parliamentary questions.  Another route is the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which organisation I ran prior to taking up my role at the OBR.  Obviously, the institute does not have all of the data and information that would be available within Government but in some cases it can come up with reasonably good estimates and in others it has to throw up its hands and admit it does not have the evidence to respond.  There is no formal process for the sign-off of Opposition policy platforms.  The Dutch are the most dramatic in this regard in terms of their having had 2,500 policy proposals from nine parties costed in the run up to its last election.  It took 80 people three months, full-time, to do that work.  It is an enormous exercise.  For the Australians, which costed fewer proposals, it was a slightly lesser exercise.</p> <p>  I echo the point made earlier by Professor McHale that the idea of throwing inadequate resources to the job people are being asked to do is a recipe for destroying the credibility of the organisation almost before it is started.  Alignment of the budget and the job is crucially important.</p></speech>

It is important to tailor the structure to the particular parliamentary systems and domestic institutions.  A very clear lesson is that any new organisation or restructured organisation must have a well defined remit rather than one that can be called into question or becomes a political issue if it chooses to do something or not.  It is important it is set a clear task and that it is resourced adequately to do that task.</p><p>If one says that a body is to do X, Y and Z but only funds it to do X, it wrecks the credibility of the body.  One of the key things we have tried to emphasise is the need to recognise and be upfront about the uncertainty in respect of forecasting and costings.  We have an explicit process in regard to every costing on which we sign off and in incorporating it into our forecasts we give it an uncertainty ranking, an idea I stole from the Australians.  This is based on the quality of the underpinning data and on how complicated the modelling and the process of calculating the answer are.  We ask if it is a measure that will result in big and unpredictable changes in people's behaviour.  Only a madman sets fiscal policy on the basis that a set of medium-term fiscal forecasts and the costings they involve will be correct in every respect.  One of the biggest services these bodies can provide is to ensure that it is front and centre from the point of view of the public and that the people making the decisions recognise that as much as anybody else.</p></speech>
