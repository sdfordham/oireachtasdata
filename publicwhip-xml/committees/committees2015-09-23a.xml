Will those present check their mobile phones and ensure they are switched off?  It is no good switching them to silent mode because they can still can interfere with the broadcasting equipment and we do not want that to happen.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome back Ms Barbara Nolan, Head of Representation of the European Commission in Ireland.  She has been before the committee on many occasions so she knows the drill.  Today, we will be discussing the refugee crisis in the EU.  We have all watched it unfold over the summer months and members will recall that we had a special meeting in April, attended by Mr. Peter Sutherland, UN Special Representative on Migration, to discuss this issue.  On that day, we were also joined by the Italian ambassador who will also address us later today.  That gave us a useful insight into the situation in April but, of course, things have moved on significantly since then.  Members will also recall that following our April meeting, we attended a meeting of COSAC in Riga in June and pushed a number of recommendations that arose from our meeting with the ambassador and Mr. Sutherland.  I am glad to say that some of those recommendations were accepted.  Today, we look forward to discussing the EU's response to the crisis to date and its future plans.  We are, therefore, looking forward to hearing about both from Ms Nolan.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I draw the attention of the witness to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.</p><p>If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and the witness continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against an entity or an individual either by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.</p><p> I call Ms Barbara Nolan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Barbara Nolan" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me today to address it on the Commission's response to the migration and refugee crisis.  The committee will appreciate that this situation is evolving minute by minute and I will try to give it a flavour of where we are at currently, but we have a European Council meeting this evening of the Heads of State and Government and the situation may evolve even further.  In fact, we hope it will evolve further following that meeting.<br/><br/>The sheer volume of people involved in this crisis is staggering.  So far this year, the UNHCR estimates that almost half a million refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe by sea and that approximately 3,000 people have died <i>en route</i>.  An average of 6,000 people are arriving every day and daily reminders of the appalling human tragedy on our doorstep are to be seen and heard on our televisions, radios and computers.  It is a pretty appalling situation.<br/><br/>This crisis is at the top of the EU's agenda.  It was the main message of President Juncker's state of the union address earlier this month, where he underscored the need for a collective effort to find solutions to this crisis.  Before going further, I wish to underline that a common European policy on asylum is not a new invention.  There have been many accusations made over the past month that the EU has been doing nothing on this issue and that we are only waking up to the situation.  This is not true.  The EU has been working since 1999 to create such a common policy and to improve the legislative framework to deal with inward migration.  The committee will appreciate that this is a very sensitive issue and touches the core of member states' sensitivities and responsibilities.  It is not easy to make advances, or at least to make advances quickly, in this area.  I wish to put that on the record because we have for many years been working to try to forge a common policy. <br/><br/>In January of this year, I spoke to the committee about the European Commission's ten priorities, one of which was the completion of a European agenda on migration.  This was put up there as one of President Juncker's ten priorities.  I also recall that this new Commission is the first to have a dedicated Commissioner, Commissioner Avramopoulos, who deals with migration issues.  That is also a first and shows that we were already, more than a year ago, thinking this issue was going to be a very important issue in the future.  At that time, of course, the focus was on developing a new approach to legal migration to make the EU an attractive destination for talent and skills.  It was also about improving the management of migration into the EU through greater co-operation with third countries, solidarity among our member states, and, of course, fighting human trafficking.<br/><br/>Following on this and building on the work already done in the area in recent years, the Commission has proposed two migration packages already this year.  The first was announced in May and the second was announced earlier this month, which was at the same time President Juncker made his state of the union speech.  The announcement of the agenda for migration in May took place against the backdrop of the tragedy of large numbers of people drowning in the Mediterranean.  I think it is fair to say that nobody foresaw the scale of what was to come.  Calls for action have grown louder and they are directed at the EU member states and the EU institutions.<br/><br/>The migration agenda that was announced in May sought to identify what could be done in the immediate term to address the tragedy unfolding in the Mediterranean.</p><p>First, it tripled the budget for operations such as Triton, for example, in which the Irish Naval Service continues to play its part, with the <i>LE Eithne </i>and <i>LE Niamh</i>rescuing around 6,000 people to date.  It put in place an emergency response system to deal with the temporary distribution of people who had arrived at the southern borders of the European Union and were in need of relocation.  At the time in May, the Commission proposed the relocation of 40,000 refugees from Greece and Italy, two of the countries on the front line of the crisis.  Ireland responded by committing to relocate 600 of these refugees.  This proposal was finally approved last week by member states and is set to be implemented in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>The announcement in May also included a commitment to set up &quot;hot spots&quot; in so-called front line member states, where EU agencies, including the border management agency, FRONTEX, would work together to channel those claiming asylum into the asylum procedure as soon as possible and also help to co-ordinate the return of those deemed not to be in need of asylum.<br/><br/>Conscious of the need to improve safe and legal routes into the European Union in the immediate term, the Commission proposed a system to resettle, to meet the UNHCR target, 20,000 refugees in need of international protection.  &quot;Relocation&quot; means moving people already in the European Union to another place.  &quot;Resettle&quot; means moving people outside the European Union, for example, those in refugee camps in Lebanon, to a safer location in an EU member state.  I just wanted to explain the difference between &quot;relocation&quot; and &quot;resettlement&quot; because the terms are used interchangeably.  Ireland responded by committing to resettle 520 of these refugees.  The proposal also pointed to the need for a permanent mechanism to resettle refugees.  It should not be a one-off; we need a permanent mechanism.  <br/><br/>The agenda also proposed an action plan to tackle people-smuggling.  We want to tackle some of the problems we are encountering at source before they manifest on our shores.  In July the Commission at the European Council meeting sought to secure agreement on these elements.  However, it also sought to secure a commitment from member states to improve the European Union's migration policy in the medium and long term.<br/><br/>Work on many of the proposals tabled in May is under way.  Many member states have stepped up to the plate, including Ireland, and made commitments to relocate refugees.  What are the most recent developments?  I have mentioned that on 9 September, as part of his State of the Union speech to the European Parliament, President Juncker announced a second migration package.  Obviously, it was needed following a summer during which many more lives had been lost and the crisis on the European Union's borders had intensified.  In this second package the Commission proposed seven key actions which could be taken by EU institutions and member states to address the crisis.<br/><br/>The first key action is that a new relocation mechanism be put in place, this time to relocate an additional 120,000 refugees.  On top of the 40,000 on which we have agreement, this brings the total number to be relocated by the European Union to 160,000.<br/><br/>The second key action is that a permanent relocation mechanism be established.  This would require an amendment of the so-called Dublin rules, that is, the Dublin Convention.<br/><br/>The third key action is that a common list of &quot;countries of safe origin&quot; be agreed by member states which should be binding.  We are confronted by people claiming asylum, some of whom are from candidate countries for EU membership.  On our list some of these countries would be considered to be safe.  We have proposed a list of countries which obviously has to be agreed of countries which we think are of safe origin.</p><p>People who are claiming refugee status should be returned to those countries because they are not fleeing situations of terror, etc., as is the case for many Syrians.  </p><p> The fourth key action is that a common handbook on returns should also be available to member states, including guidelines on procedures to be followed, and an EU action plan on returns should be approved.  The fifth key action is the removal of as many obstacles as possible to facilitate the necessary and urgent public procurement, that is tenders, connected with the refugee crises.  For example, complex public procurement rules have to be followed for housing refugees so we want to make the system lighter so that the response can be faster.  That proposal has also been tabled.  We also want to make the rules on supplies of services for refugees lighter so that we can respond quickly to these specific problems.  We also tabled a proposal from the EU's external action service to address the root causes of the crisis.  Last but not least, we also proposed the establishment of a European trust fund for Africa, with &euro;1.8 billion in spending, to try to address some of the reasons people leave their home countries in the first place. </p><p> Where are we now?  The Commission has been working hard with the member states in the Council in an effort to achieve a united approach.  Last week, when justice and home affairs Ministers met in Brussels, they discussed the proposals I have outlined above at length.  I assure the committee that this system is moving very rapidly.  Normally EU proposals have to wind their way through the system and it can take many months before they are on the table.  The last seven proposals in the package proposed by President Juncker at the beginning of September have already been tabled, in the justice council that met last week.  We are working in real time and at a very fast pace, in so far as we can move, if one likes, a very big machine quickly.  </p><p> On the positive side, coming out of the meeting of justice Ministers, final agreement on the May package was reached.  This concerned the relocation of the 40,000 people.  Much work was also done by member states to identify Common Positions on other elements of the proposals.  However, agreement was not found on the relocation of the additional 120,000 people.  However, last night, - and I am now coming to the latest of the latest developments - the justice Ministers met again in an extraordinary meeting.  There was only one point on the agenda, which was to find agreement on the relocation of the 120,000 refugees as proposed by the Commission.</p><p> Securing unanimous agreement on these measures at Council level was always going to be an enormous challenge.  The preferred option was always to have a decision by consensus, but given the emergency situation and the need to move forward, the EU Presidency, which is currently held by Luxembourg, sought a decision by qualified majority voting.  The majority voted in favour of the proposal to agree to this relocation of 120,000 people.  In our view, the decision taken last night is an essential building block to moving forward.  We are now in a position to relocate 160,000 people.  This decision on its own is not going to solve the refugee crisis and this relocation is not a silver bullet, but it is part of the comprehensive set of actions I have outlined.  We must now work on the next steps to improve our common European asylum policy and to address the root causes of this crisis through foreign and development policy. </p><p> The Commission hopes that this evening's summit meeting of Heads of State and Government will move the process further and bring the EU member states together.  We have a tough road ahead to ensure we fulfil our obligations.  On the one hand, we have responsibility and a moral duty to ensure that those fleeing war and persecution are treated with dignity and, on the other hand, we should show solidarity with those member states which find themselves at the front line of this crisis.</p><p>We should not forget that in spite of the many differences between member states, the EU is by far the wealthiest and most stable Continent in the world and that we have the means to help.</p><p> It is very heartening that the Government is among those member states going into these Council meetings with a clear commitment to play its part.  President Juncker has reminded us that winter is approaching and we need to be prepared.  We count on all actors, all those who can play their part in helping to alleviate this crisis, whether they are EU institutions, member states or NGOs, to work together.  It is only by doing so that we can hope to resolve this grave crisis.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Before I invite members to question Ms Nolan I advise them that we need to limit contributions to two minutes.  I hope I will lead by example.  I will begin with my questions.</p> <p>  I note what Ms Nolan said about the EU being by far the most stable and wealthiest Continent in the world.  I do not think this is a European crisis alone and we need to see more engagement and involvement from countries and regions such as the US, Australasia and others.  What is the Commission doing to try to encourage those countries to get involved?  I cite the case of the Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s when it was seen as a world issue, not just an Asian issue.  What is being done to ensure that other wealthy and stable countries such as the US, Australia and others are doing their bit to help solve this humanitarian crisis?</p> <p>  Could Ms Nolan indicate what the Commission is doing to address the root causes of the issue in Syria in particular?  What pressure is being exerted?  I read in the newspaper at the weekend that if Aleppo falls to the Assad forces, some 1 million additional refugees will be created but that if it falls to the ISIS forces an additional 1 million refugees would also be created, some of whom would no doubt make their way to our shores.  What is being done to tackle the root causes of migration?</p> <p>  I am pleased to hear about President Juncker&rsquo;s proposal to establish a trust fund of &euro;1.8 billion.  Could Ms Nolan indicate where the money will come from?  Will it be additional money raised across the European capitals or will it come from the existing European Union budget?  I will leave it there.  The next contributor is Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne and then we will have Deputy Derek Keating.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#G00300"><p>I welcome Ms Nolan to the committee.  I concur with the comments on the seriousness of the situation.  It is one of the greatest movements of people that I have witnessed in my lifetime.  We are not on the front line.  We are part of the European community but other countries are very much on the front line.  I agree that we have a moral obligation as a member of the European Union to play our part in the crisis.</p> <p>  Ms Nolan stated that for the past year the Commission considered there would be a refugee crisis in 2015 or at least there would be a flow of refugees.  What is her best information on the medium-term to long-term future of the refugee crisis?  Does she anticipate that this time next year, whoever is on this committee will still be discussing the flow of migration?  Is there any information in that regard?</p> <p>  I concur with what the Chairman said about Syria.  The information is that up to half the population of Syria has been displaced either internally or to refugee centres in neighbouring countries and the European Union.  The issue must be tackled but that is beyond the remit of the committee.  In most situations one has good guys and bad guys but it is difficult to distinguish between the two.  It is a question of who is worse in terms of the Assad regime or ISIS.  It is a very difficult situation for Syria.  What are the prospects of an end to the displacement of people from there and for the situation in the area to settle down?</p> <p>  We are not a party to the Schengen Agreement but the pressure on it is mounting as the situation continues to develop.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1012" speakername="Derek Keating" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#G00400"><p>I will make an effort to respect your wishes, Chairman, given that we have a very heavy agenda.</p><p>I welcome Ms Nolan and I thank her for attending with her colleague, Ms Eimear N&iacute; Bhroin. The committee has just received a copy of the submission made by Ms Nolan.  It contains some interesting and up-to-date information which allows me to bypass some of the questions as they are already answered in the submission.</p><p> I am glad that this is top of the agenda.  I appreciate it is not a simple issue.  It is a complex issue which requires a phenomenal amount of work.  Some of the images are distressing and upsetting and not only where an effort was made.  I appreciate that there are some countries on the front line and under pressure, and that we are that bit further removed and I respect that.  However, one also sees countries not only endeavouring to keep people out but endeavouring to hurt them, to cut them with blades and sharp shards.   I believe the Commission has a role to play in giving the message that this is not acceptable.  We all saw the image of a young boy lying dead on a beach, silent through death but still speaking to the world.  We must continue to hold that in our hearts and to keep the image of the dead young boy alive.  The Chairman spoke in terms of it requiring not just a European response.  I would like to know what the Commission is doing in terms of reaching out to the world as the situation requires a global response.  These are words echoed by Peter Sutherland recently in one of his helpful interventions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#H00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for arranging the meeting today as this is the issue of the day and will be for some time.  I welcome Ms Barbara Nolan and Ms Eimear N&iacute; Bhroin and I thank them for the excellent submission.  We are all aware of the issues which arise from the turmoil in Syria, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East.  This turmoil is the result of the decisions of the American and British Governments and others to displace the then President of Iraq and to remove the Libyan leader Gadaffi and others.  These seemed like good ideas at the time but there was no long-term strategy.  I commend the work of the Turkish, Lebanese and Jordanian Governments.  At a huge cost to their own people, they have done enormous work in providing refuge for those fleeing from Syria and elsewhere.</p> <p>  Kuwait was rescued by the Americans and the Allies &ndash; my own nephew was with the American forces and the Patriot missiles.  Young soldiers went out there to free Kuwait when the Kuwaiti Government fled to Paris.  The princes there were restored to Kuwait without any elections.  It is difficult to understand how, after the enormous sacrifices made, they have refused to accept any of the refugees whatsoever.  Saudi Arabia has generously offered to build 200 mosques in Germany while refusing to accept any refugees. The United Nations, the respective Ministers and the governments will have to take action in this regard.</p> <p>  It would be preferable in many cases to retain good quality camps in the areas - supported by the United Nations - until this matter is resolved.  If there is an influx of Shi&rsquo;ites and Sunnis into Europe let us be in no doubt that they will be in conflict in time.  This is a deeply serious situation which we did not create but with which we are, rightly, willing to help.  Irish people have always helped in this regard.  We were those people on ships, we were the 6,0000 who died in the 1840s.  We are understandably aware but we should not blind ourselves to what is happening in the world.  I commend the German Government which has, by its actions, increased the pressure on the rest of Europe.  Germany is being flooded with refugees at present.  It is a very serious situation.  We need greater involvement by the United Nations which has been relatively silent so far during this crises.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#J00200"><p>I apologise for being so late.  We were in session next door at the Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs and Trade dealing with somewhat the same issue.</p><p>This international problem is creating terrible riots within the European family.  I am thinking in particular of the position of Hungary and Slovenia as two examples of unsympathetic and unco-operative European countries.  Having said that, however, it is important to point out - this would be my personal belief - that this is not just a European problem, it is a worldwide problem.  It is not going to be solved exclusively by the EU because the areas of conflict are outside the EU.  In a sense, we are victims of other crises where there is an overspill from refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.  They are overflowing and thus travelling from Turkey into Greece.</p><p>What is the position of the European Commission <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the world response to this international issue?  We have the UN, including the UNHCR dealing with refugees.  I was asked by my local imam, when I was in his mosque after Friday prayers a few weeks ago, to explain why I thought all these Muslims are coming to Europe.  I could not think quickly enough as to what the answer was.  We are a liberal democracy and hopefully they see us as being free, open, accommodating and friendly.  However, what is the role of the rest of the world in working through the UN to resolve areas of conflict?  There is an important role for Iran, Russia and the UN.  Saudi Arabia could have a role to play too.  This is a worldwide conflict and we are trying to address it as Europeans.  Can Ms Nolan explain the position of the European Commission <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other organisations such as the UN or the Arab League?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#J00300"><p>I thank Ms Nolan for her presentation.  Sometimes I despair because we have seen many of the scenes in recent weeks and months, which are a repeat of what we saw 20 years ago during the war in the Balkans.  They may be different people but generally from the same region, all seeking to move to a place of safety.  People are on the move all the time.  They are coming from war-torn areas where there is repression and fear.</p><p>I worry about economic immigrants because I am not so sure about that situation.  I do not entirely buy into the arguments made in this regard.  I attended a meeting in Luxembourg two weeks ago on the European defence and security issue.  Climate change and this issue were discussed at length.  Climate change was one of the contributory factors.  There was a strong view that people from the candidate countries should be excluded, but I am not too sure about that.  They may have another reason for wishing to move and it may not have to do with economic matters.  They have been in that war zone for a number of years and know what it is like.  They have had recent experience of it and they may not wish to go through what they see coming towards them in one shape or form again given the kind of hardship they are suffering at the present time. </p><p>The Chairman is thinking they are subject to the <i>acquis communautaire</i>.</p></speech>

They have an inbuilt fear of something coming down the tracks that they cannot quite define, but they know that it is not good and they do not want to go there again.  The EU is making a mistake by saying it will not facilitate there concerns.</p><p>Once one puts up the barrier and does not show a willingness to help those in distress, whatever the cause, there is a price to be paid for that.  The worst images of all are those of razor wire and barbed wire barricades being presented to people fleeing for their lives.  It is a sad reflection on the EU and the global community, particularly the UN, that they have failed to grasp this issue in its initial stages.  It would have been quite simple, as Senator Leyden said, to set up safe havens.  They have not been restored since the Balkan wars.  They failed there because they were not defended.  That was the only reason, but they should have been defended.  That option was and still is there.  </p><p> I cannot for the life of me understand why we seem to have given over the management of refugees in that war-torn area to traffickers.  They are organising to horde groups of asylum seekers together before putting them on the high seas and letting them sink or swim.  That included women and children.  We should think carefully about the kind of abuses that some of those unfortunate people are running from. </p><p> It is easy for us to say throughout the length and breadth of Europe: "This is terrible.  We can't have hordes of people coming from different areas like that - coming to invade us by this invidious system."  We are attempting to treat the symptoms of the system, but are not treating the problem.</p><p> The last point I want to make concerns what we will do from here on in.  We should invoke the assistance of the UN in a meaningful way.  In addition, we should recognise that there are a number of countries in the front line that have been making serious sacrifices for the past four or five years, yet they have not got the kind of recognition they deserve, or the backup support they should have.</p></speech>

Many questions have been raised and it may be that you cannot cover all of them.  However, perhaps you can choose the ones you think are most relevant and take five minutes to conclude.</p></speech>

First of all, several of the questioners have made the point that this is not only a European crisis.  This is true.  We have to acknowledge the huge sacrifice and effort that countries such as Jordan, the Lebanon and Turkey have made.  They have taken in a huge amount of people and given them refuge.  We should also acknowledge that, as far as I know, the United States has offered to take in at least 10,000 until 2017.  Who knows, that may increase later on.  Canada has also offered to take people.</p> <p>  We are exploring all avenues to ensure that this stays on the world agenda as well.  It has become a European problem because these people are arriving here.  We are physically closer to them but of course it is a world problem.  Our vice-president, Ms Mogherini, who is in charge of external relations, is committed to pursuing all the UN options in terms of trying to get agreement about dealing with the root causes of this.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned Syria, which is a very complex situation.  We do not have an army.  There is no European army, despite what one might read in the newspapers sometimes.  This is a serious situation that will probably take many years to resolve.  I do not have a crystal ball.  As regards what Deputy Kyne asked me, the general feeling is that this problem is going to continue for some time.  Nobody thinks we are necessarily going to stop the flow overnight.  However, if we apply these different elements in our armoury we can perhaps make some kind of effort certainly to stop the worst excesses of it, which are the people smuggling aspect.  We will try to deal with that situation.  </p> <p>  I mentioned the trust fund for Africa and there will also be a trust fund for Syria, which the EU will start funding.  It is looking for other countries, including ones outside the EU, to contribute to it.</p><p>There was an announcement today about that.  It is a global issue but I am speaking today only about what we are doing. </p><p> We are working with the UN.  Obviously, on the ground we work with the UNHCR dealing with the crisis.  We do have internal stresses.  In the Schengen area some member states have had to invoke temporary measures, which are foreseen under the Schengen rules which provide that where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security a member state may exceptionally reintroduce border controls at its internal borders for a limited period.  Anything that has been done in that regard until now has been completely in line with what is foreseen under the Schengen borders code.  This is not something we would like to see continue.  We all value the ability to be able to move freely in the EU, it is one of the huge benefits of being in the EU and we would like to see the situation return to normal as soon as it can.</p><p> We always have provision in the EU budget for emergencies but of course there was already quite a lot of money going towards dealing with many of these issues before.  We are now upping the game from areas of the budget that allow us to deal with it.  We cannot reopen our multi-annual financial framework but we are doing what we can to boost particular areas.  For example, even under the social fund, to which most, if not all member states have access, some of that money can be used for example, for integration of migrants, language training and such like.  There is also a fund from the EU to support each relocated migrant up to the tune of &euro;6,000, which will go to those member states that accept the relocation of migrants.</p></speech>

In respect of the issue I and several of my colleagues raised, taking the view that this is a global crisis, Ms Nolan said she was giving her own response.

Can the Commission be proactive in that respect?</p></speech>

It is not just the Commission as the Heads of State and Government are also raising this in all the relevant fora.  I am sure when Mrs. Merkel goes to the UN she will raise it too.  This is the top issue.  I agree with Deputy Keating we must have a global response.  In the meantime, Europe has to put its own house in order, be united and show solidarity in the face of what is an unprecedented migratory flow.  That is where we are at.</p></speech>

The current refugee crisis is a challenge of tremendous proportions that affects all of us in Europe.  It also affects the core values of the European Union, as a community of values, and we have seen dynamic developments in the European Union, as we have just heard.  Yesterday there was the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and a summit is under way this evening.  As already mentioned, these refugees are part of the global challenge.  The UNHCR estimates there are approximately 60 million people forcibly displaced worldwide.  It is important to note that 86% of those people are hosted in developing countries, areas less affluent than the European Union.  In August 2015 alone, 105,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Germany.  Among those, 45% were from Syria, 11% were from Afghanistan, 9% were from Iraq and 8% were from Albania.  Germany is expecting the arrival of 800,000, if not 1 million, refugees and asylum seekers this year, which is five times last year's number.  It is a huge challenge to all of us to provide housing, health care, education and a prompt and fair assessment of claims for asylum to this enormous number of refugees.</p> <p>  The vast majority of the German public is showing a great willingness to help incoming refugees.  Thousands of volunteers have collected food, clothing and toys and have provided assistance for arriving refugees.  In the first half of September, an average of 5,000 migrants crossed the Austrian border into Germany per day.  Over the weekend of 12 September and 13 September alone, 19,000 migrants arrived at the southern German city of Munich.</p><p>This tremendous influx led to a situation where on 13 and 14 September, Germany temporarily introduced controls and immediate identity registration for refugees upon arrival in Germany at or close to the German&ndash;Austrian border.  As Ms Nolan mentioned, this measure is in accordance with the Schengen procedures.  We see it as necessary for security reasons and to better manage the influx of these migrants.</p><p> It is of central importance that we find a joint European answer to the refugee crisis.  From Germany's point of view, this European strategy should include the points already mentioned by Ms Nolan.  However, let me highlight four aspects of that strategy.  I will start with the medium and long-term perspective.  We need to find new political initiatives to fight the causes of flight in the countries of the Middle East and Africa.  Stabilising failing states and curbing violence and civil war must go hand in hand with efforts to achieve economic development and create genuine economic and social prospects, especially for young people.</p><p> Our focus lies on supporting the countries neighbouring Syria and the Western Balkans.  Germany has provided more than &euro;1 billion in aid to Syria and its neighbouring countries since 2012.  We have discussed with the European Union a means to step up its engagement in these countries, including financially.  We have just heard there are concrete plans in this regard and a trust fund for Africa will be decided at the Valletta summit.  It is also interesting that the structures and diplomatic channels provided by the Cotonou Agreement could be helpful.  There will also be a trust fund for Syria.  Following the agreement on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, I believe a new window of opportunity has been opened for diplomatic efforts to move towards a solution.  This may be a chance to break the gridlock on Syria.  However, it remains clear a political solution must be found.</p><p> The second aspect of a European approach is the need to join forces to deal with this tremendous refugee and asylum crisis.  Many of the refugees arriving have left everything behind, have risked their lives and those of their families.  These people cannot be stopped by walls or fences.  Temporary border closures by several EU member states have shown that there is no alternative to joint EU management of the influx of migrants.  Last week, the EU interior Ministers discussed the setting up of hot spots for the direct redistribution of refugees in Greece and Italy in an effort to establish a permanent system for refugee relocation.  These hot spots are a prerequisite for more equitable burden sharing within Europe and must be made operational as soon as possible.</p><p> The decision taken yesterday by justice Ministers on relocation of 120,000 refugees is an important step forward.  Joint European border management entails continuing and enhancing our efforts to ensure that the Mediterranean ceases to be a mass grave for people who have tried to reach us.  Ireland has shown solidarity by sending two vessels to the Mediterranean as an important and life-saving part of the handling of the refugee crisis.</p><p> An important issue is the issue of solidarity among EU member states.  The European Union is founded on the idea that when we stand together we can achieve tasks that we cannot achieve on our own.  Receiving hundreds of thousands of refugees is an enormous challenge that we can master only when we stand together.</p><p>Today&rsquo;s reality, in which only a handful of states shoulder most of the burden of this challenge, is just as unsustainable as a system that forces those countries that happen to form the EU&rsquo;s outer border to take the strain alone.  We have seen major progress in the EU fora in discussing this matter.  The last weeks have seen the majority of Europeans react to the fate of the refugees with overwhelming compassion and readiness to help.  It is certainly true for Germany.  However, the number of those arriving has also raised fears.  Europe needs a system of binding, objective criteria for refugee quotas for all member states that acknowledges their respective capabilities.  Yesterday's decision was a major step forward in this regard.</p><p> Reliable burden sharing is the key to safeguarding the goodwill necessary to receive and integrate those who come in dire need and to fight xenophobic fears all over Europe.  Importantly, it is also key to preserving the cohesion of the EU as a community of values.  Germany highly appreciates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to voluntarily opt in by taking 4,000 refugees.</p><p> Burden sharing also includes immediate assistance to the EU countries that are currently under particular strain.  Germany has bilaterally made available emergency funds to aid refugees on the Greek islands.</p><p> We need a more integrated European asylum policy.  A common European asylum code should guarantee asylum status that is valid throughout the EU for refugees in need of protection.  In the long run, we will be able to help refugees in need of protection only if those who are not entitled to asylum return to their countries of origin.  The EU must make readmission a key priority of its relations with the countries of origin and be prepared to make technical and financial support contingent on constructive co-operation.  To that end, we need an EU-wide understanding on which nations we consider to be safe countries of origin.  All countries of the western Balkans aim to join the EU, and we have good cause to extend to them the prospect of accession.  This means at the same time that, at least generally, we cannot also treat them as persecuting countries.</p><p> We have to act now and must not waste time.  There are thousands of refugees, women, men and children, seeking refuge at the doorstep of the European Union.  Many of them are wandering around in disarray and are becoming increasingly desperate.  Winter is coming, as has been mentioned.  It is entirely up to us whether we will unite to send out a decisive signal of humanity and compassion; it is our choice whether we will stand together in solidarity.</p><p> In a few weeks, families across Europe will celebrate Christmas with their loved ones and families. We will read and hear the story of a family on the move being turned away, a story that has set the moral foundation and value orientation for all of Europe.  The decisions we will take during the next days and weeks will decide whether we Europeans will celebrate Christmas at peace with ourselves.</p></speech>

Mr. Giovanni Adorni Braccesi Chiassi" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#O00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the joint committee on the immigration and refugee crisis that is occurring in eastern Europe and the southern Mediterranean.  Today is the second time in six months that I have had the honour to tackle this matter with members.  On 29 April last, I was here with Mr. Peter Sutherland, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General for International Migration, to speak about the difficult situation on the southern coasts of Italy in the face of the continuous flow of migrants from North Africa.</p><p>This is a crisis that began a long time ago.  I recall that this problem was one of the major points in the programme of the Italian Presidency of the EU last year, and we launched the operation "Mare Nostrum" in November 2013.  Perhaps the relevance of this problem was not perceived at that time.</p><p> In any case, I thank the Irish authorities again for having sent two naval vessels to help all those refugees.  If we are to quantify the assistance provided by the European partners we can say that in the last few months they have taken on a third of all rescue operations in the Sicilian channel.  I also note the fact that Ireland has decided to take 4,000 asylum seekers in the last few days.</p><p> The problem of migration and refugee flows is one which will be with us for many years to come.  It is a world issue.  I was surprised but very pleased to read that the United States is willing to take, apparently, 100,000 refugees in the coming months.  However, this problem has two sides.  On the one hand there are those who are leaving their countries of origin for reasons which I would define as political and who are asylum-seekers; on the other there are those who are leaving their countries mainly for economic reasons and, therefore, have a quite different profile.  There are different demographic dynamics in Africa and Europe.  In 2050 the population of Europe will be reduced from 730 million to 700 million, while in Africa the population will rise from 1.1 billion to 2.4 billion.  That will continue to push population masses to seek better living conditions on this side of the Mediterranean.  Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the crisis which is occurring in countries such as Libya, Syria and Iraq will be solved in the short term.</p><p> However, to have a clearer picture of the crisis it is worth quoting some figures.  In the past 18 months, 130,000 migrants were rescued exclusively by the Italian armed forces in the Mediterranean, and the numbers are rising.  Last weekend, approximately 5,000 more people were rescued.  In 2015, it is estimated that 200,000 migrants have transited from Libya to Italy, while for Greece the figures are even higher at 400,000 men, women and children.  It is clear that a problem of this magnitude cannot be faced individually by any single European country for many different reasons.  One of these, and one which is of great concern to public opinion in our Union, is the question of security and, therefore, first is the question of the identification of thousands and thousands of migrants.  This is anything but a simple operation.  Only a co-ordinated and joint action on the part of the European Union can attempt to define and set in motion an efficient strategy.  Italy, which is exposed on the front line because of its geographical position, has endorsed the need for European action for many years.  Today, at last, the awareness of this need has spread to many, even if not to all, European countries.</p><p> The European Union must assume responsibility and not just in terms of solidarity, but also because only co-ordinated action can attempt to channel and administer an event of such historical significance such as the one we are witnessing.  It is necessary first to acknowledge that the Dublin regulation, conceived 25 years ago for a profoundly different migration reality, must be changed.  The current context requires a much deeper action which can only move along the guidelines which were outlined in April by Peter Sutherland.  Essentially, the European Union must define a common policy on asylum, to include uniform criteria for the provision of international protection and lead to the mutual recognition of decisions on asylum and to a mechanism for the distribution of refugees.</p><p> At the same time, it will be necessary to work at European Union level on the question of repatriation of irregular migrants.  This will be a complex operation that will require the involvement at diplomatic level of the countries of origin and the location of important resources.  There is no doubt that such an action will stand a greater chance of success if conducted in a co-ordinated and unified way.  The repatriation of irregular immigrants which must obviously occur with respect to the dignity of migrants is an important step in the fight against criminal trafficking of human beings.  This is an indispensable premise for serious policies on the reception of those who have the right to international protection.  These can also go hand in hand with policies on the promotion of legal migration, which is more and more useful and necessary, both to counteract the decreasing population of many European countries, as well as for its positive effects in reducing demographic pressures and supporting the development of the countries of origin thanks to the flow of remittances.  Furthermore, uniform criteria for the provision of asylum and efficient common policies on the repatriation of irregular migrants are a guarantee for the Schengen system&rsquo;s stability which has been severely tested these past months.  Freedom of movement within the European Union must be safeguarded as one of the fundamental pillars for us to stay together. </p><p> The management of migratory flows which at this stage are of a structural and unquantifiable nature also demands a strengthening of the European Union&rsquo;s external action in certain contexts.  The Commission has drawn up a useful document on the role of external action in facing the refugee crisis and reacting to the crises which are today the origin of the massive refugee flows towards Europe.  We think the conference in La Valletta in November will be a particularly important testing ground in this context and point to the fact that the crisis is a world crisis.  It will provide a forum for a wide and equitable discussion with our African partners on questions relating to development and aimed mainly at tackling the deep-rooted causes of these migrations and bring to the surface our shared interest in finding a way of managing them in a more ordered and mutually beneficial fashion.</p></speech>

I will refrain from going into the detail of my written intervention, especially as the Chairman has noted we are lacking time; therefore, I will be brief.  I am sorry if therefore I miss a few points.  I subscribe to the majority, if not all, of the points raised by my colleagues, the German and Italian ambassadors.  I also refer to the earlier intervention of Ms Barbara Nolan.<br/><br/>Our intervention which we issued last week has slightly changed in respect of the decisions already recorded at the Justice and Home Affairs Council yesterday, but I will try to describe the overall thinking which was behind our position initially and which I think will also be reflected in one way or another by our Prime Minister tonight.  <br/><br/>The area of freedom of security and justice policy which cannot be handled by the instruments in this policy alone will form part of the context of a discussion on the migration crisis.  This is not only the internal problem of the European Union.  It is also put under pressure by the external aspects which then connect with both Common Foreign and Security Policy and external aspects of possibly a number of sectoral policies.  That is why the thinking of the Polish Government was, as mentioned, to look at the context not only from the humanitarian point of view which requires an <i>ad hoc</i>action at the current moment but also from the perspective of it being a rather far and wider-reaching problem, which means looking at the root causes and the situations in countries which are the reasons for the migration of the refugees.  It also involves working together with the international community.</p><p>This is a much deeper and more complicated situation, as was said.  The issue of relocation and resettlement was also mentioned.  I think we can talk about "the five Rs", as I would add the issues of readmission, return and reintegration.  There is also the question of how to handle the issue of illegal and legal migration in the refugee crisis and of those who are readmitted and have to be able to live again in the country.  The way they escape or the other countries could provide a place for them to stay must be considered.</p><p> In the debate on the crisis a matter which was also raised by the representatives of Poland was sovereignty.  We were against an automatic system of quotas because, from the position of the internal and external perspectives, we were not sure they could provide the right message.  There is already pressure and it might send a wrong signal that all this would be done automatically.  We must look at the capacity of countries, not only at this moment but also in a potential future moment.  In this respect, I subscribe to what the Italian ambassador has said about being a front country.  Ours is a front country of the land border, obviously, and fortunately not under the same pressure as Italy.  We cannot and do not forget the problem behind our eastern border which is also the EU external border in Ukraine.  I agree that winter is coming and that we cannot predict what the situation will be if we have the humanitarian and refugee crisis of people coming from Ukraine.  There are different scenarios.  Some scenarios are not taking place.  Those dealing with the current crisis should reflect also on the potential problems that may occur.</p><p> We do support and have agreed that there needs to be co-operation with third countries and countries with which the European Union has recognition agreements.  In order to help, especially those neighbouring countries with a problem of refugees, there is room for further work to be done by the European Union.  I was pleased to hear that information had been provided by the Commission on how EU institutions were also engaging in this respect.</p><p> As a country with an EU external border, we fully understand and subscribe to the mechanism and possibilities of the Schengen agreement for arranging temporary border controls.  While we must try to manage different problems as they appear, in the longer term it would be a failure of the system we have created to secure the freedom of movement of persons that makes the border friendly as an external border for people to travel to.  In this respect, we cannot go in the direction of just totally blocking on a permanent basis.</p><p> We undertook a number of reforms and efforts when we were in the process of accession.  For instance, we limited the distance between our border control stations or border points from, if I recall properly, sixty-something km to 19 km.  We have modernised the border control system, with non-military, police-oriented forces which can also work effectively on a mobile and permanent basis in handling the issue and the pressure.  These are like the experiences of other countries, on which we can rely and use as a tool.</p><p> I fully agree on the points made about fighting illegal migration.  The European Union and the member states have different agencies at their disposal.  There was mention of a number of operations by Frontex and Europol in handling this, unfortunately, profitable business and the moneys spent in both trafficking and illegal migration.  Efforts should also continue in this respect.</p><p> The final matter which countries are discussing and which is also, in a way, important is information policy - those countries which in a way are safe and those which are not and those with which we can co-operate.</p><p>The external context of the pressure of the refugee and migration crisis for the EU is also complex.  We cannot compare the Balkans, Syria and Libya with one another, as they are completely different situations.  The refugees are often mixed in with the economic migrants.  Within the economic migrant group, we can differentiate between different people who are travelling to change their lives economically and those whose daily or annual incomes are too low to survive.  In this respect what the UN and the member states may do and the kind of message we are sending to the international community concerning how we can engage different actors is also important.  I will conclude there.  I thank the Chairman and other committee members.</p></speech>

I will try to limit my comments to a couple of minutes.  Ambassador H&ouml;pfner, I was in Berlin when the Chancellor announced her decision about the numbers of migrants.  I was very impressed by the way in which ordinary people there seemed to open their hearts and doors on this issue.  It was an example to all of us in the rest of Europe and it helped to move the debate on significantly.</p> <p>  While I was there, I spoke to some members of the Bundestag who explained that 30% of arrivals were actually from Balkan countries and were more economic migrants as opposed to refugees.  Bearing in mind that many of these countries are accession states on their way to full EU membership, what is the internal debate about perhaps extending the visa programmes for such people, bearing in mind that hopefully in a short number of years they will be full members of the EU?</p> <p>  I also have a question for Ambassador Braccesi.  When you were here in April, you would have heard the debate during which Mr. Sutherland stated he was interested in looking at the option of processing migrants in centres outside the EU.  Do you have any thoughts on whether that could be a runner?  It was debated at EU level but no decision was reached on going down that route.</p> <p>  Mr. Rakowski, I know that Poland is a member of the Visegr&aacute;d group.  What are your views on fellow members of the group and their attitude to this crisis?  You mentioned about potentially seeing a significant influx of refugees from the Ukraine.  Have you discussed burden sharing with other members of the Visegr&aacute;d group in the event, which we all hope will not happen, that Poland sees a significant increase in numbers of Ukrainian refugees?  How would you expect fellow members of the Visegr&aacute;d group to react to that?  </p> <p>  The next questioner is Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne.</p></speech>

I would like to welcome the two ambassadors and Mr. Rakowski.  I have a couple of questions for them.  Can Ambassador H&ouml;pfner comment on the implications of the whole crisis in relation to Schengen agreement and the open borders?  It is often said that his country needs migrants because there is work and the population is ageing.  Does he accept that other countries do not have this capacity?  Does that impact on his country's response to this or does he feel it is somewhat welcome?  As the Chairman said, Germany is unique in this regard, so are there issues for that policy.</p> <p>  Does Ambassador Braccesi have any comments to make on the Schengen Agreement?  From the outset of this crisis, Italy has been a front line country so what impact is the crisis having on the Italian economy, including services?  What are the views of ordinary Italians about it?  What are they saying about the situation?</p> <p>  Mr. Rakowski mentioned the Schengen situation but what do ordinary Polish people think of the crisis?  Is there a view that Poland needs to do more or is there an anti-immigrant feeling there?</p></speech>

Abraham Lincoln once famously said of one of his generals, "McClellan has the slows."</p><p>One of the criticisms I would level at the European Union and the United Nations is that Europe had the slows in terms of dealing with this crisis.  We have had difficulty dealing with the economic crisis.  We took a long time to recognise its scale, depth and duration but eventually we got it right.  Similarly, in relation to this crisis, Europe has the slows, and so has the global community.  The United States and others only recognised in recent times that there was any responsibility or culpability on their part.</p><p> I compliment the countries on the front line that have made huge efforts to deal with the situation and to help out because when people are fleeing before whatever enemy, they like to see a friendly face somewhere.  They do not like to see the barbed wire, barricades or glass wall and they will remember it forever.  That could have serious implications for the people of Europe and globally at a later stage.</p><p> I say to the European Union that, if possible, it should co-ordinate its efforts to the extent that even if we do not have one voice that we have a general thrust of opinion in terms of how to deal with the situation.  That includes the regularisation of processing outside of the European Union to bring about order.  Why should unfortunate people, some of whom are suffering, who have come from war zones or are starving, be subjected to more torture by being kept virtually in cages while awaiting processing?</p><p> The United Nations needs to think very seriously about its responsibilities and how to deal with a situation of this magnitude and nature in a more meaningful way, as opposed to treating the symptoms.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Matthias H&ouml;pfner" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#T00300"><p>Two questions were directly posed in my direction.  The first was by yourself, Chairman, on the comments made by members of the German Bundestag that 30% of the refugees arrived from the Balkan region.  Indeed, that is so.  I mentioned the number of Albanians alone that form part of this refugee influx in Germany.  As I have said, in our view, we have to come to terms with the definition of countries of safe origin and if these are countries of safe origin, then special visa procedures or immigration procedures would have to take place.  We cannot accept citizens of such countries as refugees or asylum seekers if their countries of origin are seen as safe.  We tend to believe this is at least generally the case because we have agreed to give them EU candidature status, or they are on their way in that direction.  It would be contradictory to see them then as a persecuting country, at least in general.</p> <p>  In Germany there is an interesting discussion under way as to whether we should not introduce a new set of rules defining legal immigration.  We are looking in the direction of Canada, for example, where I have also served as ambassador and where they have a very successful points system managing something like 250,000 immigrants per year.  It is a political discussion in the direction that we should define possibilities of legal immigration.  That would take some of the pressure from the refugee situation.</p> <p>  The second question was whether the explanation for the current German policy is that we need all these migrants for demographic reasons.  Let me clearly say, this was certainly not the reason for the German approach.  The reason was the immediate emergency, the immediate challenge to core values of the European Union, challenges to humanity and to solidarity.</p><p>Therefore, it is mainly a value-oriented approach.  Immigrants from Syria, who in many cases have a good level of education and training, may become beneficial for Germany and our demographic numbers are not very different than in some other European countries.  There can be beneficial effects but the immediate motivation was clearly value oriented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Giovanni Adorni Braccesi Chiassi" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#U00200"><p>I will answer the committee's questions.  We are aware of the fact that it is much better to talk directly with the countries that the people are coming from.  I am talking mainly about economic emigrants, because when people leave their countries for political reasons, those countries do not exist.  We cannot talk to them.  We see how serious the problem is in Libya - an agreement is always close but it collapses every day.  There are certain countries that are very aware and willing to help to solve this matter, such as Morocco, Egypt and Lebanon.  I was in Morocco at the end of the '90s and we had reached an agreement with Morocco that we would take 5,000 people from Morocco every year because Morocco had agreed to take back all of those who were entering Italy illegally.  That will be a response to a global problem.  I read that there are around 60 million migrants all over the world and Europe will need them.</p> <p>  I will answer the question.  In Italy, we made the decision that refugees and migrants have to be distributed through different regions because they were concentrating mainly in the south of Italy.  Public opinion acknowledges that there are jobs that Italians do not want to take and that only people coming from outside Europe will take these kinds of jobs.  For a number of months there has been an increasing number of jobs given to people who come from outside the European Union.  </p> <p>  There is a fear about integration and security.  We have experienced a large number of immigrants in the past years coming from Albania and Romania, before Romania was part of the European Union, but those were coming from one country.  These immigrants are coming from tens of different countries and they speak tens of different languages.  How will they be integrated into Italy?  There will be a problem of scholarship and how they will adapt to our rules.  It is not an easy problem to solve.  It is a problem that cannot be solved by blocking them because they will arrive one way or another.  The problem has to be faced at a common level and we have to take into consideration the problems of the Italian people.  Sometimes it is a struggle between poor people.  There are Italians who are looking for houses but do not have them and they might get scared by all those people arriving and asking for the same thing.</p><p>It is a major political concern.  The Catholic Church is doing quite a big job in order to explain and also to give a response.  The Pope asked that every parish accept one family.  It is the beginning of a solution to a problem, but it is a major concern.  I believe there is a more positive attitude now that it is no longer just on the shoulders of Italy, Greece and certain countries.  It is now on the shoulders of all European countries.  Thank you.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Piotr Rakowski" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015092300002#V00300"><p>Thank you.  I will first answer Chairman&rsquo;s questions on the Visegr&aacute;d group.  Firstly, the issue of how to handle this crisis and how to look from the wider perspective was discussed on a number of occasions between our four countries, mostly at the level of Ministers of foreign affairs.  There was also a summit of the four countries on 4 September in Prague.  There was a joint statement of the Prime Ministers.  The position and outcome, and the further discussion that would take place, would not defer from what has been agreed.  All four countries highlighted a number of issues and looked not only at the internal perspective but also looked at the wider problems, the root causes for migration and the fact that migrant status has certain differentiations.</p> <p> One of the key elements was not to introduce the automatic system of quotas just based on the voluntary basis and the capabilities of the member states.  In this respect I think that the compromise that was reached yesterday does not, in my opinion, contradict what was discussed earlier and it is in accordance with the position of the Polish Government.  As regards the Ukrainian situation, three of the four countries are neighbouring countries with Ukraine.  The situation over there definitely was, and still is, an issue of concern.  I cannot recall very detailed discussions concerning what might happen if the refugee crisis had potentially originated in Ukraine because it was not that specific and there is not the situation.  However, the holistic approach towards Ukraine and the concerns on how the reforms are going, how the Visegr&aacute;d countries may become involved in terms of support, how the trade and external pressure from Russia and how the situation in the Donbas and in Crimea would develop, these were urgent as well.  I think that if it happened again it would be a point of rather deep interest from the countries within this regional grouping.</p> <p> Now I turn to the Deputy's question on what is the current discussion on the situation on the migrant crisis in Poland.  It is not a secret that we are in the process of parliamentary elections, the campaign has started and the debate is rather polarised.  There was only one poll taken within Polish society and approximately 50% of the people polled voted against bringing migrants or refugees to Poland.  This connects with the last part of my previous intervention - the proper information campaign.  On the one hand there are polls which indicate the real scenario and then there is an image which is seen as extreme because there is a strong association between those who are against it &ndash; they are confusing the words "economic migrant", "migrant" and "refugee".  This confuses the situation when people are fleeing.  Then, unfortunately, there is the image of Islam which might be interpreted as ISIS and extreme terrorism, which is false and inappropriate.</p><p>It is difficult, based on this rather narrow point of discussion addressing the public agenda, to reach conclusions which will be long lasting.  I would refrain from giving an interpretation of society's overall response to this factual situation.  Perhaps it will be better in the future, when the political situation has settled, to really monitor the position of the society.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be here this afternoon to introduce to the committee three draft Government orders giving force of law in Ireland to three new double taxation agreements with Zambia, Ethiopia and Pakistan; one draft Government order giving force of law to a protocol to the double taxation agreement with Germany and three draft Government orders giving force of law in Ireland to three new tax information exchange agreements with Argentina, the Bahamas and Saint Kitts and Nevis.</p>  <p>  With respect to the double taxation agreements first, a new agreement was signed with Ethiopia by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Sean Sherlock on 3 November 2014 and agreements to replace the existing double taxation agreements with Pakistan and Zambia were signed on 16 April 2015 by me and on 31 March 2015 by the Irish ambassador to Zambia, H.E. Mr. Finbar O' Brien.  A protocol to the current double taxation agreement with Germany was also signed by me on 3 December 2014.</p>  <p>  With regard to tax information exchange agreements, an agreement was signed with Argentina on 29 October 2014 by the former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Josephine Feehily, another agreement was signed with Saint Kitts and Nevis by the Irish ambassador to Great Britain, H.E. Mr. Daniel Mulhall on 20 July 2015 and a third agreement was signed with the Bahamas on 12 January 2015 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan.</p>  <p>  Double taxation agreements are essential in order to allow Ireland to develop greater opportunities for international trade and investment by reducing the number of tax impediments that may inhibit cross-border activity.  Ireland has signed 72 double taxation agreements of which 68 are in effect.  Ireland is a small country which is highly reliant on trade and investment with other countries, therefore growing a large network of tax agreements is very important.</p>  <p>  Double taxation agreements facilitate trade and investment in a number of ways.  They provide greater predictability and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and are key to the prevention of double taxation.  This is achieved through the formal allocation of clear taxing rights to one of the countries, or if both countries hold taxing rights, by providing that the authority in the country in which the taxpayer is resident grants a tax credit for the tax paid in the other jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Double taxation agreements reduce the risk of excessive taxation that may arise because of high withholding taxes and ensure that taxpayers are not subject to discriminatory taxation in other jurisdictions.  They also facilitate mutual agreement procedures which allow the tax authorities of both countries to consult with each other in taxation matters affecting the agreement and include provisions that allow for the exchange of information for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.</p>  <p>  Double taxation agreements cover direct taxes - in our case, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax - and apply to the taxation of both companies and individuals.  Those agreements made with developing countries such as Ethiopia, Zambia and Pakistan include a mixture of provisions drawn from both the UN and the OECD model conventions, departing from one or the other in certain respects in order to match each country's best interests and best to achieve the objective of avoiding double taxation and non-taxation in two countries with different tax systems.</p>  <p>  The protocol to the double taxation agreement with Germany amends the provision in our existing agreement with Germany to bring it into line with the OECD model tax convention.</p>  <p>  To date Ireland has signed 25 tax information exchange agreements of which 20 are in effect.  These agreements require parties to exchange information where the information requested is "foreseeably relevant" to a tax investigation in the other state.  The tax information exchange agreements are limited to exchange upon request - they do not provide for automatic exchange of information between the states.  However, the automatic exchange of information between jurisdictions is now being provided for through the new OECD common reporting standard to which more than 90 other countries, including Ireland, have committed.</p> <p>The automatic exchange of information between tax authorities is a valuable tool in the fight against tax fraud and evasion and we look forward to its implementation at an EU and global level.</p> <p> The tax information exchange agreements concluded by Ireland are all based on the OECD model tax information exchange agreements.  This model grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices globally and now represents the gold standard.  The agreements cover all taxes imposed by each State at the time of the agreement together with any identical or substantially similar taxes imposed at a later date.  In the case of Ireland, this is income tax, including the universal social charge, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and value-added tax.</p> <p> As part of Ireland's international tax strategy, published on budget day in October 2013, the Department of Finance set out an international tax charter outlining the principles and strategic objectives that guide Ireland's approach to international corporate tax issues.  One of these principles is a commitment to engage constructively and respectfully with developing countries in relation to tax matters and to support these countries in raising domestic tax revenues in ways that are more efficient, that promote good governance and equitable development, and that can allow them to exit eventually from a dependence on official development assistance.</p> <p> As part of this commitment, the Department has commissioned a spillover analysis of the impact of Ireland's tax system, including the tax treaty network, on the economies of developing countries.  Ireland is a thought leader in this area of research - only one other country, the Netherlands, has previously carried out a similar, though more limited in scope, spillover analysis project.  Last year, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, called on the OECD to adopt at least in spirit, a 16th action in the BEPS project that insists upon all countries undertaking spillover analysis of how their taxation regimes impact on the developing world.</p> <p> In this context, one element of the tax treaty review component of the spillover analysis has been the identification of certain elements of Ireland's old treaties with Zambia and Pakistan, dating from 1971 and 1973 respectively, which were in need of updating to reflect developments in international treaty policy since that time.  Our renegotiation of today's double taxation agreements with Zambia and Pakistan, along with our new double tax agreements with Ethiopia are in line with both the commitment in our international tax charter and the spillover project.  Ireland's tax treaty network compares very well with those of other large OECD countries.  It now includes most of the world's major economies, which account for in total more than 80% of the world GDP.</p> <p> In addition, there is a strong pipeline of agreements coming down the tracks.  Negotiations for new agreements with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan and a protocol to the existing agreement with Mexico have concluded and a Government decision authorising signature will be expected in the near future.  Negotiations with Ghana, Kazakhstan and the Netherlands are at various stages.</p> <p> The Minister for Finance and I, as well as officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue  Commissioners will continue to prioritise the growth of our tax treaty network.  As outlined in our IFS 2020 strategy document, we will continue to engage with industry representative bodies in identifying other jurisdictions where tax agreements would be beneficial for Irish business, as well as continue our efforts to open negotiations with other jurisdictions which we have, as yet, not been able to secure.  We consider that these agreements play a pivotal role in the strengthening of our economic recovery.</p> <p> Today's consideration of these international agreements by the committee is an important step in their ratification process.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il Eireann on 15 September 2015 in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the draft orders is required before the Government can make the orders.  The proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the draft orders has been referred to the committee for consideration and after consideration by the committee the draft orders are then referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval.</p> <p> After that the Government may make the orders and the agreements will then be included in a schedule to the taxes Acts, by means of a section in the forthcoming finance Bill.  At that stage, the Irish ratification procedures are completed.  Once both countries have completed their procedures, the agreements will take effect in accordance with their entry into force provisions.</p> <p> I commend these draft orders to the committee and, if required, I will be happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  I had a look at the draft orders earlier and I have no difficulty whatsoever with them.  My party very much supports the three orders giving effect to the double taxation agreements, the one protocol and the three tax information exchange agreements.  I commend the officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance for continuing to progressively build up Ireland's tax treaty network.  Clearly it is vital to our economic interests.  It makes trade easier.  It makes working relationships across trans-national business communities far easier.  The fact that we now have a network covering 80% of world GDP and a pipeline of further treaties coming down the track is very encouraging.</p>  <p>  I welcome this, Chairman.  I do not have any questions as the matter is very straightforward.  I wish the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department well in their continuing efforts to expand our network further.</p></speech>

The idea behind the BEPS project is to try to find solutions where we can have simple, almost one size fits all, tax treaties for all countries that sign up for the BEPS project.

As the Chairman knows we are now reaching the finality and the BEPS reports are expected to be published in October.  The BEPS action plan includes the development of measures to prevent the abuse of treaties.  Some of these measures will involve changes to the OECD model convention on which Ireland's model is based, as the Chairman correctly states.  This will have implications for Ireland negotiating position generally for future double taxation agreements.  However, it has been said that changes agreed under BEPS would take over 20 years to permeate through to tax treaties worldwide.  For this reason the action plan also provides for the development of a legal instrument to allow targeted BEPS measures to be incorporated into existing double taxation agreements, DTAs.  Work on developing this multilateral instrument is expected to be concluded next year and the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are involved in this work.  The new rule will apply to all future DTAs.  There will be the development under the action plan of a multilateral instrument to apply certain actions to existing treaties and we are working on that currently.</p>  <p>  The Bahamas is a Crown dependency, hence our ambassador to the United Kingdom signed the treaty.</p></speech>

We are delighted to have with us Mr. Barry Andrews, chief executive of Goal; and Ms Sophie Magennis, of the UN High Commission for Refugees.  Both have been to the forefront of the migrant crisis over the summer period, so we are delighted to have them here this morning.  On behalf of all our colleagues here, I extend a warm welcome to them both.</p><p>This is the first opportunity for members of the committee to receive reports and reflect on the refugee crisis which escalated mainly in the Mediterranean region in the summer of 2015.  I am aware that over the past week the EU has been holding meetings, at ministerial and Heads of State level, to find a way forward, ensure a solution to the crisis and provide further assistance to people seeking to cross into Europe.</p><p>The format of today's meeting is to have opening statements from Mr. Andrews and Ms Magennis, before going into a question and answer session with members of the committee.  As we know, the interior and justice Ministers met yesterday in Brussels, while today there is a European Council meeting as well, so the timing of our meeting is very appropriate.  </p><p>Without further ado, I want to remind witnesses, members and those in the Public Gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as, even in silent mode, they do cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  As I said, today's meeting is being broadcast live on Oireachtas TV across the various media platforms.</p><p>I also wish to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>We will now start our proceedings immediately.  This is a very serious subject and one that has been on our television screens throughout the summer period.  It has disturbed many people throughout the world, including in our own country.  </p><p>I now call on Mr. Barry Andrews to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

First of all, I wish to introduce Mr. Jonathan Edgar, our chief operations officer in Goal, and Ms Maria McLoughlin who is our advocacy officer in Goal.</p> <p>  Goal has been trying to refocus attention on the necessity of looking at this issue at source.  There is obviously an awful lot of debate about the logistical challenges of relocating a number of people in this country in the next two years and elsewhere throughout the European Union.  I think Ms Sophie Magennis from the UNHCR is better placed to give her observations on that.  Goal's focus is primarily on Syria and also on the border areas around Syria.  We are asking leaders to continue to focus on this as the source of the problems we are seeing in Europe.  Without addressing that issue at source, those problems will get worse.</p> <p>  I first addressed this committee in April 2013.</p><p>At that stage, 70,000 people had died in the war in Syria.  I informed the committee that I was afraid that I would come before it again some day and that the figure might have risen above 100,000.  What I did not anticipate was that the figure would reach 250,000.  I did not anticipate that I would be back here in 2015.  I did not anticipate that it would create incredible changes in the region, nor that it would come to visit the shores of the European Union, and certainly not to the extent that has actually proven to be the case.</p><p> This matter was raised by members as a Topical Issue in the D&aacute;il in March 2012.  There has been very little discussion of it the D&aacute;il.  Let me give some of the quotations that were used, one Deputy said this was a crisis of gargantuan proportions.  At that time, just 10,000 people had died in the war in Syria.  If the number of deaths were of gargantuan proportions in March 2012, what is it now?  What have we done?  That is my challenge to the joint committee and to anybody who will listen to the testimony that GOAL can give.  The Minister of the day said that the worst-case scenario would be if Syria were to slip into open civil war, which would be profoundly destabilising for the entire region.  It is not as if people did not know that this was going to happen and that there the likelihood was high that these events would come to pass.</p><p> What was very abstract back then is now very real.  We know why that is so because we have seen various photographs in newspapers in recent times.  GOAL started an advocacy campaign in the middle of August.  The basic idea is that we do not want to look back at the conflict in 20 years' time and say "I wish I had known then what I know now".  We tried to confront people with the reality of the war in Syria.  Inevitably, we have a diminished sense of the reality of war because of where we are.  However, we also self-censor all the time.  We do not allow our screens to be filled with the realities of war and, therefore, we have a diminished sense of that reality.</p><p> The UN Security Council was presented, some four or five months ago, with a video of doctors trying to resuscitate three small children, none of whom survived the resuscitation effort.  The UN Security Council was moved to tears by this video but was not moved to action and has done almost nothing about this crisis.  Nobody has seen this video.  We have tried to raise this advocacy issue as often as possible.  What it brings us back to is the ineffectiveness of the United Nations, which I say with all due respect to my colleague.  The UN, at its very best, is superb in terms of the work it does in educating children, particularly girls, the work it does with refugees and the work it is doing regarding climate change, with the COP21 meeting coming up in December.  It is excellent in those circumstances.  What it has been terrible at, for example, is evidenced by the way the World Health Organisation, WHO, dealt with the Ebola epidemic.  It can be very bad in terms of bureaucracy but its core fundamental purpose is peace.  It was founded in 1945 with the express purpose as stated in the opening lines of its charter, "We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ...".  That is the central plank of the United Nations.</p><p> The Security Council was founded for that purpose but, as I have said before, the Security Council is a 1945 answer to a question nobody is asking anymore.  There are five permanent members of the UN Security Council.  Why so?  They won the Second World War.  They have a veto over all matters of the Security Council.  It would be bad enough if the Security Council just passed resolutions that were ineffective.  I have mentioned in my paper that the head of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, of the UN has acknowledged that Security Council resolutions have gone unheeded.  What is worse is that the belligerents in the crisis in Syria are actually emboldened by the failure to implement UN Security Council resolutions.  There is a direct correlation between the level of violence and the catalogue of failed UN resolutions.  We have seen well-documented evidence of the use of chemical weapons.</p><p>We have seen well-documented evidence of crimes against humanity, rape as a weapon of war, disappearances and arbitrary arrests, but nothing happens.  What we must do, and I have seen this emerge now in commentary among EU leaders, is really look at the UN Charter, the UN Security Council and the basic institutions.  It is almost a Bretton Woods system, set up for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, or something of a similar nature that is required to redraw a completely new paradigm for conflict resolution globally.</p><p> It might seem pointless for a small parliament to apply its mind to things such as this but, in fact, Ireland has a tremendous tradition.  We have a very significant role in the EU and the EU has incredible influence with some of the major powers that are influencing this war in Syria.  In the case of Saudi Arabia, for example, consider the trade relations between that country and the EU.  In the case of Iran, we have seen a great improvement in relations between it and the West.  Consider that influence and, of course, Russia.  While sanctions have been applied to Russia because of what happened in Ukraine, that has not extended to the veto which Russia is constantly using to stop the most basic resolutions that would protect populations in Syria.</p><p> In conclusion, back in March 2012, Deputy Ann Phelan, who is now a Minister of State, quoted as follows: "The world is a dangerous place, not because of the evil that men do, but because of those that stand idly by and do nothing."  Members of the committee will ask what they can do, but there has not been any Private Members' business applied to this issue in the House.  There have been no all-party motions.  It is debated in this committee, but nowhere else.  There are no meetings held here in this building where external people are brought in and it is not given the priority that it deserves.  It is the humanitarian catastrophe of our time.  It was gargantuan in March 2012, and now, in September 2015, it is something that requires and deserves all of our attention.</p></speech>

I am happy to be here with colleagues from GOAL.  The UNHCR works in partnership with many international non-governmental organisations based in Ireland in the countries surrounding Syria and, indeed, in Syria.  It is a mark of the co-operation that takes place between the UNHCR and international NGOs that representatives of both GOAL and the UNHCR are before the committee today.  We are very happy to be here at the committee's invitation.</p> <p>  This crisis is of a huge magnitude, as Barry Andrews has outlined.  The High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, has been speaking about this crisis for many years and, indeed, addressed this committee in October 2012 on the occasion of his mission to Ireland.  One of the messages he has been promoting recently is that while this crisis is of a very big scale, it is manageable for Europe.  I wish to focus on a number of matters with which we would appeal to the committee members to get involved.  One is the resolution that will be brought before the Oireachtas, presumably next week, on foot of decisions to be taken in Brussels today.  The other relates to funding appeals that are under way at present.  The third relates to political support, which refugees and others really need at present.  While the crisis is of a huge scale, there are some manageable things with which politicians, UN agencies and NGOs can begin to engage.  Ultimately, of course, the solution to this crisis is a resolution of the conflicts that are causing people to flee.</p> <p>  The High Commissioner for Refugees and the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, have been appealing to members states, through the institutions in the UN, to take action to address this conflict.  While we hope that some actions will be taken, in the interim the United Nations agencies such as the UNHCR are doing everything they can to provide humanitarian support.  There is no humanitarian solution to this crisis; there must be a political solution to the crisis and to the conflicts that are causing people to flee.</p><p>I know that the Secretary General of the United Nations is doing everything he can to try to encourage member states and political entities at the United Nations to take the decisions that need to be taken.</p><p> I do not need to labour too much the background to the UNHCR.  It is the UN refugee agency and we work under the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees.  My colleague, Jody Clarke, who works in external relations, and I work in the Irish office and very closely with the Departments of Justice and Equality and Foreign Affairs and Trade on refugee issues.</p><p> Since the beginning of 2015, 477,906 people have arrived in Europe by sea.  We gave some statistics and a background note to the committee in advance of the meeting.  This is double the figure for all of 2014 and seven times the figure recorded in 2013 and represents an increase to almost 500,000 people travelling by sea to Europe.  I want to talk about why that is.  First, around the world conflicts that have been rolling on for many years have continued and many new conflicts have erupted or been reignited.  There are eight in Africa, including those in the C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, the Central African Republic, Libya and Mali, conflicts familiar to members of the committee.  There is the situation in the Middle East and what is happening in Syria, Iraq and now also in Yemen.  There are other reasons for movement within Europe, while there is the prospect of greater movement if we consider what is happening in Ukraine.  As a result of all these activities and conflicts, almost 60 million people were displaced in 2014, that is, between internally displaced people and refugees.  This compares to a figure of 51.2 million a year ago and 37 million a decade ago.  Most of the people in question, almost nine out of ten, live in developing countries.  There is a lot of awareness now of what a refugee crisis looks like because we are seeing it in the European Union, but it is still a tiny proportion of the global displacement figure.  In 2014, 86% of the world&rsquo;s refugees were hosted in developing countries.  People flee to neighbouring countries and do not move further.  We are seeing some movement into the European Union, which is galvanising people&rsquo;s awareness of what movement looks like, but we need to keep this in perspective.  It is a very small movement when we consider the global picture.</p><p> A second key issue to explain why we are where we are is that the war in Syria has become the single biggest driver of new displacement.  Since the conflict began in 2011, 7.5 million people have been forced out of their homes inside the country.  They are internally displaced.  They are in a dire position because many are beyond the reach of any assistance from non-governmental organisations, NGOs, or the United Nations, although attempts are made to try to assist them internally.  More than 4 million more have been forced to flee Syria and go to other countries.  While there is growing awareness in the European Union of people arriving here, Turkey hosts 2 million and Lebanon, approximately 1.3 million.  Jordan hosts over 600,000 registered refugees but approximately 1.3 million Syrians are on its territory.  The numbers in the European Union are small by comparison with these figures.  Many of the people concerned have been hosted in Turkey and Lebanon for many years and are only now beginning to consider whether they should move on.</p><p> The preliminary findings of a recent UN study show 70% of Syrian refugee households in Lebanon live below the national poverty line of just over $3 per person per day.  People are living in Lebanon where there are no official camps and are quite destitute.  Ireland has recently received some resettled refugees who have come from Lebanon.  I met them last Friday.  They have been living for years without an income; their children have not been in education and having been in that situation for between three and five years, with nothing improving, they are considering whether they should take even very risky journeys to move.  There is a lack of safe and legal alternatives for people to move.  The UNHCR has been advocating for many years with member states to try to increase legal alternatives for refugees and those who need protection to travel to countries where they could find protection, for example, through the issue of humanitarian visas.  The Syrian humanitarian admission programme that the Irish authorities established was a very good initiative.  It will I hope enable 114 people to enter Ireland in safety.</p><p>We have assisted the Irish authorities with that programme.  There is a resettlement programme in Ireland and other countries also have larger scale resettlement programmes.  However, more could be done to facilitate access to work visas, student visas and humanitarian visas which would allow Syrians to travel to other countries within the European Union and elsewhere.</p><p> Before I conclude, I would like to address what is happening at European level and then I would welcome any questions members may have.  At European Union level, as the committee will be aware, there was a further extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers yesterday which was attended by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  An outcome document has been published.  The leaders are meeting today to, hopefully, endorse and ratify that document and look at broader issues that need to be put in place.</p><p> The relocation mechanism agreed on by a vote at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers yesterday will facilitate the relocation of 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece - people likely in need of protection - to other member states.  Ireland and the UNHCR have very much welcomed the measure.  Ireland will opt into this measure.  We understand the measure will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas next week and we encourage it to move quickly to ratify the measure.  Once the opt-in is established, Ireland will participate in the relocation mechanism whereby these asylum seekers will be relocated to other European Union member states.  UNHCR has greatly welcomed the measure and has welcomed the fact a decision has finally been taken which, hopefully, will be ratified by the leaders tomorrow.  However, we have highlighted that this measure alone will not solve the European Union's crisis.  The relocation of 160,000 asylum people is a good start.  We indicated many weeks ago that a preliminary estimate of the UNHCR of the needs was 200,000 people, so those needs will need to be looked at and kept under review.  </p><p> Relocation is one measure but many other measures need to accompany it and we have highlighted what those are.  For the relocation mechanism to work, Greece and Italy need to be supported to enhance their reception capacity.  We have colleagues, and we have been in contact with them in recent days, who are working in Kos and Lesbos.  Thousands of people are arriving in Greece every day and the facilities are not there to assist people on arrival.  Those facilities need to be put in place in Greece and the facilities in Italy need to be enhanced.  The decision allows for Greece and Italy to provide updated roadmaps to the European Commission to set out how those reception arrangements will be improved.  That will require the assistance of member states, including Ireland, the European Asylum Support Office and other European institutions.</p><p> We need to stabilise the situation in the European Union's neighbouring countries.  Much more needs to be done in terms of aid support to Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and the countries that are already hosting refugees.  The UN has launched a combined appeal for over $4 billion to support activities in that area and the latest estimate shows it is 37% funded.  Much more needs to be done in terms of the funding position to assist those neighbouring states.</p><p> In terms of the exact position of the European Union's Mediterranean crisis, we have put out what is called our special Mediterranean initiative funding appeal for $50 million to assist the countries receiving refugees and asylum seekers at the moment.  That initiative is currently 5% funded.  We are continuing to work with states to attract additional funding.</p><p> The key lesson from the chaotic scenes in recent days and weeks in the European Union is that piecemeal actions will not work.  There needs to be a unified response by the European Union to this crisis which we have termed as "manageable".  We hope that Ireland and this committee, through its various parliamentary networks, will do what it can to encourage the European Union to respond in a unified way to this humanitarian crisis.</p></speech>

Before I hand over to Deputy Smith, I will ask some questions.  Ms Magennis spoke about the countries that have taken in refugees and obviously this is a real humanitarian situation.  Why does she think the European Union is not dealing with the issue of smugglers, which is the source of the problem?</p><p>Ms Magennis talked about Lebanon and Jordan.  We have been there and have seen the camps and the problems.  We have also been to the Turkish border with GOAL and have seen what Turkey has done.  Why does Ms Magennis think these refugees are not going north towards Russia or towards their neighbours in the more wealthy Arab countries rather than to Europe?  Is it more lucrative?</p></speech>

I wish to make a couple of points on that issue.  I will deal first with the issue of smugglers.  The issue of smugglers has been dealt with by the European Union in some of its documents.  We will have to see what comes out from the leaders' meeting today.  Our understanding is that they will be looking at that issue.  The Chairman mentioned that the smuggler issue is a source of why people are coming to the European Union.  Our position on that is that people are going to come because they have no alternative.  We have raised the need to tackle smugglers to make sure people are not subject to this terrible exploitation but in reality people's situation is so desperate that they will take any measures to travel.  We have made the point that in order to address this humanitarian crisis - it is a humanitarian crisis - we need to look at the real reasons for the movement.  We need to tackle smugglers and criminal gangs, as has been highlighted by the High Commissioner, but that is one of a number of measures and focusing on that alone will not get us to an answer.</p> <p>  In terms of why people are moving to Europe, I stress again that a very small proportion of Syrians are moving to Europe.  In fact, the vast majority of Syrian refugees are moving to neighbouring states where they have Arab brothers, sisters or relatives or where there are people of a similar culture, so the vast majority of them are in those countries.  The Lebanese authorities-----</p></speech>

Refugees are being hosted in the region because that is to where they are able to flee.  The issue is that there is no durable solution for those refugees where they are.  One in four in the territory of Lebanon is a Syrian refugee.  The Lebanese authorities have done what they can but they cannot cope with those numbers.  A small proportion of those refugees are coming to Europe.  When the Chairman mentions looking at other alternatives, we have to look at what is a durable solution for Syrians.  The people need to find residency in the new country to which they go.  There is a need to look at the situation of asylum seekers or refugees in the other countries he mentioned.  We have to do a lot more to build solidarity with other countries but we also have to recognise that for many years other countries have borne the responsibility of this and European Union countries have not done so directly.  Lebanon and Egypt have done so.  Turkey has invested massively in providing support and assistance to more than 2 million refugees on its territory.  A small proportion are coming to the European Union and our view, as the UNHCR, is that the European Union can do an awful lot more to assist people coming to European Union countries.</p></speech>

There are other countries, including the UAE and other Arab states, that have provided funding and we are engaging very closely with those countries.  One of the purposes of today's meeting is to try to appeal to European Union countries, in the context of the discussions which are taking place today and tomorrow, to look globally at what other countries are doing but this is a defining moment for the European Union.  The European Union is based on treaties which guarantee the right of asylum.  The right of an asylum seeker or a person in need of protection to be granted entry to the European Union countries is set out in the 1951 convention and in the treaties and that right is not being guaranteed in all the European Union member states at the moment.  We are currently appealing to all European Union countries, including Ireland, to take on board those obligations and to step up at what is a crucial moment and a testing time for the European Union.</p></speech>

I have seen some information coming from other countries in regard to their intake.</p><p>We can come back to the committee with additional information on the intake in other countries, but the primary focus this week, given the crisis in the European Union, with thousands of people arriving at its borders, is on seeing how it can respond.  All partners need to step up and the Chairman is correct to say all countries in the world have a role to play.  We should promote a response that is as global as possible.  It would enhance the advocacy of the European Union <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>all member states if it could demonstrate that it was living up to all of its obligations.</p></speech>

I recall an earlier meeting with Mr. Andrews at which he referred to the Syrian crisis as the humanitarian crisis of our generation.  We have had considerable exchanges with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and when he reports on EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings, we continually raise the issue of the situation in Syria and refer to the problems in the region.  We have also asked parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il.  This is an issue we need to keep on the agenda as much as possible.  In every exchange with representatives of the United Nations we refer to the totally outdated architecture of that body and its inadequacy in dealing with such problems throughout the world and draw attention to the totally unsatisfactory situation at the Security Council and the non-implementation of resolutions.  From the point of view of my party which is, I am sure, reflective of the views of other members, we need a radical restructuring of the United Nations to reflect the current geopolitical system in the world.</p> <p>  In response to the question put by the Chairman Ms Magennis rightly said only a united European emergency response would address the current refugee migration crisis.  The Chairman also referred to the obligation of other members of the international community, be they wealthy Arab states, the United States or other countries, to play their part, which does not in any way excuse the inadequate response, to date, of the European Union.  There has to be a response from the entire international community.</p> <p>  The reference by both Mr. Andrews and Ms Magennis to the fact that the civil war in Syria is now in its fifth year paints an appalling vista of this humanitarian crisis.  More than 240,000 Syrians have been killed and 7.6 million people displaced within Syria.  Over 4 million people have had to leave the country, while approximately 12.2 million - over half of Syria's population - are in need of humanitarian assistance.  Every one of these figures points to a bleak and depressing picture and shows the international community has failed to respond to the difficulties in Syria and the attendant pressures in adjoining regions.  Mr. Andrews mentioned the need to deal with the issues at source and has, at various points, referred to the need to continue humanitarian assistance to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, countries that have huge numbers of displaced persons from Syria, as well as some from Afghanistan.  </p> <p>  The United Nations appealed for $8.4 billion to meet the needs of 18 million people in Syria and across the region, but it is my understanding that it has been totally underfunded to date.  Has the recent constant media coverage of the plight of these refugees and a greater awareness of and empathy towards the victims of the humanitarian crisis we see unfolding every day led to an improved financial response from governments, public agencies and the voluntary sector?  I compliment NGOs and their personnel who are working in these regions in the most appalling circumstances.</p><p> One of the pictures that will always be in our minds is the picture of the three year old child washed up on the shore.  One message that GOAL put out during the summer was that we do not remember that eight children a day are being killed in Syria, which is an appalling statistic.  I do not mean it only as a statistic, it is an appalling situation occurring daily in Syria.  Europe and the international community have a huge obligation to improve dramatically their response to a very difficult conflict in Syria and in adjoining regions.</p></speech>

Mr. Andrews was obviously moved by the scale of the problem.  I sense a frustration in him that the world has not responded as it should and I think everybody shares that but the movement of people on this scale is a problem the world has not had to tackle before.  We should not be terribly surprised that we are not immediately jumping to solutions.  I agree with much of what Mr. Andrews has said in regard to Syria, particularly the issue of tackling the problem at source.  Ireland can, and should, have an input through the EU and the UN.</p> <p>  There was agreement yesterday to take in 120,000 refugees into Europe.  This is a drop in the ocean in terms of addressing the real problem, yet look at how long it took to get even semi-agreement on that.  I agree that smugglers are a result of the problem and that they are not the cause.  Even if Syria was to be solved in the next number of years, the OECD said today there would be a million refugees this year and a million every year for the remainder of this decade.  Given what is happening in sub-Saharan Africa, the population growth and the ongoing wars there, there will be a flow of people into Europe over the coming years.  Given this, when Mr. Andrews talks about a durable solution, can we provide that?  If we have this ongoing debate about 120,000 people, how are we going to accommodate a million refugees a year?  Can we, should we, and would it have a destabilising effect?</p> <p> I have visited the camps on the Turkish border with Syria.  I am in awe of what Turkey has achieved, but it is destabilising Turkey.  It is destabilising Lebanon and Jordan.  All of those countries are swamped and becoming almost ungovernable at this point.  I admit and totally accept that they are taking far more than we are at the moment but, contemplating the future, can Europe provide a durable solution?  This is a major issue for the world and for Europe and is the biggest challenge we have faced since the Second World War.</p></speech>

I refer to the million migrants per year every year.  It has changed two governments already in Europe.  Will it destabilise Europe?

I also acknowledge the crews of the <i>LE Eithne</i>and the <i>LE Niamh</i>.  They have rescued over 6,300 people in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Maybe the committee should send a message of solidarity to those crews and thank them for the work they are doing.</p><p> My first experience of refugees was people fleeing the North during the Troubles.  I was young at the time but that was the largest movement of a civilian population in Europe since the Second World War.  We have experienced the significant movement of people in our lifetime.</p><p> It does not seem that long ago when we heard from GOAL on this issue when it was on the border with Turkey and there were difficulties going into Syria.  GOAL is now working with 815,000 people in the region.  It is one of the few non-governmental organisations that is actually on the ground in Syria.  I have seen some figures concerning the numbers of NGO workers killed there.  How much of a threat is there to NGO workers?  What areas does GOAL operate in?  Does it operate only in government or rebel areas or both?  What is the breakdown between Irish staff and local staff?  What size of an area would be affected by an indiscriminate barrel bomb dropped from a helicopter?</p><p> GOAL claims there is no humanitarian solution to the crisis.  Will it agree there is also no military solution to the crisis and that, realistically, the only way forward is a political solution?  States in the area have fanned the conflict but are not taking in refugees.  They have armed groups with weapons, supplied resources and training, so they also have a responsibility.  There has been a military response from some European states with calls to deal with those people travelling across the Mediterranean by bombing the fishing boats and so forth.  However, there does not seem to be the same immediacy when it comes to saving lives.</p><p> The delegation claimed there was a poor response from politicians.  Recently, there was an initiative by some Members involved with the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, where 23 organisations were invited to a meeting on this crisis.  We all accept that the public, not only in Ireland but in Europe, is way ahead on this issue and politicians are scrambling to catch up.  Several points from the AWEPA meeting were the importance of information for those coming to Ireland, that it is accurate and credible and we tie in with the good will of the people.  Does the delegation have any suggestions for mobilising that public support and holding on to it?  The danger is that one could have a tsunami or an earthquake in another part of the world which people would concentrate on then.</p><p> There is a belief that people just want to escape a war zone and then everything will be fine.  We know from GOAL&rsquo;s work that 85% of Syrian refugees live below the poverty line of $3.20 per day.  A colleague, recently returned from Jordan, saw the camps at first hand.  Outside the camps, she saw young children basically being sold off to older men.</p><p>Is there anything the UNHCR, which runs the camps, can do about that?  There were also difficulties concerning attacks on women, so perhaps Ms Magennis could outline some of the work being done about that.  Winter is approaching in these camps, so what is the plan to deal with adverse weather conditions?  </p><p> Lastly, there is the question of promised funding that has not been delivered.  Is there a name and shame list for those who commit to funding but do not deliver?  Thankfully, when Ireland gives a commitment we actually follow through on it.  I am thinking of larger states in that region, but are there particular ones that stand out by giving a funding commitment and yet not following through on it?</p></speech>

This crisis is so vast - Mr. Andrews mentioned comments made in the D&aacute;il in 2012 - that it is difficult for us, as backbenchers, to get our heads around it.  It is so vast internationally and has ramifications and implications right across the world.  I note with particular interest the reference to the inability of the United Nations to perform.  It is interesting that the Prime Minister of India, which is a huge country, is in Dublin today lobbying the Taoiseach to gain support for reform measures India would like to see in the United Nations.  One such measure is that it wants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.</p> <p>  Leaving that aside, however, it is important that we are now collectively looking at the UN and seeing its weaknesses and strengths, as well as separating the theory and practice concerning its role in the world.  Europe is trying to do something in a haphazard way.  The UN is out there somewhere in the ether, although I know there are representatives of the UNHCR here today.  However, we need a world vision in terms of what is happening.</p> <p>  I would like to ask some rather direct questions.  I would praise Ireland's wonderful record in handling programme refugees over the years.  Interestingly enough, those who are taking a very negative stance in Europe include the Hungarians.  As a child, I remember families welcoming and accommodating Hungarian refugees.  It is a pity that the Hungarian Government does not remember the Hungarian migrants and refugees.</p> <p>  Ireland has a wonderful record starting with the Hungarians.  We then had the Vietnamese boat people.  I know there are also some Rohingya people from Burma in this country as programme refugees.  We have had wonderful people from Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Kosovo.  Some have settled and integrated and have not been a problem while others have returned to their countries which they had been economically and politically forced to leave.  It is a wonderful thing to see them being settled and accommodated here, as well as being afforded the security and protection they need in the short term.  </p> <p>  Given GOAL's involvement in a particular region, are we talking today about Syrian refugees alone?  I do not want to get emotional about what is happening in the world, including three year old children dead on the beaches and where they might have started out from.  We are a small country that has made a contribution in the past.  We are continuing to make this contribution, small as it might be in the eyes of NGOs, involving between 3,000 and 5,000 people.  Are we talking about accommodating only the Syrians?  My information is that large numbers of Eritreans, Somalians, Pakistanis, Afghans, Iraqis and Libyans are also part of that movement of people.</p> <p>  As an Irish politician, therefore, I am seeking direction on how we can pick these poor, unfortunate people for refuge in Ireland.  We have heard about the situation.  For example, on RTE radio this morning, there was a vivid report from the camps in Lebanon.</p><p>Where do we extend our reach of humanity to?  Should we go to camps in Jordan and take them out of there because they have been living in misery for two or three years already?  Should we go to the Mediterranean and help the Italians because of the big influx?  Will the witnesses suggest which 4,000 or 5,000 should be the lucky ones that Ireland will accommodate over the next two years?  Is there a priority?  My heart goes out to those in the Lebanese and Jordanian camps and in the overflowing camps in Turkey and, more recently, to the hundreds of thousands who are moving up through Europe.  I would like to hear how the witnesses suggest that we, as parliamentarians and as a Government, should respond.  It is expected that this year alone there will be 3,500 applications for asylum, which are separate to the programmed refugees that we will bring in, so there will be an increase in asylum applications.  I feel a sense of hopelessness because the project is so vast.  It requires an international response.  It requires Russia, China, the United Nation in its reformed structure, the European Union, and the Arab countries, including Iran, which are key players in the conflict, and Saudi Arabia, which is another player in the conflict, to open their coffers.  We need the United Nations and all of these agencies and countries to work together to try to create a better world.  </p></speech>

The sad part is that neither the global community nor the European Union seems to be able to speak with one voice on this issue.  There are mixed messages coming from them.  The vision of children and adults crawling under razor wire to escape from something is a vivid image that will stick with many people.  When historians come to write about this in the future, they will write about it in a critical way.  History tells us that in the past those who warned of things to come were not listened to.  What Barry Andrews has said to the committee is very real and we should take it into account.  Not only should we take it into account in Ireland but the European Union and the UN should listen carefully to what has been said.  Peter Sutherland has made similar comments about the same issue in recent times.</p> <p>  I do not understand why the UN has not established positions to support the camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, to show what it can do.  The authorities there will accept that support.  I do not understand why the UN has not done it.  It is fine to appeal for aid and to do good.  When people do good everyone supports it but when people do evil, and in the course of it create further evil, nobody seems to be able to stand up and confront it in a meaningful way.  </p> <p>  I have already referred to mixed messages coming from other European countries.  I do not understand why countries have such a short memory.  Things that have happened before invariably happen again; history repeats itself all the time.  What I worry about most of all is the unfortunate people who are forced into boats, who are drowning on the shores with their children, who are being shot, harassed and faced with razor wire, baton charges and CS gas and all the other things, will remember in the future how they were treated when they were vulnerable.  The UN stands challenged now and has to account for itself.  So too does the European Union.  </p> <p>  There are lessons to be learnt.  Interfering with sovereign states in the future should be a no-go area regardless of what evidence exists.  The lid has been lifted off a situation that will trundle on unless there is a positive intervention of a serious nature.</p><p> I spoke on this subject at the security and defence meeting in Luxembourg a couple of weeks ago which was attended by High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Mogherini.  I cannot understand the reason the traffickers have been allowed to drive the situation and are in control.  They are feeding into what is happening.  The rest of the EU is trying to respond.  It would have been simple to establish bridgeheads in the various locations to administer to the refugees, setting out a safe haven for the refugees before they would come across Europe.  That would eliminate the need for razor wire and the treatment of refugees in that way.  High Representative Ms Mogherini did not agree with my views, but my honest opinion is that the European Union has failed.  As time goes by I think the resentment will grow, the humanitarian extent of the problem will grow and the disaster will grow.  I cannot understand the reason the European Union and the United Nations cannot come together and do the sensible thing and take control of the situation.</p></speech>

They paint a grim picture, which we have become accustomed to seeing on our televisions over an extended period.</p> <p>  The significant decision made at European level yesterday is to be welcomed.  While it is regrettable that not all countries bought into the process and will participate, the onus is on every country in the European Union to shoulder its responsibility and to work to alleviate the pressures on countries which are literally overrun by people fleeing war torn parts of the world.  I have no doubt that countries, our own included, will knuckle down and respond generously and that Government and the various agencies will do a good job in accommodating the 4,000 people we will take.  As others have said it is only the tip of the iceberg and that the problem will run for years.</p> <p>  Mr. Barry Andrews rightly highlighted the very significant issue of the lack of action by the United Nations.  This is a major world crisis but who is pulling all the world leaders together to see what can be done.  We hear that G8, G7 and G12 members come together on a regular basis to discuss issues of world significance but I am deeply concerned that nobody seems to be grasping the nettle on this issue and pulling together all the interested parties who can play a key role in solving this major world crisis.  There is no urgency in dealing with this crisis.</p> <p>  The barrel bombing in Syria has resulted in innocent children and others being killed on a daily basis.  A stop can be put to that if there is the political will in some of the world powers to intervene and put a stop to it.  As Barry Andrews said earlier, we need to have much more discussion in the national parliaments throughout the European Union.  We need to keep the pressure on the European Union, the United Nations, the superpowers and those who are playing a significant role in providing the armaments and the weaponry that is causing so much destruction.  I would like to see world leaders calling an emergency summit to fasttrack significant actions that can put a stop to some of the conflict in these regions.  I am sure that many hundreds of thousands of the Syrians who are pouring out of their country want to remain in Syria and have their children educated there.  They do not want to put their lives at risk by coming to Europe.  With the onset of winter they will face a very uncertain future.</p><p>There is an urgency about this that politicians, at all levels, must grasp.  We criticise everybody from time to time, but Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe paid tribute to members of the Naval Service who have done such good work on <i>LE Niamh</i>in rescuing people in the Mediterranean.  We also have to think of all those working with NGOs who are putting their lives at risk every day to bring humanitarian aid to the victims of war.  There is an onus on us to support the people concerned by doing everything we can to bring about a political solution and an end to conflict, but this can only be done by the world's most powerful leaders in coming together in emergency session to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

I did get the papers, but I am sorry I was not here to hear the presentations.  </p> <p>  I join others in complimenting the delegates on the work they are doing in dealing with what is probably the greatest humanitarian crisis for some 70 years.  Given the numbers turning up in Europe, how do they think we can best distinguish between genuine refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants who take huge risks to get to the borders of Europe, which is something which needs to be discouraged?  How do the delegates think we can do this?  In opening the doors we may, to some extent, accelerate the numbers coming across the Mediterranean, leading to more and more tragedies to add to the ones we have already seen.  Is there a better approach, perhaps in line with Mr. David Cameron's suggestion that Britain take refugees from camps in neighbouring countries?  </p> <p>  Many members of the committee have been to Lebanon and Jordan in the past few years and seen the refugee camps and the horrendous conditions in which people live.  I was struck more by the plight of Palestinians.  It is shame on the international community and the United Nations that Palestinian camps have been in existence since 1948.  People have been living in these camps for that length of time in wholly unsuitable bombed and shelled buildings which would be classified here as dangerous.  They would be secured, lest people were injured, but people are actually living in such accommodation.  This highlights the inadequacies of the international community when it comes to addressing these situations.  Would it be better to try to relieve some of the camps in countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and, in particular, Jordan, the stability and future viability of which are threatened by the influx of migrants?</p> <p>  My third question might perhaps be for the United Nations, but it involves an idea which others believe might have some merit.  I do not understand why a secure and sanitised area, free from conflict, within Syria cannot be created by an international peacekeeping force, in which there would be well serviced and well managed refugee camps.  This would at least cater for Syrian people within the confines of their own borders and ensure that, until such time as the conflict came to an end, there would be humanitarian aid and security.  It would also mean that they would be more likely to go back into the communities of Syria.  This point has been made by a number of leaders.  </p> <p>  I have attended a couple of international conferences in the past three weeks, at one of which I had lunch with the Patriarch of Antioch.</p><p>He echoed what some of those leaders said that many of the young, strong and fit people in Syria, who are well educated, were leaving to go elsewhere and would probably never return home.  Appeals have been made for them to stay because in the post-conflict era, Syria will need to be rebuilt.  To some extent, the diversity and pluralism which we value will not be evident in countries like Syria and maybe Iraq because of the persecution of Christians being forced to leave.  Can the delegation provide suggestions or solutions for same?  </p><p> To what extent does GOAL consider the risk posed by Daish terrorists infiltrating the ranks of refugees being a problem for Europe and elsewhere in the future?  Obviously, if that situation comes to pass, then public opinion will change dramatically.  We should try to prevent that from happening and now is the time to do so.  What assessment or monitoring procedures need to be put in place to ensure a problem does not arise?  Anecdotally, the Gulf States, as the delegation will know, are not taking refugees.  It has been stated that they are not taking them because to do so would pose a risk to the stability of their counties in the future.  Security is an issue.  Daish has said that 1,000 jihadists have deliberately left Syria as part of the exodus.  I would welcome the delegates comments on that issue, which might be better informed than mine.</p></speech>

The refugee crisis stems from a complete lack of respect and disrespect for human rights in countries, whether Syria, Yemen or Eritrea.  Unless we grapple with the human rights issues, then we will have another Syria and other situations will develop in the future.</p> <p>  I refer to children who arrive unaccompanied or end up unaccompanied because they are particularly vulnerable.  Have the delegates met many of these children who are a target for traffickers?  </p> <p>  I refer to the barrel bomb issue and Syria.  Why can there not be political agreement reached on the issue because it is causing so many deaths and injuries?  I was part of a group that visited the Turkish-Syrian border with GOAL.  The Syrian people we met on that occasion told us they wanted to return home.  I was very conscious of how they held on to their culture and language.  They had their own teachers and medical people.  They wanted to create a Syrian society but the big question is, when will that happen?</p> <p>  As has been mentioned, unless a political solution is found, the crisis will continue and there will be more crises.  There are people who have become refugees again.  I refer to people who went to Syria as refugees and now they must leave Syria.  </p> <p>  Following on from the point made Senator Walsh, we are appalled when a European country says it will not accept refugees but the Gulf States and the Emirates can do so and get away with not contributing.  Are they contributing in any way to easing the plight of refugees?</p></speech>

I happened to be in Italy last year when High Commissioner Mogherini announced that Operation Mare Nostrum would be abandoned.  My first response was that she should resign because she had condemned to death all of those people who were going to make that journey and that is exactly what happened.  The European Union's response so far has been appalling, to put it mildly.  Emergency meetings have taken two weeks to convene, which is not anyone's definition of an emergency.  We have seen barrel bombing and heard about the red line in regard to the gas attacks in Syria but they have led to the refugees ending up in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.</p><p> I know personnel who are working on the very intricate system of biometric payments to refugees all over the Middle East who are from Syria.  I have read reports - our guests have confirmed this - that in some instances the money for those people in refugee camps has been stopped - in certain cases in the past couple of weeks.  This is basically forcing people to travel to Europe.  Mr. Andrews may already have supplied an answer to this question during his presentation but what is the cost of looking after Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey?  What is the cost of looking after that same refugee in Europe?  I presume it is ten times greater.  If European powers and countries do not want to do it - and apparently they do not want to look after these refugees - for compassionate and humanitarian reasons, they might do it because of the purely economic argument that it is easier and cheaper to look after them in the displacement camps on the borders of Syria than it is to look at the scenes we are seeing on our TV screens.  This is only a crisis for Europe because it is not on our doorstep; it is now inside the borders of Europe.  It is simply an economic argument because Europe, as we know, does not really care about a humanitarian crisis.  It is only because it is now a political crisis in Europe.</p></speech>

There is a strong chance that the situation in Syria will get worse.  There have been some minor changes in the complexion of the conflict that could see millions of people moving over the border.  Mr. Edgar was in Turkey and Greece recently and was able to identify the people who are leaving Syria, going straight to Greece and trying to get straight through Turkey.  They are not stopping there anymore.  They never wanted to come to Europe and I think Ms Magennis agreed with me on this.  That has been very well documented at this stage.  They have been gathering on that border for four years and had it been about pull factors, they would have left a long time ago but they love their country, have ambitions for it and want to go back to networks of family and property and their home, which is something we all take for granted but which is a very powerful thing and that is what they wanted to do.  They are real refugees.  They are fleeing persecution.  They have a well-grounded fear of persecution so under our obligations under UN membership and the Geneva Convention, we must offer asylum to people who are genuine refugees in those circumstances.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Crowe, our operations are in north-western Syria.  We will reach 850,000 people this year through our programmes.  It is the largest operation in our history.  No Irish people go over the border.  We have 650 Syrian staff but no international individuals go over the border now.  They operate out of Turkey in terms of remote management with the support of our donors.  It is effective up to a point but the Chairman and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan will recall that when we went there in February, we visited an orphanage where we met children.  I referred to one of them in my paper.  Many of those children experienced incredible trauma and some of them had not regained the power of speech at the age of three or four as a result of that trauma.  The GOAL staff we were with were Syrians.  They introduced us to these children and were themselves very moved by the testimony of the workers in the orphanage.  That is the reality and Deputy Smith made reference to the fact that eight children per day were killed in May.  Another incident occurred in the Mediterranean a week ago where 15 children were drowned, so this is now a daily reality.  As we sit here today, more people are getting on to boats.  There are people in the middle of the Mediterranean.  This is happening right now and it has the potential to get much worse.</p> <p>  I will now deal quickly with a couple of the questions that were posed.</p><p>I have referred to the effect of the barrel bombs in the paper.  We call them indiscriminate but they are not really indiscriminate; that would suggest that civilians are collateral to some military objective but the civilians are the target.  The Assad government has chosen to terrorise civilians into submission through the bombing of market places, bakeries, hospitals, schools and all sorts of civilian infrastructure.  It is quite discriminate and the effect of it is unbelievable.  That is why GOAL has reluctantly been one of a number of NGOs calling for a no-fly zone to take them out of the air and to decommission the bombs.  That is very much a measure of last resort in circumstances where there is absolutely no other political initiative.  If there was, it could be left to exhaust itself to see if it could come to some conclusion but there is none.  It is a measure of absolute last resort.  Will a military intervention solve it?  No.  Could it be a component or a threat that would bring other belligerents to their senses?  It has to be enforced in some way.  If there is going to be a safe area to protect civilians and guarantee access of humanitarian aid, that is something that has been done in the past but always in parallel with a political initiative.    </p><p> Syria, Iraq and Eritrea are the source of the refugees who will come here under the programme but any other refugee who qualifies under the criteria of the Geneva Convention is entitled to asylum in this country because Ireland has signed it.</p><p> Senator Walsh raised the issue of ISIS infiltrating the refugee movements.  That statement has come from ISIS, which is a terrorist organisation and is deliberately trying to generate fear.  In June, the EU anti-terrorism chief said that 4,000 Europeans had joined ISIS so if 1,000 are coming back, there is an issue in Europe that has to be tackled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sophie Magennis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015092300002#R00200"><p>Much was raised in questions and comments by members.  A common theme was very heavy criticism of the lack of global leadership, of the United Nations and of the Security Council and of the failure to act.  There has been a lot of criticism of the global and European response.  When the High Commissioner for Refugees came to Ireland in 2012, he spoke many times about the lack of a coherent global governance framework.  I am the head of office with the UNHCR in Ireland.  It is not my role to defend the United Nations.  The criticisms that have been made today are valid.  What we have been trying to do at the level of the High Commissioner and also the United Nations Secretary General is to see what solutions and ideas there might be.  We are at a stage where there does not seem to be a possibility of political consensus in the Security Council to try to address what is happening in terms of conflicts in the world.  We hope that there will be some movement on that but we are in the hands of the member states when it comes to political leadership in solving these problems.  We hope that should Ireland take a seat on the Security Council in future years, or through its influence there, it will seek to advance the kind of reforms that are necessary.  The criticisms are valid but I would appreciate an opportunity today to look at what Irish parliamentarians and the Irish State can do to try to do something constructive in the midst of all of this mayhem and lack of global leadership, because children and vulnerable people are suffering and there are things that can be done.</p> <p>  I want to address some of the specific questions raised by members.</p><p>Deputy Durkan asked some questions on what was happening in Turkey and Lebanon.  The UNHCR is on the ground in Turkey and is working directly with the Turkish authorities to provide support to the refugees who are there.  The Turkish authorities have spent nearly $5 billion in providing support to refugees and our colleagues are involved in registering refugees and providing all the assistance we can provide.  Our colleagues are also in Lebanon.  A couple of Irish people working with the UNHCR are in the field providing support in the shape of access to medical care, access to funds and, where possible, education.  However, we simply cannot cope with the numbers and more support needs to be given by other states where Syrian nationals on the ground do not amount to one in four of its population.</p><p> There were a couple of questions about how the resettlement and relocation programmes would work, particularly from Deputy Eric Byrne.  Ireland will take 520 refugees on resettlement before the end of 2016 and those refugees will come from Jordan and Lebanon.  The UNHCR will register refugees in the area by looking at their vulnerability and their needs and we will then recommend them to countries for resettlement.  Ireland has a long-standing history of being one of a very small number of resettlement countries and we refer vulnerable cases, such as families and medical cases, here.  The Irish authorities come out to meet the refugees in the camps and they then come to Ireland.  I have met with some of the recent intake here.  It would be very helpful if parliamentarians could assist in raising awareness about these programmes and why people are coming here so that we can assist with their integration into Ireland.  We would be happy to provide more information about these programmes for this purpose.</p><p> A question was asked about the relocation of the 4,000 who will be coming to Ireland this year and next year.  These are asylum seekers who have come into the European Union seeking protection.  Nationalities that have 75% refugee recognition rate will be eligible for relocation.  This will mean that nationalities who, when assessed for refugee protection within the European Union, have a very high rate of being recognised as refugees will be eligible for the relocation programme.  In practice, this means Syrian and Eritrean refugees.  They will be selected in Italy and Greece and invited to Ireland.  It is likely they will come into the State in groups of 100 every three months or so.  </p><p> As regards national preparations, the Minister for Justice and Equality has established a task force and, while this veers into the domestic domain, there is a foreign affairs element to this and a member of the Department of Foreign Affairs sits on the task force. The task force co-ordinates all the arrangements in Ireland for the arrival of the 4,000 relocated asylum seekers, their speedy assessment as refugees and their accommodation within the country.  </p><p> Senator Walsh asked about the issue of security assessment, which is crucial and is a big risk factor for the UNHCR when we undertake resettlement or relocation arrangements.  We have to be very careful about how these procedures are rolled out so they are all conducted in close collaboration with the garda&iacute; and with FRONTEX.  Security screening happens both pre-departure and on arrival and exclusion assessments are also conducted to make sure anybody who may have involved in conflict or war crimes is not included in an intake.   I can assure the Senator on those points.</p><p> Deputy Mitchell raised the issue of what the European Union could do.  These are global problems and not for Germany alone to solve through the excellent leadership the Chancellor has provided nor is it for the European Union alone, as a bloc, to provide a solution.  However, the European Union is uniquely placed at the moment to provide an example.  The UNHCR advocates with other African and Asian countries and appeals to them to keep their borders open, to admit people who need protection and to provide humanitarian assistance.</p><p>This is also something the Irish authorities, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade among others, will be involved in when there is a conflict.  We appeal to countries to keep their borders open, to admit people who need protection and to provide humanitarian assistance.</p><p> Irish Aid has an excellent programme that provides assistance and aid to people.  We appeal to nations in other very poor, very unstable parts of the world to assist.  We would appeal now to the European Union and to countries like Ireland, and parliamentarians like the members, to be part of mapping out solutions and ideas to see how we can positively respond to this crisis.  If the European Union can provide a positive example, starting off today with the leaders' decision on the relocation programme, we are then in a stronger position to advance our advocacy.</p><p> Also within the European Union, solidarity should be demonstrated with countries in the south such as Italy, Greece and Malta, where there has been some solidarity extended, particularly by the Irish Naval Service and Defence Forces, which have done wonderful work in the Mediterranean.  These are good examples that can be built on.</p></speech>

Mr. Andrews and Ms Magennis have asked what we can do.  While there will be a formal invitation from the Minister for Justice and Equality next week to get permission in respect of the numbers, I propose that we write to the Government and Opposition Whips to request a broader debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber on the migrant and refugee crisis.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We should set aside a substantial amount of time for Members to air their views on this and to get both Opposition and Government responses.</p> <p>  I have a vivid memory of a young boy we met in the Syrian orphanage.  Both Deputy O'Sullivan and myself met him.  He was almost lifeless and, as Mr. Andrews said, he went through terrible trauma.  Obviously the children were being well looked after by the caretakers in the refugee camp.  He left me with a memory of what can happen.  A father with his wife and two children were fleeing the city of Aleppo and they ran in to a barrel bomb.  The father and daughter were blown to bits, the mother survived and the little boy was found two days later in the branches of a tree.  He never spoke for a number of weeks after the incident.  He was coming around in that refugee camp but I still remember hugging that child and how almost lifeless he was.  Hopefully he is doing better in the tender loving care of the carers in that refugee centre.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming before us this morning.  We will keep in touch with them both to stay updated on what is happening.  We will certainly keep this issue to the forefront of our agenda as things develop.  We look forward to having a debate in the Chamber on the crisis.</p></speech>

Observing that the procedures to identify and appoint the best candidate for UN Secretary-General should be in line with the best practices in high-level appointments of executive heads of the United Nations and other international organizations; <br /><br />Emphasizing that in order to ensure capable and effective leadership at the highest levels of the UN Secretariat, candidates for Secretary-General must not be under pressure to appoint individuals of any particular nationality to the Secretariat in exchange for political support; Urge you, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan T.D. to: 1. Ensure that the government of Ireland only nominates or supports the nomination and election of the most-qualified candidates for the position of the UN Secretary-General, based on the criteria above and with due regard to gender equality and geographic balance; <br /><br />2. Support, without prejudice to the role of the principal organs enshrined in Article 97 of the Charter, improvements to the selection process to make it fair, open, inclusive and geared to producing the best-qualified candidates, including:  A public call for nominations; <br /><br /> A timetable for the selection process with clear deadlines, to be published no later than the start of the General Assembly&rsquo;s 70th session; <br /><br /> A list of all official candidates and their relevant experience and qualifications to be published by the President of the General Assembly at the end of the nomination phase, and by the Security Council when considering its shortlist; <br /><br /> Regular updates on progress to be delivered by the Presidents of the General Assembly and Security Council; <br /><br /> The organisation by the General Assembly of open hearings with candidates, with a role for civil society and the media, to enhance transparency and inclusivity; <br /><br /> The presentation by the Security Council of two or more candidates for the General Assembly to consider; <br /><br /> The appointment to be made by a two-thirds majority of member states present and voting by secret ballot, unless it is the wish of the General Assembly to make the appointment by acclamation. 3. Call for the appointment to be made for a seven-year, non-renewable term, upon consideration of a single term of appointment, as suggested by UN General Assembly resolution 51/241 (1997) on &quot;Strengthening of the United Nations system. </blockquote> <p>I refer to a campaign organised by Parliamentarians for Global Action of which body some of those present are members.  Effectively, the motion seeks to ensure that there is more transparency in the selection of the Secretary General.  We have been fortunate in having very many good Secretaries General of the United Nations, but the existing UN General Assembly has passed resolutions on the selection and appointment of the Secretary General - 51/241 (1997), 60/286 (2006) and 68/307, and they all call for improvements to the appointments process, but have not yet been implemented, although a new appointment is now imminent.</p><p>What we are really pushing for is implementation of these resolutions as part of the process for the next election.  The campaign is called 1 for 7 Billion and sets out criteria that should be satisfied during the process to ensure the United Nations has the right leadership.  We have heard today that there are more challenges every day for the United Nations to rise to and I think its leadership is crucial to how successful it will be in that regard.  The motion should be uncontroversial and I hope it will receive a lot of support.</p></speech>

While I would approach it in a very positive way, it has not really come up as an issue at this committee.  I have no problem if the Senator wants to take it today, but I would prefer if, at some stage, the committee could invite speakers to outline the background and give an overview of related doubts to get a sense of what it is we are actually voting on rather than pass the motion today.  I would like it to be part of a discussion and an approach that we are actually going to take.  That would be helpful.</p></speech>

I deal with a small group of international parliamentarians and we have met and discussed this issue with a number of ambassadors of various countries to the United Nations.  They were very supportive of the idea because they see the need to have resolutions passed by the assembly implemented, adopted and dealt with.  The suggestion made by Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe will add strength in having the issue ventilated.  Perhaps the motion might then be passed on to Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

Before calling the Senator, I remind members that I will report on my visit to Egypt later in the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015092300002#U00900"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That this committee send a delegation to Egypt to be present at the upcoming trial of Ibrahim Halawa on October 4th.</blockquote> <p>I have read the Chairman&rsquo;s very comprehensive report.  We discussed this issue before the summer during which it was highlighted by the Chairman&rsquo;s visit and his meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Egypt.  There are outstanding issues such as clarification of the charges Mr. Halawa is facing.  The Chairman has spoken on radio about seeking clarification from the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior and he might clarify this when he gives his report to the committee.</p><p>I believe some members are considering travelling to Egypt for the trial on 4 October and it is important that we have a delegation present.  It may not be the final court hearing, but I understand Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe is to propose that those who do travel give evidence to the committee on the current situation, especially on the serious charges faced.  We believe and Mr. Halawa&rsquo;s legal team is of the opinion that he is still facing the death sentence, but the information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is that he is not and that the charges have been reduced.</p><p>To assist any member who wishes to travel for the trial in October trial and visit Ibrahim in prison, I will relate my own experience.  When I requested assistance in securing a visa and access to the prison, I was told by our ambassador in Egypt that it was a matter for the Egyptian ambassador.</p><p>When I sent the reply to the Egyptian ambassador, I was told by him that it is a matter for the Irish ambassador in Egypt.   Correspondence went over and back for two weeks but I still do not have the answer.  Even if the committee, its secretariat and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assisted members who wish to go out by securing access, it would be of great assistance.</p></speech>

As I stated last night, I had a previous commitment that lasted much longer than I had anticipated.</p> <p>  I see some merit in what Senator Daly is proposing, for two reasons.  First and foremost, it underlies our concern for an Irish citizen.  It would send a positive signal to many people who are Irish citizens by choice, as distinct from birth, that every citizen of this Republic is being treated equally in terms of the concerns of this Parliament.</p></speech>

It represents a good idea.  It sends a signal to the Egyptian authorities that this House is very concerned over this trial, which I regard as a show trial.  My colleague, Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, had written to the committee and, along with the Chairman, asked for an updated report.  She was shocked by the conditions in the prison and by what Mr. Halawa was experiencing.  Mr. Halawa is two years in the prison.  What he has gone through must be traumatic.  What is proposed would be a very positive step and send the right signal to regimes that arrest Irish citizens that this House is very concerned.</p></speech>

There are so many examples of the trial being postponed.  I do not see the merit in going for a trial that we are not sure is going to happen.  Therefore, there should be other aspects to the visit if we agree to go ahead with it.</p></speech>

It would be important for continuity given that he has been to Egypt and has already spoken to the individual.</p></speech>

If a delegation were to visit, is there any indication that it would be allowed to attend the trial?  It would be significant to know that in advance.  What is the possibility of a further postponement?  Is it possible to obtain, through our embassy, clarification on the process that would obtain on arrival in Egypt?</p></speech>

It is important to ascertain from the authorities beforehand the likely reaction to the appearance of a delegation at the trial.  In some jurisdictions, it is resented by the Judiciary, while it is not resented in others.  I was involved in a few such cases in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.  We were lucky in the sense that the legal profession did not resent the appearance of a delegation.  We were successful in what we were trying to do in all cases, but I strongly urge that in the case of a delegation going to Egypt, we ascertain from the Egyptian authorities in advance their likely reaction so we will know the position before we start.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.  While it would be helpful for him to lead the delegation, he has already gone out to Egypt and has been of great assistance.  I would not wish to impose on him a requirement to go again.  The presence of other members would be of equal importance.  It is important that a delegation go.  It would be beneficial for the Chairman to lead it, but I believe he has done a lot on this issue already by facilitating a discussion by the committee and making a personal visit in the middle of the summer during his holidays while other people were off.  He made a considerable commitment and represented the people of Ireland on the trip.  Therefore, I do not necessarily believe we have to decide now who should go, rather we should agree to the principle of sending a delegation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015092300002#W00100"><p>I will respond to that.  We will go through the report more thoroughly later on.  The situation in Egypt is very challenging.  There is a very dysfunctional legal system there.  We must make that quite clear.  When we asked previously if a delegation could travel out to see Ibrahim Halawa we were refused but eventually they came up with a solution that the Chairman would go.</p> <p>  It is not our role as a committee to attend trials of people abroad but, having said that, the Ibrahim Halawa case is unique.  He is a young man.  There is no guarantee that anybody could get into the courtroom.  This place is located an hour and a half outside Cairo.  The court case could be over in five or ten minutes and we might not get to see him.  We need to be careful about this.  The idea, in principle, is a good one.  It keeps the committee focused.  It keeps a focus on Ibrahim Halawa's case.  There is no point in a delegation going out to Egypt if they do not get to attend the trial or see Ibrahim Halawa.  They are the two reasons.  We need to get more advice on this from the Department and we need permission from the Egyptian Embassy or the interior Ministry to attend the trial.  When Lynn Boylan went out the last time she did not get to attend the trial.  We need to be careful and to examine the possibilities of a visit.  We do not know what will happen.  We do not know what the charges are against Ibrahim Halawa.  We have a fair idea of the process but we do not know what the charges are.  If the witnesses do not turn up the case could be postponed again.  We need to make more concrete inquiries about attending the trial before we decide on that and maybe we can decide next week.</p></speech>

We will get feedback next week from the Egyptian authorities as to whether members will be allowed to attend the trial and to visit Ibrahim.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that it is important that members of the committee meet him and that the foreign affairs committee agree in principle to send a delegation on the understanding that it will have access to the court and to Ibrahim in jail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015092300002#W00300"><p>That makes sense.  There is no point in going out if the delegation will not see him or go to the court case.  It is chaotic there because there are up to 400 people being tried at the same time and all their families are there so the delegation probably will not get in.  Even the officials from Cairo find it hard at times to get into the court case.  We need to make inquiries about this to both the Egyptian and Irish authorities and to take a sensible approach while at the same time continuing to highlight Ibrahim Halawa's case.  Is that okay?  Can we leave it until next week?</p></speech>

I remind everybody to turn off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the sound system.</p><p>We are pleased to welcome from the Department of Health: Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General; Ms Frances Spillane, assistant secretary; and Ms Grainne Duffy, principal officer.  They are here today to update the committee on progress on the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant.  Members will be aware that these issues were initially brought to the committee through special reports under section 4 of the Ombudsman Act 1980 by the then Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  The committee held a number of meetings on both topics, which culminated in the cessation of any new applications for the mobility allowance.  The current recipients continue to receive their allowance, although applications for new allowances have been closed since 26 February 2013.  On 2 July 2014, Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, former Secretary General of the Department of Health, met with this committee and advised that the Department was working on the drafting of a new scheme.  Mr. Breslin is here today to apprise members on the latest developments in regard to the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant.</p><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for forwarding their presentation, which has been circulated to the members.  Before commencing, I must inform you that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you give to this committee.  However, if you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Breslin to make his presentation.  This will be followed by a question and answer session with the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.177" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#G00300"><p>This is my first appearance before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, and I am happy to be invited by the committee.  I am aware of the committee's continuing interest in the issues which have arisen with the mobility allowance.</p><p>I hope to update the committee on the progress under way in developing new legislative proposals.  The committee is very familiar with the circumstances around the closure of the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant schemes.  By way of reminder, I will only provide a short synopsis to put today's discussions in context.  I will then speak about developments under way, after which I will be very happy to answer questions.</p><p> The mobility allowance was established in 1979 as an administrative scheme by way of departmental circular.  The mobility allowance was payable by the HSE and previously by the health boards, subject to a means test, to persons with a severe disability who were between 16 and 65 years old and unable to walk or use public transport.  The monthly full rate of mobility allowance was &euro;280.50.  At the time the scheme was closed, there were 4,700 recipients, at an annual cost of &euro;9.3 million.  Since the closure of the scheme, the Government has directed that the HSE should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment to these 4,700 individuals pending the establishment of a new transport support scheme.</p><p> The motorised transport grant was established in 1968 and was also an administrative scheme.  It operated as a means-tested grant to assist a person with a severe disability with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum grant was &euro;5,020, payable once to an individual in any three-year period.  In recent years, more than 300 people received the grant each year, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.3 million per annum.  As the committee is aware and as the Chairman has just said, the Government decided to close the motorised transport grant scheme in February 2013 and no further grants have been payable since that date.  However, it is important to note that the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in the governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p><p> In 2012, the then Ombudsman recommended that the Department of Health revise both schemes to make them compliant with the Equal Status Act by removing the upper age limit and using a broader definition of disability in respect of eligibility for both schemes.  These recommendations raised significant issues of a legal, financial and practical nature, particularly as regards extending eligibility to a significantly wider cohort.  With continuing pressure on public expenditure, including the health budget, the Government came to the conclusion that such an extension of either scheme would have implications for the protection of front-line health services and would be unsustainable.  A review group on transport support for people with disabilities and, subsequently, an interdepartmental group were established, with the interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  On foot of the interdepartmental group's work, the Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health in consultation with other relevant Ministers.  In making the decision to establish a new scheme, the Government's focus has been on those in most need who have least resources available to them.</p><p> In line with the Government decision, the Department of Health has been working to develop policy proposals for a new transport support scheme.  These proposals seek to ensure that there is a firm statutory basis to the scheme's operation, addressing one of the critical findings against the existing schemes, which were purely administrative.  There is a transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the scheme, resources are targeted at those with greatest needs, the scheme is capable of being costed and it is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p> Following detailed policy analysis, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, provided policy guidance to officials which has allowed for the drafting of a general scheme and heads of Bill for the new transport support scheme.  This general scheme and heads of Bill has now been completed in draft form and it is currently subject to detailed legal examination.  This is a very important stage, given the complex legal issues which have arisen in the operation of previous arrangements.  The proposals will also be the subject of consultation with other relevant Departments, in particular the Department of Social Protection, which was previously identified as having a potential role in the issue of payments under a new scheme.  In finalising proposals, it will also be necessary to estimate both the numbers likely to qualify for the payment and the likely overall cost, as well as securing the necessary funding in the event that additional costs arise.</p><p> The clear instruction from the Government is that eligibility criteria for the transport support scheme must focus on those with the greatest need and who have least resources available to them.  The position as articulated in the Ombudsman's reports about the inequitable nature of the abolished schemes remains valid and must be addressed under any new arrangements.</p><p>However, to make the eligibility criteria for the scheme very broad, opening up newer categories of eligibility, the effects of which are difficult to estimate, would carry major budgetary implications.  Competing demands within the disability budget and elsewhere must be considered - for example, issues such as therapies for children, day services for young adults leaving school and the need to improve other supports for people with a disability.  Therefore, the focus in the Department has been very much on the identification of appropriate criteria which will benefit those facing the greatest challenges while taking account of the group that has continued to receive the payment and which, it must be acknowledged, has come to rely on that payment.</p><p> These considerations continue to be at the centre of the Department's efforts to find a solution which is fair, financially affordable and legally sound.  The real needs in this area are recognised.  If one takes the case of an individual who uses a large customised wheelchair which cannot be accommodated on public transport and if that individual is not in a position to easily transfer to a standard seat in a car, it is acknowledged there is a real issue of cost attaching to that person's transport.  In addition, if this individual is in receipt of a low income, such costs could restrict his or her access to transport and participation in important activities.</p><p> An added issue to be addressed is the treatment of the 4,700 people currently in receipt of payment under the previous mobility scheme.  As mentioned, payments continue to be made to this group on an interim basis in order to prevent hardship and allow time to deal with the complex issues which have arisen through no fault of recipients.  This is important in alleviating stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.  Whatever criteria are settled on for the new scheme, we will also seek to address the needs of current recipients.  Again, this adds complexity to the definition of eligibility criteria from a legal and drafting perspective, but the proposal to be put to Government will seek to take account of this group.</p><p> The proposals will also provide for a transparent and objective appeals process which will deal fairly and sensitively with applicants.  In the coming weeks, we plan to submit the draft general scheme to the Government, once the legal examination and consultation with other relevant Departments are complete.  It will be a matter for Government to determine the precise policy which will underpin the general scheme to be published.  I cannot pre-empt the outcome of these considerations.  The approval of a general scheme and heads of Bill by the Government will be followed by publication and pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</p><p> While I am limited in regard to how precise I can be on the nature of the final proposals in advance of their determination by Government, I assure members of the priority attaching to this issue.  Delivering on the objective of finalising appropriate and equitable criteria for the new scheme while taking account of the group that continues to receive payment has been demanding.  It has been subject to considerable input across Government.  I believe the current year has seen considerable progress achieved in the Department in developing detailed and concrete proposals which will now be subject to wider scrutiny.</p><p> I would also like to reassure the committee that the Department has stayed in touch with the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, on this matter and I envisage updating him shortly on developments.  The review group and interdepartmental group were also assisted to a considerable extent by the National Disability Authority, which I have been assured remains available to assist as and when required.  </p><p> In summary, the Department is working to develop a solution which will meet the aim of contributing towards the cost of the transport and mobility needs of those in greatest need and those with the least resources, within whatever funding level is available.  There is an unusual degree of complexity attaching to the issues.  I fully acknowledge the protracted period since the problems with the mobility scheme were first highlighted and I fully acknowledge the period since the committee first raised the issue with the Department.  However, I believe significant progress has now been achieved.  I look forward to completion of this work shortly.  This will allow the Minister to bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks and for the process of Oireachtas scrutiny to commence.  Thank you.</p></speech>

I am deeply alarmed that it is over a year since we met the previous Secretary General in private session.  The briefing we have received today is not hugely different from the briefing we received then - a year further on - on the issue of the rights of people with disabilities across the State.  Recently, I heard the phrase "a circular filing cabinet" in regard to governance.</p><p>Something goes in and it comes round and round again but does not get addressed.  I ask for an explanation.  For people watching today and for people with disabilities, who have a profound concern about this issue and who have been before our committee and given evidence, how can we justify a period of more than a year, with essentially the same assurances that this is being prioritised?  In his presentation today, Mr. Breslin assures us that this is being given priority.  How can we genuinely say that?  More than one year on, we still have not drafted a scheme, in consultation with disability representative groups, that deals with the issues raised by the Ombudsman.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

We have completed a set of policy options in that interim period.  We have outlined them and we have engaged with the Minister of State to try to refine them.  We have now turned them into a draft general scheme and heads of Bill.  That was the work that was ahead of the process when the former Secretary General last appeared.  We are now at the stage where we have completed that as a Department and we are engaged with the relevant legal experts and other Departments.  We hope to complete that process and go to Government in the coming weeks.  I would have preferred to be here saying we have published the general scheme and that it is before the Oireachtas, but I believe and am committed to achieving that in the coming weeks, which would be a substantive achievement at that stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#K00700"><p>I listened to the contributions and I remember being here when we heard from the Ombudsman in 2013 and the Minister thereafter when the scheme was suspended.  As I remember it at the time, we were told that it would take a number of months, possibly until June 2013, to have a replacement scheme in operation.  Given the complexity of the issue, I presume the time has been usefully spent, but to date we do not have any product by which we can measure that.  I hope it will happen very soon.  However, I understand that it will then have to go through the process already outlined.  Heads of a Bill will be presented to Cabinet and then published.  This committee will then go through the new pre-legislative stage.  I dealt with another piece of quite complex legislation, the Gender Recognition Bill, which was substantially changed after that process.  I would not say it was delayed, because I think it was a better Bill afterwards, but the process took nearly two years, if not more, from gestation.  That is my concern.  Even with the publication of the heads of a Bill, we could be two years away from a scheme being put in place to address the needs of those who previously would have got the two grants.</p> <p>  Has an exceptional needs payment been set aside in the meantime?  There has been a saving to the Department since 2013 because the scheme was suspended for new applicants and I presume some people have died.  There would, therefore, have been a saving for the Department of Health.  Is that money ring-fenced?  There are people who are in dire need.  Is there some mechanism whereby they could apply for some of that money?  My prediction is that this may take another two years, which would be a total of nearly five years of having to do without for those who previously got the motorised transport grant or the mobility grant.</p><p> Has there been any thought given - it might be in the new Bill - to moving these grants away from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection?  It has been delivering similar grants which involve medical assessments.  Would that be an appropriate mechanism?  Would it make any difference in the future?  The Department of Health has a limited or inadequate budget, as we know, while the Department of Social Protection has a budget which, of late, it does not fully spend.  It usually sends the money back to the Exchequer.  As the Department of Social Protection makes savings in the future, it might ring-fence funds to put towards this type of cost.</p><p> Have the officials any indication, after two and a half years of looking at this, of how many people would be applying?  I see that part of the next phase will be trying to estimate how many people would be able to apply for or benefit from the new scheme.  I presume after this length of time, there should be some guesstimate as to how much this is going to cost.  Without being tied to a figure, we will have to be allowed some type of yardstick with which to measure it when the heads of the Bill are published.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#L00300"><p>On the work that has been undertaken, it may be worth opening up a general discussion.  There is particular complexity in this work.  If one had a greenfield site, one would set out some new criteria and identify the people who might qualify.  In some ways, that is the easiest part of the legislative process.  We have inherited an administrative scheme which was not operated on a firm legislative basis and which, in reality, had some inconsistencies in it.  Under that scheme, 4,700 people qualified.  We believe we are going to seek to come forward with something that can legally provide for those 4,700.  That is the complexity of combining a new scheme with ensuring we keep the 4,700 people in payment.  That is the particular challenge we have been confronting and we think we have made progress.</p> <p>  This goes to the point the Deputy has made about the interim period.  In the interim period, the money for those 4,700 people has continued to be paid in recognition of their reliance on the payment.  They have had that payment over many years, and to simply remove it when we closed the scheme would have been inappropriate and could have caused distress.  They continue to get that payment.  Any numbers falling out of the scheme have been very marginal in the interim period.  That money continues to be ring-fenced and will be available for the solution we come up with in the general scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how many people could apply.  It is difficult to envisage a number lower than 4,700 because if there are people in categories which might not in the future be eligible, but we want to keep them all within the scheme, then everybody new is going to be additional to the 4,700.  It will be an increment of the 4,700.  Essentially, it comes down to how broadly we throw the net open in devising the criteria for who should qualify.  I am happy to talk about that in further detail as it is the real meat of teasing through the general scheme.</p> <p>  On the Department of Social Protection, there has been debate across the Government on that question.  The backdrop is that the then health boards had minded a number of schemes that were not particularly health specific.</p><p>These schemes migrated to the Department of Social Protection.  They were income support schemes for particular categories.  They covered persons in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, the disabled person's maintenance allowance and income supports.  The Department of Social Protection has certainly taken over a number of these.  There would have been a debate on whether this scheme would be relevant in that regard.  It is important that we finish the work we have taken on rather than trying to pass it across.  It involves completing a legislative basis for a new scheme.  When that work is done, it will be fair enough if somebody at Oireachtas or Government level questions who should administer the scheme, but I do not want to be distracted from trying to finish this part of the process by having to determine whether there is somebody else who should take it on.  We have the ball and should get this over the line as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

I can understand the complexity of what Mr. Breslin is trying to do.  However, the delay is unacceptable and has gone on for too long.  Obviously, the suspicion is that the issue is just being fudged so as not to have to deal with it this side of a general election because it could be controversial.  That is the suspicion one might have, given the incredibly slow movement on this issue.</p> <p>  We identified a long time ago the complex conundrum which we discussed here at length.  It seems quite amazing that although the process has gone for so long, we still do not actually see anything we can assess.  All I really wish to ask for - I know Mr. Breslin cannot answer because this is political - is assurance that what I describe is not what is taking place.  Perhaps he might elaborate on the process and the interaction between the Department, people doing this work and the Government.  I do not know what he can say about it, but can he tell us the date on which we will see the result of all this labour?</p></speech>

We are approaching this task on the basis that it needs to be completed independently of any other event and that we need to submit the work to the Government, once completed.  The timeline is that we will complete the process of seeking legal advice and engage in some consultations, principally with the Department of Social Protection, and then make a submission to the Government.  We intend to do this in a matter of weeks, not months or years, subject to getting through the legal advice process.</p></speech>

I hope we will not only go to the Government but also put a workable proposition to it that would allow us to publish.  I am happy to revert to the committee in a number of weeks to outline the position.  I will have no difficulty in doing so.</p> <p>  On interaction with the Government, we have been working under the policy direction of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and keeping the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, informed of developments.  This has been across the Government's table on a number of occasions.  It has set up an interdepartmental committee and so on.

I understand this is complex.  He has mentioned that there are inconsistencies regarding what is in place.  I would not mind hearing about some of them.  He also spoke about budgetary implications and said there would be competing demands within the disability budget.  Does he envisage that the cost will be much greater than what is currently available or does he envisage it falling within the same budget?</p><p>Are the budgetary implications informing what he is doing?</p></speech>

Quoting the Equal Status Act, she considered that it had fallen foul of that Act.  Therefore, in its actual rule set there were inconsistencies.  There were also inconsistencies in its application, but that is almost inevitable when one leaves the decision-making process to a decentralised old health board system and even within the HSE, where at a local level decisions are made on a case by case basis and there is no national policy in terms of process and procedure.  In the introduction of any new scheme we would seek to put in place, both at a clinical and a means-testing level, one national process that would apply consistently to all people in order that we could guarantee equal treatment across the country.  That would be one of the things we would seek to do.</p></speech>

There were two particular findings.  One was that there was an arbitrary age limit such that if one was over 65 years, one could not apply.  It was said that was not consistent with the Equal Status Act, as it was purely arbitrary.  Obviously, if one removes a limit, a scheme is likely to apply to more people, if one does not do anything else with it.</p> <p>  The other aspect was that there was criticism that it was confined to particular disabilities.  The scheme was principally focused on physical disabilities.  I do not want to raise unreal scenarios, but I will illustrate a more exaggerated one.  If one was to drop the age limit completely and say a person with any disability or condition could apply, that would be a very wide scheme which would have obvious and real budgetary implications.  The task is to look at it afresh and ask who are the people in greatest need and try to come up with new criteria, as opposed to fixing the old scheme.  That is what we have been engaged in.</p></speech>

As part of the process, has Mr. Breslin considered amending equality legislation in such a way that it would permit him to introduce targeted measures?  Obviously, this is an administrative scheme; has he, therefore, looked at it in that context?  As that was legislation he was seen to have contravened, has the process included examining it?  Schemes will be examined for the young, the elderly and those with disabilities.  The legislation will permit him to do this on the basis that those in a particularly vulnerable group require a particular focus with this pocket of money.  Has this aspect been looked at?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#N01700"><p>There was a particular problem with the Equal Status Acts because the scheme was not on a legislative basis; it was an administrative scheme.</p><p>If we provide legislation then it would stand on its own legislative basis but, importantly, that legislation has to have an objective basis to it.  If it was purely arbitrary again, it might not be an issue for the Equal Status Act but there might be constitutional or other reasons.  We do have the option of providing for a category of persons to avail of this scheme and for others not to avail of it but it would have to be based on objective grounds.  Some of the work that we have been doing is trying to tease through what could be the objective grounds for that.  Our thinking at the moment is that it would be invidious to distinguish between different disabilities that are in or out.  Such an approach would lack objectivity.  It would certainly bring one back into that space of equality.</p><p> In terms of providing objective grounds that are legally sound, one of the areas we are looking at is functional impairment or functional requirements.  That is where a lot of work has taken place.  To give an example, which I provided in the statement, if a person is using a very large wheelchair, he or she is unlikely to be able to use public transport which most of us are able to use.  He or she is unlikely even to be able to use public transport that somebody in an ordinary wheelchair would be able to use, certainly someone in an ordinary wheelchair who has an ability to manoeuvre himself or herself.  Even with a personal assistant, carer or family friend accompanying them, such a person would probably not be able to use public transport or local transport solutions in those situations.  Because of their functional requirement in that situation, they face a barrier that other people do not face and so what we must try to come up with examples or criteria such as that, that can be objectively stood up and that can be stood over when the Bill comes before the Oireachtas.  That is the work we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#O00200"><p>Some of what I will say arises from the answers to date.  I would find it invidious if one were to draw up a list.  The problem is that the Department of Health has a list for medical cards, for instance and the Department of Social Protection has a list for the domiciliary care allowance and other schemes.  It is not something that should be done but there are procedures in place.</p> <p>  It was only an inquiry about future administration.  I do not want the Department to hand it over to somebody else to start all over again.  I suggest that the transfer of such a function would be considered in legislation but that is a policy decision.</p> <p>  The Department has probably looked at this, but there have been cases where, for instance, the Department of Social Protection has ended one scheme and let it run for the existing cohort while a new scheme has been introduced for new claimants.  I presume the Department is considering something similar to that approach.</p> <p>  In some ways my final question has been answered.  It is not likely that any budget line for a scheme will be contained in this year&rsquo;s budget if the Department is talking about only getting to Cabinet in the coming weeks with the heads of a Bill.  A budget line for a scheme would be unlikely on 13 or 14 October or whenever the budget is this year.  It appears that we are at least a year away from the full conclusion of a scheme given that the Bill would have to pass through the Houses and then statutory instruments or commencement orders would have to come after that.  Is it safe to say that it will be at least a year before we see a new scheme in place and in operation?</p></speech>

Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor said there are people who might have applied for the old scheme, and if they were applying now they might have benefited from it but cannot do so.  If we are successful in getting all the way to primary legislation and getting a Bill through the House, we would not want to be in a situation where we could not commence the legislation because we had not made any provision so we will ring-fence the existing resources and we may need to consider making some provision, albeit it not a full year provision for 2016.</p><p>It will be a matter for the Oireachtas to take charge of the legislation once it arrives over here and it will be timetabled as laid down.  We might have a contingency in place that if it was to progress we would not delay its implementation.  That is something we will look at. </p></speech>

The committee is now sitting in public session in its capacity as the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  We are dealing with petition No. 00002/2015 submitted by Mr. Con O'Leary.  It is a discussion with officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and officials from Irish Water about the fitting of meter boxes in a driveway with car access.  I ask all present to be careful with their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system.</p> <p>  We are pleased to welcome today from Irish Water, Mr. Jerry Grant, head of asset management; Mr. Kevin McSherry, capital delivery specific projects manager; Mr. Kevin Murray, metering technology and solutions specialist; from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Aidan O'Connor, principal adviser, architecture and building standards section; and Mr. Martin Vaughan, assistant principal.  I welcome the witnesses here today and thank them for forwarding their presentations, which have been circulated to the members.  Members will be aware that this issue arose out of petition No. 00002/2015, which relates to the fitting of inappropriate water meter boxes, according to the petitioner, in areas that are being accessed by vehicles.  The petitioner, Mr. Con O'Leary, claims that the companies installing water meter boxes on behalf of Irish Water are installing grade C boxes whereas they should be using grade B boxes.  He claims that this is not in compliance with the Department of Environment circular letter BC6/2009, which states: "The performance specification for covers and frames to services in footpaths, including footpaths in private housing estates, is determined on the basis that such areas are subject to occasional traffic and 'wheel loading'."  The circular goes onto refer to the Department's publication, recommendations for site development works and housing areas which requires the use of a class B 125 product on footpaths and also advises that local authorities should ensure compliance when inspecting and procuring works.  The petitioner is calling for a review to establish that this is the case and that plans be put in place to prevent this from recurring.  </p> <p>  There has been much debate and public disquiet surrounding the establishment of the utility and the operations of both the Department and Irish Water over the past two years and I believe this committee can afford an opportunity to explore the issues raised in this petition.  I hope, if nothing else, to give clarity to householders and members of the public.</p><p>I must inform you that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If the witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and the witness continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I now invite Mr. Grant to make his presentation.  This will be followed by Mr. O'Connor and we will then move to questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#Q00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  The committee will have a submission from us and I will not read it verbatim, I will take from it the salient points.  I preface it by saying that we have, at this time, constructed 645,000 water meter boxes.  We also note that previous to our involvement 225,000 non-domestic meters were provided in this country in similar boxes.  The majority of our boxes are grade C with 500 currently at grade B.  Based on risk assessment almost all of these boxes are in footpaths, including drop sections, and sometimes in road edges.  We are very happy to address the queries in relation to the following: the use of grade B and grade C; the independent testing and information that we have used to inform our design decisions; and the issue of meter reading which was referenced in the submission.</p> <p> Our intention is to confine ourselves to the terms of reference set out.  We are currently defending one set of legal proceedings from an individual.  Obviously we will not be discussing that, and matters relating to that will not be touched on.  There is some background information to give the committee a sense of the scale of the water metering programme.  We also discuss specifics around the design guidance for the boundary box and the performance of the boundary boxes in practice.  There is commentary on our engagement with the petitioner.  In summary we have set out the broad statement that we are satisfied that we have had a very rigorous approach in respect of selection of the covers for the boundary boxes which are used in the national domestic water metering programme.</p> <p> We have addressed the petitioner&rsquo;s concerns on a number of occasions and we have also addressed them through representations made by elected members.  The grade C plastic surface box used in the programme is designed to be three times the strength of the basic grade C box which is specified in the code.  This is a material fact because once we picked the suppliers of our covers we were then in a position to have regard to the actual strength of the covers based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty and our own tests, which demonstrated even higher strengths.  We can demonstrate that it is common industry practice outside Ireland to install boundary boxes with grade C surface boxes in the drop-down areas of footpaths.  The empirical evidence from the programme - and from the previous non-domestic metering programme which was a very extensive programme and to a greater degree in more heavily trafficked areas - suggests that the failure rate of grade C covers is very small.  We have had reports of failure of 14 meter boxes out of 645 that have been installed.  Only seven of those related to damage to the actual lid itself.  Millions of similar grade C surface boxes have been installed in similar circumstances in Britain without any reportable issues.  The installation of grade C surface boxes better facilitates customers who want to access the boundary box to read the meters and to operate the stop tap if they are anxious to cut off the supply.  The installation of grade C surface boxes is therefore more helpful to customers.</p> <p> Not only have we set out very strict design criteria and construction criteria, we carried out specific installation training for every crew that operates with all of the contractors on the boundary box project.  We also carry out post installation quality audits and these ensure that workmanship and standards of installation are particularly high.  Any defects relating to installation are minimised.  We have given due and proper regard in the entire process, from design through to procurement and construction management, to all of the relevant codes and standards.  The departmental circular which is referenced extensively by Mr. O&rsquo;Leary is not binding on Irish Water.  It is acknowledged in that document that it is open to the authority to design alternatives or to develop alternatives and that it is good engineering design to follow standards such as those, in the absence of independent design or independent risk assessment.  Such standards do not have to be automatically followed where good design and planning suggest an alternative equally robust solution.</p><p>Accordingly, Irish Water has taken all the normal design considerations and risk factors into account and remains fully satisfied that its approach to the installation of surfaces boxes in the drop-down areas of footpaths is the most appropriate design solution.  While Irish Water acknowledges the terms of the departmental circular, we consider it objectively reasonable for us to pursue the approach we have adopted.</p><p> We were given the task by Government of installing more than 1 million water meters outside domestic properties between 2013 and 2016.  Even in international terms, that was a significant undertaking and a very ambitious programme.  Following robust EU procurement processes, the programme commenced on site in August 2013 and will continue until 2016.  Where existing boundary boxes are already installed at a particular location, our contractors examine each boundary box and make an assessment as to whether it is suitable.  For that reason, we have installed 645,000 boundary boxes.  We have actually installed more than 755,000 meters.  We were able to utilise approximately 110,000 meters in existing boundary boxes.  Again, the vast bulk of those would be class C covers.  Members will see a picture of the boundary box on the page.  It is designed to accommodate the water meter and stopcock at the bottom of the box.  It also has a vertical chamber, a cover and a frame, which is the subject matter of the main point at issue today.  The box can be classified as grade A, B or C according to its load-bearing capacity.</p><p> I will reference the equipment supply agreements.  Early on in the project, recognising that we had to deliver 1 million sites constructed, we needed to have in place very robust equipment supply arrangements in order that the equipment would be available to our contractors.  We were asking the industry to do something that had not been done before.  We conducted an open procurement process for boundary boxes and other materials and these were to form part of the equipment supply agreements.  Our metering contractors are obliged to use materials from those agreements and this ensures a high level of quality and consistency of product and materials across all contractors on the programme.  Approved boundary boxes are available to Irish Water's metering contractors, with covers that comply with either grade B or grade C loading requirements.</p><p> In terms of the establishment of those agreements, there was a two-stage procurement process, as is usually the case, with a pre-qualification stage followed by a tender stage.  The tender stage included both quality and price assessment.  There were no legal challenges to the manner in which the process took place and the supply agreements were established without any issues.</p><p> Arising from that procurement process, an equipment supply agreement was established for the supply of boundary boxes for the programme.  During the course of it, candidates were advised that a total of approximately 1 million units would be required, that 320,000 units - the maximum estimated for any one year - would also be required and that a supplier should, therefore, be in a position to provide 100,000 boundary boxes for domestic water meters in a year.  The clear intention behind this was to attract suppliers with both the factory and procurement logistics capacity to be able to make the appropriate level of equipment available to the contractors.  Otherwise, it would become a constraint on the installation programme.  That was consistent with the fact that we expected to peak at approximately 30,000 boundary box installations per month.  We have, in fact, exceeded that number in the peak months.</p><p> Obviously, the procurement process had regard to the skills, efficiency, experience and reliability demonstrated by candidates offering their goods as part of the tender competition.  Two Irish suppliers of boundary boxes, namely, Mains to Meters and Fusion Pipeline Products were selected, offering the EBCO box and the Talbot box, respectively.  Both of these products are manufactured by Atlantic Plastics, part of the TALIS Group, in Wales.  The grade B surface boxes available on the equipment supply agreement are formed of cast iron.  The class C boxes are plastic but the class B boxes on the frameworks we are using are cast iron.  The grade B boundary box is supplied by a company based in Offaly but is manufactured in France.  Generally, but not exclusively, grade C boxes are typically plastic while grade B boxes are typically cast iron.  However, there are plastic grade B covers.</p><p> In terms of training, it is important to say that Irish Water has the opportunity to review previous performance in respect of the installation of boundary boxes in Ireland.  It was quite clear to us that when we examined situations where failures occurred, they very rarely related to the strength of the cover but instead related to workmanship, including in respect of the compaction around the chamber, the type of finish of the pavement and covers not being aligned correctly.  We formed the view, therefore that it was critical to have control over the workmanship as much as the materials.  We knew that the material would not be the intrinsic cause of failure in the vast majority of cases.</p><p>We established with the Department and the water services national training group a training programme for contractors' crews and all the crews have been through that training.  In addition, we are satisfied that we have in place very robust processes and procedures to ensure the quality of workmanship.  The level of training helps to ensure there are minimal defects and that, in fact, is the experience.<br/><br/>I refer to boundary box design guidelines and the history of boundary boxes.  The boundary boxes gradually replaced the old stopcock chambers that had been in use from about the 1990s.  The Water Framework Directive became the driver for metering of non-domestic flows.  That became a matter of Government policy in the early 2000s.  Between 2002 and 2009, local authorities installed approximately 225,000 non-domestic meters and boundary boxes.  During that time various guidance notes were carried out and specimen contract documents and specimen specifications applied to that work.<br/><br/>Irish Water sought evidence of the performance of these non-domestic boundary boxes since 2002.  We have established that grade C surface boxes exhibited very low levels of damage and as such replacement levels have been very low.  Only a small number of grade B surface boxes were ever used.  Where defects were discovered, it was evident that they were typically as a result of poor workmanship and the nature of lateral support, which is essentially compaction or, in some cases, vandalism.  Grade C surface boxes were installed in commercial areas and I have made the point already that the non-domestic customer would typically be in non-residential areas where traffic conditions might be expected to be heavier.<br/><br/>We have some statistics from Cork County Council on repairs carried out.  Again over a seven year period, 31 surface box replacements from all causes of failure were identified.  They have to be viewed in the context of their being 159 boundary box replacements for other reasons.  The reasons that boxes were replaced are due to things such as settlement or changes in street level, excavation work in the vicinity and so on.<br/><br/>I refer to the UK experience.  We have regular discussions with a number of UK water utilities which have confirmed to us that the majority of UK water and sewage companies are installing grade C surface boxes as part of their respective metering programmes.  Thames Water and Southern Water are the only two England and Wales companies at present that are specifically mandated by Ofwat, the regulator, for compulsory metering of domestic customers in Britain.  They are carrying out significant programmes of installation and the vast bulk of them are grade C surface boxes.  Thames Water, Southern Water and United Utilities have not indicated to us during our discussions with them that there are any performance issues coming up with the grade C surface boxes.  We understand that none of the companies measures it specifically because it is such an insignificant issue as far as they are concerned.  They have had no feedback from their operations and maintenance staff of any failure incidence of the grade C surface boxes.<br/><br/>In terms of codes and standards, it is absolutely true to say that a designer will always look at applicable standards, where they are available, in terms of coming up with the specifications for works.  The codes and standards generally set the base limit.  Irish Water considers the following factors in arriving at its conclusions.  These take into account the difference in load bearing capacity for a nominal grade C cover and the nominal grade B cover.  There is a range of 10:1.  The basic code grade C cover is 0.5 tonnes, the grade B cover is 5 tonnes.  That leaves open the fact there is a huge range of load conditions in between which would have to be addressed.  Obviously, if one went for a grade B cover in all the situations where traffic might mount the footpath, one would effectively be providing a cover with much more strength than would be necessarily required.  The codes make no allowance for the workmanship and supervision in respect of installation.  In fact, many codes allow for factors to be included that take account of those things.  They make no reference to the balance that needs to be struck between the strength of the cover, the ease of access for the customer, the accommodation of radio devices and, indeed, the reading of meters.  The codes do not account for the severity of different failure modes.  Where we have tested plastic covers for failure, they essentially split and stay<i>in situ</i>.  Indeed a metal cover tends to break more catastrophically because it is more brittle.  That can result in more significant health and safety issues.  The codes refer to locations accessible to vehicles but give no particular guidance as to the level of vehicle traffic.  <br/><br/>The designer is obliged to consider all circumstances relevant to the design.  Irish Water recognises that there were factors that had to be considered that were beyond the scope of situations considered in the available guidance.</p><p> The petitioner has referenced Circular BC 6/2009, that details the specification for surfaces boxes.  The suggestion is that Irish Water is inappropriately acting in violation of the circular.  The circular is not binding on Irish Water.  It is primarily addressed to planning authorities and building authorities.  It has been developed from a developer and housing perspective rather than a water services metering and customer viewpoint.  In any event it is a general circular which requires to set out guidance for all circumstances in which these might be used, which would not have the considerations of design and the control of workmanship and so on, that is practised by us.  The circular contains the default specification as far as we are concerned for the installation of surface boxes in the absence of specific design and location specific risk assessment.  It is a well established practice that objectively justifiable and reasoned designs can diverge from such non-binding guidance if such design is technically sound and grounded on a rational understanding of the products being used, the risks relating to that product and the situation in which it is being installed.  Given the scale of the programme, the public money being expended, it was incumbent on Irish Water to design the most technically suitable and efficient solution, having regard to all relevant material factors.</p><p> As officials from the Department are present, I will now move on to the manufacturer's guidance.  The equipment supply agreement in respect of the provision of grade C and grade B surface boxes for the programme was established prior to Irish Water concluding its full technical opinion as to the appropriate location for the installation of grade C surface boxes or indeed grade B boxes.  Our current approach is founded to a large extent on the proven load bearing capacity of our grade C surface boxes used in the programme rather than the minimum load capacity of a theoretical product.  We understand that the manufacture of the grade C surface boxes used on the programme has supplied something in the order of 16 million of these products to the UK and Ireland and that it is common practice to install them in the drop-down or cross-over areas of residential footpaths.</p><p> Irish Water has been informed by the supplier of the grade C surface boxes that they have had practically no reports of issues with covers sited in the drop-down areas.  Our experience in the programme to date is that we have installed more than 644,500 grade C boxes compared with 500 grade B boxes, of which we have reports of 14 broken covers.  We have also obtained confirmation from Atlantic Plastics, the supplier of the boundary boxes that the installation of a boundary box in a drop-down area of a footpath will not in this instance be deemed to be a breach of warranty conditions.  They are satisfied that the warranty holds for boxes in that circumstance.  We are aware that UK water companies from time to time give direction and specification as to products used by developers on their behalf.  They do sometimes specify the higher strength material.  Again that takes account of the fact that they are anxious to mitigate against the risk of poor workmanship in that uncontrolled situation.  These variables do not arise in the context of boundary boxes being installed pursuant to our programme and therefore these documents are not particularly relevant to us.  </p><p> In terms of load testing, the grade C surface box used in the programme is designed as three times stronger than the minimum requirement.  Representatives of Irish Water have observed the surface boxes tested in controlled conditions to more than four times the load stipulated in the British standard.  The grade C surface boxes used by Irish water withstood loads in excess of two tonnes before cracking and loads in excess of three tons before fracturing.  To put it in context, a large family car would be very unlikely to exert a wheel load greater than 0.5 tonnes to 0.75 tonnes.  It is very unlikely that all of that load would transfer on to the small area of the surface box.</p><p> We also have had independent load testing carried out on the grade C surface box, which has been proven to withstand loads of more than two tons.  As part of the test, a stone was placed on a surface box and a standard car tyre used to impose the load on the stone.  The result of that test was that the care tyre deformed around the stone and came into contact with the surface box.  The test was abandoned when we were afraid the tyre would actually explode.</p><p> In terms of the customer, there are clear benefits for customers where the grade C surface box is used because it is significantly more convenient for them to access the meter and the outside stop-valve, which is in the surface box for their property.  The surface box is not only lighter than the grade B metal cover, it also can be levered using a screwdriver, like the way one uses a screwdriver when opening the lid of a paint pot.  The metal surface box needs a set of lifting keys that have to be provided to the customer and can easily be mislaid.  The metal surface box also needs an element of manhandling with the resulting risk of injury and with fingers being trapped.  Safety is a key priority for Irish Water in everything it does.  Safety in construction has been a particular focus of these contracts as it is on every contract.</p><p> It is important to note that the grade B surface boxes are not indestructible in themselves.  We have referred to the consequences of catastrophic failure of a grade B box.</p><p> In terms of performance on the ground, we have installed approximately 645,000 boundary boxes to date.  From that figure of 645,000 boundary boxes, there have been 14 reports of broken surface boxes.  That is a tiny percentage.  The reasons for the individual failures are varied and Mr. Kevin McSherry can discuss it, if members wish.  In terms of the consequence of selecting a grade C box, it is insignificant.  We have been specifically monitoring a sample of grade C surface boxes installed in the drop down areas of residential driveways.  We have 50 grade C surface boxes that we have been keeping under observation since November 2013, which is almost two years ago, and no visual defects in any of these surface boxes have been recorded.  Such an audit clearly supports the approach we have taken in respect of the installation of these covers.</p><p> In terms of the role of contractors, I reference the photographs on the page that show the concrete slab within which the cover sits.  The concrete slabs are constructed to a very high standard and provide huge rigidity to the cover and frame and the overall installation is very strong.  In accordance with the installation contracts, the final design responsibility rests with the contractor.  The contractors decide between a grade B or a grade C box, based on a risk assessment that they carry out.  The decision is generally based on engineering assessment of the loading conditions of each location.  That allows for the fact that prior to contract, it is not possible to predict all of the situations and circumstances that might arise, so a degree of discretion is left with the contractor who might typically install a grade C surface box where there is pedestrian traffic and occasional light vehicle traffic, parking manoeuvres and so on.  On the other hand, a grade B surface box might be considered where there are risks of occasionally higher wheel loads - in other words, where there is clear evidence of heavy vehicle access that might access the footpath or the drop down.</p><p> Our audits generally concur with the design decisions being made - in other words these are rational, sensible decisions and it is clear on what basis they have been made.  The contractors as designers have demonstrated that where the locations permit, the lighter cover is the most appropriate surface box to install.  It is also fair to say that when they look at a particular location, they will from time to time move the location of the meter box closer to the wall of the building to reduce the risk.  That has been part of the approach that has been taken to ensuring there is no difficulty with the grade C box as the standard box solution.  It is also important to say the contractors bear the risk of the damage to the boxes for a number of years and, as such, it would not be in their interests to select a grade C cover if the situation warranted a grade B cover.  </p><p> In terms of supervision and quality control, both Irish Water and its contractors have committed significant resources to supervision and quality auditing to ensure that the finished work is of a very high standard.  We also have developed extensive quality assurance and control resources to conduct follow up checks on finished installations.  Any where a defect is encountered, it is repaired at the contractor's cost.  That is part of the contract.  Our field inspectors carry out frequent audits of contractors work for that purpose. </p><p> I refer to meter reading.  Our meters feature automatic meter reading, that is, AMR technology, where a transmitter sends a meter reading from the meter to a receiver unit in one of Irish Water's meter reading vehicles.  This means that meter readers generally do not need to access the cover of the meter box.  They can read the meters from a passing vehicle.  As a result of that efficiency, 11 meter readers can now read the entire suite and get a full meter reading of all the domestic meters we have installed to date.  To maximise the benefit of remote meter reads, it is important to enable the automated reading of the meters to be conducted effectively.  Our considerations fed by logic and previous studies indicated that while there was no question that the grade B box precluded the reading of the meter, the less dense the material, the better from the point of view of the efficiency and certainty of being able to read it.  That said, we have now completed three quarterly cycles of readings and our systems have not reported any difficulty regarding the 500 meters with grade B surface boxes.  However, we are a little careful in respect of regarding that as conclusive because these are 500 individual boxes, which are not in close proximity like the grade C boxes.  Therefore, we are not making an assumption that there would be no issues and difficulties, although it has to be said that our current experience is that there is no difficulty. </p><p> Irish Water does not consider that there is sufficient empirical evidence from the programme to determine definitively whether more wide spread use of grade B surface boxes would have a negative impact on our ability or efficiency in conducting the reading.</p><p>In the past we have engaged with a petitioner who produces a form of boundary box with a grade B surface box.  Both Irish Water and the Department have engaged on the matter, directly and through third parties.  We have also carried out a pilot scheme and provided a provisional report.  A final report will issue to him shortly.  We are continually in the business of looking for new and innovative products.  Clearly, we will conduct a future procurement process for the delivery of covers and meter boxes.  However, currently we have our suppliers on contract and the contract will continue for the next 12 months.  We have also had extensive engagement, detailed in our presentation, with Oireachtas Members on this question.</p><p> The petitioner has referred to a High Court case in respect of installation of a grade C surface box at a particular location and acknowledges that he was party to assisting the particular plaintiff in his action.  We acknowledge that a settlement was made in that case.  It was made for pragmatic reasons as we manage all legal cases pragmatically in the best interests of our customers.  However, we absolutely refute the statement that the question was conceded as to the appropriateness of a grade C box in general or at that location.  In fact, we made our own technical assessment of the location and concluded that a grade C box would have been used.  Again, acting reasonably in that situation, as part of the agreement we agreed to provide a grade B box and have done so.  That was in the interests of resolving the matter expediently and cost effectively.  It was a pragmatic decision to install a grade B box.</p><p> In general, we are satisfied that all relevant design considerations have been taken into account in this huge programme of work and the selection of grade C surface boxes.  We conclude that not only our experience but also the previous experience in Ireland and general experience in the United Kingdom demonstrate that the grade C surface box of this standard is perfectly suitable for use in the drop-down areas of footpaths and footpaths generally.  We have taken full account of all design considerations in arriving at our conclusions.  In that regard, we have followed through on all of the detail, from design through specification, the training of our offices and quality assurance, to ensure there is no deviation in the standard.  Customers can access their meter box readily by the use of a screwdriver.  It is important they can access not just the meter for reading but also the stop tap.  We have 645,000 installations of our own, with no more than 14 failures.  We reference the 225,000 pre-existing meters with class C covers.</p><p> We believe we are fully in step with the general practice involving millions of meter boxes across the United Kingdom.  Therefore, I am satisfied that we have offered the best value solution to our customers and the correct technical solution.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Connor" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#V00300"><p>On behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and my colleague, Mr. Martin Vaughan, I thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend this meeting.  We are from the architecture and building standards section of the Department, which section sets minimum standards for building regulations, with which members are familiar.  The standards set are mandatory and must be complied with.  The references in the documentation circulated and in the "blue book" - site development works - are recommendations and, therefore, not part of the building regulations.  They are external to buildings and guidance documents.</p> <p>  On 1 January 2014 Irish Water assumed statutory responsibility for public water services.  It is the designated national authority and, therefore, responsible for water services, including infrastructure and water meter boxes.  The statutory role played formerly by the local authorities, acting as water service authorities, no longer pertains.</p><p>Our recommendations in this guidance document were to local authorities in general, and there are quite a number of them.  Now we are dealing with one single national authority.  My responsibility is to deal with the matters specifically relating to the guidance that is given in the document, such as the recommendations for site development work and to deal with the circulars, namely, BC 9/2008 and BC 6/2009, which are relevant to this discussion and to the practices of the guidance.</p><p> The origins of this guidance document are quite noble, when one looks at it.  It goes back to An Foras Forbartha, where it was first published in 1974.  It was amended in 1984.  The Department then published a guidance document based on that in 1998.  It is, as I said, recommended standards guidance for local authorities that, effectively, did not have their own guidance, although some local authorities did.  They would have had by-laws, etc.  The document does not contain all the possible solutions.  It allows the authorities to come forward with alternatives and it recognises that some authorities provide their own documented recommendations.  There is a broad recognition in the foreword of this document to explain where it sits in the sense of guidance.</p><p> When we refer to non-compliance with the building regulations, we mean there is an obligation to comply and, therefore, there is non-compliance.  Strictly speaking, there has been a failure to adhere to the law.  The blue book does not carry the force of law.  It is a recommendation and a guidance document only.  Confusion should be avoided, because we are the authority, if one likes, for both.</p></speech>

In this case, the relevant parties are obviously Irish Water and the Department.  We do not second-guess the decisions of courts or an Ombudsman.  I wish to make it clear that any deliberations taking place today and any decisions that our committee makes are not in any way to be compared with those of a legal case.  We are not deliberating on tendering processes or anything concerning them.  We are deliberating on whether Irish Water complied with the required standards.  We have listened to the evidence presented today.  I do not want any of this hearing today to be seen in any way to be in conflict with a court of law, which is independent and has an independent jurisdiction.  We certainly would not act in a way that would fall foul of the <i>sub judice </i>rule in any way, shape or form.  I wish to clarify that point.  For any party that is interested in these matters, any court cases are entirely separate from our deliberations today and we would not be seeking to influence or to undermine in any way, shape or form a court of law or separate process.  We will be looking at the specific petition.  It is a stand-alone petition which we have accepted as a legitimate issue.  We have listened to the evidence given and now I will open up the floor to the members to ask questions.</p></speech>

I will read the questions out.  I will be as quick as I can but I will need a few minutes.  All stopcocks were replaced by meter boxes.  The stopcocks were predominantly fitted and paid for by the householder.  All these stopcocks were the correct grade B standard.  Irish Water has now replaced them with a substandard product that does not comply with prescribed standards.  How can this be right?  </p> <p>  Why did Irish Water make-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1049" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#Y00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I have given the secretariat my full list of questions.  I would appreciate if each of them could be answered, at the convenience of the witnesses, within the next week.</p> <p>  Why did Irish Water make a mistake in the specification for the supply of water meter boxes that should have included a requirement for the enablement of a radio signal propagation?  How did Irish Water expect the radio signal to get out of the box when they ordered a cast iron covered box?  Why did Irish Water sign a contract for cast iron covered boxes when it was not possible for radio waves to get through the metal?  Who took the decision to order the wrong water meter boxes?  Was there an engineer in Irish Water with radio and electronic qualifications?  </p> <p>  It would be ridiculous, gentlemen, for us to be here today without showing the delegation what we are talking about.  Irish Water has already stated that it had a report of 14 broken covers.  I can tell the delegation that there are 15 broken covers because I have one here in my hand.  The cover was broken by vehicles driving over it.  I also have pictures here of boxes that have been located in crazy positions where lorries, creamery lorries, tractors, trailers and heavy vehicles drive over them which has led to the boxes being broken.</p><p>The main thing is the difference between a grade B and a grade C cover.  It is very important for people to realise what we are talking about.  That is important but what they sit on is more important.  One is strong and will not break while one is weak and will break, and is breaking.  It is ridiculous to say there are only 14 reported complaints.  People who walk and who cycle see them every day in this cracked condition.  Do we telephone Irish Water to report them?  Of course, we do not.  If I walk around Dublin tonight and see a cracked cover, will I check what street I am on and telephone Irish Water in the morning and report it?  Let us not be silly.  One knows that will not happen and that is the reason Irish Water is not inundated with people reporting these broken covers.  It is ridiculous to think that one cover will do the same job as the other.  The extra cost that was involved was minimal when one considers the consequences of installing these inferior covers, that is, replacing those that break as well as the possibility of litigation arising if people get hurt.  There is a myriad of problems and difficulties.  That Irish Water went to England to purchase them from an English company, owned by a German parent company, did not make sense when a product was available here.  I cannot see for the life of me why Irish Water is insisting to this day that it was right to install an inferior product given what was actually required.  One would have allowed for the meter to be read remotely and Irish Water would have had no problem with it.  This does not make sense.</p><p> I look forward to getting replies to the questions I have submitted.  They are detailed and deserve answers.  An inferior product, which is breaking, is being installed.  This product will continue to break for years to come and will end up costing taxpayers thousands, even millions, of euro because of the decision taken at that time.</p></speech>

I ask Irish Water what design life it expects to get from either grade C or grade B box covers.  Both presentations stated that the guidelines, circulars and standards, whether UK or Irish, are not binding either by the Department, with respect to Irish Water, or by Irish Water in terms of the rules.  How then could they allow companies to guess, essentially, the requirements of Irish Water if the appropriate standards are based on experience and not laid down standards?</p><p>Why can Irish Water not use the specifications and insist on what it has learned from experience?  In the context of the design life, a figure of 50 years has been mentioned to me.  This means there is a long way to go in terms of the lifetime of these caps.  However, the level of experience in terms of the installation of the covers is not high.  How can we draw conclusions as to the appropriateness of the experience with regard to the specifications which are being issued to companies?  Let us be fair, what else would they use in coming up with appropriate designs to supply tenders?  Did Irish Water envisage, before the metering project began, that in certain areas or circumstances a grade B box of a particular standard would be required?  If so, was an evaluation carried out of how many grade B-type covers would be required?</p><p> Part 7 of the executive summary, which is the briefing note supplied by Irish Water, states that the Department's circular is not binding on the company.  It is good engineering design practice to follow standards such as those specified in the Department's circular in the absence of any independent design or risk evaluation.  However, such standards need not be automatically followed where good design and planning suggests an alternative, equally robust solution.  In the absence of anything else, it appears that we are almost guessing what will happen in terms of where some of these covers will be installed.  Between 80% and 90% are installed appropriately in areas where there are pedestrians and cars but they are also being installed in areas that are accessed by fuel trucks, tractors and other agricultural machines.  Do the witnesses agree that, in the context of areas where there is agricultural commercial activity and where domestic meters are being installed, it would be appropriate to state that in the next 50 years - or whatever is the design life of these covers - there is a slight chance that a tractor, a heavy goods vehicle or a fuel truck will drive over the covers and that it would, therefore, be prudent to opt for heavier covers?  Was an evaluation carried out as to the number of such covers that would be required when assessing the tenders?</p><p> I hope I will have the opportunity to pose a number of supplementary questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#AA00300"><p>I will cover some general points.  Mr. Kevin Murray will deal specifically with some of the technical points around the specifications and also the radio signal question.</p> <p>  On the general point of stopcock replacement, stopcocks have been the subject of gradual replacement since the early 1990s.  The Department specifically advised local authorities in this regard and many of the latter had, long before the non-domestic programme was introduced, insisted that meter boxes be used.  This was because they anticipated the introduction of metering.  Indeed, meters were installed in some local authority areas.  We found many boxes with meters that were installed under planning conditions in certain counties.  In those situations we replaced the meter with our meter so that we could read it efficiently with our system.  Those boxes were perfectly good for the job.  The basic point, in respect of both questioners, is that the standards are a default position and one can always default to a standard.  However, a standard does not, of itself, absolve one of responsibility for adequacy of design.  A company such as Irish Water, which has a strong engineering capability, absolutely has the right - the codes allow for this and the non-binding guidance document acknowledges it - to consider the specific circumstances and conditions that obtain.</p><p>As I said in the presentation, the backfill standards generally and, in particular, the way the concrete surround is cast around the cover make it very robust.  In terms of normal traffic, for example, a car, it can handle at least three to four times the load.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  The reality is that approximately 225,000 of these have been installed in this country since 2009.  They began to be installed in 2002.  The UK experience corroborates that.  So there was no reason to be concerned beyond the fact that they were more cost effective and guaranteed to be easy to read.  As specified in the documents, we provided for the option of a grade B cover precisely because there would be situations where a milk truck or something of that nature might necessitate the higher strength cover.  It is absolutely correct to acknowledge to Deputy Healy Rae that there is a big difference in strength and the stronger cover can be used precisely in those situations.</p><p> We cannot guarantee that we have every example right but, clearly, if a failure arises in the period of guarantee of this contract, the contractor is obliged to replace it at his own cost because that is what the contract requires him to do.  If it happens beyond that, then clearly we will have to replace it.  However, the number in that regard will be very small.  Mr. Kevin McSherry will talk about the generality of examples.  The member mentioned some additional ones that would not have been reported.  It might be useful for Mr. Kevin Murray to talk about the issue of the readability of the meters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Murray" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015092300002#BB00200"><p>I will try and pick up on some of these points.  On the design life question that was asked, the tender documents sought a design life of 50 years.  That was specifically requested.  We also considered if grade B or grade C surface boxes would be required.  As a result, our tender document asked for both grade B and grade C tender boxes to be provided.  The nature of this particular contract was a little different from what one might expect in that we arranged a framework of products.  We went to the market and asked suppliers to provide us with a framework of boundary boxes.  Then we separately went to the market and engaged contractors through a tendering process.  We told them that they had to select the products from our framework.  In response to the question about how contractors could know what complied and what did not, that did not apply in this case because we were providing them with a product that we had preselected according to our procurement process.  I hope that deals with the issue.  I would be happy to take supplementary questions on it.</p> <p>  We were also asked about the automatic meter reading.  Clearly, we considered automatic meter reading.  We also carried out a tender for suppliers to provide us with the water meters that go into the boxes and we laid down requirements for their radio signal to be capable of being picked up at a certain distance, at a certain speed of travel and with the meter in the boundary box to a certain depth.  The suppliers of those meters had to take into account a number of factors, not least that the boundary box could have a plastic or metal cover.  They also had to take into account the environment.  The radio signal will pass through the metal cover.  The issue is to what distance it will travel and to what extent it will be impeded by the density of a metal cover.  However, it can also be impeded by many other factors, such as walls that might be between the van and the cover.  Perhaps somebody might have parked a car in the vicinity.  These factors can all degrade the distance the signal can travel.  We have witnessed signals being picked up over 100 m away from boundary boxes in some very good circumstances.</p><p>However, the performance to date has been such that we have not seen a discernible impact from the use of metal covers as opposed to plastic covers in the small number of cases we have used them.  That is probably testament to the quality of workmanship and the products used.  I hope that addresses that question.</p><p> I believe Mr. Grant has answered the question on stopcocks.  There are many examples of broken stopcock covers around the country.  Unfortunately, what tends to happen is that the customer or whoever else will open the stopcock cover.  The Deputy will be familiar with its horseshoe shape.  When it is opened, sometimes somebody can accidentally give it a kick, the hinge breaks and the stopcock cover becomes loose and then disappears.  That is a problem and an indication that, in a variation of an t&eacute; nach bhfuil laidir cathfaidh s&eacute; a bheith glic, something can be stronger but not necessarily as clever.  We believe our products meet requirements very well.</p></speech>

When the works are completed, Irish Water works with the contractor and the relevant local authority to confirm that they are to the relevant standard.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy, if there are issues, they should be passed through to us and we will happily investigate any broken lid.  Members of the public have telephoned us on 1890 278278.  Of the 14 reported incidents to date, seven have involved broken covers.

Ours is a very new company and it is something at which we will look.  Over time we will look at applying ISO 9000, ISO 14000 and ISO 55000 standards.  They are part of a management system standard we would expect to apply in the next few years.  Very few companies of our scale apply that standard.  Very few utility and construction companies apply that standard.</p> <p>  There are 225,000 non-domestic meter boxes in the ground, practically all of which have grade C covers on streets with heavier traffic because they are in commercial premises.  There are some instances of broken covers.  They were put in by the local authorities and their contractors.  In some instances, clearly, there were workmanship issues.</p><p>In the main the number of failures is very low.

I wish to refer to the design life of 50 years.  Mr. Grant in responding to questions referred to the proof of the pudding, but in this case it will be 50 years before we see the proof of the pudding.  That comes to the nub of the issue.  I acknowledge that a great deal of work was done on the specifications, the delivery framework and the workmanship in advance of the procurement process, which was well pointed out by Mr. Murray.  Surely some thought was put into the number of grade B and grade C boundary box covers that would be required as part of the tender process.</p> <p>  The automatic meter reading technology was mentioned and the grade C covers, which account for 80% of covers, present no inhibiting factors in the reading of the meters.  It was mentioned that factors such as a wall, a car or other impediment could affect the efficient reading of the meters.  I suggest that cast iron covers would inhibit the efficient reading of meters.  Was that considered as part of the process for the grade B covers?  I would be surprised that Irish Water would purposely put an impediment to the efficient reading of meters, given that it employs only 11 meter readers.</p></speech>

Today it was said that those guidelines are not binding.  What is the point of guidelines, if they are not binding?  Most people who are building their homes or running businesses understand there is a regulatory environment.  The concern is that the guidelines for Irish Waters and others to implement are not binding.  It is puzzling why we have a Department with oversight if the guidelines it issues are open to interpretation and can be dismissed arbitrarily.  I am sure that would be a very serious concern for people paying attention to the proceedings.</p></speech>

Within that document there is mention of standards.  There are Irish standards, international standards and European standards.</p><p>It is not without reference to standards but what I am saying is that the recommendations are what they are - recommendations.  When they were developed they applied to local authorities that did not have any standards at the time or any declared document one could use as a standards document.  That is why it was developed over the period in question, as I have explained, through An Foras Forbartha in 1974 on to the Department's own publication of this document, which advanced it.  It also includes guidance on roads, for example, road turning circles and so forth.  They have been superseded by developments in design.  The issues that are dealt with here - those which develop over time - are the subject of the recommendations.  There would be standards within that to the effect that if one is to follow it or deal with a particular concern, then one follows an Irish standard, a European standard or, in some cases, a British standard.</p></speech>

What is the point in making a recommendation?  One of the issues that got us into the massive economic crisis of recent times was light-touch regulation or the non-existence of regulation.  Here we have a Department that has gone to the trouble, we assume, of establishing engineering standards and issuing recommendations but these can be completely ignored and dismissed.</p></speech>

They are not binding.  Irish Water has stated that repeatedly and Mr. O'Connor has confirmed it.

However, those recommendations are not binding.  What is the point of such recommendations?</p></speech>

These pictures confirm that the boxes in question are being installed on roads where traffic is driving over them.  At the same time, the manufacturer of these grade C surface boxes has stated clearly they are not to be used in situations involving motor vehicles.  The manufacturer further states that no warranty is given or liability accepted for failure to comply with its installation instructions.  The Department bought the boxes but was told by the manufacturer not to install them in locations where vehicles can drive over them.  They are being put down in places where creamery lorries, trucks and heavy machinery are driving over them.  Am I correct or incorrect in saying that the suppliers of the boxes clearly state that?  Am I right or wrong?</p></speech>

The point Deputy Healy-Rae has made is not supplementary to the point I raised.  That said, I will ask Irish Water to respond to Deputy Healy-Rae's point in a moment.  I believe the Deputy is referring to documentation from Thames Water.   He is referring to a Thames Water, company-specific addendum which states that boundary boxes of class B may be used in areas subject to "occasional traffic loading" but a wise precaution is to install these out of the line of traffic wheels, in the centre of the driveway.  Irish Water will deal with that point in a moment but  I ask Mr. O'Connor to deal with the point I made first.</p></speech>

That is an interesting point but if a local authority wishes to introduce rules and regulations relating to wind energy, for example, the Department can enforce its own guidelines, even though that is a matter vested in the local authority.  There is precedent, therefore, of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government enforcing guidelines on a local authority, a vested body, in the public interest.</p></speech>

I was getting to that point.  Within the Water Services Act, there is provision for the Minister to issue instructions and directions to Irish Water.  However, I am not aware of that having been done.  Mr. O'Connor and I do not work on the water services side of the Department but that provision is there in legislation.  The legislation also contains a provision for complaints from the public relating to the infrastructure and all aspects of Irish Water's remit to be made to the parent company, Ervia.  Apologies, I am wrong about that - there is a provision for complaints to be made to the Commission for Energy Regulation and the commissioner can then make a direction on such matters.  That is the legal framework that now pertains to water services-----</p></speech>

They were written in the context of local authorities taking estates in charge.  They were taking into charge works that had been carried out by private developers.</p><p>The local authority was taking over responsibility for that infrastructure, so it had a right to insist on the standard of infrastructure of which it was taking control.  It is no longer taking control of water services infrastructure.  The circulars are still relevant and binding in that other elements of the site development works document are taken in charge by local authorities.  However, water services infrastructure is not.  Therefore, if there is a problem now with water services infrastructure and it needs to be replaced, the responsibility for that no longer falls on the local authority.  It falls on Irish Water to replace it.  The circular no longer applies in that regard, but that point is not appreciated.</p></speech>

They were procured quite early.  In our assessment of the requirements, we allowed for up to 10% of boxes to be grade B.  That was a considered view that had regard to the situation in Britain and here in Ireland with non-domestic meters.  We had clear evidence that the majority of situations would be satisfied by the grade C cover, but we anticipated that perhaps up to 10% would require grade B.  That said, we took no decision to specify that, say, 10% were to be used.</p> <p>  I wish to make an important point.  In regard to any guidance or standards in the public domain, we would never summarily or arbitrarily ignore them.  We have responsibility to the Commission for Energy Regulation to deliver the most cost-effective and efficient solution to any problem.  We will not be compensated by the CER for failures that occur from our lack of control over quality.  Therefore, we are at risk if there is a problem in this regard.  We took these decisions clearly understanding the construct and quality control process we were putting forward.  If we are setting criteria for private developers for infrastructure that we might be taking over in the future, we may take a very different view and will take an appropriate view in all those situations.  This is particular to work we are carrying out under contracts and supervision and to our specifications, and that is the core point.  There is nothing arbitrary or summary about this.</p></speech>

The issue is the guidelines, frameworks and regulations are clear and one either adheres to them or does not.  The lay person following these proceedings would ask the question.  We are all subject to regulation, particularly those involved in building or engineering works and there are clear standards to be adhered to.  It is not about going about them arbitrarily or any other way.  The issue of contention is that Irish Water would have any degree of discretion on the matter.  The point is whether recommendations, guidelines and circulars are binding.  It is not that Irish Water dealt with them either arbitrarily or summarily.  That Irish Water had any flexibility is the issue.</p></speech>

By this stage, members are well aware of the Government's decision in May 2011 to put new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  Reference to this arrangement is also made in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State boards of November 2014.  The joint committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson designate to hear his views and trusts this provides for greater transparency in the process of appointments to State boards and bodies.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Fintan Gorman.</p><p> By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am very grateful to have the opportunity to address the committee as part of the process of being appointed as the chairman of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, was established on 1 July 2010 following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and seven Regional Fisheries Boards.  The main functions of IFI, as identified in the 2010 Act, are: "to promote, support, facilitate and advise the Minister on the conservation, protection, management, marketing, development and improvement of inland fisheries, including sea angling."</p> <p>  The 2010 to 2015 period has been a time of huge change and consolidation for Ireland and for the fisheries sector.  Its establishment, unfortunately, coincided with the economic collapse and the ravages of the recessionary period have had serious consequences for IFI.  Between 2009 and 2014, staff levels at IFI reduced from 440 to 298, a reduction of 32%.  To put this in context, the overall State agency staff numbers have reduced by 18.2% and the overall Civil Service numbers have reduced by 9.2% over the same period.  Therefore, IFI has lost almost four times more staff than the wider Civil Service average and the overall budget of the agency has decreased by 15%.</p> <p>  Despite the serious reduction in manpower and financial resources available to it, IFI has continued to maintain a 24 hour a day, seven days a week fisheries service on Ireland&rsquo;s 74,000 km of rivers and streams, 128,000 ha of lakes and over 5,500 km of coastline.  This has been made possible by the innovation and commitment of the board, management and staff.  Necessity is the mother of invention, and work practices at IFI have fundamentally changed the way it does its business.</p> <p>  IFI staff now use a range of hi-tech equipment to target specific "hot spot" areas and increase operational efficiency.  This includes kayaks, which are being used to conduct silent patrols along river and lake shores; all-terrain vehicles, which are being used on some of the countries beaches to patrol for illegal bass fishing; personal water craft, including jet-skis, which are being used to patrol shallow estuarine areas which previously would have been inaccessible to RIBs; larger RIBs, which are being used to launch dawn patrols on coastal areas, and officers go well out to sea under the cover of darkness and then approach coastal areas at first light; and night vision scopes, thermal imaging equipment and long-range spotting scopes, which are being used to great effect.  In 2014, staff seized 372 nets extending to 20.72 km.  This level of seizures illustrates the positive result of overt and covert patrols but, in reality, is just a percentage of the total number of illegal nets.</p> <p>  It is this spirit of innovation and co-operation which has helped IFI to develop as a professional agency and enabled it to fulfil its mandate in adverse financial circumstances.  During the first five years of its existence, IFI has established its headquarters in a modern, fit-for-purpose building in Citywest and it continues to consolidate and upgrade its facilities in the regions.  It has adopted a recognisable staff work-wear, engaged in extensive research projects and produced innovative policies for the management of trout, pike and bass fisheries.  I compliment the outgoing chairman, Mr. Brendan O'Mahony, past and present board members, the CEO, Dr. Ciaran Byrne, and management and staff on their sterling efforts in the protection and development of our fisheries.</p><p> IFI is a public benefit entity with a small budget and a large national mandate.  Most people are probably unaware of its existence but it provides great benefit to rural communities and the nation in general.  The economic contribution of angling to the Republic of Ireland stands at over &euro;836 million per annum and is estimated to support in excess of 11,350 jobs.  Some 446,000 individuals participated in recreational angling in Ireland in 2014, which is 7.5% of the population based on a Millward Brown omnibus survey of 2014.  This includes Northern Ireland and visitors.  Some 132,000 of these anglers came from overseas.  A 2014 F&aacute;ilte Ireland survey indicates that Britain accounts for approximately one third of our overseas anglers while 59% come from mainland Europe, with Germany being the single largest continental market at 24%.</p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that approximately 2% of all overseas visitors are angling tourists, which equates to 132,000 visitors per annum.  All this angling activity provides a great economic spin-off to hotels, restaurants, bed and breakfasts and tackle shops.  Angling is the life blood of many peripheral communities and it provides jobs in areas that have been ravaged by unemployment and emigration.</p><p> IFI currently employs approximately 230 fishery officers around the country and they engage in vital stock protection, habitat protection and research work.  The future health of Ireland&rsquo;s angling resource is dependent on ensuring that our fish populations are protected and conserved.  Our fisheries are a precious asset.  If one does not protect and invest in an asset it diminishes in value.  Having provided a brief outline of the sterling work that IFI is doing with limited resources to conserve the great national asset that is our fisheries, I will now outline a vision of the enormous potential that our unique fisheries and our pristine waters present if we are willing to nurture, market and invest.</p><p> The age profile of anglers is worrying.  We can and must engage a new generation in angling.  To do this we need to encourage the development of accessible fisheries around the country, in many cases focusing on urban dwellers.  These models have been proven internationally, and an example of one successful model is the Go Fish BC, an initiative supported by the Freshwater Fisheries Society of British Columbia.  We also have to support entry into angling through appropriate and targeted education and coaching programmes, such as those run by many of the angling federations and the Dublin angling initiative.</p><p> If our unique angling resource is to be positively exploited to its potential we need to provide trained knowledgeable guides with local expert knowledge.  There are viable career opportunities here.  Participation levels in angling are directly related to the quality of the product.  Provide good fishing and the world will beat a path to your door.  Investment in the product will re-engage lapsed anglers and increase participation levels.  IFI  has concrete, verifiable evidence to prove the definite link between quality of resource and participation levels.  The 1994-99 tourism angling management, TAM, programme saw the targeted investment of &pound;17 million in our fisheries.  By 1999, overseas angler numbers peaked at 173,000.</p><p> These are not pipedreams but are some of the strategies, methodologies and projects that IFI have researched, examined, costed and documented as part of the soon-to-be-launched national strategy for angling development, NSAD.  The strategy marks a significant milestone in the development of our national fisheries resource and will act as a roadmap for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s angling sector in the future.  The extensively researched background material for the strategy lists projects such as the Owenmore River, Ballynahinch, County Galway; the Easkey River, a salmon river in Sligo; Lough Sheelin trout fishery in Cavan; the River Shanowen game fishery in Kerry; the salmon fishery in Lough Currane, County Kerry; and the coarse and pike angling fishery in Lough Ramor in Cavan.</p><p> An investment of at least &euro;25 million will be required to deliver this strategy nationally over the period of 2016 to 2020.</p><p>In return, it has the potential to grow the economic contribution of angling from its current level of &euro;836 million to &euro;900 million per annum and, in the process, support an extra 1,400 jobs in local areas.  A properly financed and resourced implementation of the national strategy for angling development, NSAD, will be a game-changer for domestic and tourist angling and the depopulated rural communities that are ever more reliant on sustainable home-grown jobs.<br/><br/>IFI is currently completing its second five-year corporate plan for presentation to the Minister.  IFI recognises and appreciates that if it is to deliver the vision I have outlined, it will need to change its current <i>modus operandi</i>.  Business as usual will not do.  The 2010-2015 corporate plan outlines in detail the main roles of IFI under five specific headings - fish, habitat, stakeholders, staff and corporate management.  Specifically, the plan envisages considerable change in the way it proposes to assist stakeholders in the process of securing funds from various agencies to carry out developmental work.  Communication and education are the other areas that will require change and improvement to meet the needs and expectations of our stakeholders and deliver on our vision for increased participation and employment.<br/><br/>IFI does not currently have the staff or funding to engage in the number or scale of development projects that will be necessary to provide the kind of boost that the tourism angling measure, TAM, project delivered.  However, we need that type of habitat and infrastructural development if we are to achieve the targets envisaged in NSAD.  We demonstrated that we could work smarter by using technology in our surveillance and protection work.  We now need to enter a constructive partnership with locally based groups and be similarly creative and innovative in our approach to development.<br/><br/>At the start of this statement I provided some contextual information in relation to the changes in staff numbers and the budget of IFI during the past five years.  We have now reached, I hope, a plateau, and can continue the development of the organisation from this base level.  I, as chairman designate, and the board generally are resolute in our focus on improving the ability of the staff of IFI to deliver service in an effective and efficient manner.  With extremely demanding and often dangerous work being the norm for IFI staff, the age profile of the operational personnel is a serious concern.  We have virtually no staff under the age of 30 and in the coming three years, significant numbers of senior operational staff will reach retirement age, leading to commensurate loss of corporate memory and experience. The current corporate plan takes account of this situation.<br/><br/>IFI is currently operating under legislation that is extremely outdated.  We urgently need up to date and fit for purpose fisheries legislation.  The principal Act under which the service operates is the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, which, as its name suggests, is actually a consolidation of previous fisheries Acts, some of which go back to the 1920s.  We look pleadingly to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the hope and anticipation that game-changing, modernising legislation will be provided.<br/><br/>Aquatic invasive species, AIS, have the potential to be environmental wreckers in the short to medium term.  Ireland has yet to work out a clear policy response to this threat.  The increasing mobility of our people and the increased number of visitors to this country will only serve to accelerate the rate of introduction and spread of AIS if appropriate border controls and regulation are not introduced.  This can only be achieved with robust implementation of effective legislation.  If and when D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann provides the legislation, IFI will be an active and willing participant in the co-ordinated response to the threat posed by aquatic invasive species.  The good news is, angling is uniquely placed to deliver benefits across the less-developed areas of the country.  Just imagine what can be achieved with a little further investment targeted at the areas envisaged in the NSAD.<br/><br/>I realise that the primary function of this hearing is to assess my suitability for the role of chairman of IFI.  In that context, I wish to provide to the committee information on my background and the credentials that I hope will prove useful in successfully fulfilling my role.  I have been a public servant for almost 40 years.  I retired from my position as principal of the national school in Cong, County Mayo, in September 2014.</p><p>My career as a public servant gives me a deep understanding of the ethos and governance requirements of public benefit entities and my role as a teacher and principal helped me to develop the vital people and managerial skills necessary to develop and lead a successful team.  It is impossible to live in Cong without having a sense of fishing but my interest in fisheries is more from the perspective of ecology, heritage, history, amenity and economic value, associated flora and fauna and the outdoor healthy recreational value.</p><p> I have been privileged and honoured to serve on the board of IFI since Sept 2013.  I have attended and fully participated in all board meetings and also serve on the development sub-committee, as well as chairman of the audit committee until my appointment as chairman designate.  I have actively participated in the extensive consultation process with angling clubs and federations in regard to the soon to be launched national angling development plan.  I attended all meetings of the national inland fisheries forum where participants avail of the opportunity to outline their concerns and desires to the board and executive of IFI.  During my time on the board I have participated in a number of courses and briefings on governance and, as a member of the audit committee, I have interacted directly with the Comptroller and Auditor General and IFI's internal auditors on matters such as the audit plan, the annual accounts and the findings of various internal audits which have been undertaken.  In this regard, I believe I have a good understanding of the governance requirements involved in chairing the board of a State agency and ensuring it is run in accordance with the principles set out in the revised code of practice for the governance of State agencies.</p><p> During the past few months, the main focus of the board and executive has been on the production and delivery of the 2010&ndash;2015 corporate plan and the national strategy for angling development, NSAD.  Given my interest in and input into both of these documents, it would be fair to say they represent a major part of my vision for IFI over the coming years.  I believe that having a strong link between the development of the corporate plan and the national strategy, as a board member and delivering on it as Chairman, will be of significant benefit to IFI in terms of driving the agency forward and enabling it to reach its potential.</p><p> I retired from my position as principal of the local primary school in 2014 and I am now in a position to devote all the time that is needed to effectively carry out the demanding role of chairman of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I feel confident that I have the knowledge, energy, commitment, enthusiasm and necessary skills to effectively advance the strategic core objectives of the board in the interest of all involved in Inland Fisheries Ireland.  My active participation and involvement in board policy development, as outlined, affords me the knowledge and insight to seamlessly continue the policies, strategies and working relationships that have proved so beneficial to the organization since its inception.  I am pleased and honoured to be nominated as chairman designate of IFI and I hope that this committee will, having considered my submission, be in a position to endorse my appointment.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Before handing over to Deputy Keaveney, I wish to raise the issue of water quality.  Is water quality improving, has it got worse and what effect does it have on angling?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.347" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Gorman" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015092300002#Q00300"><p>Water quality is inextricably linked with the viability of our angling product.  Fish are an aquatic species and water quality is the main determinant of the viability of our fisheries.  Never has the demand on quality water been so great as it is now.  Changing demographics are imposing strains on it, as are increasing industrialisation, urbanisation, intensive agriculture and climate change.  All of these are imposing significant strains on water quality and quantity.  Some of the biggest challenges to fish populations come from poorly regulated, managed and maintained municipal water systems.</p> <p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland recognises that rural environment protection schemes and other environmental programmes undertaken in agriculture have had a significant benefit for water quality and have removed some of the strain.</p><p>We still realise that increasing agricultural production will prove problematic if more controls are not put in place.</p><p> We recognise and welcome the establishment of Irish Water from the perspective that it provides one national body that will be responsible for water quality and, according to the legislation, provide for planned capital investment in the municipal water system, mostly in respect of water going out.  With regard to fisheries and water quality, having 42 towns in which untreated sewage is still discharged into waterways is unsustainable.  Our hope is a single national agency, rather than a plethora of agencies, may be able to address that detrimental situation for angling.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his very strong and committed presentation.  Clearly, he is passionate about this area.  I am sure the industry or pastime is deeply embedded in the heritage of Cong.  Despite Mr. Gorman being a Mayoman, we are neighbours.  His presentation was excellent.  There is a consistent thread or theme on which I would like him to elaborate.  Obviously, there is a very strong business case that is riddled with references to hope, employment, investment and a net return for communities.  This is critical to Mr. Gorman's strategic submission.  It is a labour and project-intensive programme.  I would like him to elaborate on what is required to achieve the maximum return and sweat this product out as much as possible.  What central investment is required for him to have an acceptable level of whole-time equivalents to stay on top of the product and ensure it is being protected with a labour-intensive programme?  How much is needed to bring it up to the required standard?</p> <p>  While I wish Mr. Gorman the very best of luck in the process of his appointment, I have grave concerns about the decrease in the number of whole-time equivalents.  It is a critical regional and rural product.  I am greatly alarmed by the percentage of staff who have been lost, considering the benchmark across the public service.  There is an urban myth that every shore or bank for trout or salmon is worth &euro;800 to the economy.  This is a significant natural environmental resource in which we need to invest significantly and which we need to protect.  As Mr. Gorman highlighted, he has grave concerns about the future viability of the product if we are not investing in programmes based on the integration of elements that have newer and younger dimensions.</p> <p>  I live on the banks of the River Clare.  When Mr. Gorman refers to future legislation, does he believe there is a role for his organisation in enforcement?  HIQA is responsible for the establishment of health standards and engages in enforcement, makes recommendations and establishes timelines.  The Mental Health Commission has a timeline for the enforcement of capital expenditure, upgrading or standards improvements.  These are enforceable in law.  Does Mr. Gorman envisage a comprehensive environmental enforcement role for a statutory authority to achieve investment in something that obviously gives rise to grave concerns?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the slippage in investment and budgets and the decrease in staff numbers.  This results in a diminished authority.</p><p>How does one protect that authority with stronger legislation that has enforcement and give it the authority to set timelines, projections and investments that will be honoured if we are going to protect such a significant natural resource?  Issues that arise include pollution, the need for investment in riverbanks, remedial works and unforeseen crises such as the identification of invasive species like the zebra mussel and so on.  Does the authority have a contingency resource or does it have to knock on the door of the Exchequer?  Can it set an enforcement procedure that precipitates an obligation on behalf of Government to give it the resources to address an immediate crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-23a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Gorman" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015092300002#S00200"><p>The Deputy's observations are music to our ears because this is the point we are making.  We accept that in the economic circumstances in which we found ourselves for the past while, we could not expect to be prioritised over services like health, education and welfare but we now recognise that the rising tide is coming in and may lift all boats.  We believe that for the type of investment we talked about - &euro;25 million over five years - we can produce a much improved protection service and far higher participation in angling for the domestic market and the tourism sector.  In respect of increasing angling levels, the evidence is there from the TAM project from 1994 to 1999 that if one invests in the product, more people will come and spend their money in peripheral areas and it will benefit the economy.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me about the co-ordination of the service we can provide.  Basically, the service is laid out by the 2010 legislation but the Deputy is right.  It could be rationalised.  We seek to protect the river and its fish species but if there is a problem with badgers or foxes up along the river, the National Parks and Wildlife Service will come up behind us doing another patrol.  However, it cannot interfere with some lad reefing the fish population.  Likewise, our officers cannot intervene if they see wildlife getting involved, so there is room for rationalisation and co-ordination.  What we must do for our investment and what we can do for the little investment we are looking for is to follow the model of other countries.  </p> <p>  Angling is a lifelong recreational activity.  It is healthy, outdoors and available to almost everyone in this country because there is no place that does not have a waterway.  I have dealt with young children all my life and I bring them out.  I live within a stone's throw of Lough Mask and can invite anyone out to fish on the lough.  We might see no fish for three days so any youngster will tell you that it is dull, boring and not cool and they will not come again.  If I was willing to do what is being done on the reservoirs in England or what has been done in British Columbia, if we were willing to invest in a mountain and stock it with little lakes with rainbow trout and if I could bring those same two children and guarantee them that I would pay my tenner and they would get two fish, they would be into fishing.  After a while with that experience, they would say, "Bring me out on Lough Mask.  I might only catch one fish in two days but it's different - wild, native brown trout.  Bring me down to the River Feale.  Catch me a wild salmon".   That is how we must do it.  We must move with the times.  We need starter lakes.  </p> <p>  As the Deputy said, we need to be much smarter in the way we do our business.  We need to introduce information and communications technology in all our business.  I will give one example.  Salmon licences are a semi-lucrative form of income for Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Under legislation, we are not allowed to put the salmon licensing system online.  Our officers must go around to hundreds of shops every year and leave in a book of salmon licences.  They must then come back and try to collect the book, the licences and the money.  Of course, when they come back the shop owner is not there so they might have to come back two or three times.  Imagine the waste of resources involved in that process when the fisheries officer could be involved in protection.</p></speech>

There are 70% complete estates which are on the most prestigious rivers in the world and have the potential to cause significant long-term damage to the product.  Does Mr. Gorman envisage, in that legislation, being able to precipitate enforcement guidelines and procedures, for example, with regard to a local authority?  Across a number of agencies, such as IFI, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Health and Safety Authority of Ireland, nobody seems to know which is the senior enforcement authority protecting the natural heritage and wildlife in the rivers and on their banks.  There is a significant falling between stools in terms of where the community can go to address this with an authority and under specific guidelines.</p></speech>

For example, we would be called in to do the scientific work on a river where there has been a pollution spill, or the like.  However, regulation of sewerage and water systems falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and we are just a notifiable body.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for a co-ordinated, methodical approach because we have a vital national asset in water quality, the fish habitat and the recreational amenity.  If we do not protect that and invest in it, like any other asset, it diminishes in value and eventually becomes worthless.</p></speech>

Obviously, from his presentation, Mr. Gorman is a very passionate angler.  While his qualifications as a school principal are noble, I believe it is his passion for angling that is the reason he was a member and is now the chairman-designate of IFI.</p> <p>  To be chairman-designate of IFI is to hold a very responsible position that goes far beyond the passion for angling.  I want to ask a series of questions on how Mr. Gorman sees his potential role as chairman of IFI and how he would gauge IFI's engagement with other statutory agencies that may have a role or may impact on some of the core objectives of IFI, whether that is in co-operation or, perhaps in some cases, in conflict with it.  For example, how would he see IFI's position with respect to agencies such as the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the Naval Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Marine Institute and F&aacute;ilte Ireland?  Mr. Gorman's presentation highlights the value of the angling tourism sector, both inland and sea angling.  How is IFI supported in that respect by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and how would Mr. Gorman foresee engagement between IFI and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in terms of further developing the tourism potential of angling?</p> <p>  Mr. Gorman made a point about outdated legislation, which would always interest members of this committee and may warrant further correspondence.  In terms of funding, there are obviously competing interests within IFI in regard to, for example, stocking, protection and enforcement.  Does Mr. Gorman have a position with regard to increasing or decreasing funding?  Does he believe IFI would get more bang for its buck by investing in stocking, in light of the British Columbia example, rather than, as he has outlined, spending more resources on protection and enforcement, particularly given the limited financial resources?  Where would he see a greater kickback for the angling industry?  Is the current level of funding appropriate and would he foresee it changing?</p><p> Another issue which is becoming increasingly prevalent and into the debate on which IFI is frequently dragged is river dredging, particularly with respect to the potential for flooding.  I do not know when we last had a dredging programme but anecdotal evidence would suggest it was perhaps 50 or 60 years ago.  One of the issues that continually arises among local authorities and agencies such as IFI is resistance to such an approach by some agencies that need to carry out river dredging to mitigate the risk of flooding.  They are not allowed to do so or they are very restricted in the action they can take.  In many cases it is too late.  I would welcome if Mr. Gorman had a view on that and how he would stand over it in his position as chair.</p><p> A very contentious issue, which I have often spoken about when IFI is before the committee, is the developing aquaculture industry offshore.  IFI has clearly made known its position on this industry in some of the publications I have read.  The reality, however, is that, as a committee and as elected Members, some of us must engage in a balancing act with respect to the potential aquaculture provides to coastal communities and also the benefits provided by the angling sector in peripheral areas.  We get conflicting information and studies, including from the Marine Institute.  When I say conflicting, I mean the studies of IFI and the Marine Institute are not in agreement.  As chairman, does Mr. Gorman see a role for greater co-operation or dialogue - or a new dialogue - between the Marine Institute and IFI with respect to coming up with a common position where the interests of both the angling sector and the aquaculture sector would be addressed?  In the area in which I live, one company employs approximately 45 people.  There is no way those 45 individuals would be employed anywhere else if the aquaculture industry did not exist.  I represent them.  A licensing regime is in place and I wish to hear how IFI will engage with it.  I understand the regime is becoming more robust.  I look forward to hearing the opinion of Mr. Gorman in that regard, not just as an angler but in his role as chairman designate of IFI.</p></speech>

Many questions have been asked.  I remind members that I need to get around to everybody.  I urge that the answers be brief.

I do not term myself an angler, I have an interest in the area and in angling but I am not a serious angler.<br/><br/>I recognise the limited employment perspective in respect of aquaculture.  To be quite honest, I see it as being totally detrimental to game angling - salmon and trout angling - particularly in the context of the cages that are placed in  estuaries and riverbeds.  I wish to quote from a recent study from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, published in the very reputable <i>Aquaculture Environment Interactions</i>.  The institute studied 300 scientific papers on the problem of sea lice resulting from aquaculture.  I will be brief, as the Chairman requested.  The conclusion is that at the mouth of spawning rivers, sea lice from aquaculture are responsible for a reduction of between 12% and 29% in the number of salmon returning.  My view and that of IFI-----</p></speech>

Inland Fisheries Ireland would be delighted to engage with BIM and to engage with the Marine Institute because I absolutely believe that we should have a common aim of preserving and enhancing the fisheries.  Let me be quite clear that IFI is not opposed to agriculture.  What we do have a problem with is that it needs to be properly regulated and all regulations need to be enforced - to the extent that when salmon and sea trout are going out in the spring, sea lice levels would be at or close to zero at that time of year.  There needs to be co-operation so we can all coexist.  There has to be a place for all forms of employment and fishing.</p></speech>

Inland Fisheries Ireland would be consulted.  I do appreciate what the Deputy is saying as I have been around the country and have heard of areas where rivers have been decimated.  The IFI has been consulted but when an egg is broken it is not that easy to put it back together.  IFI is often sent for in order to pick up the pieces of the broken egg and put it back together.  I think that IFI and angling groups and bodies should have a greater input into what is going to be done on the point debated.  There is a big demand in areas of the country where flooding is a problem so one has competing interests.  Unfortunately, where people have been flooded in recent years the pleadings of IFI in such situations are not top of the list of priorities.  It is trying to ameliorate the flooding situation.  As politicians, members will realise that when someone&rsquo;s home is being flooded, pleading about fish is not going to get a great hearing.</p></speech>

You are very welcome.  I will be unintentionally rude as I have to leave the meeting soon.  I wish Mr. Gorman the very best, in advance, in his role as chairperson of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  When I was a youngster I used to go around the rivers and lakes of south Leitrim with a fishing rod and a worm and look out for the bailiffs.</p> <p> I attended a meeting with staff in the IFI offices in Drumsna a few weeks ago.  I am aware that the union has campaigned for a restoration of some of the cuts that were made.  Normally one looks for things like policies, practices, equipment and statistics.  These were very impressive but what bowled me over entirely was the enthusiasm of the staff in the IFI Drumsna office.  Seldom have I come across staff who are so enthused about the work they do.  A striking example of this was one lad who came in after the meeting had started.  He had got a call out.  While he was out he had met some German tourists and when they saw him - like when I was a young fella - they probably thought "here&rsquo;s a guy from inland fisheries, we could be in trouble here".  He spoke with them.  They were doing nothing wrong, they took photographs of him and the IFI banner and they were so surprised that an official from IFI would take the time to talk to tourists.  I imagine they will now go and tell their angling friends in Germany about it &ndash; a small yet significant contribution to tourism.  I did not check their teeth to ascertain their ages, some of them may well be middle-aged or beyond but it certainly impressed me.</p> <p> I have some points on the presentation and Mr. Gorman's responses to some questions.  I fully appreciate that the 32% cut in funds and the reduction in staff from 440 to 298 has limited the scope for improvement.</p><p> Mr. Gorman mentioned a couple of times that he pleads repeatedly with the Oireachtas to update the legislation.  Has IFI a summary list or is it working with any individuals within the Department to point out where there are inadequacies in the current legislation, what gaps exist and what types of changes are to be made?  Has he made any submission on that, because I have not seen it?  Would it be possible to get a copy of a submission he has made?</p><p> One of the questions I had intended to ask was with regard to permits.  Mr. Gorman tells us that the problem with the permits can only be resolved when the legislation changes.  Perhaps he would tell me about that.</p><p> The second point I wish to raise is that, anecdotally, people will say that fish stocks are way down.  However, I understand that is not exactly accurate.  Perhaps Mr. Gorman would discuss that, the current position with the fish stocks, what the trends are and whether we are doing enough to spread knowledge about fish stocks and the preservation of our fish stocks.</p><p> I have one point of disagreement with Mr. Gorman.  I understand that having a single unitary business responsible for water quality should be a good idea in theory.  However, I cannot agree that Irish Water, in view of its history, will in any way contribute to the ease of his work.  In fact, it will probably exacerbate the pollution problem by throwing very expensive consultant reports along with untreated sewage into the waters, but that is my position in that regard.</p><p> I welcome Mr. Gorman and it is good to have Dr. Byrne here as well.  He is welcome.  I wish them the best.  What they do is important in financial terms and also for the feel-good factor in Ireland.  Inland fisheries are important.  Perhaps Mr. Gorman will deal with the points I raised.</p></speech>

Yes, there was.  Before I was appointed to the board of IFI, I understand we were on the verge of having fisheries legislation updated.  However, a problem arose at the time.  I understand that Dr. Byrne was invited to a meeting of the committee and he was invited to discuss legislation with the political parties, but a controversy arose about a small facet of the legislation.  I understand the legislation was almost ready to go but the particular facet revolved around a contribution by participants in angling to the funding of the upgrade of the system.  It was left in abeyance after that and it has not been raised since.  I am not really familiar with it but I will ask Dr. Byrne to provide the Deputy with the details of the position with that at the time.</p> <p>  The other question the Deputy asked was about employment.  If we get more employees, of course we can do more protection, more development and, hopefully, raise the profile of the organisation.  That is without doubt.  We would hope that it would be productively used.  I will convey the Deputy's compliments to the staff-----</p></speech>

Nothing beats human interaction.  No amount of computer interaction, machinery or anything else can beat having people.  Soldiers on the ground is the best way to impress and to provide any service.</p> <p>  However, I can again offer a snippet on how that can be improved.  I said that any investment we would get would be used wisely.  If we get extra staff and if we got new, improved legislation, we could have a new situation.  We spend a great deal of our time on one prosecution.  The amount of paperwork involved and trying to get it processed and get it through takes up an inordinate amount of time.  If we had investment in IT, we could create a platform where that could be dealt with.</p><p>We could create an IT format for dealing with reports for the OPW on flooding and similar issues.  The format could be available there rather than people having to start from the ground each time.  The potential exists therefore for some investment in IT and an increase in staff in order to radically improve the output, performance and productivity of the organisation.</p></speech>

His credentials speak for themselves and I have no doubt he will make an excellent chairman of Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p><p>I have a number of questions, but I am sure the chairman designate has been briefed by the CEO, Dr. Byrne, in regard to some of the concerns I raised previously with IFI.  I welcome the chairman designate's assertion that the levels of employment within the organisation are unsustainably low.  I know from meeting employees in the Limerick region recently that they are concerned about this, particularly in regard to part-time staff who are taken on for six months and then laid off for six months.  These staff do an excellent job and I would like to see some progress made on this issue and welcome Mr. Gorman's comment on it.</p><p>I know a change has been suggested in regard to fish counts and how data will be published and it is expected the 2015 data will not now be made available until April 2016.  This creates a bit of a problem for people concerned about stocking levels in rivers.  Mr. Gorman made a passionate assertion in regard to stocking levels and mentioned that in order to have a viable angling industry, we needed to have fish.  I have cited a case umpteen times to the IFI.  I have no axe to grind in this regard.  I am not an angler and know nothing about how to catch fish.  All I know is how to eat them and I find them good.  However, if we look at the statistics in regard to a river I am <i>au fait </i>with, the River Feale, which rises in County Cork, forms a boundary between Limerick and Kerry and flows into the sea at Ballybunion, it is obvious the IFI has information available indicating stocking levels are on a downward trajectory.</p><p>I know the response Mr. Gorman will give me on this - that there is a healthy level of fish within the River Feale.  However, let us look at the River Feale and at other rivers across the country.  In Mr. Gorman's area we have the River Moy.  Intervention has brought that river to the state it is in today where it is making a massive contribution to the local economy.  It cost significant money to make that intervention, but it was worthwhile paying it and it has paid a dividend to the local economy.  I was in the Chairman's part of the country over the summer and every second town and village had a fishing tackle shop, demonstrating the contribution the industry is making in the west of Ireland.  There is no reason the industry cannot make that kind of contribution in other parts of the country, but we need somebody to speak out honestly in regard to what is happening with our rivers.</p><p>At a time when there were no sewage treatment works, no regulations on agricultural effluent and lime used as fertiliser all over the country, we had more fish in the River Feale than we have now.  Perhaps Mr. Gorman can explain this to me.  I do not want to hear about El Ni&ntilde;o, changes in the north Atlantic drift, weather patterns or what is happening off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland or any of that.  I just want to know why, when Limerick, Kerry and Cork county councils are making improvements to sewage treatment works, when farmers operate under strict restrictions in terms of protecting rivers, when anglers are taking massive hits in regard to what they can catch and are very conscious of their role as custodians of the rivers, fish numbers are reducing.  Perhaps Mr. Gorman can cast some light on that.</p><p>In response to Deputy Harrington, Mr. Gorman mentioned flooding.  When the village of Athea in County Limerick, which is on the River Gale, a tributary of the River Feale, flooded in 2008, Limerick County Council arrived in to remove what can only be described as industrial-type debris from under the bridge, which had been blocked for years because the channel is not maintained by anybody.  The OPW does not maintain it because it is not an OPW channel.  The fisheries people arrived then and wanted the debris returned to the river.</p><p>That is the kind of public relations farce - fiasco - that occurs when it comes to people's property being flooded.  In the hierarchy of things, river gravel is treated as being more important.</p><p> What is the IFI going to do about inland fisheries?  Does Mr. Gorman think it is the responsibility of the wrong Department?  Does he think responsibility for the marine lies with the wrong Department?  I know nothing about how to catch fish but one Department deals with salmon in the Atlantic, while another deals with what happens in the mouth of the River Shannon.  One Government agency deals with the same fish in the Atlantic, while another deals with those around Mount Collins.  It is absolutely bizarre to have two competing Departments with two totally different agendas and two competing Government agencies with two totally different agendas.  Throw in the local authorities on top of this, as well as Irish Water, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Office of Public Works and local representatives with their own axe to grind.</p></speech>

Add all of these competing interests together and what are forgotten are the fish, the marine and life on the river.  It is amazing that there are fish in rivers, given the number of interests involved.  Every single one of them has a statutory interest and they are all competing against each other.  As Deputy Noel Harrington said, they would not agree on what day of the week it was, but while that is happening, stock numbers are falling through the floor.  As in the Feale, the Deel and other rivers in County Limerick, the fish will be wiped out and there will be nothing left.  All the next generation will have is B&eacute;aloideas - their grandfather's recollection of what it was to stand on the bank of the River Feale with a rod.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Gorman give me a straight answer?  In Lanesborough there is Asian clam.  In Shannonbridge and Carrick-on-Shannon there is the same problem.  There are some in the River Barrow also.  People are angered and frustrated around the country when they go to Inland Fisheries Ireland about a problem, only to be told that it is the National Parks and Wildlife Service that deals with it.  They go around in circles.  If an invasive species was found in any river in the country, would IFI be responsible?  Would the National Parks and Wildlife Service be responsible?  I want a statement on who would be responsible.  On conservation and protection, the effort made by IFI and the National Parks and Wildlife Service is the most pathetic I have ever seen made in my life.  There were supposed to be reports on what was happening, but they were delayed, although I believe they may be out now.</p> <p>  Around the country, during the years, we brought thousands and thousands of English anglers here.  At a time when the sterling exchange rate is very positive for a person coming here from England, we have not marketed our product, rivers and country.  In Rooskey, compared to the number who came at one time, the place is dead.  If one moves right along the River Shannon or any of the rivers by its side, the story is the same.  We talk about flooding, but when there is a problem such as a blockage, everyone says what cannot be done, but there is nobody there to say what actually can be done to solve the problem.</p><p>We are all great at saying one cannot touch that as it might affect something but it is all right if the farmer&rsquo;s animals drown.  Someone must step up to the mark and take responsibility.</p><p> Do administrative staff in Inland Fisheries Ireland&rsquo;s depots have vehicles supplied to them or is it just staff examining rivers?  I have seen some of the vehicles used by the agency in the west.  If one were trying to catch a poacher in one of them, one would not be going too far.  I note from photos of vehicles parked at the agency&rsquo;s main offices that they are mainly four-wheel drives.</p><p> There was a strategy to remove pike from inland fisheries as the main concentration was on trout and salmon.  If one examines good practice in other European countries, such a policy has been abandoned because the statistics did not stack up in favour of such action.  Will there be a change in policy in that regard?</p></speech>

As chairman of the board, it would be inappropriate for me to get involved in management.  Management is paid to manage.  From my experience, it is doing the job well but it is up to it to answer specific questions of that nature on vehicles.</p> <p>  The strategy on pike will be reviewed in two or three years&rsquo; time.  The agreement is that after checking the scientific advice and consulting widely with anglers and other affected groups, there will continue to be a pike cull in the wild brown trout lakes, of which there are 12, located mainly in the west.  Until that policy is reviewed, it will continue.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, we need specific and definite legislation on invasive species.  Until such time as legislation outlining which group is responsible is produced, there will be recurrences of the situation relating to Asian clam as outlined by the Deputy.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, everyone kicked the ball around - pass the parcel was played.  Eventually, Inland Fisheries Ireland was left holding that baby.  We are still cutting <i>lagarosiphon major</i>in the lake at a cost of between &euro;400,000 and &euro;450,000 a year.  We are only containing it and will never win against it.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has not been provided with any designated funding for this.  After that experience, I would contend that the NPWS should have taken on that responsibility rather than Inland Fisheries Ireland being left holding the baby.  We will be reluctant to do take a similar approach on the next occasion.</p></speech>

When the figures for the Feale are examined at micro level it is one of the better rivers.  It is not closed to angling because the standing scientific committee work out on the basis of counter-data that the Feale exceeds its conservation level, therefore so much fish are available for exploitation.  It is above that level and they are allowed to catch a certain number of fish in the Feale.  I cannot answer the question on the counter-data, that is a management matter and I suggest the Deputy refer it to management.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the graph is down and that there is quite a danger in the next generation that we will have b&eacute;aloideas, a distant memory of when it used to be a good fishery, if we do not take serious steps to change many things.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  Many would say, which is very controversial but I will kick the ball into the pitch, if we want to maintain these rivers long term we must go to hatcheries.</p></speech>

We are responsible, as I understand it, for inshore fisheries going out for a few miles and after that the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency takes over.  At least in a field there is a boundary but it is senseless out at sea, to mark where one begins and the other ends.  Many of the things we do are senseless.  There should be a rationalisation of how all these services are provided.  We can only work, unfortunately, within the legislation and the regulations.  Much of that is very prescriptive and very wasteful.</p></speech>

The quality of the fishing available to them has declined.  I suppose all the plethora of agencies that Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan referred to have to take responsibility for that.  As a nation we have not protected, developed and invested in that great asset that could provide a livelihood in rural depopulated areas, places where companies such as Intel and IBM will never come to employ anyone.  If the asset of angling tourism was invested in, nurtured and developed it would provide sustainable jobs.  It is the only thing, along with agriculture, that will provide the jobs.</p></speech>

Does IFI co-operate and liaise with F&aacute;ilte Ireland?</p><p>Mr. Gorman mentioned the depletion of stocks, of which I am very well aware in my own county of Kerry, as is Deputy Patrick O'Donovan in his area.  Stock rates are falling dramatically in the Feale, Laune, Maine and Flesk rivers, among others.  In the adjoining county of Cork there are reservations about stock depletion in the River Blackwater, a renowned salmon fishing river.  Are regular audits carried out to monitor the position?</p><p> My next point is on amenity areas, in particular, angling facilities for disabled people.  I reiterate what has been said about progression of the building and development of fishing tourism.  We should look very much at what is happening in Mr. Gorman's and the Chairman's county, but we should also look at the model in Scotland where amenities on rivers are very well structured and developed to attract tourists and there is a huge tourism industry.</p><p> How much liaison is there with Irish Water?  It is shameful to see raw sewage entering rivers.  In this day and age, it is not acceptable and the problem needs to be worked on immediately.  I ask for the appropriate treatment plants to be provided.  I am sure that, through PPPs and other means, Irish Water, with local councils, would be able to install them as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Forty years ago, when English and Scottish angling tourists came to my home town of Carlingford and stayed for one week to fish the lakes of counties Monaghan and Cavan, the benefit to the local economy was enormous.  This has not happened for the past 30 years and I would love to see it happening again.  While I do not know why it is not happening, there is a major opportunity to attract angling tourists from England and continental Europe.  Mr. Gorman might comment on this.  What should he do in order that, following his tenure, he will be able to say he achieved his aims?</p></speech>

For the small sum of &euro;25 million over four or five years, we can get multiples in return.  Where I come from, Cong, the situation was the same as that mentioned by Senator Terry Brennan.  It was populated mostly by British anglers who were high spenders and sustained jobs in the area.</p> <p>  We co-operate with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the marketing of the tourism product.  However, to be honest, it recognises that just 2% of visitors to the country are anglers.  The big focus is on the Wild Atlantic Way.  If something is located along the corridor of the Wild Atlantic Way, it is promotable because it will yield a result.  Anything else is not quite as high on F&aacute;ilte Ireland's list of priorities.</p></speech>

As I said, in spite of it not being politically correct to say so, we see it as a positive development.  Rather than interacting with the disparate views of several county councils and local authorities, there is now one body that can, I hope, be held responsible for the dreadful situation to which the Senator referred, the 42 towns in which sewage is being discharged into harbours.</p> <p>  This is going to be the responsible body.  Again, as with fisheries, if we want a result, we will have to be prepared to put our hand in our pocket.  If we starve it of resources, we cannot expect it to deliver its remit.  Where I come from, a rural area, we have no problem.  Water is viewed in a different way.  If I pollute Lough Mask, the water coming out of my tap is polluted.  I see a direct correlation between the quality of the water out there and what I am using.</p></speech>
