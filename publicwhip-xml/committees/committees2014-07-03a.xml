Horse Sport Ireland gets funding from the Irish Sports Council as a governing body which means it comes under the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In the past it might also have received money from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Both of those Departments are probably relevant to the body.</p></speech>

We would like a detailed reply on its activities and an annual report if one is available.  Then we can decide on some of the issues that have been raised with us.</p><p>  Could we agree the agenda for Thursday, 10 July 2014?  We will deal with the 2012 Appropriation Accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General - Vote 20, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Chapter 8, management of outsourced safety cameras.  Is that agreed?

The CEO of the CRC had resigned with effect from 6 December 2013 and the interim administrator also carried out many of the duties normally performed by the CEO.<br />The appointment formally ended on 31 March 2014 and the final report was submitted to the director general of the HSE in May 2014.  It is important to note that the HSE did not have concerns in regard to the quality of services or the quantum of services being delivered under the service arrangement.  The problems identified at the CRC related to governance and general compliance issues.<b></b>I must emphasise for the committee that the interim administrator did not have any specific powers or legal standing.  However, the exemplary co-operation forthcoming from staff at the CRC enabled him to fulfil the roles assigned to him in an effective manner.<br />The interim administrator was not appointed as an inspector or investigator and was not authorised to embark on a formal investigative process entailing the formal taking of evidence by way of interviews with a view to making any findings of wrongdoing.  In the event of any wrongdoing being alleged, reported or suspected, it would have to be reported to the appropriate authority.  The interim administrator did not find it necessary to refer any matter to any third party or authority.  However, there were governance difficulties at the top of the organisation relating to certain practices, questionable procedures, wrong interpretations of compliance requirements and poor judgment. <br />Access was afforded to all available documents and records.  The overall standard of record-keeping was good and the normal financial transactions, in particular, were properly supported or vouched.  There were some exceptions in the report which are referenced. <br />Boardmatch Ireland was engaged to assist in the recruitment of a new board of governors for the CRC and a board of directors for the Friends and Supporters of the CRC and the continuing members of the CRC and the Friends and Supporters of the CRC co-operated fully in the appointment of the new boards. <br />In regard to the operation of service arrangements, it has been recommended that the HSE should assign operational responsibility for each of the larger non-statutory agencies to a designated HSE manager.<br />The correspondence between the HSE and CRC board on the application of public pay policy and related matters commenced in 2009 and continued until 2013 when all of the CRC governors resigned.  A full declaration of all pay arrangements has now been made to the HSE by the CRC and the revised administrative and governance arrangements in place will ensure good practice and compliance with public pay policy in the future.<br />It is still necessary to red-circle salaries in a small number of cases for further review and deliberation by the new board but the use of an artificial split of the salaries by the CRC that facilitated the avoidance by senior staff of the full impact of public sector pay cuts has ended.  The former CEO, as the person charged with the executive responsibility for the administration of the CRC, would have been familiar with public pay policy and moneys paid to him in excess of the properly calculated reduced rate for the period January 2010 to the date of his termination in June 2013 should be recovered.  Members of the committee will be familiar with the broad terms of the former CEO's termination agreement as it was discussed by the committee at its meeting on 16 January 2014.  In the report, major difficulties with the package, from an employer standpoint, are identified. <br />There was no ambiguity around the need, under the service arrangement, to obtain the HSE's approval to the subsequent filling of the vacant CEO position in 2013.  It is difficult not to conclude that the board knowingly ignored the terms of the service arrangement and its 2009 commitment to the HSE when it proceeded with the appointment of a replacement CEO without HSE approval and offered a salary in excess of the approved pay scale. <br />Two defined benefit pension schemes are operated at the CRC - the voluntary hospital superannuation scheme, VHSS, and the Central Remedial Clinic pension and death benefit plan, CRC plan.  The report states that, from an employer standpoint, the CRC has enjoyed substantial benefits from the VHSS arrangement.  The new board now governs the CRC and it has assumed responsibility for its operations.  The CRC board and the new Friends and Supporters of the CRC board are also reviewing company governance to ensure best practice in the future.<br />Undertakings related to the CRC, namely, the Friends and Supporters of the CRC, the Care Trust and CRC Medical Devices Limited are referred to in the report of the administrator.  None of these undertakings is in receipt of public funds and they are not section 38 or section 39 organisations.  However, a number of big ticket items are referenced in the report which impacted on CRC finances and decision-making.  These items include forgiveness of loans to the Care Trust, an unsecured interest free long-term loan of &euro;3 million to the CRC to assist in pension liabilities and a donation of &euro;700,000 to the CRC to finance the termination agreement entered into with its CEO. <br />In regard to the Friends and Supporters of the CRC, the HSE was not aware of the funds being accumulated by the Friends and Supporters of the CRC.  It is recommended that the current Friends and Supporters of the CRC functions should be transferred to the CRC board as soon as is practicable and, ultimately, the company should be wound up. <br />In the case of CRC Medical Devices Limited, it is recommended that the process of winding up that company in an orderly manner should proceed, preferably with the assistance of its directors and company secretary. <br />The Care Trust has built a successful lottery for the benefit of the CRC, Rehab and the Mater hospital and it has consistently generated significant funds for the benefit of the CRC.  The Care Trust has its own governance arrangements and management structure.  It is stated in the report that the Care Trust should be urged to go beyond the minimum company law requirements and publish more details of lottery proceeds and associated expenses.<br />The report of the interim administrator was accepted in full by the HSE and, since its publication on 19 June 2014 by the HSE, I understand the newly appointed board of the CRC has met to develop a comprehensive plan of action to address legacy and other issues identified in the report.  The HSE will support the new board and CEO in their efforts to restore confidence in the CRC as a charitable organisation delivering quality services.  The HSE is strongly committed to addressing all pertinent matters referenced in the report under the governance arrangements now in place.<br />Clarification was sought by Mr. Brian Conlon in regard to the report.  May I read that into the record as part of this statement?</p></speech>

The points raised are disputed and no change has been made to the report.  It has also been stated in the response by the HSE that, although presented as errors, the points made are more in the nature of cavils and, as such, even if their validity were accepted <i>in toto</i>, they would not alter the narrative of the report, the report's conclusions or the report's recommendations.  <br />Mr. Conlon raised two points in regard to the appendices to the report.  It should be noted that the appendices as presented in the report are exactly as found - that is, a true copy as they have been presented and they have not been altered by the interim administrator in any way.  The source of each appendix is also identifiable.  It is, therefore, not strictly necessary to revisit the appendices.

I introduce my colleague who is with me today, Ms Stephanie Manahan, the new CEO of the Central Remedial Clinic.  The Central Remedial Clinic, Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic, the Care Trust and Central Remedial Clinic Medical Devices Limited are all mentioned in the report.  I point out that they are all separate legal entities.  I am here today as chair of one of those entities - albeit closely intertwined with the others - and will primarily address the issues in relation to the CRC.  I will touch upon the other entities as far as I can.  The standing and relationship among all these legal entities is currently the subject of discussion and consideration among the boards concerned.<br />The new board of the CRC received Mr. Cregan's report on Tuesday, 19 January 2014 and considered it at its meeting the following day.  As the new chairman of a new board, I consider that the report is clear, fact-based and helpful.  I hope the committee agrees.  In summary, the following emerges from the report.  There is no question but that the competence, professionalism and care provided by staff is of the highest quality.  There are sound financial systems in place.  The CRC delivered on its services arrangement obligations and there are no apparent obstacles in place to the HSE and CRC entering into similar arrangements for the foreseeable future.  However, governance did not meet modern standards and the report reveals that the board did not follow the commitment it gave to the HSE on the remuneration and appointment of senior executives.<br />The root of its problems and the reason we all find ourselves here today related to the application of public pay and CEO recruitment policies at the CRC.  As stated in the report, whether deliberately or unintentionally:<blockquote>In regard to the application of Public Pay and CEO Recruitment Policies the CRC, notwithstanding its 2009 commitment to the HSE, approved a series of appointments to the Executive Team without consulting the HSE; and the CRC artificially divided senior management and administrative salaries into two categories &ndash; Agreed HSE and Private CRC - and used the artificial split of the salaries to facilitate the avoidance by senior staff of the full impact of public sector pay cuts.</blockquote>The report further states:<blockquote>There was no ambiguity around the need, under the service arrangement, to obtain the HSE's approval to the filling of a senior management position.  It is difficult not to conclude that the board knowingly ignored the terms of the service arrangement and its commitment to the HSE in 2009.</blockquote>This was facilitated by a number of undesirable governance practices whereby members and board members served several companies in several different capacities and the distinctions between companies and their boards may have been allowed to become blurred.  We cannot change the past but we can put measures in place to ensure that this could never happen again.  The new board is here to support Ms Stephanie Manahan in leading the organisation in her role as CEO.  Together, we are determined to drive a culture of good practices, ensure good policies are in place and above all ensure transparency and accountability.  We do this to underpin the delivery of quality services to all of our clients and service users and to establish comprehensive engagement with all our stakeholders.<br />I am more than happy to return to the committee to provide further updates or for any member of the committee to contact me with any queries in the future.  What we hope to do today is to give the committee a sense of the steps we have taken and to set out our action plan.  Some of the issues facing us &ndash; particularly those concerning individuals &ndash; will require expert advice before final decision making.  To take governance first, a new board of governors of the Central Remedial Clinic is now in place.  The new board is competency-based.  I have sent on copies by way of background material of the biographies of each member of the team.  Each individual member has been identified and selected on the basis of that individual member's skills, expertise and experience drawn from relevant disciplines and different industry sectors.  The current composition of the board is on our website.  I say &quot;current composition&quot; because the board is committed to continually examining its needs versus its skill set and will consider appointing new members as required.  We are also examining ways of letting our clients and staff get more involved in providing input to the board.<br />The board has set up the following work groups and committees: a remuneration committee charged with ensuring that the remuneration for senior members of the CRC is open, fair and transparent; an audit committee charged with oversight of financial reporting and disclosure; a committee on fundraising governance, structures and best practices; and a working group to review the current memorandum and articles of association with a view to bringing them into line with current legislation and best practices including term limits for board members to allow new blood to be constantly added to bring in fresh ideas and challenge existing practices.  I note that the remuneration committee was involved in the appointment of Ms Manahan who was appointed following an open and transparent recruitment process using the Public Appointments Service with effect from 1 June 2014.  Ms Manahan has extensive experience in the health sector both in the UK and Ireland and was most recently deputy hospital manager at James Connolly Memorial Hospital.<br />Friends and Supporters of the CRC, as a separate legal entity now has a separate and independent board, chaired by Mr. Tom Quinn.  Mr. Quinn is also on the board of CRC but is the only member from F&amp;amp;S.  I believe this is prudent.  Mr. Quinn excuses himself from meetings during discussion of any area where there would be a conflict of interest, real or perceived.  As part of its deliberations, the F&amp;amp;S board recently wrote to me and informed me that it had resolved that its 50% shareholding in the Care Trust Limited should be transferred with immediate effect to the Central Remedial Clinic; that all revenues accruing to F&amp;amp;S from the Care Trust Limited from a current date should be paid direct to the Central Remedial Clinic, and that it should request its legal advisers to prepare all the necessary legal documentation to give effect to these resolutions.  This offer is being considered by the relevant subcommittee of the full CRC board and will subsequently be considered by the board itself.  I welcome the general thrust of these resolutions.  In addition, we have asked our audit committee to meet with our auditors, Ernst and Young, to understand how we best reflect the relationship between CRC and F&amp;amp;S in our 2013 books so that anyone who examines the accounts of CRC will be immediately made aware of the existence of F&amp;amp;S.<br />Given the current separation of the two boards and our committee on fundraising governance, structures and best practices, we are in the interim implementing a process by which funds can only be drawn down on foot of an agreed and approved business case signed off by both boards.  In the meantime, the CRC board has resolved as an additional layer of transparency that all donations raised by the CRC itself in 2014 will be put in a separate bank account.  Those funds may only be accessed on foot of two of the three authorised board level signatories.  We are committed to full transparency and accountability so that all our funding partners, including the HSE and our donors, can see how all monies are spent.  CRC Medical Devices is a subsidiary of F&amp;amp;S which has had no directors since the resignations in December last.  I understand that F&amp;amp;S is in the process of appointing directors to allow it to regularise legalities surrounding the company, pay off outstanding invoices and wind the company down in an orderly fashion.<br />I trust the committee will appreciate that there are several constraints to my going into executive and senior administrative pay arrangements in any great detail at this time.  However, I would like to make the following comments.</p> <p>On payments to former chief executive office, Mr. Paul Kiely, it is the intention of the board to write to Mr. Kiely about the report&rsquo;s finding.  The calculations of payments to the former chief executive officer, however, are complex and require careful consideration and legal advice prior to any decisions on how to proceed.  Issues such as the full implementation of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, as well as the Croke Park and the Haddington Road agreements, on the full salary, calculation of severance payments, retirement age and other matters all need to be looked at prior to any contact with Mr. Kiely.</p><p> On other executive and senior administrative pay arrangements, the new board is determined all salaries and appointments will be at levels consistent and agreed with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  A small number of senior management pay levels are outside the approved HSE scales.  Mr. Cregan&rsquo;s report recommended these salaries be red-circled until 2015 to allow some limited time for the new board and chief executive officer to review management structures, job descriptions and executive pay arrangements.  We consider this is appropriate as it gives us time to develop a new strategic plan for the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, for 2015 and beyond.  We already know the current management structure has to change as key gaps need to be filled and several retirements will take place in 2015.  I am willing to attend the committee again, either formally or informally, to update it as we go through these processes.</p><p> From our early beginnings in 1951 to today, the CRC has grown to be one of the largest organisations dedicated to the well-being and health of people with physical disabilities.  The legacy issues we are discussing today were not of the making of the staff.  They were caused by governance issues at the top of the organisation.  Staff at the CRC continue to provide our clients with the services they need and deserve in the professional manner they have come to expect.</p></speech>

I wish it to be recognised that I am here voluntarily in a spirit of co-operation in the hope of supplying honest answers to questions raised and, above all, enabling the clinic to fully restore its function and reputation.  I must state also that the former board is no longer an entity but a group of private individuals.  Accordingly, it must be clear that anything that I say here today is an account of my own personal opinions, observations and actions.  I am not representing other former members, nor speaking on their behalf.<br />The CRC is a great organisation.  It has been providing world-class services to disabled people for 63 years and should be recognised as a great success story.  It has an extraordinary skilled, dedicated, hard-working and compassionate staff, as well as extraordinary clients, children, parents and families who also contribute so much themselves to the success of the clinic.  There is a new board in place now, as well as a chief executive officer, well qualified and generous people who will give their time freely, as did the former board, to bring the clinic forward to new and great achievements.  I ask everyone, politicians, the media and the public, to support them and help the CRC in every way to return to the excellence and dignity that it has for so long enjoyed.  This must be our foremost objective.<br />CRC has been a presence in my life since my earliest memories.  My mother, Lady Valerie Goulding, founded it when I was four years old and ran it on a full-time voluntary basis for its first 30 years.  I first shook a collection box for CRC from the age of 15 and did so on various streets in many towns across the country.  Due to these personal and family connections, the difficulties and damage of the past year leave me with a feeling of deep sadness and regret.  I must mention again something that seems to be widely ignored or perhaps disbelieved.  We took neither pay nor expenses of any kind in connection with CRC.  The governors were volunteers, receiving no material benefit whatsoever themselves.  We have incurred considerable expenses ourselves and contributed to numerous fund-raising ventures, not ever claiming anything back.  I state again this only to reinforce the fact there is no motive, no incentive and no benefit for any director to see anyone in the CRC receive excessive payments.  It would have been perfect for the board if all staff were to be paid by the same approved scales.<br />With a few exceptions, I generally welcome Mr. Cregan&rsquo;s report.  It positively and unambiguously exonerates the board from the major accusations that have been raised.  It finds there was no wrongdoing and no need for further investigation, which slightly makes me wonder why we are here.  There was sound financial control, as well as robust and sound control of credit card use.  The standard of record and file keeping was good.  The audited accounts of CRC and Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic were accessible and transparent.  The care trust had built up an infrastructure that contributed significant funds for the benefit of CRC.  Employee contracts could not be unilaterally broken without significant risk.  Management salaries were fully declared to the HSE as late as May 2012.  Service arrangement obligations were met.  There was co-operation in forming the new board.<br />There is one item, however, which I view as seriously and damagingly incorrect, namely the allegation that the company had then been virtually abandoned by all its previous governors, company secretary and chief executive officer.  It is clear that Mr. Cregan has not received a full understanding of the events that led to the board&rsquo;s departure and the popular perception that the board, having decided it had done something wrong, had run away.  Senior people in the HSE will know in fact the board was effectively dismissed at a few hours&rsquo; notice.  At a meeting in HSE headquarters on 13 December 2013, the then chairman was informed that unless all the board resigned forthwith, HSE funding would be withdrawn from the clinic.  The resignations were tendered directly because the board&rsquo;s position was untenable, its primary concern being not to allow any impediment to the continued funding by the HSE of the CRC, which would effectively shut down the clinic.  This subsequently put the legal status of the HSE&rsquo;s running of the clinic into dubious legal territory.  To sort this out, it had to request myself and others to facilitate this which was willingly given in the clinic&rsquo;s interest.<br />The Cregan report identifies an issue I believe to be at the heart of the problems raised:<blockquote>It should have been clear to the CRC from 2009 that the environment in which it operated had changed significantly and the maintenance of an attitude of provider independence could not prevail in the long run.</blockquote>The board was very concerned about independence.  CRC is not a branch of the HSE.  Board members did have a strong culture of independence.  There was a justifiable feeling that the exercise of this independence was the key to much of the CRC&rsquo;s success over 63 years.  My mother, the founder, was not known for bending to other people&rsquo;s rules.  Perhaps, as it goes back a long way, that is the origin of some of these problems.  We wished to exercise provider independence only to achieve two primary goals, namely the continued provision of excellent disability services, along with the ability to expand them further, as well as the achievement of this in a cost-efficient manner.  However, on reflection, it is judicious to admit to having pushed this independence too far in light of acknowledged and written commitments to the HSE.  More determined co-operation from both parties should have alleviated this situation.<br />High executive pay was a real difficulty.  I believe most of the current difficulties arose essentially from the legacy of climbing down from the apparent economic boom of the early years of the century and the difficulty of one body, the HSE, funding a job whose contract of employment is with a different body, the CRC.  Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general of the HSE, stated everyone must understand that all employees in section 38 organisations should be considered as government employees.  He may understand it but I, and the rest of us, find that hard because normally an employee is an employee of the company with whom they have a contract of employment.</p> <p>This is one of the difficulties.  I will give a brief account of how these salary arrangements arose.  Prior to 2009, all management salaries, including that of the CEO, were declared by the CRC and fully funded by HSE.  In 2009, the HSE announced that it was introducing new consolidated scales for senior management.  These resulting benchmarking levels were substantially below some rates already being paid.  It was agreed at a meeting with the HSE in June 2009 that the clinic would independently pay the outstanding difference to those receiving salaries above the sanctioned rate - what are wrongly referred to as "top-ups".  That expression is difficult because it suggests that-----</p></speech>

That is not the case.  They were never &quot;topped up&quot;.  It was simply continuing what they had been paid fully by the HSE until these new scales came in.  While the HSE had backed out of part-payment of these salaries, the clinic had contracts of employment with these individuals which are legally binding.  The board was advised that it could not unilaterally break these contracts without expensive compensation and the risk of legal action in addition to severe disruption of clinical function.  The board's view, which was rejected by the HSE at the time, is now supported in the Cregan report by the following statement:<blockquote><br />It would be unwise for an Interim Administrator (or a Board of Governors) to unilaterally break existing employee contractual arrangements and, thereby, expose the CRC to significant financial risk.  It should be remembered that the cuts in public sector pay required the passing of the FEMPI legislation.</blockquote>Any legal person will back that up.  A recently published article by Professor Michael Doherty from the Department of Law at NUI Maynooth states:<blockquote>The core of the employment contract is that in general, terms agreed cannot be altered unilaterally by one side to its benefit, or to the detriment of the other.  Pay cuts, for example, cannot be simply &quot;imposed&quot; on unwilling employees.</blockquote>This article goes on to warn the HSE specifically to be cautious about this issue.  <br />The board's decision to continue to pay these long-established contracts is, for example, exactly what the Government or the HSE have done in the case of medical consultants' contracts.  They found that while they wanted to reduce these levels, they were unable to do so and had to continue them.  Replacements were allowed to come in a newer level but those on the higher level were allowed to stay to the end of their contracts.  We are simply following practice that has been done elsewhere.  It was agreed at a meeting with the HSE in June 2009 that the clinic would pay the difference from other sources while maintaining the longer-term objective of bringing pay levels into line with the consolidated scales.  Salary levels were also reported to the HSE since 2009, as previously denied, unfortunately, but now specified in the Cregan report from 25 May 2012.  This problem does not just relate to the CRC, and it is strange that it has been highlighted as such.  The director general of the HSE confidently announced last December that by the end of January all section 38 salaries would be brought into line with approved scales.  Six months later at this committee, he conceded that there are still 58 employees whose salaries remain in excess.  When asked why this was the case, he cited &quot;contracts and legal restraints,&quot; which is exactly the problem we have been trying to deal with.  There does not seem to be an easy solution for anyone.  <br />However, it seemed to me that within our pay structure, with these high pay levels coming from the boom years, we had an exceptional anomaly, which was the pay level of the chief executive.  I took action on that question due to unease about this salary level in the charity sector and brought it to the board hoping to address it in some practical way while respecting contractual constraints.  I held talks with Mr. Kiely and an agreement was reached and approved by the board which reduced the enormous contractual liability of &euro;2.08 million by &euro;1.34 million over the next six years.  I went home thinking that this was a marvellous success for the clinic.  Although it was uncomfortable to have to give such a large payment to one individual, it was a huge step towards conformity with HSE scales.  It was, in fact, a normal commercial buy-out of a contract.  <br />I will go through the sources of the CRC's income, which comes largely from the HSE.  Some of it comes from voluntary sources.  The CRC also generates independent income.  From 2004 to 2012, the clinic accumulated revenues of &euro;34.7 million.  Breaking that down, &euro;13.12 million came from revenues and activities within the clinic; &euro;19.16 million came from commercial lotteries operated by The Care Trust, which should not be confused by Rehab lotteries; and &euro;2.46 million was in investment income.  The last two items are held by F&amp;amp;S, a company whose purpose is to hold funds for capital projects and a reserve against future shortfalls in normal operating costs and State funding reductions.  It makes payments on a roughly annual basis to the CRC to cover any deficit and special projects.  This money is used to provide additional services to people with disabilities.  Every cent of it goes towards those purposes.  It included co-funded projects with the HSE, such as those in Waterford Regional hospital, and also with the Department of Education and Skills, such as Scoil Mochua.  Without these matching funds raised for the CRC, many of these valuable projects which gave so much aid to disabled people would simply not have happened.  The CRC used a small portion of its independent funds to achieve the settlement and associated savings with Mr. Kiely without recourse to either State or voluntary funding.<br />These past few months have been very difficult for me personally.  I can only apologise for any shortcomings or inadequacies on my part in dealing with the issues that so affected staff and clients of the clinic over the past year.  Difficult issues confronted us and difficult decisions were made, which the committee may not like.  I have, however, a clear conscience that nothing I did or failed to do resulted from any motive other than the best interests of the clinic.  I believe this to be true for the other former board members.  I still cannot now specify how a better outcome could have been achieved, given the circumstances and options open to us at the time.  I am also disappointed that the HSE, in pursuing these issues, forced a position on the CRC board that it now accepts cannot be implemented.  It has in the process caused serious damage to public perception of the CRC and to the charity sector in general.  I believe the HSE should correct the public record in this regard.  I look forward to answering any questions to the best of my ability.</p></speech>

I regret the fact that several people the committee has invited are not here today, but I hope they will come in at a later date.  I will start with Mr. Cregan, because it is really his report that has sparked the discussion here today.  What he has done as interim administrator is fantastic.  What he has done for the CRC is great.  The changes that have taken place in a very short period of time have been prompted and stimulated by what he has done.  We are seeing the beginning of a renaissance in the CRC, which Mr. Cregan has done much to contribute to.</p><p>  Was Mr. Cregan the HSE's man in the CRC?  He was sent in to do three specific things, some of which were current and some of which involved looking at the past.  He was to investigate the past.  I am bit uneasy about the fact that he is employed by the HSE and came in and made judgments about his employer, which was in direct conflict with the old board of the CRC.</p> <p>Does he feel uncomfortable about it?</p></speech>

I made it very clear that I would go in as administrator and report what I had found, irrespective of whom it affected, and that I would try to bring forward a report from which everybody could learn lessons.  I was not appointed as an investigator.  I identified issues for the attention of the CRC, the HSE, Friends and Supporters of the CRC and the Care Trust.  My discomfort was related to my legal position - I was not an officer of the CRC - and I took legal advice on what I could do.  Having said that, I did not have legal standing; the CRC staff were excellent, co-operative and enabled me to do what I had to do.</p></speech>

To bring a level of public confidence to the administration of the CRC, we sent in an interim administrator, Mr. Cregan, to carry out some of the CEO's duties and provide a review.

Based on what was required there and then, the assessment at the time was that Mr. Cregan would be an appropriate person to go in and act as interim administrator.  In the absence of a board, having come under such great public scrutiny, staff of the CRC were very anxious.  Our overall concern was the requirement to deliver a service to the people who depended on the services provided by the CRC.  In order to do it very quickly, Mr. Cregan was asked to go in as interim administrator.</p></speech>

A new service level arrangement to strengthen the governance and funding provided to section 38s was only introduced in its infancy towards the end of 2009 and has been worked on ever since.  In 2010 or 2011, an additional amendment was made to it that any funding that comes from other sources should be identifiable.  That would not have appeared in 2009 when the initial discussions took place.</p></speech>

Second, the other organisations we fund in a similar situation do not have access to such funds.  They would not have a level of funding of that nature.  One would expect that if they were to fund from their own sources, they would generate savings or suppress a post to make good the shortfall.  We were certainly at that time focused on the level of funding we were providing from the public pot, which was &euro;16 million at the time.</p></speech>

I have the letter in front of me and I am quiet happy to read it into the record.  I read it in the last day.  I do not accept at any time that there was any fund mentioned at all and I would like the Deputy to read the letter, which I have previously given to the committee, and what it says and the follow-up.<br />This letter is dated April 2009 to Mr. Des Peelo regarding remuneration of senior staff.  It is a short letter but it is important.<blockquote>As you may be aware, the HSE were requested by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children to collect detailed information on the pay and non-pay expenditure of voluntary organisations providing services to people with disabilities.  The information requested included the number of staff at each grade or level within the organisation and the full remuneration available to each grade or position.  I wish to acknowledge the co-operation of the management of the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) in providing the information in respect of your organisation...<br />Following analysis of the detailed information supplied by all organisations, the remuneration of a number of senior staff in CRC, as reported, would appear to be significantly out of line with the norms for the sector taking into account the size and the budget of the organisations.<br />[I then list a number of the posts: Deputy CEO, head of human resources, manager of clinical services, manager of services for adults, manager of IT and manager for capital development and special projects]<br />I am sure you will appreciate that in the current economic climate, and with the level of pressure on public services due to the restrictions on the availability of funding, the remuneration of senior executives is attracting increased and critical scrutiny.  Notwithstanding that CRC has access to funding separate to the funding provided by the HSE, the HSE, as a majority funder, has a responsibility to ensure good governance and accountability in the organisations.<br />To this end, I am requesting that the Board immediately review and take steps to significantly reduce the level of remuneration for senior management and staff in the CRC, in line with norms of the organisation.  I would be grateful if you [could let me have that information.]</blockquote></p></speech>

I cannot understand why the HSE did not know about this or did not ask about this and when the CRC was requesting funding, presumably by filing in a form or matching criteria every year, why the HSE did not ask what other funds the organisation had elsewhere before making a decision.  Mr. Cregan's finding was specific that the purpose of the Friends and Supporters of the CRC was to maximise what they got out of the HSE.  In other words, it was to hide money in order that the CRC could request more money from the executive.  Is it not correct that the HSE should have been able to say, "No, you have money elsewhere"?</p></speech>

The funding is provided on a yearly basis and it is not built up based on a level of service which is why the new governance arrangements were introduced as part of the service level arrangement.  There was a new service level arrangement so that we would see the levels of activity to provide for the level of funding.  The arrangement sets out that a copy of the audited accounts would be provided to the area manager and the financial accounts would have been submitted.</p> <p>It is my understanding that the transparency in relation to the funds held in those accounts certainly was not visible.  We certainly have taken on board a recommendation that further financial scrutiny needs to be given to those accounts even though they would have been looked at by people with expertise in finance.  They need to be further scrutinised.  That is the learning that I accept needs to take place as a result of the findings in this report, but there was no knowledge of the extent of the funds, I can say that. </p></speech>

It was kept in the dark about the extent of Mr. Kiely's pay for several years.  It was kept in the dark about the level of pay generally where top-ups were happening.  It was kept in the dark specifically about Mr. Kiely's pay-off.  It was kept in the dark about his successor's appointment and the pay he was getting.  Would that be correct in all cases?</p></speech>

In relation to the appointment, as the Deputy knows, there is significant correspondence and engagement that went back and forth to try to unravel how that appointment actually took place because as part of the service level arrangement it is required to seek permission.  It knew that was the case.  It did not do that.  The process that we would have - the transparent process for recruitment - did not happen.  Then there was an issue in relation to the salary.  It appeared it was paying a salary which was in excess of that which was agreed now.  In 2009, as we said, it was very clear at that time.  It said it had contractual commitments to the now previous CEO which had to be honoured, but that at a time when a new CEO was going to be brought on board or be replaced, first, that it would advise us and seek our permission for that and, second, that it would bring it into line with pay.  I have the backing documentation which will verify that.</p></speech>

The HSE is claiming that the board, of which he was chairman, did not inform it of what was happening in terms of Mr. Kiely's package, Mr. Conlan's appointment, Mr. Kiely's pay, pay generally, and the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic.</p></speech>

In relation to pay generally, we believe those levels were declared to HSE and known.  The only instances I have of that were in 2009 when they were declared in detail and again in 2012.  I cannot verify it, but I believe there was another correspondence in between that.  Certainly in 2009 and 2012, which were actually the same basically, apart from two retirements - they referred to the same people so my understanding is that it was informed.</p><p>  As far as Mr. Kiely's retirement package is concerned, I am not aware of a requirement to report such a termination agreement.  I have never heard of a request coming in for that or a procedure by which retiring people should have their terms reported to the HSE.</p></speech>

A confidentiality clause, as I understand it, means it is confidential and it is not to be revealed to anybody, but I also understand, when the Deputy is talking about that particular issue, why people have queried that that was a strange thing to put in.  My understanding is that when lawyers write voluntary severance packages, that is purely a routine matter.  It was not an unusual thing to come in.  I said: "Why is this there?"  They said: "That's always there."  The terms of that, as I understood it, mean that when one is told something is confidential, as far as I would understand that, it would mean that one would not reveal it to anybody.</p></speech>

The next thing is the Conlan appointment.  As I have said, in that case the board felt that of all the responsibilities, duties and obligations it had from a statutory point of view, the appointment of its chief executive was the most important - pretty well - decision that it would ever make.  The CRC had had in its 63 years only four previous chief executives.  They had all been spectacularly successful.  The board felt this was really the most supremely important thing that it wanted to do independently.  It was looking at sort of a conflict there between its statutory obligations to make an appointment and an agreement that I acknowledged to have had with the HSE to share in that process.</p><p>  Yes, I am afraid I am putting my hands up here.  We thought that of the two which one has supremacy and we actually delayed the decision for a long time.  It was terribly important in our mind to get an excellent chief executive officer.  We delayed the decision for a long time about how to go about it in relation to the HSE.  In the end we decided that - to be honest, rightly or wrongly - there was a level of distrust of HSE administration.  We thought it was an unwieldy and bureaucratic organisation.  Specifically, we feared that if we involved it in this process - maybe I should not say that - we feared that it would cause first of all a delay, leaving us with a lame duck chief executive - Mr. Kiely having decided to go.  Second, in the knowledge that the HSE had a lot of staff it wanted to redeploy, we actually feared that it might try to impose somebody on us.  Rightly or wrongly, those were the kinds of views expressed.  We boldly neglected the procedure that we-----</p></speech>

It is what certainly would now be seen as a governance failure.  I think it is something that was a common enough occurrence in boards because of our national reluctance to discuss individual wages openly, there was a remuneration committee which determined the wages of executives.  The remuneration committee did that and then found the level of remuneration, came back to the board and said, "We've sorted out the remuneration of XYZ" without actually specifying what that level was.  So that was the situation, undesirable as it seems now.  Indeed, to some extent, the members of a non-executive board would not always be expected to know the salary level of every person within the organisation.  So consequently-----</p></speech>

The fact was that this was not known to a lot of the members.  Indeed, as soon as I found it out, it shocked me quite severely.

My unfortunate position is I do not have training and qualifications in finance and commerce, but others on the board did and, to be honest, I had great respect for their expertise.  My assumption was that all was in order.  Let me point out because it is very important to do so that while we look on these salaries as anomalies, the CRC's budgetary performance, efficiency and excellence in its international standing were supremely good.  Within this we have the difficulty of a small number of individuals on high salaries.  The board's objective, in the big sense, is to provide the best service for disabled people in Ireland and to do so very efficiently.  We still believe we did so.  This large achievement is universally recognised and accredited by client satisfaction surveys.  The performance at the clinic has many good features to which I could point.  To say these efficiencies are completely spoiled by one or two anomalies within them is a little unfair.  That the senior salaries were not fully known to the board was an error of governance.  Prior to the old board going we introduced new governance procedures which would have put an end to it.  It was unsatisfactory and has come to an end.  We hope this is the end of it.</p></speech>

That is how we saw it.  Mr. Nugent, the then chairman, was called to HSE headquarters.  I met him as he came out of the meeting with three officers of the HSE.  He was told bluntly that if the whole board did not go, HSE funding would cease.  Whether this threat could have been carried out I do not know, but it would have been irresponsible of us to challenge it.  I saw the look on his face and he told me it was over, that the board had to go or the funding would be pulled.  The popular perception appears to be that we ran away after making a right mess of the place.  That is not the case.</p></speech>

The Deputy will ask why Mr. Kiely was not pushed a little harder.  In the discussions I had with him it was clear to me that the priority in his mind, as it is with people approaching their 60s, above all things was that having worked for such a very long time in the CRC to protect his pension.  One possible solution was a pay reduction, but the reduction in this case would have had to have been so enormous that it would have decimated his pension value which was dependent on his final years of salary.  That is why it did not work.  He was determined to defend his pension.  I had thought I had found the boundary of what he would find acceptable.  I thought he had the easy option of staying in position for another six and a half years and be paid the &euro;2.1 million.  I have since been advised by a very distinguished lawyer that I could not have told him the pay level was very uncomfortable and would not do him or the clinic any good because it would have led to a constructive dismissal case.  I was advised to tread carefully.  I felt the boundary had been reached where I felt there was no slack and it was take it or leave it and that if he left it, he would stay.</p></speech>

The loan was given in the full expectation, on the advice of the actuaries, that it would be fully returnable in 2016 or 2017 - I believe it was 2017.  It was simply to cover a very common problem.

I have read the report, which is 146 pages in length and very comprehensive.  This is nothing personal, as our job is to peruse.  In general terms, the report highlights the features.  Mr. Cregan sent us a letter in January, which I assume he stands over, and the report is consistent with that letter.  It is unusual that he did not interview the directors, although he made contact with Mr. Goulding.  At board level, the companies had common directors for a significant period.  At the CRC, the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic and CRC Medical Devices, the common directors were Mr. Goulding and Mr. Nugent.  In addition, Mr. Kiely was company secretary for all three before being replaced by Mr. Conlan, although the latter would dispute some of this, in respect of the CRC and the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic.  Mr. Cregan has dealt with the issue, but interviews should have been done.</p><p>  Mr. Cregan was unable to locate the files of two senior executives.</p></speech>

Mr. Cregan referred to there being proper financial systems, but there appears to have been a major absence of documentation in respect of inter-company transfers.  Mr. Goulding can correct me if I am wrong but, under the original structure, the CRC held the shares in the Care Trust before they were transferred to the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic.</p> <p>CRC Medical Devices, which was originally held by CRC, also subsequently transferred to the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic.  Given the transfer by the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic of approximately &euro;1.4 million in respect of a settlement package for Mr. Kiely, does Mr. Cregan still stand over that there are proper financial systems in place?</p></speech>

However, the narrative on board decisions in relation to what I would term big ticket items was poor.  It is important there is full disclosure of board documentation in relation to these transactions.  The record shows that a board decision had been made to pay "X".  That is properly recorded and the amount has been paid.  CRC is audited annually and its accounts are presented annually.  The auditors who conduct the audit are from a reputable firm and have never identified any problems in relation to the systems in place.  I did not make my earlier statement lightly.  I am satisfied that there are good systems in place.  However, I am unhappy that the records of the board, in relation in particular to the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic, are not adequate enough to fully inform anybody looking at the transactions of the basis for them.</p></speech>

I have also stated in my report that any investment in a company is risky and that people must be careful if funds are raised through charities not to risk those funds in ventures.</p></speech>

Under the memorandum and articles of association of the Care Trust, money raised through the lottery by the Care Trust is for the benefit of CRC, Rehab and the Mater Hospital.  That money is paid into the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic but not withstanding the memorandum and articles of association of Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic, that money can only be used for the benefit of the CRC.  The money was transferred by way of a donation from the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic to the CRC so ultimately the CRC got the &euro;700,000.  It is a moot point whether the amount was paid but the transaction was regular in the sense that the money raised by the Care Trust was paid into the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic and subsequently transferred to the CRC.</p></speech>

CRC does fantastic work.  I have reviewed the original memorandum and articles of association of the CRC, of which Mr. Goulding's mother was the founding member.  I want to divorce the work done by CRC and its staff and users of the facility from the structures.  Mr. Goulding asked earlier why he is here today.   The HSE is the custodian of taxpayers' money, &euro;16 million of which is paid annually to the CRC.  Mr. Goulding is here today so that the committee can question him in regard to whether funding provided by the HSE to the CRC is being properly spent on behalf of the taxpayer and in regard to CRC's adherence to section 38 provisions.</p></speech>

How can the board stand over that the same CEO implemented cuts under Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation in respect of ordinary rank and file workers within CRC and did not apply them to himself?</p><p>  The CRC, in terms of the work done by the Goulding family and Mr. Goulding's mother as the founding member, will continue.  I appreciate the work being done by the CRC.</p> <p>I really appreciate the work but as a board, how can it stand over this?  There is &euro;12 million in the friends and supporters bank account at any one time and the ordinary person may see it as nothing more than a lucky dip or slush fund for looking after the upper echelons and management in the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC.</p></speech>

There was a legal compulsion for us to do it if we wanted him to leave.  If he did not leave and we continued under present arrangements, as we were legally compelled to do by contract, it would have cost us more.  That is the simple answer and it is backed up by much legal advice.  As I stated, I do not like the idea at all and it is an uncomfortable notion.  When it comes to the idea of hiding funds or having slush funds, the board would have three objectives or duties.  One is to maintain, sustain and protect services for people getting an existing service in the CRC.  The second is to retain the ability to bring people who are not receiving service into the net and expand the scope, geographically and functionally, of the clinic.  That is very important and we can only do that if we have a capital fund.  The third objective is to keep a reserve in these times of rapidly diminishing State funding for obvious reasons.  It was only prudent for the CRC to keep a certain reserve of money to offset future anticipated reductions.  One of the problems in speaking about capital funding is that in the health service the physical disability sector tends to be the poor relation, as other elements are seen as more urgent and immediate in the acute care area.</p></speech>

With the benefit of hindsight and considering the e-mails between Mr. Goulding and Mr. Kiely.  I want to take away the personalities from those documents, and to put it in lay terms, it seems Mr. Kiely was able to come up with his own dowry without having to provide for it.  Should Mr. Kiely have come up with his own package or should the CRC brought in an independent person to do it?  If Mr. Kiely had stayed on board, the terms of the Haddington Road agreement would have kicked in.  It was indicated that the process cost the CRC &euro;151,000.  How does the board stand over the fact that the chief executive officer did not take the cuts from the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, although he was imposing it down the line on people with no say?  Many of those people were probably under financial pressure.</p></speech>

Why did the CRC not bring in an independent party to adjudicate on his package.  It appears Mr. Goulding sent an e-mail indicating that it would be extremely important that the board would sign off on the package, and that the board rubber-stamped it.</p></speech>

I deemed it something that could be put up for consideration, although I was on unfamiliar territory, having not arranged anybody's pension or departure arrangements before.  The proposal was put forward and could have been queried.  The board could have gone on bickering with Mr. Kiely for a long time and possibly got a certain reduction in the package but it was quite clear that this was the kind of level of remuneration that was going to have to be given to the man or he would have stayed on.  The other issue very much in our mind was that if we got into a dispute scenario, we would probably have had to pay him approximately the same amount, with legal fees on top of that if we got into difficulty.</p></speech>

All of them asserted, in my understanding, that the position was very clear.  It does not take much expertise to discover that if somebody is employed for 37 years and if the performance has been exemplary, with no query about the way in which he or she has done a duty, that person would have the right to continue in that employment, or if it is required that he or she leaves, the person should get an appropriate agreed settlement.  I agree it is a shocking amount of money.</p></speech>

The memorandums and articles of the friends and supporter fund indicates it should be to "erect building structures, train nurses, educate and generally assist."  It is also to "provide home help for disabled persons".  A &euro;700,000 settlement, without seeking proper legal advice, does not meet the terms of the memorandums and articles of that fund.  Ultimately, the CRC was set up to look after disabled people.  Money was raised by ordinary people with a box but it has not ended up in its proper place.  There was &euro;12 million in a fund which is effectively for capital projects and the occasional revenue project, which appears to have been nothing more than settlement for a former CEO.  Was the moral dilemma of Mr. Kiely imposing FEMPI cuts on the rest of the staff discussed?  These affected ordinary people such as nurses, carers and attendants.</p></speech>

I contend that at that time the board had a fiduciary duty to seek legal advice.  What appears to have happened, and these things do happen, is that it became too cosy.  It happens over time.  Effectively, and this is not a personal issue, Mr. Kiely was judge and jury over his own settlement package.  Would that be fair comment?</p></speech>

I think there was enough objectivity among the board.  While there was admiration and respect for Mr. Kiely and the way in which he performed his duties, I do not believe any of us thought that we should load him up with an extra &euro;100,000 here, there and anywhere, where we did not have to.  I felt that the boundary of what he was going to accept had been reached.  He is a very determined individual and is very aware of his rights and able to protect them.  He had an understanding of his rights and we believed that it would not have taken a lot of pushing to get us into a difficult situation with him.</p></speech>

The impression would be given that the moneys put into CRC Medical Devices came from Friends and Supporters of the CRC.  Initially, the medical devices company was a 100% subsidiary of CRC.  I suspect that the CRC provided it with funding and when that was proving to be difficult the company was transferred to be 100% held by the Friends and Supporters of the CRC, where the pool of funds was.  Effectively, it was out of sight and out of mind in terms of the HSE.  Could Mr. Goulding say how the set up for the medical devices company come about?

The abiding thing to remember is that the work done by the staff and the service users continues.  Outstanding work was done by Hamilton Goulding's mother to establish the CRC.  Clearly, on reflection, there was serious remiss in terms of the use of the funding collected in order to be used for front-line services.  That funding was used, in my view, for a use that it was not intended for when people throughout the country donated their money.   One must practice what one's preaches.  For the ordinary people who work in the CRC that does not appear to have been the case.  It is very important, in future, that we do not have organisations with separate fund-raising arms.  We must have transparancy.</p></speech>

We would share some of his concerns such as the preferability of having an independent entity carry out the work.  That point has been made so I will not labour on it.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge his report and the timeliness of its production.  However, his criticisms of the HSE are more implicit than explicit in his work.  Before we turn to the CRC, people looking on will say that substantial amounts of money were going to the clinic and to other section 38 organisations, and the HSE was asleep at the wheel for a long time.  Is that a fair comment, Mr. Cregan?</p></speech>

It would, and I have recommended it to the HSE, have been preferable, rather than a number of people dealing with the CRC, that there would be a single designated manager who would manage the relationship.

As Mr. Cregan knows, and he has put it very succinctly in his report, under public pay policy a section 38 organisation is not entitled to pay remuneration above a rate as reduced in accordance with that policy or any general agreement on pay.  In other words, the organisation does not have the discretion and one cannot have an arrangement like Lanigan's Ball where one can step in and step out of public pay policy.</p></speech>

With a view to rebuilding confidence in the CRC and every other section 38 organisation, there is no option.  It is not <i>&agrave; la carte</i>and one does not apply public pay policy willy-nilly or in a preferential manner.  The policy is the policy, regardless of whether one is the CEO, the nurse or the carer.  It does not matter as all the staff are public servants.  Can we all agree that is the position?</p></speech>

There was a deliberate contrivance to avoid cuts in pay for the chosen few in CRC.  That was not very honourable.  I am assuming, given Mr. Goulding's background and clear attachment to the CRC, that he operates on the basis of equality for employees of that clinic and he does not work to the notion that some are more equal than others.</p></speech>

The idea that there was a contrivance to separate salaries in order to protect some people from pay cuts that others would be receiving is really quite wrong.  The separation simply started when the new scales were introduced in 2009 and there was obviously a separation then because some of the salaries which were contracted were being paid by the HSE and the balance was then outstanding.  We come back to the point about a contractual obligation, that a company that has a contract with an employee cannot unilaterally diminish the income without being legally liable.  From that point onwards, once one does not have one body paying everything, one automatically has separation.  To say that the separation was made with a view to making in the future some special protections is not correct.</p></speech>

I assume he has no such reservations about Ms Manahan, who has now taken on the role.  She came through the appropriate procedure.  I am sure she is a very fine individual and more than well qualified for the role.  It was not such a disaster after all.</p></speech>

When we were facing into something that had to be done, we wanted it to be done in the bast way.  We were trying to choose the influences that would make us achieve the best result.  We did not know what those external influences might be.  We were trying to narrow it down to something we could control.  Of course it could have been the case that many other suitable people could have come into the picture.  I am glad that one such person has come into the picture in this case.</p></speech>

I am sure Mr. Goulding, who would not have been unique in showing an interest in who got to where, etc., would not share that view.  The culture I am talking about is very negative in any organisation.</p></speech>

There should have been more rotation of board members.  I think this happens in many boards.  The members who retired every three years kept getting re-elected.

At all times, my understanding was that there was a legal impediment.  Deputy McDonald asked whether more radical action should have been taken.

Is there anything Mr. Goulding would like to say while he is before this committee?  I am thinking particularly of the other employees of the clinic who have come through all of this.  Is there anything Mr. Goulding wants to say to them about this entire debacle?</p></speech>

As I have said, it leaves me with a lot of sorrow and regret.  It has been a terribly difficult time for everybody.  The clinic always had a powerful and unique spirit of harmony, co-operation, positivity and energy.  That applied to the staff, the users and the families.  The reputational damage that has been done is very bad because it affects the feelings and the morale of those working there.  I know it will be undone.</p><p>  The other thing I would like to mention is the clinic's financial position.  It started out completely voluntarily for the first 30 years or so, before State funding came in to a huge extent.  As a result of the financial restrictions we are in, State funding is reducing again.  The further reductions that are coming this year unfortunately mean there will be a need for the clinic to strengthen and perhaps establish new independent revenue streams to allow it to have capital projects and indeed to supplement revenue.  The new board will have to work very hard to repair the hurt feelings and morale of those involved and the financial damage that has been done.  It is very regrettable.</p></speech>

When one makes an apology, one needs to be sure of exactly what one has done wrong.  When I look back at the circumstances and the options I faced, I still have a little difficulty in ascertaining what I could have done differently.  There are a few things.  I am not perfect.  The board was not perfect.  I am very sorry that this happened.  I wish I could have done better.</p></speech>

I welcome all of our witnesses.  I have a personal connection with the CRC, having worked as a teacher in Scoil Mochua for over ten years.  I have a particular personal angle on this.  Before I ask about the relationship between the CRC and the HSE, I would like to commend Mr. Cregan on the work he has done in his report.  It is appreciated by me and by the staff members and parents with whom I have been in contact.  I would also like to wish Ms Manahan and Mr. Timmins well in their new leadership roles in the organisation.  It is important to mention that despite its problems, the CRC has continued to do exemplary work throughout this difficult period.  I think I am right in saying that until recent times, the HSE had a pretty hands-off approach to the running of the CRC.  Even since 2009, the HSE has been slow enough in getting the CRC's financial affairs and salaries in order.  Would Ms McGuinness agree with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laverne McGuinness" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014070300019#S00100"><p>There are a number of points to be made.  In 2009, at the time when we wrote requesting details of the individual salaries on foot of a letter from the Secretary General, it was the first time we received or indeed requested visibility in respect of the salaries of the individuals there at higher levels.  It is also important to note that at the time, there was no service level arrangement with these organisations.  The HSE had been established in 2005.  Funding arrangements were organised in a different way.  It was an inherited position from former health boards.  Late in 2009, a service level arrangement was developed.  The agencies were consulted.  It took a long time to develop it.  It was an extensive document but it was the main tool used to manage the relationship at an area level with the organisations.  However, it did not fully reflect the meetings with the organisations.</p><p>  We have learned that the service level arrangement needs to be improved.  Some areas should have been included in it but were not included.  Mr. Cregan has already alluded to the piece regarding the requirement for greater financial scrutiny of the financial accounts.  The piece with regard to public pay policy was only inserted into the service level arrangement in 2010 to 2011 so it was not legally contractual.  We have since worked on a revised service level arrangement.  We have certainly taken what we have learned from the CRC into account.  There is now a centralised unit looking at service level arrangements and there will be one manager responsible for the management of the totality of all the funding streams, be they to the CRC or otherwise.  In 2014, we introduced a compliance statement.  In fact, this statement puts in place and strengthens a relationship with the chairs of the various boards.  Heretofore, the engagement has been with the CEOs and the executives so the relationship is with the chairs of the boards.  We met each section 38 agency in December.  A compliance statement and a code of good practice on how boards should operate were produced.  This has begun and we have that back at this point in time.</p></speech>

Ms McGuinness is probably the best person to answer this question but I would be interested in hearing Ms Manahan's comments as well.   My question concerns the relationship between the CRC and the HSE, particularly in respect of the provision of clinical services.  To what extent will the CRC have an independent hand and to what extent will it have to bow whatever direction is coming from the HSE?</p></speech>

Obviously, the service arrangements and engagement take place at a local level and that will continue.  In answer to the Deputy's question, the voluntary and independent nature of the organisations will be respected.  We will work with organisations in terms of implementation of policy, be it around changes we are introducing around the value for money reform within the service, the 0-18 programme, New Directions or any national policies so that they will implement that in line with policy.  We will do that on the basis of consultation and engagement.  The intention would be that the CRC and all voluntary organisations would work with the HSE in implementing policies like that.</p></speech>

Last night, I was at a meeting of parents of children in Scoil Mochua in Clondalkin and parents of service users on that site.  As Ms Manahan knows, an application to build a new school has been made.  It is being held up because of information requested by the HSE.  I would like to be corrected if I am wrong but my understanding is that the HSE is consolidating disability services in certain locations in south west Dublin.  This may well be a constraint in terms of the school getting permission to proceed because it must be a joint effort.  Part of the building is a school under the Department of Education and Skills funding while the other part is clinical services which clearly come under the remit of the HSE in terms of funding.  To what extent will the CRC be able to make decisions there?  The very existence of the school in that location is related to the provision of clinical services.</p></speech>

What is happening in the Dublin west area is that the CRC, Stewarts Hospital, Enable Ireland and the HSE are all providing services to children in one form or another.  The implementation of that programme is commencing and I imagine that the Deputy is hearing some of the feedback from that.  Any implementation of that will be done in a co-ordinated way.  There is a local implementation group that is representative of all stakeholders.  A subgroup of that includes parents.  I understand that a meeting with parents was held in the Dublin west area but was poorly attended.  I have asked that we ensure that more comprehensive communication takes place so that people are fully engaged.  That is part of what we will be doing in any change like that.  Anything we do should not negatively impact on any capital investment that might be taking place.</p></speech>

It is about how the HSE, Stewarts Hospital, the CRC and Enable Ireland working with the Department of Education and Skills co-ordinate the delivery of services in the future so that we have a co-ordinated assessment and intervention for children, it should not matter what school they attend or where they live and there is a standardised assessment process.  We commissioned the National Disability Authority, NDA, to do work for us.  It has provided a research resource.  When we work in this way, we get a better outcome for children and a better use of resources.  I fully accept that it must be done-----</p></speech>

The people who went to those meetings yesterday had great difficulty in getting there.  That is an issue that is not sufficiently appreciated by any of us, even by myself, even though I have worked closely with people like that over ten years.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware I have been in the post for four weeks.  During those four weeks I visited the school three times.  The chairman and one other member of the board accompanied me on one of those visits.  The CRC is very committed - certainly I am - and I know the board is very committed to the schools and the excellent service those schools provide.  I look forward to working closely with Mr. Pat Healy's office to ensure the school is very involved and engaged in the process.  To date there have been a number of meetings at which senior CRC staff have been represented.  Certainly as one of my priorities, I need to brief myself to see how the progress of the zero to 18 piece is being rolled out across the different areas in which the CRC is involved.  I stress that is one of my priorities.</p></speech>

I can assure them that the HSE will co-operate with the school in Scoil Mochua to ensure clinical services will continue to be provided at the site and, in their application for a new building, that the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills will work together towards bringing that to fruition if it is the decision of the Department of Education and Skills that a new school needs to be constructed.</p></speech>

There will be a necessity to implement the national policy around the nought to 18 programme.  Therefore, there will be some changes in how services are delivered but that should not negatively impact and should be of benefit.  National research shows that where a joined-up approach is implemented, there is a better result for children, which is what we are after.  There will be some impact in respect of how services are delivered, but this will not have a detrimental impact on the school, its operation and its capital funding.</p></speech>

Certainly there would be no reason those who currently attend would not continue to attend.  The issue is about how we utilise best the therapy resources available at the CRC, Stewarts Hospital, Enable Ireland and within the HSE itself in order that there is an equitable distribution of that resource to the benefit of children in the area.  This is about maximising the outcomes for the children.  We would absolutely support that.</p></speech>

One of the great fortunes of both the school in Clondalkin and in Clontarf is that the clinical services are provided on the same site as the school so it is easy to move from one to the other.</p></speech>

Turning to some of the historical issues in the CRC, how is the money in Friends and Supporters of the CRC going to be dealt with?  First, what is the extent of the money?  Will it remain as a separate fund long-term or will it come under the general spend of the CRC?  Can Mr. Cregan or Mr. Timmins illuminate what will happen to that money and how much is still in place?</p></speech>

That will vary from month to month, depending on the drawdowns and the what projects are involved.  Two projects that have been identified and pencilled in are the clinical services at the Mochua site for approximately &euro;6 million and the Swords day centre for &euro;3 million, both of which are capital projects.  The fund is intended primarily as a capital project, so we will be looking at some of the other areas.  Ms Stephanie Manahan mentioned that I visited with her Scoil Mochua a week or so ago.  I have also visited all the other sites in Dublin and I can see there is a need for capital expenditure in many sites, not just at Scoil Mochua.  The intention is that it is primarily a capital fund.</p></speech>

For example, if I wish to proceed with a capital project, one portion of the project would be the capital part and another portion would come under ongoing expenses, for which we would seek funding from the HSE.  There is no point in our board building a big facility unless we understand that we have ongoing support for it going forward.  To that extent, we would engage with the HSE and discuss it with it.  For example, the Swords project will be a joint project.  As Mr. Pat Healy said, the HSE does not stop us doing capital projects but given that we are funded by the HSE, we would have to discuss and debate with it on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

We have already had some discussions.  We do not have the details but we will engage on them.  Many of the funds raised through fund-raising are for capital, refurbishment or extension works.  Using that type of funding for staffing purposes and revenue will have to be looked at more carefully because one is making a long-term revenue commitment based on fund-raising.  Often we would come to an agreement with an organisation to target a waiting list initiative or short-term initiative where staff would be used to support front-line initiatives.  That is something we would agree with the CRC and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because commitments to permanent full-time employment have to be dealt with carefully and approved because permanent streams of funding need to be available for those.</p></speech>

It was advertised on the website.</p> <p>Any opportunity I got, I told people the board of management was assisting in the process.  The skills of the individual candidates matching the requirements of the organisation were assessed and ultimately, the appointments were made by the members of the company.  As I said already, this involved arranging with the members of the company that resolutions be passed appointing those people.  The process is not yet complete.  As Mr. Timmins already said, there will be further vacancies and rotations and there will be constant updating of the skills of board members from now on.</p></speech>

First is in the case of allowances, which may or not be approved by the HSE, such as allowances to people moving up to carry out a role above their normal role.  Second is the payment or top-up above the pay agreed for a particular role and third is related to the full implementation of the FEMPI legislation.  As of today, there are six people still in that category, but I am open to correction by Ms Manahan on that.</p></speech>

I intend to come at this a little differently because the subject matter has been dealt with comprehensively by members.  I will give the deputation my take on what has happened here, why we are in this room and how the position has evolved in recent months.  Furthermore, I will ask some questions with regard to public pay policy.</p><p>  There seems to be almost an attitude or truism that public pay policy is always correct, but it is not always correct.  Mistakes can be made when public pay policy is formulated.  I will be asking the HSE how it formulated public pay policy in this regard because I believe, as a result of the disorganisation of the HSE and its dereliction of responsibility when it came to the policing of this particular area, that as a consequence of the way public pay policy was formulated and the way the HSE dealt with the section 38 organisations, they were forced into doing it.  I am not so sure whether there has been a debate with regard to appropriate levels of pay when it comes to the health sector organisations that receive public moneys.</p><p>  Ms McGuinness has made clear the genesis of the entire relationship between section 38 organisations and indicated it did not really kick off until 2009 and that the contractual arrangements finished in 2010 or 2011.  I believe the HSE knew very well what the levels of pay were for chief executives and senior staff in many of these organisations and did not do anything about it.  In many cases the organisations resisted giving that information.  They took the view that they were independent and, in some cases, they did not believe that imparting that information to the HSE was reasonable, and they were wrong.  However, in many cases, even when financial statements were imparted by those organisations to the HSE, no analysis was ever done by the HSE.  We have seen this again and again throughout the entire affair.</p><p>  One question in particular needs to be asked and this is the element that has never got a scintilla of debate in recent months.  Does paying someone very well in organisations that receive public funding eventually lead to savings or lesser amounts of public moneys being expended in the long run?</p><p>  I believe we have arrived at this point artificially.  I am not using the Central Remedial Clinic as the example.  The CRC is a charitable organisation.  When I asked Mr. Kiely about where his pension was funded from, this entire episode kicked off.  However, there is another question at issue.  Let us separate the fact that the CRC is a charitable organisation - we must be very careful about that element of it - from how chief executives are funded within the sector.  There is another issue at stake to which the HSE must respond but in respect of which it has never responded.  It is an issue that has never been debated and I believe it is a realistic issue that needs to be aired.</p> <p>Everything has changed since the banking crisis.  People's perception of those on high salaries has changed.  There is almost a perception in this room that anyone who makes over &euro;100,000 a year has questions to answer.  They do not.  In some cases benefits accrue from those on higher pay in an organisation because of their skill sets, experience or management ability.  I am not so sure the Health Service Executive has taken that into account.  I think it was railroaded into this public policy because it was embarrassed by the fact that it had not policed this area properly for many years.  It should respond to this.  I ask Mr. Goulding for his opinion. </p><p> Ireland is not the only country having this debate.  One only has to search on Google to find that chief executive officers of organisations such as Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York make millions of dollars.  Some individuals involved there make complaints because the fund-raising arm is very active and question whether people should be so highly paid, while ordinary individuals fund-raise.  These are legitimate questions.  I suspect, however, that we have moved in the other direction.  It is not the case that public pay policy is always correct and one can make the case sometimes that people deserve to be very well paid if they bring long-term benefits to an organisation.  That has been forgotten in this argument.</p></speech>

It is set by the Government and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health.  The HSE&rsquo;s role, as the Deputy rightly articulated it, is to implement public pay policy.  I tried to explain its genesis.  In 2009 we were asked to establish the individual pay rates for those working in the disability sector - the Deputy is correct about this - and to implement them.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, FEMPI, brought forward another piece.  It was revealed at the time that there were people who were employed under contracts with different rates of pay than those sought in order to be aligned with public pay policy.  The HSE and the health service are not involved in setting public pay-----</p></speech>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform signs on the dotted line.  The HSE is asked for its input and knowledge when a policy is formulated.  If Ms McGuinness is telling me the HSE has nothing to do with public pay policy for section 38 organisations and in this area, I do not believe it.  Strictly speaking, the HSE can hide behind this.</p></speech>

I am saying that in respect of public pay policy, we receive a copy of what is known as the consolidated pay scale setting out the scales.  They do not specify, for example, the CEOs of particular disability organisations.  They have particular grades.  Our colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be able to speak about it.  We have tried to get an independent assessment of what is the correct rate of pay for individual organisations not specifically referred to on the consolidated pay scales.  The indicators usually taken into account are budget, scope, scale, complexity and diversity of services.  We have to seek the advice and authorisation of the Department of Health on what we pay.  That is the public pay policy we must implement.  We are obliged to implement public pay policy.</p></speech>

There are circumstances in which a business case needs to be put forward to set out why a particular individual may need to be paid a certain amount in order to attract somebody to a particular post.  In some cases we are having difficulty in recruiting to various posts.  That is my opinion; that is not public pay policy.  As a public servant, I have to implement public pay policy.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct in his observations about governance.  All of this came to light as a result of Enron, as the Deputy will know from his Google search.  It is not unique to the health sector, or other sectors.  Pay is being examined because of the austerity facing several organisations and because of the Enron crash.  When the crisis happened, the question was asked why the people in question were being paid so much.</p></speech>

Negative results accrue from this.  That is not taken into consideration.  Mr. Goulding has made it very clear that there was no contrivance to avoid public pay policy, but some of these organisations - not the Central Remedial Clinic - knew very well what the limits were and felt that in some cases individuals who had that skills set or management ability needed to be paid more.  Somebody might make the case that if one paid an individual &euro;1 million, that might make it possible to save &euro;2 million down the road.  That element of the debate does not take place.</p></speech>

Now that it is there, however, and we are mandated to implement it across the sector, its application in retrospect is an issue.  The Deputy&rsquo;s observations on whether it is better to pay somebody more to have a better job done and achieve greater savings doe not come into the context of public sector pay.</p></speech>

It has been railroaded into this because it was not doing its job.  There is a danger for the health sector and those organisations, including section 38 organisations, that this is too confined.  I believe in the free market, even when it involves individuals, and that paying someone over the odds can benefit an organisation.  This is fair game for the Committee of Public Accounts and very one-sided.  There needs to be a debate about it.</p></speech>

That is the law and applies to public servants' remuneration and public service bodies and must be applied equally to everyone working in each public service organisation.</p> <p> In regard to looking at particular cases or particular areas where there might be a skills shortage or whatever, there is provision, as my colleague said, for a business case to be made.  That is not to say such a case will be accepted or that there are not extraordinary pressures on the pay bill which would make it very difficult to deal with, but those cases can be made and are, on occasion, sanctioned appropriately.  There is the process of make a business case and then submission to the Department of Health and ultimately the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

It is important to bear in mind that we arrived here artificially.  In other countries, they look at the issue pragmatically.  It happens all the time that consideration is given to the fact that where a large salary is given, the individual in receipt of it should have the ability to save money for an organisation in the long run.  What has happened here to a certain extent is that we have arrived at this situation because the HSE was forced into it and because this committee did its job.  The sector was not being policed properly by the HSE.  There is a danger now, however, that organisations in the health sector generally may lose out because good people with the right skills will not be interested in taking up positions at the level of pay that is presented to them.  I hear it again and again at this committee, not just in regard to the health sector but also, for instance, in the case of NAMA, that organisations are finding they cannot hire or retain staff.  There is a politically correct attitude out there that nobody should be paid over a certain amount and if a person is earning &euro;100,000, he or she might be a bad person or have questions to answer.  It is a narrow view.  I understand exceptions can be made within public policy, but I do not see that happening.</p></speech>

Mr. Goulding has explained that Mr. Kiely's pay was set at a particular level and he did not receive any increases.  It was a case of the benchmarking system that was in place at a time when people had different perceptions when it came to pay and salaries.  I am not using CRC as the example for the policy argument; charities are different and there is a sensitivity there that needs to be accepted and appreciated, with people fund-raising and so on.  However, there is a larger issue that is essentially to do with political correctness.  It is a valid concern.  Perhaps Mr. Goulding will comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hamilton Goulding" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014070300024#Z00700"><p>It is an interesting angle from which to come at the issue.  I set in train the course of events that ended in the departure of Mr. Kiely, of whom I had a sort of split view.  From one perspective I admired him greatly because of his capability.  I am sure he saved the clinic an awful lot of money, undoubtedly many times more than what he was paid.  He had extraordinary anticipation and initiative.  On many occasions when an issue was brought to the board, by the time someone had asked him a question about it he could say he had already fixed it last week.  On the one hand, his performance was extraordinarily good.  I had a different view, however, in regard to his salary.  In my view, people's salaries should be paid, first of all, on the basis of their performance - that is obvious - and, second and to some extent, the ability of their employer to pay.  In this case, the overriding factor was the sector we were in, namely, the charitable sector.  As the Deputy said, popular opinion, with some good reason, does not like and will not tolerate the payment of very high salaries in that sector.</p><p>  The successes of the clinic have been acknowledged by everybody here.  Those types of successes do not come without sound management from the top, good guidelines and good executive control.  The CRC managed its budgets perfectly for many years.  In fact, it hardly ever ran an annual deficit of more than a minute amount and never, as many other organisations did, ran cumulative deficits.  The cost of the senior management group we are talking about was &euro;1.82 million in 2004 but had reduced to &euro;914,000 in 2012.  In other words, the cost of senior management at the clinic halved in that period.  By that time, moreover, the CEO had taken on the duties and responsibilities of two, possibly three, other people.  He was, in effect, doing three and maybe even four jobs.</p><p>  The international standing of the clinic was widely recognised as delivering a service that was as good as any, not just in Ireland or the UK but throughout Europe and beyond.  The clinic did not achieve what it did by not going beyond the Irish Sea.  We attended conferences elsewhere and hosted them here in Ireland.  The last one we organised was attended by people from 30 different countries, including Australia, India and South America.  In the course of those conferences attendees saw that the treatments, techniques and equipment being used in the CRC for the benefit of Irish people with disabilities were as good as anywhere in the world.  In 2012, the CRC undertook a customer satisfaction survey, the results of which were phenomenally good.  There were criticisms, of course, as there always will be, but many of the categories scored in the 90s for positive feedback.</p><p>  I am making all these points in order to highlight that much of the excellence of the clinic, as with any organisation, comes from the top and is a consequence of the way in which it is managed.  If we had been engaged in an industrial production type of activity where we were in business for profit, it might not have been unreasonable to suggest that Mr. Kiely should get a pay rise.  The reason I personally thought his salary was completely inappropriate was that we are a charity organisation, not because we are publicly funded.</p></speech>

However, as far as the other issue is concerned - and this is addressed to all the delegates - by limiting pay, notwithstanding the business case exceptions, the question must be asked as to whether we are damaging or weakening the sector by kowtowing to political considerations.  The HSE needs to take that on board.  Within the sector and within the HSE itself, there are individuals who hold the view that this policy does not make sense for some individuals and organisations.</p></speech>

One can have an organisation the size of the CRC, which is a &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million organisation, where the CEO is being paid substantially more than others who might be running a &euro;100 million plus organisation of much greater complexity.  Part of the challenge for us is to devise what we have termed a sizing model, that is, a basis upon which a reasonable and appropriate scale is set for different sizes of organisations.  One looks at the disability sector and compares it with, say, hospital groups, where the new CEOs might be running &euro;700 million organisations.</p></speech>

Many of these voluntary organisations are large and have charitable status, which adds another dimension.  This is not only a matter of salaries, it is a question of what is required in terms of governance, quality, service, expectations and management of services.  Very capable people are required to run these organisations and it is necessary to set an appropriate scale across social care and the hospital system.</p></speech>

This is what happened in some cases where the HSE was not taken seriously on public pay issues.  It was felt that an organisation should hire a particular person at a certain level so that it could benefit.  In many cases this was done out of a sense of care for the organisation in question.  There were good reasons for this and cases can be made in such circumstances.  We all accept this, including Mr. Brazel and Ms McGuinness.  Cases can be made but this fact is not being entertained in this political environment and this is a mistake in some cases.</p></speech>

We are here because Deputy Ross raised the issue of accounts at the CRC.  We are not here because the HSE or any of its 500 financial staff discovered what happened.  After all of the bluster, the HSE now suggests contracts are in place, and if they are contested, most will have to be red-circled.

On section 38 and section 39 agencies, they are listed, along with the funding they receive, in our financial statements every year.  The amount they are paid is published in a schedule of financial statements in the annual report.  On the audit committee, an internal audit was carried out on section 38 agencies and the CRC.  Such audits were carried out on a rotating basis on various agencies through 2010 and 2011.</p><p>  The Chairman correctly points out that the HSE was set up in 2005 but these agencies were funded through a different mechanism prior to that.  This arrangement was consolidated for the first time towards the end of 2009 when there was a new service level arrangement.  It took almost two years to conclude discussions with the people involved.  This was a first measure to achieve transparency and accountability in each organisation on what the funds handed over were used for and the service provided.</p></speech>

The HSE knew that it was allocating substantial funds, but it did not follow the money.  Now that this has been discovered on foot of hearings held by the committee, it is trying to apply salary scales retrospectively.  At the same time and within its own organisation, it is willing to red circle these salary scales.  On the previous occasion on which its representatives came before the committee, we discovered that one postholder in Limerick was being paid privately at a rate of &euro;258,000 when the actual salary scale was somewhere in the region of &euro;112,000.  The HSE is doing things that it expects others not to do.  That is what I find frustrating.  The letter from Mr. Peelo to the HSE in 2009 states quite clearly, "Notwithstanding that CRC has access to funding separate to the funding provided by the HSE...".  This means that the HSE knew there was a fund in existence, but it never inquired as to the amount of money contained in it.</p></speech>

We had said that while service level arrangements and annual financial statements were looked at by accountants, the level of scrutiny to be applied had to be augmented.

My belief is that the HSE knew about all of this all along and that it turned a blind eye to it.  That is what the correspondence indicates to me.

Many of the hundreds of organisations we resource have individual collections as part of their operations.  The CRC collected money through voluntary fund-raising, etc. and Mr. Cregan made reference to its Santa Bear Appeal in that regard.  It would have been similar to many other organisations and we would have seen the money involved in accounts.  When the HSE came to an understanding with the CRC on an initiative in Waterford which we funded jointly, it put up money from its capital fund and the CRC contributed from its own resources. The assumption was that the money was coming from that resource.  What we were not aware of was the existence of the larger Friends and Supporters of the CRC fund.</p></speech>

The issue identified by Deputy Shane Ross and the committee in general is that a more forensic analysis of the accounts may have highlighted this.  Under the procedures which obtained in 2009, accounts were reviewed principally to see if the funding we provided was reflected in them and to establish that it was a going concern.  In addition, the auditor's notes were required.  If there had been a more forensic analysis of the accounts, clearly it might have identified what has emerged.  That is what will happen in the future.</p></speech>

It would not be normal for an audit committee such as the one in the HSE to look in detail at the financial statements of an individual grantee.  The role of the audit committee is to ensure there is adequate financial and performance reporting in respect of the entire body of grantees.  Around 2006 my office reported on the systems in place in the health boards - as they were before the HSE was established and with the establishment of the HSE -  the adequacy of supervision and the oversight of grantees.  One of the matters we identified was that there was not adequate financial reporting and that there was not adequate analysis within the HSE.  Steps were taken after this to improve the position.  To my thinking, that is really where the impetus originated from for the development of the service level agreements.  It took some time to put them in place.  As Mr. Healy outlined, there are still problems regarding the receipt of financial statements from grantees and the analysis and following up of these statements.  When the financial statements for the HSE for 2013 were presented to the committee, one of the issues highlighted in my certificate was the HSE's own recognition that more needed to be done in the oversight of grant-aided bodies.  The normal thing one expects with a set of financial statements when one examines them is that if there are donations, they are identified separately in the statements.  What one might not be sure of is from where these donations came or the route through which they came.  There is a difference between section 38 bodies and other organisations in receipt of substantial amounts of public funding in that they are not required to comply with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p> <p>Some of the things that specifically are not required of them would be such matters as confirmation by the chair to the relevant Minister that public pay policy is being observed, and that the remuneration and terms and conditions of chief officers be disclosed in the financial statements.  That is something I suggested the committee might like to consider suggesting to the HSE: that the fundamental requirements that are imposed on semi-state bodies also be applied to the section 38 agencies in future.</p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. Timmins and Ms Manahan on their respective appointments.  I thank Mr. Goulding very much for being present.  It is a testament to his character that he has turned up.  I have never met him before.  It gives me an indication of how important the CRC and its work is to him and his family.</p><p>  It is also important to note, in the context of the chairman&rsquo;s interaction with the HSE, that one of the reasons there are organisations such as the CRC is the holistic failure of the State - all of us collectively - to provide disability services.  Had it not been for Mr. Goulding&rsquo;s mother and many others like her, many people in this country would have grown up without services.</p><p>  To link that back to the point made by the Chairman - that this cannot all be blamed on the HSE because the problems predate its existence - the situation in this country is that we all thought the only role of successive Governments, the HSE, and the Department of Health was to write cheques and hand them over to service providers.  As the Chairman outlined, there has not been a greater level of forensic work and the linkage that is required for governance.  I note the progress that has been made in a short time.  I hope the new measures that have been put in place signal the beginning of a new culture in terms of the relationship between section 38 agencies and the HSE.</p><p>  I note the comments of either Ms McGuinness or Mr. Cregan, in his report, that the HSE did not have any concerns about the quality or quantum of services provided by the staff.  I can only imagine how difficult recent months have been for Mr. Timmins, Ms Manahan and many of the front-line staff and employees who are providing excellent services.  It is important and welcome that the report made such a finding.</p><p>  I wish to refer to how we got to this point.  At this stage the debate has moved beyond the CRC.  I hope our exchange can be more focused on the lessons we can learn in terms of section 38 agencies and the need for the HSE to interact with them for the benefit of both the taxpayer, which is the purpose of the committee, and service users.</p><p>  I have heard the arguments on Mr. Kiely&rsquo;s remuneration package.  I have no doubt that, as Mr. Goulding has said, he genuinely believed a good financial deal had been achieved for the clinic.  I have heard his rationale and I am struck by the genuine nature of his belief.  I do not necessarily agree with the actions taken by him and the board.  I am confused as to why there was not greater interaction with the main funder, the HSE, on the issue, but I believe the motive was good.  However, where I get more confused and more concerned is on the appointment of the next CEO.  That is the area I wish to explore.  One could quite correctly say the CRC was contractually obligated to pay Mr. Kiely the sum of money, although people might consider it obscene or abnormal.  But when it got to the appointment of Mr. Conlan, it seems at that stage there was blatant disregard for what had been agreed.  My understanding from the correspondence trail was that there was an agreement between the CRC and the HSE that when the situation with Paul Kiely was resolved and the next appointment was made, the rules would be obeyed and the CRC would stick to the pay scales and consult the HSE.  I wonder why that did not happen.</p></speech>

At the time of Mr. Kiely&rsquo;s retirement, another person also left, so one had two people leaving and the total value of their salaries amounted to approximately &euro;340,000.  That was on top of the saving from that group of another &euro;350,000.  We were looking at a situation in which the management group costs that had existed at the same time the previous year had gone down by about &euro;700,000, and we were replacing that with a cost of &euro;125,000.  We thought to ourselves, just looking at it in isolation, that it was a fantastic result.  We thought it also brought us quite substantially along the road towards compliance with the approved pay scales.  We did not think we would get there in one jump.</p><p>  When we were considering the appointment of a new chief executive - the problem has been resolved now and there was a solution, but it did not seem viable to us at the time - we did not wish to invite somebody to take a job in which the top six subordinate people of whom the person would have charge were paid 30% more than the new chief executive.  We would have been asking the person to take a job at less than the salary earned by the people he or she would supervise.</p><p>  Our first interest was in seeing if we could get a candidate from within the company.  That was ruled out, effectively, because one would have had to ask someone to apply for the job of chief executive but tell him or her it would involve a pay cut.  That is where we were coming from.  As I said previously, there was a poor performance in terms of liaison with the HSE.  That is really the reason we got a bit blinkered and said we had to get a really good person.  We knew we had overstepped the mark a bit.  I was very conscious of that and I said we needed to try to patch it up a little bit.  We did have a meeting in September of that year with three officers from the HSE and we were told that was pretty bad stuff, but it accepted that the result was very good and it was considered that we should put the situation behind us.  Effectively, although we had clearly transgressed, it seemed to us that we had got a good result.  We got a man of extraordinary experience whom everyone agreed was suitable and we thought that the situation had been resolved.  It is not a perfect story, but that is what happened.</p></speech>

Staff costs had been saved and because of that it was decided that the CRC could afford to pay the new chief executive a little bit more; otherwise, people at a subordinate level would have earned more than him.  That is fine except for the fact that there is a chain of correspondence, some of it directly from Mr. Goulding on 27 October 2011, when he as chairman wrote to the HSE and said &ldquo;As and when the position of chief executive is to be replaced through retirement or resignation, the CRC will arrange that the provisions set out are included in all future relevant contracts.&rdquo;  He then informed the board on 7 November that CRC would comply with the HSE requests on any future appointment.  Then the correspondence just stopped.  Mr. Goulding had agreed both through correspondence and with the board that a certain chain of actions would take place.</p> <p>We then have Appendix 24, which is an e-mail from Mr. Goulding to Paul Kiely, Brian Conlan and Jim Nugent.  Some of the language in it is concerning.  On page 64 he refers to how he will deal with the Health Service Executive, HSE, in regard to Paul's replacement.  One line states: <blockquote><br />If we just sit tight it is inevitable that they will react fairly soon, and come looking for details and explanations which will already have put us at a disadvantage.</blockquote>He further states: &quot;... we have taken the initiative and have more control of the discussions ...&quot;.  Mr. Goulding goes on to state there are three matters he wishes to raise with the HSE.  The third point states: &quot;That we can, by use of our independent funding, augment the salary above their standard rate.&quot;  I am interested in first on the specific level regarding the CRC and then on a broader level in terms of what happened with the relationship between the CRC and the HSE that we have a situation where Mr. Goulding, as chairman, is writing letters to his colleagues on the board to the effect that they must be careful these guys do not put us at a disadvantage, that they have to take the initiative or they will come cracking down on them while still asking if he can further augment the salary.  It is completely at variance with the public messages he had been corresponding with the HSE.</p></speech>

I suppose it is a mindset that had developed, rightly or wrongly, and some of it wrongly, of suspicion and distrust of some aspects of the HSE.

He has come before the Committee of Public Accounts and co-operated with us.  I genuinely admire and appreciate that, and the fact that Mr. Goulding has put his hands up, so to speak, in terms of errors.  My view on this, and Mr. Goulding may or may not wish to comment, is that he had a board of people who were well-meaning individuals, from my experience and reading, and I will not cast aspersions on the ability of the former chief executive because Mr. Goulding told me, and he had many more dealings with him than I did, he did a good job but it seems as if the board was taken hostage at the end by a man who constantly stated in his e-mails to Mr. Goulding and others that he did not want to embarrass the CRC, that he wanted an exit strategy and referred to "my package".  The tone I and others get from reading the e-mails between Mr. Goulding and Mr. Kiely is of an individual who, albeit his legal entitlement, will not budge and has a board of well-meaning individuals over a barrel.  That is not to say, and Mr. Goulding has already acknowledged, that things could not have been done differently, but that is my take on it for what it is worth.  Mr. Goulding might wish to comment on that.</p></speech>

I was always looking at a situation to try to find something that is fair to Kiely in the light of his entitlements and fair to the clinic.  To say he was pushing us around all the time is too strong.  He was a strong character, as I have said, a man very well aware of his rights and a man about whom I felt if he was pushed very hard, or even not very hard, we were near the boundary of things getting more difficult and possibly more expensive.  That is all I have to say really.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for the HSE.  I regret the fact that the entire discussion about section 38 and section 39 agencies has become dominated by two organisations, the CRC and Rehab.  That is not to say that I do not believe our actions were correct; I believe they were.  Both organisations needed serious examination but there are many more, and we have to be very careful that we do not end up having a situation where we exhaust one organisation while letting others off the hook, for want of a better phrase.  We have had a number of larger organisations and a number of hospitals where significant concerns have been expressed by many members of this committee, and indeed by the HSE, with regard to their own practices, for example, the interpretation of the consultants' contract in St. Vincent's hospital, which seems to be unique, if not bizarre, and which Ms McGuinness's director general has told me clearly he does not accept as correct.  In that hospital also we have had a very unique and interesting relationship between public and private, with public buildings mortgaged for the development of private entities.  We have had concerns about the national maternity hospital and some potential linkages with private business there, and salary levels.  I understand 1 July, which is only two days ago, was the date by which the HSE had informed this committee that it hoped to have resolutions to some of these matters in terms of bringing organisations into compliance.  Is Ms McGuinness in a position to cast any light on it today?</p></speech>

The details were required back by our human resources, HR, directorate on 1 July, which is only the day before yesterday, so what I have is very interim and some of the numbers in it could change.</p><p>  To recap on the posts over the past number of months, we have been working with the section 38 agencies to get details of where salaries are over and beyond what has been set as public pay policy for their respective grade at this point in time.  We have done a full assessment.  We have asked for all the details from each of the individual organisations.  The HSE then set up a review panel internally consisting of a number of senior management teams to go through the documentation submitted by each of those organisations.  Organisations were asked at the time whether there were contractual obligations, the form the contract took, and if there was a business case to be put forward - all the various documentation.</p><p>  At a high level, 202 business cases were received from the organisations across the sector and 143 of those were received in respect of senior managers, that is, those managers above grade 8 level.  Fifty-nine in respect of the salary level below grade 8 level were received.</p><p>  The internal review panel met in April and a period of three months was given to come into compliance with public pay policy or else to produce whatever necessary documentation they felt did not help them to do that.  In terms of where we are at a high level in that regard, 43 of those payments have ceased in total.  We have had confirmation back that they have ceased in total and withdrawn payments of that nature.</p></speech>

We have business cases which clearly set out contractual obligations, and they are seeking red circling now.  As I said, this information is pretty raw; it is only from the day before yesterday.  That will have to be assembled, gone through again and submitted, if relevant, to the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They would have substantive documentation attaching to them with regard to their legal contracts.</p><p>  Some of the agencies are in a separate process.  For example, the CRC is in a separate process, so we are leaving it aside.  About 18 of those are indicating that they have contractual commitments, obligations and legal contracts but we have not seen them.  That is roughly where it is at at this point in time.</p></speech>

Those 60 will be gone through again in finite detail.  The process is that there will be an engagement and discussion with the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, potentially with regard to some of those, and legal advice may have to be taken on some of them as well.  Our director of HR is on leave at the moment but we do not have any more information that I can give the Deputy but we will provide it to the committee when we have.

Excuse me for being pedantic but Ms McGuinness has indicated 43 where the payments have ceased in total and 60 of the 143 business cases came with the documentation.  Can I have the breakdown of the other 40?</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy each of the individual ones.  Forty-three have ceased in full.</p> <p>Three are in a category relating to what the HSE knows as the "one person one salary" principle.  An example would be when there is an outside arrangement, perhaps for lecturing, under a different contract and three of them are in a particular piece there.  As I stated, 60 are those for which there are contractual obligations, red circling is being sought and the documentation has been submitted.  Obviously, were this to proceed, it would be personal to the post holder and would change in the case of anybody new.  Eighteen have indicated contractual entitlements but the HSE is awaiting the documentation to be submitted in those cases.  They currently have not fulfilled and submitted the legal contracts in this regard.  Seven were working with agencies to achieve compliance, and as some were in partial compliance, we are working with them to see if we can get full compliance on that.  We are awaiting responses from four agencies on their actions to reach compliance and are stating this also is part of the compliance policy and statement.  We have eight in a separate process, one of which is the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC - this not to single out the CRC, as it has legitimate reasons in this respect - and that brings us up to 143 cases.</p></speech>

I have read the curricula vitae or the biographies of the CRC's new board it sent to the committee, including that of Ms Manahan herself.  It appears as though the CRC certainly has a robust, credible and diverse group of people on its board and I wish all of them the very best of luck.  While I am aware the CRC is reviewing its memorandum, that this is raw and it is only coming to terms with all of this now, the witnesses might indicate how they envisage the structuring of the board, what lessons can be learnt from the past with regard to the relationship with the HSE, term limits, annual general meetings and, in an issue we discussed with the representatives of the previous board, involvement with the service users, as well as possible representation for them.</p></speech>

There will be a number of terms that can be served, possibly two or three terms.  We continue to examine the skill sets on the board and where there are gaps, we will add additional areas.  We are looking at the membership and, as the Deputy is aware, a company limited by guarantee must have seven members.  We are a little bit light on that at present and I wish to echo what Mr. John Cregan said regarding the co-operation of the existing members in terms of doing that.  In particular, Mr. Goulding has been very helpful in reaching out to the other members and trying to get that.  Consequently, we are looking at that.  We are looking at how we will get parents and clients involved.  We think they need input into the board and whether that input is part of a group, part of bringing some people onto some committees, whether they are part of the board itself or of the membership are all in the mix in respect of what is being examined.  We will seek input in this regard from the various stakeholders.</p><p>  I am trying to remember for what else the Deputy asked.</p></speech>

The HSE is a major funder of the CRC, and last year 83% of funding for the CRC came directly from the HSE.  Consequently, it is a major stakeholder and therefore a major partner in the process.  We intend to keep that relationship very strong and professional.  Again, the HSE has been helpful in terms of moving things along in the last while and it is very open to what we are doing.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank Mr. Hamilton Goulding for his attendance and for being so open and honest.  I wish him the best of luck in whatever ventures to which he goes.  I also wish Mr. Timmins and Ms Manahan the best of luck in the CRC, and it is to be hoped this episode can soon be put behind us all.  I wish to ask Mr. John Cregan a question on the issue of Paul Kiely and the manner in which it was dealt.  Now that Mr. Cregan has been in the CRC and has concluded his administration, how would he have dealt with it?</p></speech>

However, I do say the Haddington Road agreement was going to be implemented on 1 July and I felt the board would then be in a stronger position to do a better deal.  I felt that the salary was overstated in terms of his pension arrangements and that this salary should have been reduced.</p></speech>

One is the actual salary <i>per se</i>but there was no legal impediment to Mr. Kiely's salary being reduced in line with public pay policy.  That is the point I have made there.  It was not reduced in the case of approximately half of his salary.  That would have made a difference, and had the Haddington Road agreement been implemented, it would have reduced the salary by nearly &euro;50,000.</p></speech>

What I say is there was an opportunity to reduce the salary in the light of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, and the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements, but that was not done.  Had that been done, significant savings would have been made to both the CRC and the pension fund.</p></speech>

My point is that all of this happened in 2009.  I accept that what happened before then was all different.  However, the HSE was put in place and a big change happened in 2009 in respect of how these organisations were to be run and what their public pay, which was to be brought into line, was to be.  However it appears as though this decision was made and the section 38 organisations have been left to deal with this on their own.  I accept the majority of their money comes from the public purse but they are separate legal entities.</p></speech>

However, I am trying to get to an overall point with regard to what we are trying to do here.  The section 38 organisations <i>per se</i>do a great deal of good work on the ground and the people they help, as well as their families, probably are the most vulnerable in society.  I accept a stage must be reached where public pay policy is implemented and, regardless of whether they are right or wrong, if the rates as designed reflect the policy, this is what must be implemented.</p> <p>I am very concerned about the way the HSE is approaching this.  They could be a lot more helpful with the boards and with those who are trying to run these organisations.  As I understand it, the boards are all voluntary.  From the point of view of public opinion, I cannot understand why the HSE has not appointed a HR expert - I am sure it has plenty of them - to sit down with those involved, come up with options, and help them implement a process so that everybody can get back to the job that he or she is employed to do.</p></speech>

My point is that Mr. Cregan is implementing the policy that has been designed, and it is his job to do that, but in order to get to where we all need to get to on this - I understand from what Ms McGuinness stated earlier that another 60 of them are still outside of where they need to be - it seems that these organisations should get HR help and legal advice.  It would be fair for the HSE to provide that, and it should have done so.  Whether they asked for it is irrelevant.  The HSE is the body in charge of them.  It is the body that pays them.  It is asking them to change their policies and their employment contracts with their employees even though they have a separate employment contract from that of the HSE.  It is not as straightforward as we would all like it to be.</p></speech>

In the report, I have been silent in terms of the salary and getting it down to the norm.  I have not commented on that.  However, what I have commented on is the application of the public sector pay cuts.  That is they only issue I have dealt with.</p></speech>

That is what I was trying to outline a while ago.</p><p>  Each of those individual agencies has been met and it is not just a case of form filling or being sent out forms.  Each of the agencies has an individual relationship with an area manager.  What we are saying, however, is that it should be one area manager responsible for the totality of a particular organisation, and if an organisation has three or four branches, there should be just one manager who can take the totality of it.</p><p>  We are working with the agencies to see how can they reach compliance, and that is where they have sent in some of those business cases that I outlined.  There are 60 business cases,  setting out that there are legal contractual obligations and seeking red circling.  We are going to work through with the agencies, and, indeed, discuss with our Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform colleagues, after we filter through them again, what the solution is in that regard.  Also, it is very difficult to get compliance overnight, as the committee will be aware.  That is what the Deputy is saying - we must work through them.</p><p>  As well as the normal interaction that we would have with the area manager through the service level arrangement, we also have put additional governance arrangements in place with the boards, because it was primarily between the executives before.  We meet the chairs of the boards themselves twice a year now in the disability sector.  One of those meetings is attended by the director of social care.</p><p>  As well as trying to develop a relationship, we are also trying to provide knowledge as to the latest best practice in relation to governance.  We last met on 20 June.  We had a specialist in the field to talk about the experiences, and there was a question and answer session in order to help them.  We have also asked that an audit be done on their compliance to assist them with the process.  We are there to help them in order to commit to compliance, so it is not as contentious a relationship as it might seem through correspondence.  The correspondence then relates to when we are not getting the information or not getting the required level of documentation that we need in order to assure ourselves that what should be being paid is being paid.</p></speech>

Ms McGuinness talks about accounts and not getting information.  In the service level agreement, why does the HSE not design a particular template of accounts that would provide it with all the information it needs at the end of the year and also a template on what the governance of all these organisations should be?  That would clean up so much of this.</p></speech>

That is part of their ethos and their culture.  Their accounts are prepared separately by their own staff and, indeed, by their own auditors and financial accountants.  That would not be within our remit to dictate.  However, we have asked that the specifics be given by the auditors of those accounts so that we can visibly see, and they will form an opinion in relation to pay policy and give us some assurances in that regard.</p></speech>

It would get bank balances and all the other information that the HSE would need.  Such a chart would be simple to design, would give the HSE the information it requires and would be part of their service level agreement and compliance statement at the end of every year.  Bodies would also have to design policies and governance that the HSE requires - for example, that the term of a board can only be three years, five years or whatever.  When that was done, they would have to sign off on all of it.</p></speech>

It might help if I go through some of the headings.</p><p>  The first page of the annual compliance statement that applies to section 38 agencies sets out the reason for it and its implementation, and how it will actually apply.  The next page contains the boards compliance statement.  That is the statement that has to be filled in.  Then, part 2 sets out board and corporate governance requirements.  That is setting out the various committees that should be in place for boards as best practice, the terms over which they should serve and how to go about the appointment of directors, the remunerations committee and the audit committee.  That is best practice in relation to corporate governance, which we have set out now for the first time for the boards as part of this overall compliance statement.</p><p>  As the committee will be aware, corporate governance is a whole evolving area.  It continues to evolve and get better each year.  This is in line with what is current best practice.  We have gone through that in detail with the chairs of the boards and taken their feedback.  We have arrived at this, which we have agreed to sign up to for the 2014 accounts and, indeed, in retrospect, for 2013, recognising that it would not be possible for all bodies to be in compliance in 2013.</p><p>  This has simplified it somewhat.  In fact, it was very much welcomed by a lot of the boards and chairmen, and the code of practice is in it.</p></speech>

It does not say there is any more information coming.  Is there anything in there that Mr. Cregan can tell us about this company?  It seems everyone just wants to drop it like a hot brick.  The directors seemed very happy to go and Mr. Conlan has written saying he does not want to know anything about it, that he is not there any more and that one should talk to somebody else.  Mr. Cregan says that in the event of non-co-operation there would be a very difficult situation.  We are now in that situation.  The company lost an awful lot of money every year and nobody is telling us anything about it, how or where it lost its money and who is responsible for it.  All we get from Mr. Cregan's report about it is the bare fact that the company is fully owned by Friends and Supporters of the CRC.  Is it not correct that at least one person employed by CRC had a CRC Medical Devices credit card?  How could that be?  Could Mr. Cregan explain that to us?  What happened?</p></speech>

It submits only very short accounts to the Companies Registration Office.  We know the company was spending money like water and that it was extravagant.  All we seem to know is that CRC charged it for management fees or expertise in the initial stages.  There was some strange inter-company transaction that Mr. Cregan does not know about.  We know about the credit cards.  We also know - this surprises me - that the auditors wrote to Mr. Brian Conlan on 6 February.</p> <p>It does tell us a little bit about what happened in the deal.  It is a strange deal that nobody will talk about, which is very odd, although Mr. Goulding has promised to give us some details about it.  There is just one thing that struck me - I think the assets were transferred to MMS Medical and all the rubbish, basically all the debt, seems to have been underwritten by Friends and Supporters.  Is that not correct, Mr. Cregan?  In fact, trade in the assets has gone to the buying company.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hamilton Goulding" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014070300032#HH02600"><p>The situation came about with the fitting of prosthetic devices, seating devices, wheelchairs, et cetera.  Purchasing equipment for disabled people is not like buying a pair of shoes; it involves a lot of specialised assessment and modification of the devices themselves.  The CRC was spending a lot time doing this with specialised staff in the seating department.  Agents would come in selling these devices and effectively used the labour of the CRC to make the assessment and decide which device was being used.  A lot of time and effort was made by clinic staff.  The transaction would then take place and the agent for the goods would achieve the sale and go away.</p><p>  Looking at this, we realised that it was strongly related to the core business.  It happened that, effectively, we were doing a lot of work and somebody else was making a profit as a result of it.  The idea therefore was to let us become an agent for these items and thus get some recompense for the work that was going into it.  That is how that business started.</p><p>  At that time - this was just before the downturn - there was a big turnover of those type of items.  There was a large list of people who had been approved by the HSE for getting one of these devices.  With the downturn, however, while people had been approved they were then told that although we had approved them we could not go ahead with that sale.  The volume of those items being sold and used absolutely plummeted.  Just like many a business that was set up in the times of economic prosperity, it bit the dust in a big way.</p><p>  On a number of occasions at board meetings we summoned in the executive team who, I must say, always impressed me very much.  At that time, Mr. Paul Kiely was keeping a weekly or fortnightly eye on it, getting briefings all the time.  Cost cutting took place; there were no luxury items and certainly no wastage that I ever saw.  Gradually, the market disappeared and the business went into loss.  Looking back, we should have wound up that operation much earlier but having risked money from the charity we were still reluctant.  This happens when something is going down; when does one stop?  We really hated the idea of making a loss for the clinic.  I know this got to Mr. Kiely personally, and it got to all of us, that we would hate to preside over a situation where we went into a venture that would not work and we would have to admit it.  We let it run a little bit too long and the losses accumulated.  Then a deal was finally opened up.  </p><p>  The trouble is that I am not well prepared in terms of accounts and numbers.  It is a long time ago and my recollection is not good.  I can obviously look into this and find more details for the Deputy.  I would be willing to do that except that I have no documentation now.  It needs to be resolved.  At the last meeting we had it was taken over very much by Mr. Conlan.  The last time we looked at it he gave us a briefing on it.  He said he was hoping that at the end of the process he was going through that we would get to a situation of nearly balancing any exposure or losses to the clinic.  </p><p>  Things have sort of disappeared into the ether now.  I regret to have to say this but I simply do not have, either on paper or in my head, sufficient information to answer the Deputy's questions here today.  </p></speech>

I am sorry to digress but it may explain this credit card thing, which I am not certain about.  There was a proposed partnership with a company in Germany.  A gentleman came from Germany and I recall his briefing to us.  In light of that, there was some idea that perhaps this guy had such ideas that the company may be able to revive itself.  We had two interested parties, put it that way.  It was not advertised for general tender but there were at least two parties, and possibly three, who were taking an interest in this as a possible sale.</p></speech>

We have a national planning and performance assurance group that has been set up as part of the overall directorate.  Certainly, I have an overview in relation to HR in terms of the number of employees.  We have a HR directorate, however, with specific delegated responsibility for the HR function.  It is the same with finance.  We have a CFO with responsibility for the finance function.  I have an overview of the performance.</p></speech>

The audit committee was established recently.  It was set up in January and we have met about four times to date.  We have gone through the annual financial statements.  There is an audit charter which sets out what the role and responsibilities are and there is a work plan.  To that, we get the internal audit reports.  A significant number of issues have been flagged as part of internal audit, but the CRC is not part of that at this time.  There are 4,000 service-level arrangements in place.</p></speech>

The effectiveness of the internal control has been flagged regarding areas which require improvement.  That has been set out among areas to be improved as part of the work plan.  We have matters there which we can furnish to the committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has represented at each of the audit committee meetings we have attended by the person with responsibility for our accounts in that office as much of the work of the audit committee this year has involved going through the detail of our annual report and annual financial statements which must be signed off at the end of March.  They have been gone through forensically by the chair of the audit committee who is independent.  There are things we must improve and we know that.</p></speech>

The issue is that the CRC was exposed in terms of CRC Medical Devices.  Therein lies the unanswered question.  Does Mr. Goulding know how it was funded from day 1 and what type of funds were used.  Was it public or private funding?  That appears to be where the guarantee is.  Therein lies the unsolved riddle.  It comes back, once again, to the impact on frontline services provided by the CRC.</p></speech>

I thank him very much for attending.  It is brave.</p> <p>It must have been a difficult and embarrassing time for Mr. Goulding, particularly because of his family connection with the body, to see it fall from grace in such a manner.  I know he accepts some responsibility for it.  The fact he attended the committee today and was prepared to answer our questions, particularly when he had the option of taking a different road which some of his colleagues have taken, will stand to his credit.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell said already, Mr. Goulding&rsquo;s family have been stalwarts to the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, and stars in setting it up and keeping it going.  I am glad he will assist the committee, the new board, and the Health Service Executive, HSE, in the future of the CRC.  While we have been critical of the mistakes that Mr. Goulding made, we should acknowledge the fact he gave the committee, in stark contrast to others involved, some very honest replies.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Emmanuel Crabit, head of the general justice policies and judicial systems unit at the European Commission's Directorate General for Justice.  Mr. Crabit is accompanied by Ms Eimear N&iacute; Bhroin, political affairs officer at the European Commission office in Dublin.  I also welcome Mr. Deagl&aacute;n &Oacute; Briain, principal officer at the Department of Justice and Equality.  I welcome, too, our guests in the Public Gallery.<br />The European Commission recently adopted a proposal, COM (2014) 158, for a new framework aimed at safeguarding the rule of law in the European Union.  The rule of law is one of the founding pillars of the EU, and the Commission has a crucial role, as the guardian of the treaties, in upholding it.  The new framework provides for the Commission to intervene early in cases of serious and systemic threats to the rule of law in a member state.  This has potential implications for member states, which is the reason for our initial examination today of the proposal.  Members will have the opportunity to hear the rationale for the framework, how it will work and what will trigger the three-stage process of the new framework from the senior officials from the European Commission and the Department of Justice and Equality who are in attendance today.<br />Before commencing, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.

I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity because Ireland was one of the first member states to underline the importance of promoting the rule of law within the EU.  Indeed, one year ago, the Irish Presidency made an impressive push to put this issue on the European agenda.  In the time available to me, I will talk about why the Commission has established the EU framework, its key characteristics and how it will function in practice.<br />Respect for the rule of law is one of the common values of the EU listed in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union.  This fundamental value is itself a prerequisite for the protection of all the other values listed in this article, including democracy and fundamental rights.  Respect for the rule of law is indispensable for the very functioning of the EU legal order and for mutual trust between member states.  The constitutions and judicial systems of EU member states are, in principle, well designed and equipped to protect citizens against any threat to the rule of law.  In recent years, however, we have seen crisis situations in some member states which have demonstrated that respect for the rule of law cannot be taken for granted, even within the EU.  During these crises, many turned to the Commission to seek its intervention.<br />The Commission intervened in those instances by exerting political pressure and, where possible, with infringement proceedings.  These actions led to results but also showed that the existing instruments at EU level are not always adequate for a swift and effective reaction.  The Commission can launch infringement proceedings against member states, but such proceedings can only be used where concerns relating to the rule of law constitute at the same time a breach of a provision of EU law.  Experience has shown this is not always the case.  There is also the famous Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which provides for preventive and sanctioning mechanisms in cases where a member state does not respect fundamental values, such as the rule of law.  However, the thresholds for using the mechanisms of Article 7 are high and, in practice, those mechanisms will only be used in extreme scenarios.    It is therefore necessary for the EU to have a lighter intermediate framework which is capable of covering situations which cannot be addressed by infringement proceedings and which remain below the high thresholds of Article 7.  This conclusion is shared by the Council and the European Parliament.  In June 2013, thanks to the Irish Presidency, the EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted conclusions which underline that &quot;respecting the rule of law is a prerequisite for the protection of fundamental rights&quot; and called on the Commission to take the debate further.  In addition, the European Parliament, in several resolutions, has called for new instruments to strengthen the rule of law in the EU.<br /><b></b>The objective of the framework is to facilitate a political dialogue with the member state concerned to prevent an emerging systemic threat to the rule of law from further escalating and developing into a situation mentioned in Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union.  The framework describes how the Commission intends to react to new rule-of-law crises and organise its approach in order to assess whether to use its power of initiating the mechanisms of Article 7.  The nature of this process of dialogue is political rather than legal.  The framework is designed to address a situation of systemic threats to the rule of law in a member state.  It does not address individual breaches of fundamental rights.  There is a systemic threat to the rule of law when the rule-of-law safeguards which exist at national level, such as constitutional review mechanisms, no longer function or come under threat.  Another characteristic of the framework is that it is sufficiently flexible to allow for swift and concrete actions.  Finally, by setting out in advance the approach the Commission will follow, the framework ensures respect for the principle of equal treatment of member states.<br />In terms of how it will function in practice, the framework establishes a three-stage process.  The first stage consists of a Commission assessment.  This is necessary to ensure a thorough and objective assessment of the situation at stake.</p> <p>The Commission may always seek external expertise - for instance, from the Council of Europe's Venice Commission.  Unless the matter is already resolved, the second stage is a Commission recommendation.  This will clearly indicate the reasons for the Commission's concerns and recommend the member state solves the problems identified in a fixed time limit.  The third stage is monitoring the follow-up to the recommendation.  If no solution is found within the framework, Article 7 will always remain the last resort to resolve a crisis.  The Commission will keep the European Parliament and the Council closely informed of the progress made at each stage of the process.</p><p> To conclude, I would like to underline that the framework is based on experience of crisis situations where the Commission was requested to intervene.  To a large extent the framework sets out steps the Commission has taken in the past.  The framework is operational and does not require additional measures before it can be used by the Commission.  We do not know whether or when we may face the next crisis, but the commitment Ireland has shown in promoting the rule of law in the EU provides a strong message for all.</p></speech>

Article 7 allows for the suspension of an EU member state that tolerates a situation that breaches the fundamental values of the European Union on democracy, rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights.  It made sense to us to focus on prevention rather than allow a crisis to develop, so we examined how crisis situations could be managed in advance.  Membership of the European Union has been very positive for Ireland, and all member states can learn from each other.  None of us is perfect, and we should not be afraid to open our imperfections to external scrutiny; we should put in place practical steps to deal with them.  There are benefits to comparing Ireland to other member states and systems.<br />At the start of the Irish Presidency, we felt that Ireland, a small member state with good relations with all other member states, should take on a difficult and sensitive topic that touches on issues of national sovereignty.  At this point, this was to be the Irish contribution to the future of the European Union.  Our starting point was concern at the apparent rise in xenophobia, anti-Semitism and other extreme forms of intolerance, including racism and homophobia, within the European Union and the perceived failure in some cases to respond adequately.<br />As a second strand, we were concerned that justice institutions, particularly the courts and the police, should function effectively so that mutual confidence and solidarity between member states is maintained.  Mr. Crabit referred to that point.  There is nothing more corrosive of the trust that is essential to the effective functioning of the European Union than the perception, accurate or not, that not all member states are wholeheartedly committed to the core European values of respect for personal freedoms and so on.  The institutions must function effectively in giving expression to those values.<br />Third, we were concerned about ensuring coherence between the internal and external dimensions of EU human rights policy.  The European External Action Service has put together an external human rights policy for the EU.  It is of great importance to our credibility that we in the EU are seen by the world outside to practise what we preach.  The element of coherence is important.<br />In January 2013, Ireland tabled a paper for discussion by justice Ministers at the first such meeting of its Presidency.  There was then a conference in May 2013 on the rule of law theme that led to Council conclusions adopted by EU justice Ministers in June 2013.  These conclusions called on the Commission to take forward a debate on the need for &quot;a collaborative and systematic method&quot; - that is, a rule of law mechanism or initiative to address the identified issues.  Given what I had to say earlier about the sensitivity of this topic, we regarded the securing of agreement by all member states to the text of these Council conclusions and the request that the Commission progress the debate as an important success for our Presidency.  We worked closely with a number of member states during our Presidency, particularly Finland and the Netherlands.  For example, after the Irish Presidency, Finland and Ireland presented a joint paper to a conference called the <i>Assises de la Justice</i>,<i></i>organised by the Commission in December 2013.  The conference was an important milestone in this debate.<br />We think the approach in the Commission's communication is positive.  The communication is a very clear and coherent response to the issues we have raised during our Presidency and the debate that has ensued thereafter.  Issues were raised by foreign affairs Ministers of four other member states in a letter to President Barroso.  When the communication was published we were able to warmly welcome the approach of the Commission.<br />There are issues that require further discussion.  As indicated in the scrutiny paper, we are aware of the legal view on the question of the Commission's competence to take the approach set out in the framework, though this is not a central concern.  In any event, one of the themes of the Irish Presidency's approach to this was the need for political discussion and peer review.  We are comfortable with the alternative suggested - that is, the involvement of the EU's institutions in a political debate at the request of member states without worrying about technical legal questions.  The discussion could be quite academic if it is not based on a concrete example, so these questions will probably arise when an issue needs to be addressed.<br />Another theme of the Irish Presidency was protecting the fundamental rights of individuals.  What is the link to the mechanism, and do EU citizens see this intervention as useful in protecting them?  The European External Action Service recommended the development of an internal fundamental rights policy, and it is the case that issues could be progressed in this way.  In terms of political discussions, there are questions relating to the roles of the Council, member states and external bodies and the reliance on evidence gathered by the Council of Europe and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights.  It is better to use a practical situation to tease out the answers.<br />Methodology is an area in which Ireland has a continuing interest.  Finland, the Netherlands and Ireland are working with the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights to identify a methodology by which rule of law indicators could be developed.  We seek clear answers to the questions of what is being measured and how.  How can this be done in a way that is not only valid in assessing a member state but can give a valid comparison across member states with different legal and constitutional traditions?<br />All member states, large and small, old and new, must be treated equally.  We must move forward on the basis of an agreed understanding of what we are trying to do.  As I have said already, some of these questions really come into focus when an actual situation must be addressed.</p></speech>

Is the new framework that was announced in March agreed and operational now, or will other proposals and changes be made?</p> <p>In other words, is Mr. Crabit here to inform us about a process which exists and which governments are putting in place or will further changes be necessary?</p></speech>

The framework explains how the Commission will assess the need for using the power of initiating the new mechanism.  It will enable more transparency and will be a means for the Commission to explain how it intends to use its power in the future.  This power is explicitly mentioned in Article 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union.  The framework is indeed operational.</p></speech>

What specific incidents or cases set in train the development of the new EU framework to strengthen the rule of law?  Do our guests envisage treaty change?  If such a change is necessary, a referendum will have to be held in Ireland.  Will the Members of the Parliament have any role to play or will it just be the Commission?  It was stated that there will a Commission assessment involved.  Will MEPs have a role in that regard?  Reference was made to threats to the rule of law which are of systemic nature and areas such as constitutional structures, separation of powers, independence or impartiality of the judiciary or a system of judicial review including constitutional justice were instanced in that regard.  In developed countries, these are all part and parcel of democracy.  Surely, in the context of new entrants to the EU, the position with regard to these areas would have been assessed in the opening of the various session chapters.  Is it the case that the position was satisfactory at one point in some of the new member states but that reversals have occurred in the context of, for example, the independence of the judiciary?  If the predominant concern relates to the new entrants, will our guests indicate whether reversals of policy occurred after their entry to the Union?</p></speech>

I did not have the opportunity to read all of the documentation supplied so I hope they will bear with me.  If I had read the documentation, I might not be obliged to ask any questions in order to try to understand what is involved.</p><p>  Romania and Hungary - certainly the latter - have been highlighted as two of the deviant European states which have at some stage been seen to interfere with the rights of their superior courts and in other areas.  I fully accept that Europe must be seen to apply the same rules and laws equally.  In other words, people in Ireland must be in a position to obtain the same level of justice as their counterparts in Greece.</p><p>  Mr. &Oacute; Briain stated that no nation is perfect.  His assertion is particularly apt when one considers the incredible ignorance of the Irish State in understanding that Roma children can be born with blue eyes and fair hair.  He also referred to the policy to try to combat homophobia and racism.  Members of the committee have just returned from Albania and Montenegro.  We were almost embarrassingly pointing the finger at the applicant states, stressing the rule of law and saying that they will not gain entry unless they meet the terms of admittance to the club.  The authorities in both countries are conscious of this and they continue to work extremely hard in respect of what they have do to.  It must be remembered that they are doing so pre-membership.  The question must be posed as to what has happened in Hungary and Romania, which became member states and which were supposedly in compliance with the rules that apply.</p><p>  Does the EU have a position on how nation states appoint judges?  There are people in this country who would say that all judges are political hacks and that one cannot become a judge unless one is the member of the right political party or has provided financial support to that party, worked for it or whatever.  If this is indeed the case, is it a fundamental flaw?  In the context of the rule of law and the arrest and questioning of Mr. Sarkozy, the latter's defence is that those involved are nothing but a shower of left wing magistrates who are politically committed to keeping him out of politics.  In the context of the assertion that Ireland chooses political hacks to be judges and Mr. Sarkozy's assertion that those questioning him are left wing lunatics, Trotskyists and communists who are determined to undermine him, is there a need to examine more closely allegations about our internal use of the rule of law?</p></speech>

Mr. Crabit referred to extraordinary scenarios in which Article 7 would be invoked.  If the rule of law stops short of invoking the latter - the big issue which arises here is that countries found to be in violation would not have voting rights - then what power is really available under it?  I refer specifically to the position in Hungary.  Is the rule of law retrospective and can it be used in respect of Hungary?  The Hungarian authorities have stated that they are not now surveilling judges.  However, everyone knows that judges and members of the political opposition in Hungary are under surveillance.  Will Mr. Crabit outline the nature of Article 7 and indicate why we are not prepared to invoke it?  Why have it if we are not in a position to invoke it?  The new framework will fall short of allowing for the invocation of Article 7.  If that is the case and if Hungary does not lose its voting rights as a result, what else can it lose?  The Hungarians will continue to do that which they are doing at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014070300005#D00600"><p>When one considers this matter in broad terms, people might ask as to why one would have any concerns.  In that context, Article 7 may be invoked in cases of serious and persistent breach of EU values and of those of each member state.  When one drills down, however, it is obvious that the values of individual states may differ greatly.  Why would anyone be opposed to human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, respect for human rights, etc.?  Again, however, if one drills down, one discovers that is not black and white.  Some countries might have particular attitudes in respect of human dignity.  I refer, for example, to a situation where a court in a particular member state might make a ruling to allow a person who is terminally ill and who is in extreme pain to take his or her own life.  Would some countries have a huge difficulty in that regard while others would not?  I am just being provocative in order to try to tease out the exact position.  In that context, if the elected government of a country such as Hungary is of the view that a threat exists, then surely the Commission is undermining its democratic basis.</p> <p>They are some of the debates that will take place.  I have difficulty with the proposal concerning the rule of law.  A young Irish person is before the courts in Egypt and one could argue that what is happening there is according to the rule of law.  Judges are presiding over the situation but in some cases they will not allow lawyers to put forward a case.</p></speech>

I accept it is not a country within the European Union.</p><p>  If one has a country that has taken a decision not to allow immigrants, does that go against European values of welcoming people?  I refer to those fleeing conflict or war.  Concerns arise in regard to such issues.  If we give the power, one could argue then that the Commission is in transition and one is further centralising power in the Commission.  A big debate arises in that regard on Europe and there is clearly a disconnect with some member states.</p><p>  On the surface, we would agree with the approach proposed to deal with countries that are undermining such values, but questions arise as to when we intervene.  For example, do we intervene if we do not like a political party or organisation elected to government somewhere whose views are anathema to many of us within Europe?  Is that the direction in which we are slowly being pushed?  Concerns arise in that regard.  On the surface, one could ask why one would oppose such an approach but we must ask questions.  I accept we are scrutinising the issue but I do not know enough about the situation in Hungary or other countries.  I would be concerned if we were checking judges willy-nilly without having a formal process, for example, whether the Minister for justice, for example, were to be the only one to decide if a structure must be in place.  I do not know whether the Hungarians have such a system.  What would the approach be if one had a judge that was involved in looking at child pornography?  In most countries another judge would make an order on the situation.  Concerns arise about situations where people would find it logical that one would approach certain issues when difficulties arise.  I presume the Hungarians and others in the region are worried about what is happening in Ukraine.  That is not to justify any country tearing up its constitution or laws but surely it is a matter for those elected in those countries if they want to change their value system or constitution.</p></speech>

Having tried bilocation, I then attempted trilocation, which is even more difficult.  I was singularly unsuccessful.  This is an important subject.  I empathise with the points expressed by Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe and other speakers.  It behoves us to carefully balance our attitudes in cases where the European institutions might intervene in what might be seen by some as the internal affairs of a member state.<br />A determination must be made on whether the rule of law has broken down; if the constitutional requirements of the individual member state are being adhered to; whether, for example, in the case of a member state with a written constitution and those without one &ndash; we can make a comparison between this country and the United Kingdom in that regard; but there must be a recognition that the constitution of the member state is recognised, observed and honoured, otherwise the European institutions may well bring themselves into disrepute.  In view of the experience in the most recent elections to the European Parliament, where there was evidence to the effect that the population in some member states seem to have developed an antipathy towards the European institutions - whether it is well based or not is really not material to this particular conversation but it exists - because of that fact we must travel very carefully before we invoke the provision of Article 7.  I accept what Viviane Reding has said, that it would only be done as a last resort.<br />In the course of ordinary domestic political debate one might determine that the rule of law has broken down.  It used to be a question of observance of the <i>acquis communitaire</i>and that in the case of accession the member seeking accession had to observe it over a period.  That does not mean when accession has been achieved that a country can depart from such observance.  We are all part of it and we must continue to support it.  If we do not do so then we all contribute to the undermining of the institutions to which we aspire.  That approach will not work.<br />The point which was raised by Deputy Crowe is what the European institutions should do in the event of an administration, notwithstanding compliance with its own constitution or the <i>acquis communitaire</i>, if a regime develops, which could happen within the European Union in certain circumstances, that is not intent on observing the rule of law.  The question is whether the institutions would be willing to allow freedom of expression, recognise human and civil rights and follow the grounds according to which the member states originally aspired to join the Union.  Deviation from that would be grounds for asking questions.  It is not desirable for the European institutions to become involved in individual member states on a daily basis in the administration of law.  It was not intended that it ever should.  It would create a dangerous precedent for the future in that eventually one could have interventions from the European institutions on a daily basis which might be welcomed in 50% of cases but otherwise would not.<br />To follow on from the points made by Deputy Eric Byrne, in this country we have a clear definition between the Judiciary and the Executive.  That has always been the case.  The system has worked extremely well.  The obligation is on all of us on both sides of the divide to recognise and accept its existence.  In the past ten years there have been situations where the Parliament in particular has overstepped the boundary of propriety.  That brings a reaction of its own accord which should not happen.  Similarly, the Judiciary must observe the rules as well.  Otherwise, we get into a situation where we have to politicise the Judiciary, which is not desirable in this country or in any other country.  There must be an ongoing recognition of the separation of powers by whatever means the separation is recognised in the individual member states.</p> <p> I believe sincerely that as time goes by we have to revise our thinking in certain areas in respect of various instruments and directives.  We should learn from past experience also.  We must recognise that where there is opposition or where Ireland, another member state or European institutions made a mistake, whether in reacting too soon or failing to react at all, and Ukraine is a classic example of the European Union as an entity reacting rather late to a situation developing in its neighbourhood, the power comes from the people to the individual member states, governments and parliaments in the first instance.  That is from where the European institutions derive their power because as we know all directives originate within the European institutions, come to the member state parliaments and the relevant bodies in the member states for appraisal and approval and, unfortunately, often get put into deep freeze, so to speak, for a number of years only to pop up at a later time.  I recall one or two directives in particular to which that applies.  They pop up ten or 12 years later having been given a derogation.  I would abolish derogations for everything because that would bring everything up to date, everything would be upfront and anybody would be able to say that this will affect the member state parliament of which they are part.  We postpone those decisions for ten or 12 years.  When they come back to bite the people, so to speak, nobody knows where they came from and, invariably, the European institutions are blamed and it is said that they are the people who caused all the problems.  I have heard people say, as I know has the Chairman, that the economic downturn across Europe was caused by the European institutions.  It was not; it was caused by institutions in member states, and the European institutions, that failed to react, plan ahead and recognise the signs that were obvious to people for many years, and took no action.  I am sorry about that rant, Chairman.</p></speech>

We talk about xenophobia and racism, and it is easy to see from the polls where the rule of law is breaking down, on which everybody would agree, but we all have different laws.  Is this process simply about ensuring that countries uphold their own laws rather than interfering with those laws?  As Deputy Durkan said, we have a Constitution and a Supreme Court that interprets our laws and the only change allowed is by referendum.  There are many areas where this Republic is unique.  One thinks of our divorce laws and the protection of life during pregnancy legislation.  There are areas in other countries where subjectivity about a law arises but to borrow the French term, <i>vive la diff&eacute;rence</i>.  There has to be different interpretations of laws.  The blunt question is whether countries will continue with that, as I assume they will have to because of the way our Constitution can only be changed by referendum.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.860" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Deagl&aacute;n &Oacute; Briain" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014070300007#F00400"><p>I would like to go first.  Much of the detail was directed at my colleague from the Commission but some issues were raised to which I would like to respond.</p><p>  On the questions posed by Deputy Eric Byrne, our addressing this issue during our Presidency did not take place in a vacuum but part of our success in persuading all member states to sign up to a set of conclusions to ask the Commission to take forward the debate was to be scrupulous not to mention any other member state.  We took the view that there is the potential for problems to emerge in any member state and that all of us should be open to looking at those, to external scrutiny and to dealing with those type of problems.  </p><p>  In terms of the Roma, for example, which is topical, it is clear we failed seriously in that regard and the Minister, the acting Garda Commissioner and the Taoiseach have apologised.  The Minister has given clear directions that we must address the type of issues that arose, particularly the lack of cultural competence within public sector organisations.  She addressed that point in the Seanad earlier on Committee Stage of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill in terms of how we will go about doing that, including the need for an assessment to be carried out on the needs of Roma people living in Ireland, and how we address those, with an obvious link in terms of how we improve the way we engage with the Traveller community and learn one from the other.  That is an example of a failure the State acknowledges, and is dealing with the problem, and in that sense it is clearly outside the scope of this sort of mechanism, which is about grievous problems that arise where the member state perhaps is not dealing with it.  I do not believe we have anything to worry about in that regard, although the situation those two families faced is serious and traumatic.  It will take a long time for the children, and the families, to come to terms with it but I understand the three apologies were very well received.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned judges.  I mentioned at the end of my opening statement how one would put a methodology in place to assess the standards of compliance with the rule of law and European values in member states, and judges are an interesting example.  The type of approach we have been taking is to look at specific issues, such as the independence of the Judiciary, and examining a methodology in terms of how one assesses that at three levels - structure, process and outcome.  Structure would be to ask a country if it has a statement in its constitution or equivalent that the judiciary is independent that is, pass or fail.  Process is the way they are appointed.  We have had debate here on that and there are proposals to put in place a judicial council.  Therefore, we have already recognised that there is work to be done.  The final one is the outcome.  Is the public confident that justice is fair and impartial?  Once judges sit on the Bench, regardless of how they are appointed, are they politically independent?  Are commercial companies, including foreign companies, confident that justice will be fairly and competently administered?  I believe we pass on all of those.  The point is that it is that outcome we are looking at rather than worrying about issues that are peculiar to a member state that the member state may have already recognised it needs to address or issues that are an emotionally important part of its sense of identity or its constitutional tradition.  We could also look at whether the member state has a written or an unwritten constitution, for example, an elected president or a constitutional monarchy.  Those are outside the scope of what the European Union can address because they are not really important.  What is important, and I will not mention any member state, is whether a member state with a constitution or a hereditary monarchy is a functioning democracy.  That is the question.</p><p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe asked what we mean by the rule of law and whether it is just about applying formalistic rules.  There was a discussion during our Presidency on exactly what we were talking about.  There is a need to be clear on what we are talking about, and there are different academic definitions.  Without boring members with all the details, there is a thick and a thin definition and the thin definition is that the rule of law is about following the rules.  It does not matter what the rules are, and that is clearly not an appropriate definition for the European Union.  The thick definition, and there is a good deal of detail on this in the speech the then Minister gave at our conference in May 2003 which I can pass on to members if they are interested, is bound up with values, protecting fundamental rights and justice systems that function effectively to protect the rights of the individual rather than just following the rules, whatever they may be.</p><p>  In terms of centralising power in the Commission, the Commission is the guardian of the treaties.  That role is particularly important for small member states, and the Commission was asked by all the member states' justice Ministers to take forward debate and come back with a communication in terms of how it would take these issues forward.</p><p>  To respond to Deputy Murphy's point, we all have different laws.  This is about putting in place something to deal with or head off crises where fundamental European values to which every member state has signed up are in danger of not being adhered.  Issues that relate to the particular approach of individual member states are completely outside of that, and even if it wanted to the Commission cannot start examining them.</p> <p>Matters such as our divorce regime, issues in respect of abortion and so on are completely outside the proposal, even if they were not already clearly protected by the protocol to the Lisbon treaty, for example.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Emmanuel Crabit" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014070300008#G00200"><p>I thank members for their earlier remarks, which are very interesting for the Commission.  There was an initial set of remarks concerning the situation we want to cover and the concepts we are using.  It is important to understand that the framework covers situations in which something is happening within a member state that could constitute a systemic threat to the rule of law.  The question is what is meant by a systemic threat to the rule of law.  First, what is meant by the rule of law?  We must be clear that there is no uniform definition of &quot;rule of law&quot; today to which everyone agrees.  However, everybody agrees that on the basis of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and of the European Court of Justice, there is a common understanding.  A number of principles are used and while it is true there is no uniform definition, there is a common understanding.  Moreover, as Mr. &Oacute; Briain noted, this common understanding is not simply the mere mechanical application of the law but has a substantive element, which is to uphold fundamental rights also.  It is a question of how the safeguard mechanism functions to safeguard fundamental values and fundamental rights.  Everybody in all academic circles recognises that even if there is no uniform definition of rule of law, there is such a common understanding, which encompasses a number of legal principles, such as the principles of legal certainty, separation of power, independence of the Judiciary and so on, and these constitute a common understanding.<br />However, what is important for us is we do not need to have an abstract definition of the rule of law, because the framework is for addressing a very specific situation, namely, the so-called &quot;rule of law crisis&quot;.  Consequently, the question is less to define what is the rule of law but more what is a rule of law crisis.  As in many cases, it is difficult to have an abstract definition of the rule of law but with the experience we have seen in recent years, a rule of law crisis is something that is commonly understood by many stakeholders and member states.  It is important to note that when the Commission was asked to intervene, it was by both the European Parliament and a number of member states because for a number of the latter, the position that was at stake was a serious concern<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the rule of law.  However, in this situation, it was difficult to state that it would qualify for meeting the thresholds of Article 7.  As members are aware, Article 7 has two thresholds, the first of which is when there is a clear risk of serious breach and this is a preventative mechanism.  The second threshold is when there is a serious and persistent breach.  These mechanisms have never been used, precisely because that would be a very extreme scenario.  At the same time, however, the Commission faced a situation in which a number of member states stated that while it perhaps was not an Article 7 situation, it was a serious situation.  It is also interesting to note that among the member states that called for more action were a number of member states that traditionally are very cautious as regards the power of the Commission.  It was very interesting to see that the Justice and Home Affairs Council sought to have a broader reflection to ascertain whether the Commission could establish a framework that would enable for the future a swift reaction for the next crisis, if any.  It is important to make the point that the Commission is speaking about a situation in which there is a rule of law crisis, not about the rule of law in general.<br />In addition, we are not speaking about all the values of Article 2.  The framework focuses on the rule of law because we are fully aware that all the values that are listed in Article 2 are very important but also raise a number of questions of definition.  The reason the Commission has focused on the rule of law in the first instance is because it was a request by the European Parliament and the Council.  It also was because experience again has shown that the question in reality was the issue of what will happen when the national mechanisms to safeguard the rule of law are under threat or no longer function.  It is very important to note it is clear this is for the national constitutions and that all member states are very well equipped to address all these issues.  However, what happens were something to occur where the rule of law safeguards themselves are longer functioning?  It was interesting that in the two cases with which we must deal, the first request came from the supreme courts in many cases, that is, from the national court of the national judiciary, which felt itself to be in a situation that was difficult and which asked the Commission to intervene.  The Commission of course has no power to set standards on the national rule of law safeguards.  However, it is true that in reality, we have been facing a situation in which a number of states have asked the Commission to intervene.  Moreover, the judiciary itself came to the Commission asking it to intervene.  The framework focuses on the situation of a rule of law crisis, that is, something that is exceptional.  The objective is not to set standards on the rule of law or, in response to Deputy Eric Byrne's question, on the appointment of judges,.  We have no power to harmonise or to propose uniform standards on these issues.  It is not at all an issue of regulating in this regard.  We are in a situation where we may be facing a crisis situation and the question is what can we do in the future.  While we know that we have Article 7, given the experiences we have had, we think it is important for the Commission to explain in the future how it will proceed in such a situation.<br />In terms of concept, it is important to perceive that we are not speaking about all the values of Article 2.  We are not speaking about setting new standards on a judiciary, on how to appoint judges, on the security clearance of judges or these extremely complicated questions.  We have no power to make any uniform standard.  It is also important to explain that we are not dealing with issues relating to the <i>acquis communautaire</i>.  It is important to emphasise that the rule of law framework is for situations which cannot be addressed by infringement proceedings.  If we think about the issue of racism and xenophobia, a framework decision has been adopted that obliges member states to incriminate racist hate speech.  As this is European Union law, we are not in a situation of a rule of law crisis in this regard.  As members are aware, it is a framework decision and as of 3 December 2014, the Commission will have the power to launch infringement proceedings in the case of a breach by a member state of this framework decision.  However, in this case, we are not at all within the scenario of the framework.  We are in the scenario of applying European Union law and the role of the Commission to ensure, as the guardian of the treaties, that European Union law is well applied.  We also have a directive from 2000 against discrimination based on race.  I refer to the EU racial equality directive, which also is European Union law and which enables the Commission, if necessary, to intervene through the normal tool of infringement.</p> <p>There are many issues which also could be related to fundamental values, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights is EU law.  This is not the same as a situation that we want to cover with the framework.  For the framework, it will be a situation which cannot be at risk through the infringement.  It is important to clarify that because I have the feeling that there was confusion on the different concepts.</p><p> As regard the treaty change, as I explained, the framework is based on the current treaty.  It does not have the effect of amending the treaty.  The treaty states the Commission can initiate the mechanism of Article 12(7) by making a proposal.  We are explaining how we will proceed to assess whether or not to make this proposal.  This does not require amendment of the treaty.  It is not something which modifies the treaty.  It is important to clarify.  Of course, it does not prevent a broader reflection as regard possible treaty change but what we established now with the framework is something which is within the treaty and which does not change at all or amend the treaty.</p><p> As regards the independence of the Judiciary, as I stated, we have no power to set standards on the independence of the Judiciary.  What we are doing with regard to the effective functioning of the Judiciary is not with the framework, but more as regards the European Semester.  As the committee will be aware, in the context of the European Semester we encourage certain member states to improve the effectiveness of their justice system.  The effectiveness of their justice system involves three elements: independence of the Judiciary, quality and efficiency.  The Commission has established an information tool which is the EU justice scoreboard, which gives an overview on how the national justice system functions.  This is not the same type of instrument as the framework.  What we are doing in terms of encouraging member states to improve the functioning of their justice system is something which is made in the context of the European Semester because having an effective justice system is very important for trust and growth, and everybody recognises this.  This is part of this exercise.  Three years ago the Council adopted, under the proposal of the Commission, country specific recommendations on the function of the Judiciary.  However, this is not the same situation-----</p></speech>

There is this EU justice scoreboard which is an information tool which provides comparative information for 28 member states.  It is just information.  This information gives a comparative overview on the efficiency and the lines of proceedings, on the quality, for instance, the use of ICT, the training of judges, the evaluation system in member states on the Judiciary, and on the independence.  This will be completed by a country analysis in the context of the European Semester which could lead to the formulation of country-specific recommendations.  That is a process.</p><p>  However, this is not the situation of our rule-of-law crisis.  We have seen a situation in the past years where, for instance, the power of the constitutional court was subject to very significant reform, which has created some concern.  The governance of the judicial system was also subject to significant reform which has created concerns among certain member states, and more so in the European Parliament and among the members of the judiciary itself.  As I said, the framework is designed to address a specific situation which can occur in a member state which would lead to a systemic threat to the rule of law.  Here, the question is whether the Commission does nothing or should the Commission step in even if we are not yet at the thresholds of Article 12(7).  The latter was a question which has been raised.  It has been raised not by the Commission alone but by many member states, and the Council and the Parliament, which turned to the Commission.  What we do with this framework is to better organise ourself for the future crisis.  We hope that it will never happen but if it happens we have explained how we will proceed.</p></speech>

Immigration in Europe seems to have become an issue in recent times.  That is a nice word for it - there is another description of that issue as well.  In the recent European elections, immigration featured.  The question that arises then is to what extent has Europe got an immigration policy that is fair and equal across the board and applicable to each member state.  For example, should it be that one or two countries must face the bulk of the burden?  Should it be that some countries have already indulged in what would appear to be a violation of race relations legislation in their home countries?  To what extent can Mr. Crabit intervene in that?  If, for example, we were all allowed to make racist or anti-ethnic speeches, which have been shown in various locations throughout the globe in recent years to be the beginning of the breakdown of the rule of law, that would be an initial potential breach or an indication of the breakdown of the rule of law.  I need not go into the individual cases as such.  When the problem becomes a major issue, it is too late.  It has to be identified at an early stage.  How do we identify it and deal with it in a way that is fair to all?</p></speech>

We have the Return Directive.  We have a number of instruments which regulate immigration, for example, the asylum <i>acquis</i>.  For these type of issues, of course, the EU system applies.  A member states must comply with all of these EU <i>acquis</i>in regard to immigration, visas and asylum.<br />As regards the issues of hate speech, racist, zenophobia, etc., to which Deputy Durkan refers, these are an EU matter.  We have this framework decision which obliges member states to criminalise hate speech based on race and zenophobic grounds.  There is EU law and it is an EU law matter.  It is not an issue of rule-of-law crisis.</p></speech>

The triggering point for the framework will not be the immigration matter or this racism matter.</p> <p>It would be more concerned with our being in a situation in which the role of the Supreme Court, in dealing with this matter, were suddenly reformed in a manner that put at risk the effectiveness of all these national rule of law standards.  I refer to where the national courts can no longer intervene because their powers are limited.  The rule of law element is the focus of the framework but the substantive matter of migration, anti-discrimination and racism policy is more a matter of using the relevant power to ensure the <i>acquis </i>in this matter is fully applied by the member states.  The rule of law framework will protect the national rule of law mechanism standards.</p></speech>

There is not much sense in having the European institutions stipulate, consequent to their having overall responsibility, that one cannot do this or that and that one must observe such a law, according to the letter or spirit, if breaches continue regardless.</p><p>  I fully recognise that the Union cannot be a home for all refugees and immigrants from all over the world.  We must have European legislation, and we have.  Whether this is effective or does its job to the extent intended remains to be seen.  If it does not do so, it should be amended.  Once immigrants &mdash; and Irish emigrants &mdash; arrive in a member state of the European Union, they are entitled to be treated in accordance with the laws laid down by that state and the Union.  Breaches and deviations in this regard are not acceptable, and no exceptions should be made.  It is utter hypocrisy for the European institutions and member states to avoid dealing with these circumstances fairly regularly when there are clear indications of racist tendencies.  People become very popular on the back of those tendencies, as expressed in various speeches over the past five years, in particular.  The rule of law will be in jeopardy in the event of European and national institutions acting inappropriately.  National institutions can do so, for domestic purposes, to feed domestic electorates information they want at a particular time, but doing so is not representative of the rule of law; it is in breach of the rule of law.  We need to define that quite clearly and carefully.  As with the Chairman, I deal with this subject fairly regularly.</p></speech>

It is worth teasing out again the point that Mr. Crabit made.  The European Union has a framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia by means of the criminal law.  It requires member states to have hate crime legislation.  The Union also has anti-discrimination legislation.  If a member state fails to put the two legislative codes in place, the Commission has the power to launch infringement proceedings.  That is part of run-of-the-mill monitoring and compliance.</p><p>  Let us consider what the rule of law framework deals with.  We have had relevant incidents here in this regard.  It is not that the member state has not applied the law properly or that it is being broken.  The framework deals with circumstances in which the political system tolerates or encourages racist discourse.  That is a threat to the fundamental values of the European Union and the neighbours of the member state in question.  Therefore, it is a matter of determining whether a problem is systemic and whether the member state is dealing with it.  If it is systemic and the member state is not dealing with it, the Commission has the additional procedure, which it hA published, for dealing with the matter.</p><p>  On a point of information, the framework decision on dealing with racism and so on via the criminal law is being reviewed in terms of implementation.  The Commission has indicated it is reviewing all member states, including Ireland, and examining domestic legislation to ensure the framework decision on criminal law has been transposed properly.  This will be happening, if it has not already commenced, in the course of this year.</p></speech>

I welcome the representatives from the European Regions Network for the Application of Communications Technology, ERNACT, Mr. Colm McColgan, general manager, Councillor Gerard Diver, chairperson of Derry City Council, board member Councillor Rena Donaghey, Donegal County Council, board member and newly elected councillor of Donegal County Council, Niamh Kennedy, and board member Mr. Brian Boyle, Donegal County Council.  I have a good deal of knowledge about the group, having been a former chairperson, and I am familiar with its work.  This is a good opportunity to put the good work it has been involved in on the public record.  From the point of view of the committee, there might be opportunities to explore, in terms of assistance to different parts of the country, both north and south.  The organisation works to develop a number of digital projects and to secure EU funding.  We look forward to exploring with the delegation the importance of technology in driving economic development and supporting business and to discussing how the experience of other regions can be applied in the north west.</p><p>  Before I call on the witnesses to make their introductory comments and presentation, I must warn them about privilege.  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Diver to begin.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity to address the committee.  The work the committee is doing is very important and it has obviously cast the net wide in terms of the matters on which it wishes to be briefed.</p><p>  I have been on the ERNACT network for only a couple of years but the network has been in existence for over 20 years.  It was initiated by the two neighbouring councils on the north west of the island, Derry City Council and Donegal County Council.  They were quite prescient 21 years ago.  The network was founded to look at communications, particularly through information communications technology, ICT, and the application of ICT.  We all know what has happened over the last 20 years.  I do not think the Internet existed 21 years ago, so it was far-seeing to create the network.</p><p>  It was obviously prompted in part by our physical location.  The local authorities are based on the north west of the island, which is on the north west of Europe, so that is a big challenge in terms of our peripherality and the links and relationships we have with places outside our region.  The network has worked very successfully over those 20 years and has received a great deal of co-operation from other regions and municipalities across the European Union.  You will be aware of that, Chairman, as you were directly involved in the network.  It has successfully accessed funding for ICT projects, to develop models of good practice and for different projects that are able to help member states of the EU work together collaboratively on a better footing on the ICT agenda.  We recently returned from a trip to Atlantic Canada, so ERNACT is now looking outside the European Union in terms of its remit through our relationship with our friends across the Atlantic.  That is a very exciting development for the work we will be doing.  As somebody who is a fairly recent addition to the network, it appears to me that part of the difficulty we have had is that we have hidden our light under a bushel with regard to the achievements and the work done over the past 20 years.</p><p>  At this stage I will hand over to Colm McColgan to make the presentation and give an insight into the work that ERNACT has done and plans to do in the future.  I thank the committee for listening to us today.</p></speech>

I echo what our chairperson has said.</p><p>  I will focus on high speed broadband and the challenges it presents for rural areas, particularly for rural areas in border regions which tend to be far away from their respective capitals.</p> <p>My first slide shows figures that highlight the importance of information technology.  We have a lot of  SMEs that use information technology and there is evidence to show they grow twice as fast as ones that do not.  </p><p> Another aspect is the fear that information technology destroys jobs.  It does but there is evidence that for every job it destroys two and a half new jobs are created.  Therefore, information technology cannot be ignored and we must get on board with it.  </p><p> We are delighted that the joint committee specifically mentions communications infrastructure as part of its remit on its website.  We feel that the sector is one of the most important assets for an area.   One of the main things we want to do today is show the committee what we have learned is happening outside of Ireland, outside the United Kingdom and in other parts of Europe, particularly in the Nordic countries which are very far thinking in their approach to this challenge.  </p><p> As Mr. Diver has said, ERNACT has been around for 20 years.  In that period we have engaged with about 130 regions.  Today we engage with about 50 regions on a whole range of digital development issues.  Of course that work embraces infrastructure but it also deals with services and how they can be used for the good of society, business and education.</p><p> The next slide gives a flavour of the type of projects we are working on.  The top project relates to broadband and refers to ten regions in Europe that have substantial rural areas.  They are very concerned that the business case for the private sector does not stack up and, therefore, one must put in public money if one wants to install very good broadband in rural areas.  Of course this is a time when national governments are strapped for cash which is the worst situation one can meet.  Other projects deal with things like using the Internet to deliver public services and the way different regions can use it, for example, to promote tourism by developing apps.  Those are some of the projects that ERNACT is currently involved with and the slides give a flavour of the type of work that we do.  </p><p> A lot of public authorities around Europe are very interested in the concept of open data and how one can better use social media and social media channels to deliver public services.  We are working on such a project. </p><p> Mr. Diver has mentioned that we have started to look to the other side of the Atlantic.  That move was prompted by the fact that the European Union has, for the first time, compiled a strategy for its side of the Atlantic.  The European Union specifically referenced the Canadian and American side of things so we travelled there to see if there was a basis for co-operation.  We were delighted to learn that they were very open to collaboration and that we have a lot of things, including challenges, in common.</p><p> I have given an introduction to ERNACT and shall now talk about broadband in the Border area.  Up until 2007-2008, which was the end of the last INTERREG programme, there was a big emphasis on telecoms.  During the period between 2000 and 2007 a lot of good work was done on the north-west corridor, particularly between Derry and Letterkenny.  In 2010 there were no cross-Border fibre links in the area but that has changed through a combination of good support from two councils - Derry City Council and Donegal County Council - and the fact that there was, at the time, more funding from national governments, with good support being provided by Dublin and Belfast.  At the end of that period there were four cross-Border fibre links and Project Kelvin is one that all the committee Members probably know about.  It was well supported by both Governments and other links exist as well.  If support had not been provided through cross-Border programmes there would be no links in the region.    </p><p> The programmes run in five to seven-year cycles.  Another project has just finished but it had very little provision for broadband.  A new programme is being discussed and is under public consultation but it contains no broadband provision.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.892" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm McColgan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300004#E00300"><p>Yes.  That is not saying that some broadband things may not be done but it is not mentioned or given the same priority.  We did so well out of the INTERREG programme in terms of improving infrastructure that it might present some kind of a problem for us.</p><p>   In the past the challenge was to get big fibre linked broadband into an area but now the challenge is to bring high speed broadband to houses, farms and small businesses located in rural areas.  The matter is being looked at very seriously in Finland and Sweden and I have an example from the latter.  We know that the market will look after larger towns and cities and the same applies to the Border region.  A lot of people in Donegal and the Derry City Council rural area live in the country where introducing broadband is quite expensive.  There is a view that high speed wireless will be a solution for rural areas.  Yesterday it was announced in the newspapers that parts of Dublin will get 1,000 Mbps.  We think that a problem will be created if one region gets 1,000 Mbps while another gets between 40 or 50 Mbps.  In Sweden researchers have analysed such a challenge because fibre cables are being put into farms and houses.  The Swedish model is quite different from the Irish model.  In Sweden most of the fibre networks are owned by the public sector which leases them back to private telecom operators in order for them to deliver services.  That is quite different from the way the telecom system has evolved here in Ireland.</p><p>  The next slide shows a county located in the north of Sweden which is remote and very sparsely populated when compared with anywhere here in Ireland.  The next slide is a more detailed map and the green spots represent small communities that have built their own fibre network.  Between 80% and 90% of the cost of deploying fibre networks relates to digging and not the fancy technologies or fibre cables.  Typically, in Sweden, a local authority or co-op would take ownership of the project.  Therefore, it would help to plan the route in consultation with local communities, it would ensure there was sufficient backhaul and it would train local people with JCBs and tractors how to dig appropriate sized trenches, how to fit special equipment on the back of their machines and how to do the work.</p> <p>In these times when we are strapped for cash at national level, both in the North and in the South, we think this is a model worth trying here.  We have engaged and are talking to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, DARD, in Northern Ireland and it is taking a good hard look at it.  We had the idea of piloting a trial in quite a rural area straddling the Border.  We could use the pilot to figure out whether what the Swedes have done would work in Ireland.  It does pay for itself over a longer time period than the private sector would demand.</p></speech>

This is tangible and we will put it on the desks of people who need to look at this idea as a possibility.  We appreciate Mr. McColgan's presentation.  With the agreement of members, we will open up the discussion to allow them to make observations and ask questions.  We will have an interactive exchange.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.895" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Murphy" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300005#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. McColgan for this very interesting presentation.  I am very familiar with the issues raised in the area I live in and represent in South Armagh.  We have problems with connections for farms in particular because much of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development form filling exercises are now done online and many farmers have difficulty accessing proper broadband.  I was dealing with a case last week on the old Belfast to Dublin road, and one would think there would be strong connections on the main route in the island but there are difficulties for small businesses that need high speed connection.  In the North, both the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, DETI and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, DARD, have given money to try to give these companies the finance to provide broadband and hit the spots where there is poor connectivity.  This has been going on for a number of years but in my experience it has had a limited impact.  Is Mr. McColgan sensing a different approach when he has conversations with DARD and DETI or is it more of the same?  Essentially, organisations such as BT have been given assistance to try to provide a service.  Some people have got it but it is a slow and patchy process.  We still find there are large parts - I presume if it is happening on my patch of the Border area that it is happening right round the Border area - which have not been hit at all.  The more rural and the more isolated the area, the less likely people are to get a service because it is not economically viable for them to try to make an attempt to connect the person, even though they are getting public funding for that express purpose.  It seems that a pilot scheme that takes a different perspective would offer a solution because what has been tried in the past number of years does not seem to have had the impact that people expected.  In the process of discussions with the Departments in Northern Ireland, whatever about in the South, does Mr. McColgan have a sense that they are taking a different approach?</p></speech>

One slide shows a 75% of value added by the Internet to the traditional sectors.  Has ERNACT done any research work in the north-west gateway in terms of the potential for SMEs to grow job creation and so on from that?  The Western Development Commission had a very interesting report a few years ago in which it estimated that there could be 18,000 to 20,000 jobs created in the north-west region by assisting SMEs in the traditional creative industries to access Internet and broaden their Internet presence.  It is interesting to see that the value added is in the traditional sectors which is where the potential for job creation in the north west would be.  Has Mr. McColgan done any research on SMEs in Donegal and Derry?</p><p>  On the ESB Airtricity announcement yesterday, Letterkenny is one of the towns that will be targeted as part of that initiative.  What are the linkages for people into Project Kelvin and are there cross linkages between all the different providers in the north west?  Are there problems with that and what is evolving?</p><p>  The project in Sweden which was highlighted in the presentation is very interesting.  Some 80% of fibre networks are owned by the public sector, which as Mr. McColgan pointed out is the exact opposite of what we have here.  Obviously, the market has failed in terms of delivering broadband to communities across the country.  We need to reshape public policy in terms of the roll-out of broadband and see it as a public infrastructure that is vitally important for the public good.  Has Mr. McColgan any details on costs?  How much would it cost to roll-out a project like the Swedish project?</p><p>  Finally, in relation to the pilot project, while I think it has some merit, what we should be doing and focusing on is the ESB wrapping fibre and bringing it on a broad scale to every house in the country, which has now been enabled.  The outworking of the ESB-Vodafone partnership is part of that.  We should be focusing on ramping it up and speeding it up and ensuring that it is developed and rolled out across the country.  By 2018 broadband will have been delivered to these 50 towns, which means by the time one gets down to rural Donegal one is looking at 2030 to 2035.  A parallel focus for organisations such as ERNACT is to lobby for the policy change and the policy commitment that would be required to ensure that happens on a broad national scale.  Perhaps it could even look at the North.  Does the ESB own the network in the North and is it something that could be rolled out on an all island basis, which would have more significant and quicker impacts as well?</p></speech>

That is helpful in light of yesterday's announcement by the ESB and the connection with ESB International in the North.  It is something we can explore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.899" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300005#F00700"><p>I join my colleagues in welcoming the delegation from ERNACT.  I thank them for taking the time to make this presentation.  I thank the Chairman, Deputy McHugh, for hosting the delegates.  The role of ERNACT is spelled out in its title, which is the application of technology in the regions.  Will Mr. McColgan comment on his role, and his engagement with the delivery of as opposed to the application of infrastructure?</p><p>  In regard to the &euro;25 million investment in the north-west gateway, will he outline the focus of that investment?  What is the remit of ERNACT and what geographic areas is it covering?  Various programmes have been announced, be it Government investment or otherwise, so could Mr. McColgan outline how this will impact on the ground in places like Donegal?  What does this mean, what is happening and what is likely to happen in the next couple of years?  We have the rural broadband scheme, which has delivered by and large low grade wireless broadband to areas, which can be patchy but is certainly a development on what was there.  That is a long way from achieving real connectivity for rural areas.  In theory, broadband breaks down barriers and breaks down geography and makes it possible to host business or any type of activity in the most remote areas and offers great scope for remote and rural areas in terms of engaging with the wider world and developing economically on a more level playing field.  The reality, however, has been that the advent of broadband has served to cut off rural areas even more so than before because without that broadband infrastructure it highlights the remoteness and disadvantages because the area does not have the broadband to be able to communicate with that infrastructure.</p> <p>Something that should give us the opportunity to become mainstream is actually making us more remote.  I agree with what has been said about the way we have to go.</p><p> The witnesses have said that digging accounts for between 80% and 90% of the cost of laying down broadband infrastructure.  I ask them to comment on the suggestion that we have the capacity to put fibre on the telephone and ESB poles that go into every house in the country.  Yesterday's announcement, which was privately driven, by and large, is further evidence that the infrastructure is there.  I understand that Letterkenny is the only town in County Donegal to be included in these new plans.  What are the possibilities in this regard?  Has there been much engagement between ERNACT and the State?  Can the witnesses comment on their awareness of the potential of the discussions that are taking place in this respect?  It strikes me that the only real way to do this - it is certainly the most straightforward way - is to put the fibre on a pole, alongside the ESB and telephone lines, so that it can be connected into every house.  That is the only way we can make sure this happens.  That would be the lowest-cost model of delivery.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to comment on the role and operation of the metropolitan area networks in towns.  What is the current status of those networks?  A significant investment was made to provide them.  In many cases, the cost of delivering a metropolitan area network service to businesses in towns has proven to be prohibitive.  I would be interested to hear anything they might have to say on that issue.</p><p> I will conclude by asking about the issue of roaming, with particular reference to the delivery of telecommunications infrastructure along the Foyle coast.  Mr. McColgan is familiar with the area in question.  Is ERNACT in a position to play a role in breaking down barriers there?  People living in Border areas are continuing to experience significant cost difficulties.  I refer in particular to people on the Republic of Ireland side of Lough Foyle who have no choice other than to operate off a Northern Ireland mobile telephone and pay the significant fees associated with that.  For these people, the lack of proper availability of reasonably costed options, like those other people are able to avail of, is a real barrier to the use of telecommunications.  Companies are charging more even though, as I understand it, it does not necessarily cost them anything.  There are ways around it if the willingness is there.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the presentation.  I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I welcome the witnesses.  I have known Ms Rena Donaghey for many years.  I met some of the other delegates more recently.  Their project is very interesting.  When I flicked through the briefing we were given, I did not see any mention of the witnesses' interaction with education providers.  The north west is fortunate to be so well served by further and higher education, for example at Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  There is easy access from south Donegal to Institute of Technology, Sligo.  Magee College and other colleges of further education are based in Derry.  As we know, the colleges are playing an increasing and obvious role in regenerating local economies and the national economy.  Are the colleges in places like Letterkenny and Derry centrally involved in the witnesses' proposals for what is needed in the region?  Are they ensuring the potential of the region is maximised to the best extent possible from the point of view of learning, providing services and creating jobs?</p><p>  As Deputy McConalogue said, easy access to adequate broadband is a huge issue in rural areas, particularly for people who are working from home.  Many people, including farmers trying to register their calves with the Department, are frustrated by the lack of adequate broadband.  At a time when many families are under financial pressure, many children stay at home full-time when they are in third level education.  Like Deputy Conlan, I know many people in counties Cavan and Monaghan who are living at home while attending Dundalk Institute of Technology.  If they do not have proper broadband at home, it makes it much more difficult for them to study and to access the documents they need.  I am sorry I missed the witnesses' presentation.  Having made a quick perusal of their document, it seems to me that the central involvement of the education providers is absolutely essential in everything we do to provide better services and develop our economies regionally and nationally.</p></speech>

One might get the impression that broadband services in the north west gateway are highly developed.  Is the high-speed broadband that has been provided in the Letterkenny and Derry area accessible to SMEs and households in all locations?  Does everybody in that area have access?  What is the quality of the mobile phone coverage for businesses, tourists and families?  My experience of going around Ireland is that it is hard to believe how erratic mobile phone coverage is.  Have the witnesses looked at the broadband issues along the other Border counties of Louth, Newry-Mourne, Monaghan, Cavan and Leitrim?<br />Yesterday's extraordinary announcement of a joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone is a magnificent development.  It will mean that regional towns leapfrog over major cities in this respect.  According to the press release, &quot;Ireland will also become the first country in Europe to utilise existing electricity infrastructure ... to deploy fibre directly into homes and businesses&quot;.  It is amazing that we will be the first country to use electricity in this way.  This &euro;450 million investment will have a dramatic effect.  I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on it.  I would like to quote from the report on this initiative in <i>The Irish Times</i>which states:<blockquote>Vodafone chief executive Anne O&rsquo;Leary said the fibre broadband network will allow people working from home to send very large files to their workplace in seconds.  They will also be able to hold video calls to China without disruption.</blockquote>This is a sensational announcement.  I thank the witnesses again.

I am interested in the work they are doing in the north west.  I live in County Monaghan.  It is clear that the same issues apply along the Border in counties Armagh, Monaghan, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Cavan.  The key for me is that every home in the area should have access to fast broadband.  It has been mentioned that many people commute to institutes of further education each day.  If they do not have decent broadband access when they come home in the evening, it is a major problem.  Over the last two years, the Government has tried to provide extra money to ensure broadband is provided in schools in counties Monaghan and Cavan.  That work is ongoing.  I think a similar investment has to be made in each household.  We should be trying to focus on how that can be done at the lowest possible cost.  I was interested to hear what was said about the Swedish example.  It has been pointed out that we have poles all over the country and that it is not as if we have to start developing new infrastructure in that regard.</p><p>  Roaming charges and poor 3G coverage are other issues for people in Monaghan and the other Border counties.  The nature of the landscape in the Border area where I live tends to lead to a situation where coverage is lost when one goes around every turn.  What kind of solutions have been found in the north west to deal with these challenges?  We need to deal with them across the whole Border region.  I am very interested in Project Kelvin, which goes through Monaghan town right beside the education campus.  We invested &euro;50 million in the development of the campus over the last two years.  Clearly, we want to get the maximum benefit from the education campus in terms of further education for people in the region.  We would like to be able to utilise Project Kelvin.  I would like to know whether the witnesses have found solutions that will facilitate that.  When it was first announced with great fanfare, we felt it would be a panacea to all our ills.</p> <p>It seems it does not mesh well with much other infrastructure.  Have solutions been found in the region to overcome those problems?</p></speech>

I will make some general points before coming to the more specific questions.  We are most concerned about rural areas and we are not really concerned about Letterkenny, Derry or Monaghan town.  Those places will be fine in the medium term, although there are challenges.  Everything will be sorted out with them.  We have discovered with our work in Europe that the debate has moved on.  It is no longer a debate about putting a fibre-optic connection between Letterkenny and Derry or between Monaghan town and Armagh.  That is happening, and I appreciate there are some temporary or short-term challenges but the real debate now has used to the end users.  These are people in rural houses, farms and small, cultural businesses in very remote areas.</p><p>  The most advanced regions are moving to putting fibre in people's premises, or otherwise they will be left behind.  An article in yesterday's newspaper indicated that parts of Dublin would get 1,000 Mbps into houses but very remote farms in Finland and Sweden are already getting that type of service.  These regions have raised the bar, and as Deputy McConalogue mentioned, rural areas are becoming even more remote, and if drastic action is not taken, the communities will not survive.  I am not suggesting that could happen here, as we are much more densely populated than Finland and Sweden, but that is a driving concept for those countries.  As there is so much fibre going around the place, the mobile telecom operators are asking to put a 3G or 4G antenna on farm buildings, as there is a local fibre-optic cable.  It is a reversal of the thinking behind the concept.</p><p>  In the United Kingdom they have tried to bring fibre to as many places as possible while covering other areas with wireless coverage.  In other countries, fibre is being installed everywhere and operators are using that by paying farmers to host 3G equipment.  Not only do these farmers have fantastic speed into houses because of fibre but they also have magnificent wireless coverage.  The drumlins in Cavan, the hills of Donegal and the Sperrins have very bad coverage but it is becoming less of an issue.</p><p>  We are very interested in what the ESB is doing as a technical solution, and there is an ESB cable going into every house in the South; there is an electricity cable going into every house in the North as well.  It is a way of tackling the technical issue.  In many of the places we work, it is already being done, and although I have noted remarks that a certain party is the first to do it, that is not necessarily true.  People will use the best technical solution and we would love the ESB to do that.  We are talking about a difference in the approach.  If the ESB approach could be applied to every house in Ireland, it would work.  Nevertheless, it is driven from the centre, and with the experience we have had over the past 20 or 30 years, by the time the work hits Malin Head or parts of Kerry, it will be years down the line.  We are suggesting a change in approach, with local communities being given the chance to see if the Scandinavian model will work here.  It could be done more cheaply and faster, and it would not be subject to the vagaries of central government planning.  We know that is very important, as it is in Sweden, but more power is given to local areas.  We saw a slide earlier detailing what we were able to achieve on a cross-Border basis in the north west.  We were able to increase the cross-Border fibre connections from zero to four between 2000 and 2008 with the support of central government and councils getting together.  Many community groups were also involved.</p><p>  This approach will work and we have spoken to people in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the North.  They seem quite receptive to it.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in the North deals with telecoms issues, and telecoms regulators are very conservative people.  They have become even more conservative over the past ten years and they do not like these kinds of solutions.  They want to get &pound;500,000 of public money and put a project to tender.  Usually, the existing telecoms operators will win such projects.  That is a good solution for many places but this approach must be allied to this other approach.</p><p>  The announcements by the ESB yesterday will not have any impact in rural areas, and they are designed for towns of above 4,000 people.  We understand the process will only apply in Letterkenny in Donegal, which is a town of 10,000 or 12,000 people.  The announcement by Vodafone and the ESB is totally market-driven, which is welcome, although it will only work in the bigger towns and cities.  They have done their calculations.</p></speech>

People are migrating to centres of population because that is where the broadband coverage is and the job opportunities.  In areas such as Sweden and Finland people can live in very remote areas and still work in high tech jobs for Nokia or Microsoft and do exactly what the Senator said earlier about sending large files to their employer or having a conference or a Skype call to somebody in China or Japan.  This is something unseen but it could unlock many of the problems we are facing in Ireland, outside of the major centres of population, to reinvigorate those areas by the application of technology to overcome the peripherality and the problems we have had in the past.</p></speech>

These initiatives announced yesterday are good for the large regional centres.  In my area, towns such as Monaghan and Cavan will get fast broadband in any event, but I am concerned that towns such as Belturbet, Ballybay, Coothill, Castleblayney and Clones will not get high speed broadband if we do not change our approach.  It is important that these towns get fast broadband and are not left behind.  There are initiatives for the villages but the small towns are being left out and, obviously, the individual units, the individual farms and the individual SMEs in the rural areas are in a predicament.  I think Mr. McColgan's approach is correct, we have to change mindsets.   If we continue to say it is okay that 50 regional towns are getting new infrastructure, that leaves behind all the other small towns.  That is the reality of it.</p></speech>

In regard to small towns and villages being able to apply to do this themselves, we have a model of that already, which is the group water scheme sector.  Donegal County Council has been frozen for the past eight years in terms of group schemes because it is dependent on Government grants.  I would advise caution because I could foresee a fancy announcement where a Minister would say a fantastic scheme is being rolled out that will bring broadband to every town in the country, for which the Government will allocate &euro;2 million per annum.  That is the solution for a government.  It is a great PR stunt that looks fantastic but does nothing on the ground in terms of delivering for the communities who need it.  As Mr. Brian Boyle is aware, there are group schemes in Donegal that have been trying to get water into their communities for the past 30 or 40 years but can do it because they have not been able to access funding.  I agree with much of what Mr. McColgan has said and there is value in it in terms of a real solution, given that the ESB is owned by the citizens of Ireland and the technology is available.  It is feasible, it can be done and it is not hugely expensive.  What is the timescale for the rollout of the project in Sweden?  What investment was required of the Government to deliver these community projects?  What is the commitment to rolling it out within a reasonable timescale?</p></speech>

I have been a county councillor for 15 years and I am aware of many of the challenges in Inishowen.  We have a population of more than 40,000.  The peninsula. which is equivalent in size to counties Louth or Leitrim, is very rural.  The lack of broadband is debilitating for primary and secondary schools and students cannot achieve their potential.  While I do not want to rehearse what has already been said, these are the problems I am hearing about on the doorsteps on a daily basis.  We have talked about businesses and SMEs.  It is difficult to keep our graduates at home when we have such a poor broadband system.  Yesterday's announcement, while it was welcome, does not do anything for me or the 43,000 people whom Deputy Charlie McConalogue and I represent.  It is for larger towns, it is regional rather than rural.  Buncrana, the town I represent, has a population of 4,000 but is not one of the 50 towns listed.  I am the mother of two students who cannot use the Internet properly because it is too slow for uploading bigger files.  The examples that Mr. Colm McColgan has given are very real.</p></speech>

The Chairman, Deputy Joe McHugh and Deputy Charlie McConalogue, will be very familiar with a community incentive scheme in which I have been involved in Inishowen, similar to the group water schemes Deputy Thomas Pringle mentioned.  This was a community assist scheme, it is part of the Wild Atlantic Way that was not able to accept coaches or larger buses.  I initiated a scheme last year where I got public money from Donegal County Council and got the community involved with their JCBs, men with shovels and spades, tractor and trailers.  We did a terrific job.  Some members may be aware of it as Eileen Magnier covered it on RTE News.  While I welcome yesterday's announcement, what do I say to the 43,000 people in Inishowen whom I represent as there is nothing in it for them?  It is intended that 100,000 houses will be connected each year under this scheme for the next five years up to 2019.  Do we in Inishowen have to wait until after that time to get broadband for our area?</p><p>  The education and training boards invested very heavily last year and will do so again this year on teaching farmers how to do their business on line.  I am teaching them how to do it but yet when they go home they cannot do it because they do not have the broadband.</p></speech>

Any significant improvement in telecommunications capacity, especially where it involves fibre to the home is welcome.  The limitation of the scheme is that it is intended to be rolled out only to centres of high population of 4,000 to 5,000 plus.  It does however answer a question that has been unresolved in that the way to deliver high speed broadband is through fibre to the home.  There has been some discussion, which is still ongoing, as to whether fixed wireless or even 4G could be the answer.</p> <p>The experience from Europe and elsewhere is that is not the answer.  The answer to delivering high-speed broadband is a fibre-optic network to the home.  Perhaps one of the benefits of yesterday's scheme will be to get that argument over the line in this country.</p><p> Another scheme was announced also, in March or April this year, to bring high-speed broadband - the use of a fibre backbone was mentioned in the initial documentation - to rural areas.  A range of townlands was mentioned for each county, with 40 alone in County Donegal.  However, there was little detail as to how this scheme would be rolled out.  If we have a collective role to play, perhaps the committee could suggest to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that the model being used in the collaborative venture between the ESB and Vodafone in the bigger towns be the model also for the rural areas.  As Deputy Pringle said, there is a huge advantage in using the publicly owned ESB network, which services every house in the land, to deliver fibre connectivity.  However, it would be a shame if that scheme was delayed pending delivery of this other scheme, because we could be looking at a long timescale.</p><p> Mention was made of the Scandinavian model and whether the fibre cables should be underground or overhead.  I saw an example in Slovenia last year in which one of our partner projects used both models.  Networks were built in the ground and fibre was also run on the electricity network, depending on what suited the circumstances.  Perhaps a combination of models would be suitable.  The important factor from our perspective is that the policy decision is made and that we figure out a way to do it quickly.</p></speech>

We need to balance our comments.  There is a very good broadband service available in some towns and villages, but the service is patchy.  I did not have the opportunity to read the announcement made yesterday, but we have had numerous initiatives over the past ten or 12 years in regard to rolling out broadband.  Perhaps it is an issue of co-ordination and perhaps an onus should be placed on telecommunications providers to provide broadband to every house in the country.</p></speech>

I know of some villages and towns in my county that have good broadband, but there is poor coverage just half a mile out the road from them.  Some houses fall between one broadband-enabled exchange and another exchange that is not broadband-enabled.  Small villages near towns often only had small exchanges and these have not been broadband-enabled.  Unfortunately, pockets of the country are being left out.</p><p>  Ms Donaghey made a good point that people can go to classes and get the skills, but are not able to use those skills at home to do the practical work.  This is a serious issue.  We need to pull together to resolve the issues.  Local authorities, statutory agencies and national government all have a role to play on this.  It will not happen if each sector leaves it to the other.  Every month that goes by without a broadband service is a huge loss to households and business.  This issue is of utmost importance.  Like our Chairman, I represent a rural area, Cavan-Monaghan, where we have particular problems on account of the drumlins.  It defies logic in this technologically advanced era that a hill can still stop a message from getting across to another area.  This baffles me at times.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Donaghey and Mr. Boyle for their contributions.  I would like to acknowledge the work they have done through Donegal County Council.  Ms Donaghey is a long-time member of ERNACT and has been very proactive in this area.  I congratulate Ms Kennedy on her recent election to Donegal County Council and commend Mr. Diver on his work in ERNACT.</p><p>  The problem here is getting a grip on what is required.  Technology is moving along and developments are happening in the larger urban centres.  We hear periodic announcements from the Government on what it says it will deliver to rural areas, but not much is happening outside of what is being driven by companies.  Will Mr. McColgan respond to us in regard to the scope of ERNACT and the counties it covers?  Will he explain what the &euro;25 million invested in the north-west corridor went into?  Does ERNACT have a role, or will it have a role, in regard to roaming?  Mention was made in previous contributions of countries that are providing 3G wireless from fixed-line addresses and paying farmers for it.  This sounds like a simple but exciting idea.  In many rural areas, even good mobile reception is still a problem.  Therefore, this idea sounds as though it could be pushed and could be of value.</p><p>  Mr. Boyle mentioned the announcement made a few months ago regarding delivering broadband to rural areas.  What do we know about that, and what exactly is happening?  Will he elaborate on what he is aware is happening in that regard?  In terms of the north west, nobody knows more about how we can deliver broadband and the current position than the witnesses.  If they cannot explain this or are unclear on what is proposed, there is an issue.  The difficulty relates to what is happening at national level and to the substance behind the announcements that have been made.</p><p>  Where do we need to go from here?  What needs to happen to drive this forward and make it happen?  It seems to me that using poles is the way to go rather than burying the fibre cables.  In Sweden, the fibre cables are being buried, but we already have the electricity poles, so this seems the way to go.  What needs to happen in terms of getting the ESB on board?  Could schemes be developed in local areas or could co-ops put together self-sustaining and self-financing projects which could see investment in ESB poles in areas which would pay back over time?  Do we need to develop models such as this?  I like the ERNACT perspective on that landscape and on what needs to happen.</p></speech>

It is worth remembering the good and not-so-good things the ESB has done and is doing.  It is great to have the ESB in terms of the social welfare schemes such as subsidised electricity and heating.</p> <p>There is another issue.  The ESB has tried a pilot scheme for broadband but it has not really worked.  I offer the example of the town of Tuam, County Galway, an area I represent.  The company had to abandon the scheme and we had to start all over again.  Believe it or not, we had to wait for a water and sewerage scheme in Tuam before we could put the broadband cables underground.  We should be careful about that.  It is a little like the curate's egg - good in parts.</p><p> Reference was made to leaving everything to the ESB, but I do not believe we can do that.  I applaud what the ESB has done but I advise caution as well.  We cannot allow the company to do everything and I do not believe the company should be expected to do everything either.  We need more investment and we need to see people working together.</p></speech>

Many people have asked for this and we believe that is the best thing the committee could achieve for us.  The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is considering the matter but it is by no means over the line.  In turn, it must discuss the matter with the more conservative Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  That is the main point.</p><p>  Donegal County Council and Derry City Council established ERNACT.  The idea was not so much to do major things but to transfer good ideas from other parts of Europe.  This is exactly what we are doing with the Scandinavian model.  Approximately ten years ago we were forced to get involved with the Border corridor when we found out there was no broadband network.  We acquired considerable experience, as did both councils.</p><p>  The &euro;25 million referred to was spent on the four fibre-optic lines that run between Letterkenny and Derry and the wireless city model in the centre of Derry.  INTERREG money was deployed to introduce wireless capability in rural parts of Donegal and the Border areas.  It was done by a local company in Derry and it was a good solution.</p><p>  The main point is that the whole broadband game is moving on.  We are moving to the point at which between 30 and 40 Mbps is becoming the norm, up to 1,000 Mbps.  That is the perspective and that is what we are aiming for.  We are trying to prepare the Border areas, especially in the north west, for that type of scenario.  We believe that if local communities in the Border areas were allowed to pilot this approach we could do a job there, because we have the expertise.  Donegal County Council and Derry City Council have a good deal of expertise in this area as well.  There is a view that perhaps the expertise does not exist outside the Departments, but it does.</p></speech>

They are welcome to the meeting.  We are all passionate about the invaluable work that carers do every day, caring for family or friends who need help because of frailty, illness or disability.  It touches an emotion in everyone.  Today we will discuss the supports available for carers across the island and explore the opportunities for greater co-operation in developing policy in this important area of health provision.</p><p> Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentation I advise them they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the meeting is admissible and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, etc.  I do not think these difficulties will arise.</p><p> I invite Ms Doonan to proceed with her opening statement.</p></speech>

I would also like to acknowledge the work of Deputies Joe McHugh and Tony McLoughlin, who have a demonstrated a keen interest in supporting family carers, and I appreciate all the work they have done so far.<br />This cross-Border consortium came together because we recognised that co-operation in this area makes sense as the increasing challenges facing family carers on both parts of the island are similar.  There is no doubt that if we work together, benefits will accrue from pooling expertise, resources and exchanging good practice.  This will achieve a better life for family carers on the island of Ireland.<br />The members of the consortium who are not here today are: Ms Catherine Magowan, Western Trust; Ms Noreen Kettyles, MeUnltd Northern Ireland; Mr. Shane Martin, a psychologist; and Mr. Frank Morrison from the Health Service Executive.  We have received guidance and training from Ms Ruth Taillon of the Centre for Cross Border Studies.<br />A family carer is someone who provides an ongoing significant level of care to a person who is in need of that care in the home due to illness or disability or frailty.  A family carer is not identified by gender, colour, creed or nationality, any more than those facing similar caring situations and feelings, irrespective of where they live.<br />It can be said that there are four kinds of people in the world: those who have been carers; those who will be carers; those who currently are carers; those who need to be cared-for.  It is not something we often consider but it is a fact that, one way or another, &ldquo;caring&rdquo; will come into all of our lives at some stage and, as a society, we need to grasp that reality and plan around it.<br />People in both jurisdictions on this island are living longer and it is inevitable that, as this trend continues, the number of family carers will continue to grow, resulting in increased demand for relevant and timely support mechanisms to be in place to provide support to those who have chosen to care for a loved one.  &quot;Chosen&quot; is not a very good word because few people choose to be carers.  It is usually thrust upon them and is not a job that somebody applies for.  There are 396,864 family carers registered on the island of Ireland giving 12,664,644 hours of unpaid care per week.  In the Republic of Ireland the 2011 census recorded 187,000 family carers, of which 4,228 were under the age of 15 years, which is startling, yet in Northern Ireland the 2010 census returned a figure of 214,000.  There is a clear need to research this glaring difference.  Not only do family carers make a profound difference to the health, well-being and quality of life of those for whom they care, but they also make a huge and unacknowledged contribution to the economy.  Family carers in the Republic of Ireland contribute &euro;77 million per week, providing 900,000 hours of care daily to the ill, frail and people with disabilities.  This is equivalent to one third of the total annual cost of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and is five times what family carers cost the Department of Social Protection in income support.  Full-time family carers contribute on average &euro;72,500 a year.  Can committee members imagine what would happen if, like the air traffic controllers in France recently, all these people decided to down tools and go on strike, or bring all the people they care for to our community health centres and hospitals?  The health service would collapse and thousands would die but we all know this will never happen because no matter what stresses or strains carers have to endure, they will never forsake their jobs.  Carers are the backbone of the provision of care in the home and community.  We all talk about care in the community but what is care in the community?  There is no community.  It is individual families and neighbours taking care of people.  We have to ask where is this elusive community.<br />The significant demographic changes to the Irish population structure, expected to occur over the next few years, will have major implications for publicly provided supports and services and, coupled with the reforms in both the structure and delivery model of our health system, this will have profound implications for family carers.  It is expected that Ireland&rsquo;s ageing population and medical advances in treating disability and chronic illness will result in more people of all ages with longer-term and complex care needs who will, according to Government, be cared for in the community.  We all know that this in reality means cared for at home by family members.  The difference between now and 20 years ago is that people who would be cared for at home would not have a high level of medical intervention or needs.  They might have been frail or have had a mild to moderate disability, but they did not have the complex needs that people can now care for at home.  I am not saying they cannot be cared for at home but they need support.  There is a change and we need to respond to that.<br />We acknowledge there are positive and rewarding aspects to caring but there are also huge challenges and demands.  Research shows that a high percentage of carers experience physical ill health and emotional or psychological problems as a result of long-term caring.  This is a fact no matter where in the world one is working.  I acknowledge the Government's publication in 2012 of the national carers strategy, Recognised, Supported, Empowered, whose vision statement is:<blockquote>Carers will be recognised and respected as key care partners. They will be supported to maintain their own health and well-being and to care with confidence. They will be empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</blockquote>We welcome this strategy and its vision, and believe if the four goals and 42 objectives contained therein were delivered, this would go a long way to bringing family carers to centre stage in the delivery of care in the home.  Unfortunately, nearly two years later, with less than two years of the strategy to go, very few of the actions have been delivered.  In fact it is sad to think how little of it has been delivered.<br />I note that in February the committee met high-ranking civil servants from the Department of Health who outlined areas of co-operation they were engaged with.  As is common when the Department of Health and the HSE speak about health, family carers were never mentioned, yet it is the policy of both Governments to progress care in the community, but they ignore the most important resource to deliver this - family carers.  They are ignored mainly because no Department has a remit for family carers.  The Department of Health has a remit to provide services to people who are ill but not for the people who are caring for them outside the paid employees of the Department and HSE.  The Department of Social Protection views family carers as recipients of benefits and not as contributors to the economy when the opposite is the case.  Family carers are the only people who have to work for their benefits.<br />Family carers do not have a recognised status within health provision and therefore do not receive the supports or services they need.</p> <p>This is particularly evident when one looks at how Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, and other INTERREG funding is dispersed within the health sector.  Provision is focused on patients and the agencies taking care of them, but little thought goes into the needs of voluntary carers.  Some weeks ago, new funding of &euro;50 million was announced under the CAWT initiative.  However, while senior health managers in my area of Donegal and Sligo have been briefed on that funding, no representatives of carers were invited to attend the briefing.  Once again, carers are on the outside.  In fact, carers in the South do not even have a right to an assessment of their needs, even when they are caring for people with high levels of dependency. </p><p> One of the most remarkable and unusual aspects of family caring in Ireland is that despite being a small island, there is a vast difference in how supports are provided depending on which side of the Border one lives.  There is a completely different model for delivering supports in each jurisdiction.  In Northern Ireland, the model is services-based with low supports, whereas in the Republic it is based around medium supports and little service provision.  I do not know which, if either, of these models is best, but it is striking that they are so different.</p><p> I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Caughey, who has travelled all the way from Belfast this morning.</p></speech>

Some 49,412 carers are over the age of 60, with 5,816 of them over the age of 75 and 20,340 caring more than 50 hours per week.  Amazing as it may sound, 319 carers in Northern Ireland are over the age of 90.  When our organisation conducted a snapshot survey recently in the Ballinascreen area of Derry, we found that 71% of carers are caring for more than 20 hours per week.  Research shows that the 20-hours threshold is the acceptable level of caring before one risks damage to one's health.  Other findings were that 50% of carers have been caring for more than five years, 50% described themselves as scared, worried or anxious, 45% help with personal care for a loved one, and 40% care for more than ten hours per day.  These statistics are seen as typical of the situation for carers in rural areas across Northern Ireland.<br />Support funding for carers' services in the North is mainly provided by the five health trusts and varies depending on the trust area.  All areas have a carers co-ordinator.  However, the recent austerity cuts have seen the financial commitment for carers dwindle.  For example, the Southern Health and Care Trust budget for carers was cut from &pound;150,000 to &pound;90,000.  This flies in the face of the recent Compton report, the thrust of which is towards keeping people at home longer.  Carer's allowance in the UK is &pound;61.35 compared with &euro;204.00 per week in the Republic.<br />I will give members testimony from two of the people we have encountered whose circumstances are indicative of the situation for carers in Northern Ireland at this time.  The first is from a woman who is caring for her husband:<blockquote>My name is Louise and I'm 62.  My husband had a stroke about ten years ago and I gave up work to care for him.  We managed at first but we're struggling to cope financially now.  We desperately needed a shower installed and couldn't get help from anywhere so we had to pay for it ourselves on credit.  I work part-time to try to make ends meet.  I feel like we're in a never-ending downward spiral and we're now in serious debt.  I haven't had a break for as long as I can remember.</blockquote>The second testimony is from a woman who is caring for her husband even though she has had a stroke:<blockquote>My name is Alice.  I'm 74 and I recently had a stroke.  I've lost the use of my left arm.  I care for my husband who has various medical problems and can't get about on his own.  Since the stroke it's become more difficult to manage the physical things like getting him washed and dressed.  Luckily for us we haven't lost our sense of humour and he will say to me, &quot;Ach, Alice, all this running about after me is keeping you fit, girl!&quot;  I do all the cooking and shopping.  We have a lady comes in to help with cleaning at the moment &ndash; we call her Mary Poppins (she doesn't know!) - but this service is being taken away.  I can't really understand why.  The house won't clean itself.</blockquote>No later than last Thursday, 26 June, the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Edwin Poots, said that the transformation of our health and social care system requires good partnership working with carers.  He emphasised the need for greater recognition of the vital role carers play in ensuring people are cared for in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Speaking at a conference on the future needs of older carers, he stated: <blockquote>The physical and emotional impact that caring can have on the well-being of individuals should not be underestimated.  With an ageing population, carers will become older and we must ensure that they are properly supported to carry out their role without it negatively affecting their own health and well-being.  Parents of children with learning disabilities worry what about will happen when they are no longer able to care for them.  So it is vital that as carers become older, they are given reassurance and have peace of mind with regard to the future of their dependants.</blockquote>The Minister continued:<blockquote>Caring for the carer and planning for the future are therefore vitally important.  We must develop new models of services for older carers and their families so they have the knowledge, resources and tools to plan for the future.  We must also ensure that they are given practical help, including respite and short break care if needed.  &ldquo;Making a difference to the lives of all in our society remains a firm priority for me.  Transforming Your Care [document on reform of health service provision in the North ]means more health and social care services will be provided in the community, therefore carers will play an increasingly important role in providing valuable services that complement those delivered by paid care services.</blockquote></p></speech>

Reports on reform of the health service on both sides of the Border - Transforming Your Care in the North, and Future Health in the Republic - have many similar strands which will impact on the lives of carers and future carers in terms of the supports available to them.  In fact, the interesting thing about those two documents is that they are very similar in what they outline, but the way services are delivered on both sides of the Border is very different.<br />The Department of Health published Future Health &ndash; A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012&ndash;2015 in November 2012.  According to this document, one of the seven tangible changes patients and clients will experience under the reformed service will be, &quot;More people cared for in their homes: The reforms in social care will help older people and people with disabilities to live in their homes for as long as possible rather than go into residential care&quot;.  Future Health sets out four pillars of reform, including a commitment by the Government to the development of a comprehensive health and well-being policy framework.  The document further clarifies that:<blockquote>Health is more than merely the absence of disease; it is physical, mental, and social well-being...  Prevention policies and programmes can be cost-effective, can reduce health care costs, and can improve the health of the population...  The role of the health service must be seen as keeping people healthy as opposed to just treating sick people.</blockquote>It is presumed that this includes the health and well-being of family carers, who have been proven to be at high risk of illness because of their care burdens.  Looking after carers is an example of cost-effective policy.  Indeed, if we do not look after carers, they will, in turn, become sick people who are the responsibility of the health service.  Future Ireland is very detailed in its methodology of approach as to how the four reform pillars will be implemented, in particular how it will achieve a situation where more people will be cared for at home through its new integrated model of care and its proposals for reforming social and continuing care and primary care.  One of the five key principles identified to underpin the delivery of social and continuing care is &quot;[a] shift towards service provision in the community, which includes natural supports (family, friends, etc.) as far as possible&quot;.  However, the glaring omission in the document is a lack of detail on how the health service will engage with and support family carers, who will be the cornerstone to the successful implementation of the strategy outlined in Future Care.<br />Mr. Caughey will now outline the situation in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I will just echo the point made by Ms Doonan that Transforming Your Care is very similar to the document produced by the Irish Government.  Unfortunately, these similarities include the omission of any indication as to how supports for carers will be resourced and funded.</p></speech>

They have given a detailed presentation and we should all appreciate the outstanding work done throughout the island and abroad by carers.  Ms Doonan and Mr. Caughey made clear that we must support carers in the difficult work they do.  Their work is often unsung and unpaid.  Along with giving proper recognition and support to carers we should acknowledge the age profile of people in Ireland is rising because we are living longer.  It follows that there is a now need to care for people for longer periods.  This should be an important element of any proposals on this topic.</p><p>  There should be a simple all-Ireland policy on this as there are no political difficulties relating to different traditions.  The necessary policies and supports in both jurisdictions should apply equally throughout the island.  This issue should be raised at the North-South Ministerial Council.  In recent years the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association was established, comprising Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, D&aacute;il and Seanad, and it has discussed health issues, drugs, alcohol abuse and other matters that affect the entire island.  There can be no political difficulties on such matters.  I am part of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association with Deputies McHugh and Pringle and perhaps we should try to get this issue on its agenda.  The Association is jointly chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr. William Hay, MLA, and I am sure those of us in the Association could seek to have the issue advanced as an item for discussion.  This would bring the focus to the all-Ireland element of the issue.</p><p>  I compliment Ms Doonan, Mr. Caughey and their colleagues on the detailed presentation they gave and their ongoing work.  It is important that carers working on their own, almost as sole-traders, have advocates because they do not have sufficient time.  I apologise because I must leave now to attend another committee meeting but I will read the report of this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.971" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Murphy" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300013#O00300"><p>I thank the Chair and I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  It is clear that carers are a forgotten aspect of health service provision because they do their work out of a sense of love and duty.  For this reason it is highly unlikely that they will go on strike and this is how they end up exploited by the health systems on either side of the Border.  The point on the Transforming Your Care programme is correct as most people say it is a very good plan, in theory, but no provision has been made to implement it.  The idea was to take people away from acute medical treatment and into the community but this happened at the same time as budget cuts on carers.  In practice the initiative contradicted itself.  This is a tough area and I do not doubt the benefits of an all-Ireland approach, particularly in Border areas where issues such as access to health services, rural transport and so on exacerbate an already difficult situation for carers.</p><p>  I am very interested in the recommendations to the committee.  At the start of the meeting the Chairman said we would focus on health matters and this is one such issue.  Often when there is a focus on health matters carers are ignored so we must ensure this issue is part of our deliberations on all-Ireland health matters.  We must see if pressure on both Departments, North and South, will help them follow through on decent propositions with practical support.</p><p>  I too must apologise because I must attend another engagement but I first wanted to register my support for the witnesses and their presentation.</p></speech>

It is a great opportunity to draw the attention of the British and Irish Governments to a policy that is not based on self-interest, making money or saving money.  This issue is about the core values of society and acknowledging that we amount to more as a group.  Very few areas of Government policy allow us to put such matters on the agenda.  This is about who we are as a people - those doing background work matter.  I feel passionate about this and ask Mr. Murphy to push it forward.</p></speech>

The services in Northern Ireland are much better than they are here, despite the fact that the support system is not at the same level.  As stated earlier, however, I do not know which model is better.  The best model might be a combination of both.  For example, in Northern Ireland there are carer co-ordinators.  Ms McEniff was a carer co-ordinator with the HSE before she took up another position within the organisation.  Her previous post was not filled.  I accept that we are living in straitened economic times but the position of carer co-ordinator was not considered important enough to fill.  There is no carer co-ordinator in place in the Republic at present.  That tells its own story.  Ms Van Aswegen would have her own insight.  This matter is not about spending money, it is about how it is spent in a way that results in the best value being obtained.</p><p>  If one considers it from an economic perspective, then matters would dictate that the State would seek to begin supporting family carers.  The more they are supported, the more people could be removed from residential care, acute hospitals, etc.  It is a no-brainer.</p></speech>

It is not because members do not want to help carers.  I know from talking to them that they want to help because they have all had experience of this matter at some stage.  The reason support is not provided is due to the position carers occupy within governmental structures.  They do not, for example, fall within the remit of either the Department of Health or the Department of Social Protection.  That is where the real problem lies.  The Ministers for Health and Social Protection do not have responsibility for them and neither does any other Minister.  They fall between stools.</p><p>  Mr. Caughey and I have discussed this matter and we are of the view that if there were a Minister of State with responsibility for carers or a senior official with a dedication to family carers, we would not be discussing this matter.</p></speech>

However, let us consider the matter from a different perspective.  If the Department for Health had responsibility and if the supports were coming from the Department of Protection - like all supports, these would be viewed as a drain on the economy - how would that sit with people?  I am not even going to discuss paying family carers because that is not the route to go.  I am stating that there needs to be national recognition for what they are doing.  As Ms Mulligan stated, we need, as a society, to step up to the mark.  In fairness, there was never an issue ten or 20 years ago because a grandmother or someone with a mild disability would have been cared for at home.  At that time one did not need the services one requires now.  People used to be transported to hospital on special beds and stretchers in ambulances, now they are being sent home from hospital with all sorts of paraphernalia in tow.  As acting director of nursing in Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton, Ms McEniff is very aware of that and she is very involved in this area.  The position has shifted and we need to catch up.

Ms Doonan already answered one of the questions I intended to pose in the context of what our guests are seeking and their interaction with CAWT in recent times.  I am of the view that the committee should take up the cudgels in the context of having carers included under CAWT because that would also provide some momentum regarding how cross-Border issues might be dealt with.  Like the Chairman, I am a member of the North-South Interparliamentary Association and we will definitely raise the matter with that body in order to increase its profile.</p><p>  I am of the view that carers fall between stools because there is a view that it is nice to keep it that way because their value to society does not need to be recognised and there is no need to take action in respect of them.  The national accounts for the past year were published earlier today and, for the first time, an economic value has been ascribed to prostitution and drug dealing.  Would there be any point in trying to estimate the value of carers in the context of the national accounts in order to raise the profile of carers and the work they do?  One of the things our guests are seeking from the committee is for it to facilitate access to INTERREG funding for family carers.  What do they mean by that?  Are they seeking it for research or is it for actual supports, etc.?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.998" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosaleen Doonan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300014#P00900"><p>Research is extremely important.  Until very good bodies of research are compiled, it is not possible to establish benchmarks in the context of from where we should work.  That is very important.  The way I see it is that there is a circle and inside that is everything to do with the health service.  Outside the circle are the carers.  However, they are central to the success of everything in the health service going forward.  Anything that gets us into the circle as equal partners and which brings about a recognition that we are going to be obliged to deliver on all the new policies the Government is introducing would be welcome.  One cannot do anything without funding, be it from CAWT or INTERREG.  I recognise that we are all trying to do the best we can with what we have but there are external bodies which are providing a great deal of funding for various different things in the area of health.  However, carers are not part of that.</p><p>  I am not sufficiently qualified to understand how these very large European Union funding mechanisms work.  However, I do know INTERREG and CAWT are the mechanisms by means of which funds are disbursed to communities.  I am hung up on the word "community".  We should say it as it is, namely, that those involved are family carers and that we are sending people home to be looked after.  I am not a medical person - I would make a very bad nurse and probably an even worse carer - but I am aware of the extent of the work - such as changing catheters and so on - those involved in care at home must do.  Earlier this week I spoke to a woman whose little boy was born with a stem cell tumour.  He screams all the time and she is expected to look after him 24-7 outside school hours and without any extra help.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1000" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosaleen Doonan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300014#P01100"><p>Absolutely.  If I had discussed this matter ten or 15 years ago, people would have said it was off the wall.  There would not have been a need for such recognition because people who required 24-7 medical care would not have been at home.  Times have changed, however.  I have visited houses filled with hoists, wheelchairs and all sorts of medical paraphernalia and seen people traipsing in and out all day expecting cups of tea to be made for them.  Homes must be made centres of care if we are serious about dealing with this matter.  There is another option, namely, to reconsider the health strategies which obtain on both sides of the Border.  However, I do not believe that will happen.</p> <p>We will look at the two health strategies, but I do not think that is going to happen on both sides of the Border.</p><p> Before we write up such health strategies on the way forward we must consider what we intend to do and what that will mean for people.  I am not necessarily asking for it to happen.  There is a willingness among Irish people to look after their loved ones at home.  Their loved ones want to be at home.  Furthermore, I think it is the place for them.  The doors are open.  It is just a matter of having the supports to be able to do that without killing oneself.  The statistics on ill health among carers are frightening.  When one cares for someone in a full-on manner with very little support over a period of five to 20 years, one's health will be hugely compromised.  We have done simple things that have made such a difference.  We had a programme that thankfully was supported by the HSE in the west.  People go to De Exeter House in Kilmacrenan in Donegal for breaks and that makes such a difference.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1003" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosaleen Doonan" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300015#Q00300"><p>People can avail of three days of respite.  I cannot describe what it means to the committee.  We have sent more than 100 people.  I have a stack of cards from them.  It made a difference to them and it makes a difference to the economy.  If one wants to be black and white about it, one must look at that.  We sent people there who were at burnout stage.  Following respite, they are no longer burned out, they no longer need a residential place and they are prepared to continue with care at home, thus saving the State huge amounts of money.  The financial and economic rationale for looking after carers is a no-brainer.  It is the way to go.  I am involved at the front line, all day, every day.</p><p>  One Friday morning when I was in the office I got a telephone call from a man who was distressed.  I did not know what was wrong.  I usually ask people for their name first but he would not give me his name.  The reason he was telephoning me was to tell me that he could no longer care for his mother.  He was providing full-on personal care for her but he was giving it up.  For a moment I did not know what he was telling me but he wanted us to be able to support his mother when he was gone.  I was on the telephone to him for an hour.  I will never forget the call.  He was really telling me he had decided to end his life.  He was going to commit suicide.  He had it planned.  He was going to Galway.  I was on the other end of the telephone.  I did not know who he was or where he was from.  I tried to elicit the information from him.  To make a long story short, I had to figure out where he was.  I got on to the public health nurses.  I had other people on the telephone checking to see whether he was a client of theirs.  One person recognised who it could be and got to him while I was still on the telephone to him.  We got him into De Exeter House.  He was there for one month.  He came out of there and he was perfect.  We got supports in to help him.  He is still caring for his mother.  That is  the reality.  That is what it is like out there.  That should never have happened.  It need not have happened.</p><p>  The man was 53 years of age and his mother was 84 or 85.  If that man got the supports he needed the situation would not have arisen.  Perhaps he did not ask for them.  Sometimes people do not ask for them.  One needs to know who those people are.  If the man in that case had got the supports in time I would not have had that telephone call.  They are the things one does not forget.  It is very easy to be isolated from such circumstances when one is not in the business.  What did I know about the situation before I got involved with the Carers Association?  I was lucky.  Those considerations did not come into my sphere of life but now I am acutely aware of them and I know for sure that they will affect me some day.  I definitely know that I am either going to be cared for or I will be caring for someone.</p></speech>

I guarantee her that.  I do not know what will happen in the future.  I am conscious that Ms Van Aswegen has been waiting to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1005" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennifer Van Aswegen" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014070300015#Q00500"><p>That is okay.  I thank Ms Rosaleen Doonan who has probably covered the area I had intended to address.  The first point is on the economic rationale.  If one looks at page 9 of the report, it reflects the tip of the iceberg of the economic rationale based on investing in carers now in order to prevent them becoming a burden on the health system through burnout and increasing the care burden.  That makes absolute economic sense.  Deputy Murphy referred to it in terms of counting beans.  Such investment makes total financial and economic sense in order to prevent a landslide at the other end and in terms of the burden on the health service.  Ms Doonan covered the topic very well with real examples of what happens on the ground much better than we could outline in a scientific way.  The real life experiences she outlined gave life to the words on page 9.</p><p>  Ms Doonan also mentioned research.  On pages 8 and 9 of our proposal we examine the proposal put forward by the consortium on cross-Border collaboration.  Research plays a key role.  We are mindful that much research exists but there is a gap in the research.  That is probably an area in which Ms McEniff has some expertise.  A core element of the model proposal is around research to inform best practice and policy.  We spoke about the disparities between the models in the North and the South.  We do not have the answer on which is the most appropriate or best model but through research we hope to identify the needs of carers; whether financial support works best or practical hands-on support that might be more prevalent in Northern Ireland.  We are very mindful of the importance of research as an element of any cross-Border collaboration and it is something we will prioritise as part of our project proposal.</p></speech>

The witnesses might be ahead of themselves.  Ms Van Aswegen might have her homework done.  The new round of INTERREG V has not been finalised yet but four themes emerge.  What I say must be taken with a pinch of salt, as matters will not be finalised until September but the four themes that emerge first, health; second, research and innovation, including research, health and lifestyle; third, sustainable transport and; fourth, the environment.  Assuming that this will be the final make-up of the four areas, Ms Van Aswegen might be on the right track.  I hope that is helpful.  The witnesses will watch the space closely in the coming months.  Are there other observations or questions?  We are coming near the conclusion of the meeting.</p></speech>

I spoke to you on a number of occasions about the issue.  Ms Doonan is familiar with my area of Sligo and the north west.  The issue is vitally important.  It was educational to listen to the presentation.  The witnesses are in good hands under the stewardship of the Chairman, Deputy McHugh.  This is the right forum to attend this morning in terms of INTERREG funding.</p><p>  You will appreciate, Chairman, the enthusiasm generated by Ms Doonan.  I have been on the receiving end of it in the north west in recent years.  I see the work at first hand that is being done with the funds that have been allocated by the carers.  Their work and dedication to their loved ones over the years is evident.  At times, carers are taken for granted.  It is vitally important that support can be provided.  I compliment you, Chairman, and the committee for organising this morning&rsquo;s meeting to bring both groupings together.  The meeting is worthwhile and educational for me and others.</p> <p>This is a step in the right direction.</p></speech>

I sincerely apologise for having to leave earlier.  I had to deal with an unavoidable situation but I will not bore them with the details.

We have made a number of commitments in terms of follow up.  I am conscious that it is not just a health issue but we will give the presentation to the Minister for Health south of the Border and for the information of the Northern Minister, Edwin Poots.  The mechanism that might be important is the North South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and we will use that opportunity.  Senator White will travel to Armagh next Thursday, and the witnesses can take it as read that she will ensure that this item is on the agenda for the joint secretariat.</p><p>  Regarding the wide-ranging issues on health that are part of this committee, we are planning that at the moment and the witnesses can take it as read that their North-South carers issues will be incorporated into that.</p><p>  To recap on INTERREG V, if they are the four emerging thematic areas it will be important to keep a close eye on them.  We said also that we would follow up on writing directly to the Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT.</p><p>  I thank all the witnesses.  I thank also the people who may have wanted to make a contribution for their patience but Ms Doonan's passion and commitment to the cause was visible to all of us.  We appreciate her, and her colleagues both North and South, being here today.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Geraldine Fitzpatrick, vice-chairperson of the National Infertility Support and Information Group, NISIG, who will make a presentation to us shortly.  The group was established in 1996 by a number of dedicated people who needed or wanted to be in contact with others who understood the difficulties involved in conception and fertility.  I welcome Ms Fitzpatrick and thank her for being here this morning.</p> <p> Before we begin, I remind members and witnesses about privilege.  Witnesses are protected by privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I apologise to members for the croakiness of my voice but I have a chest infection.

We sent the committee a submission, which I will go over very briefly.  The National Infertility Support and Information Group, NISIG, was established in 1996 by three people, including myself.  In 2005, the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was published and we had a representation on that commission.  We were established in 1996 and, nine years later in 2005, we took part in the commission and, nine years later in 2014, we are here, so we are probably making a little bit of progress, which has to be welcomed.<br />Unfortunately, the whole area of infertility is still very unregulated.  The unmet needs we have are as follows.  We need equal access for everybody, regardless of income, and we need independent governance and regulation of assisted human reproduction services in Ireland.  As a consequence of that, we would get robust, independent and Irish-specific data which people should be able to access when they want treatment.  Currently, they cannot do so and must go to the websites of all service providers to find out what services they provide and where.  We believe that if these unmet needs are met, the patient, the clinician and Exchequer funds will be protected.<br />The population of Ireland is 4.5 million and one in six people are affected, but not everybody will seek infertility treatment.  The pie chart in the submission shows that approximately 7,800 different types of treatment are carried out in Ireland annually, including IVF, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination.  We have included the websites of the different IVF clinics because people use social media and do their research on the Internet.<br />We also refer to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, HFEA, in the submission.  We usually refer to UK governance when talking about infertility.  The HFEA issues its report annually and was established in 1991.  In recent years, it set up a new maximum multiple birth rate of 10% and it believes it has achieved that.  We do not have any independent data which tell us what the Irish multiple birth rate is from IVF, but an audit on high-order multiple pregnancies in three Dublin hospitals was published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i>in January of this year.  Between 1999 and 2008, 101 high-order multiple pregnancies were recorded.  We also included the ESRI statistics in the submission because singleton births have reduced the stay in hospital by 16% from 2003 to 2012 whereas multiple births continue to have a high stay in hospital.  We believe that some of those multiple births are probably caused by infertility treatment and if Ireland decides to have a target of reducing multiple births, it will reduce the cost to the Exchequer.<br />The report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was published in 2005 and the recommendations are exactly what we are looking for, which is a regulatory body, national statistics, the availability of counselling and the availability guidelines for general practitioners and gynaecologists.  We believe our needs are in line with the commission's recommendations.<br />The White Paper on universal health insurance states that health care will be available based on need and not on ability to pay.  Therefore, we hope assisted human reproduction technology will be included in that in order that people can get access to it.  The problem with infertility treatment in Ireland is that it is quite an expensive treatment so, therefore, it is only available to those who can afford to pay.  Some people travel abroad to have it in countries where it is less expensive but that causes problems because the patient is vulnerable as a result of having to travel abroad.  Nobody really knows who is responsible for the patient's treatment.<br />The White Paper on universal health insurance states that the universal health insurance landscape will include a number of regulators, including the Health Information and Quality Authority, which will deliver good governance and good quality.  We believe our needs fit into the UHI model which the Government proposes.  What NISIG wants is the recognition of infertility as a health need.  It needs to be addressed under the UHI model and good governance will actually save the Exchequer money in the long term as a result of fewer adverse events and fewer multiple births.  There is a benefit for everybody.</p></speech>

I have a small number of questions.  I was a little taken aback by the World Health Organization's definition of infertility as a disease.  It jumped out at me.  I had a number of such experiences in terms of coeliac, which is also described as a disease, and many other things which I would see as conditions or whatever.  The word "disease" has a particular connotation or impact, certainly among lay people like myself.  I wonder what Ms Fitzpatrick's view is of the World Health Organization's definition, which struck me as strange but maybe it is not.  People having to deal with infertility would not necessarily appreciate it.  I wonder about that.</p><p>  In regard to the number of people in the population affected by infertility, Ms Fitzpatrick indicated that more than 300,000 Irish people are affected by infertility.  I am making an assumption here that they are made up of both males and females.  Perhaps Ms Fitzpatrick could elaborate as to the number.  Is it known?  Do we have figures on the number of females and males?  Does Ms Fitzpatrick believe the number is a true reflection of the real level of infertility across our population?</p><p>  The specific actions she would commend or expect, primarily from Government, include a regulatory body to be established by an Act of the Oireachtas to regulate AHR services in Ireland.  I presume this has been a lobby going back some considerable time.  I wonder would Ms Fitzpatrick elaborate on what engagement she has had.  Was it specifically with the Department of Health?  Are there other Departments which could, or should, have a direct input?  What progress, if any, has there been in terms of any stated commitment or intent?</p><p>  I am not aware of any promised legislation on the programme of legislation.  I do not have it with me to check but I cannot recall that there is even the promise of legislation in terms of the programme, as published, but I wonder whether Ms Fitzpatrick has something more definite at this point in time.</p> <p>My party would fully support the introduction of such legislation, which, as Ms Fitzpatrick outlined, is her number one recommendation.  That is not in any way to relegate any of her other recommendations, but legislation is one of the areas in which we can best assist.  I undertake to continue to pursue this matter.</p></speech>

We try to ensure infertility is not a side effect of the treatments we administer, but that is not always possible.  The consequences of infertility are devastating for individuals and families and it is an issue we need to address.<br />I will begin by offering Ms Fitzpatrick some advice, if I may.  Seeking as a priority the provision of new regulations and the establishment of new regulatory bodies is a reasonable approach.  In that context, however, I will put forward something of a guerilla view on how our health system works.  When people come in here and ask for increased bureaucracy or more inspectors, they are likely to receive a warm response from Government.  If, on the other hand, they argue that what they actually need is more services and staff and better access and resourcing, they are pushing a much stiffer door.  The truth is that the <i>Titanic</i>needed more lifeboats, not more lifeboat inspectors.  This brings to mind the Health Information and Quality Authority, to give an example, whose public relations department has mushroomed at a time when we cannot deliver basic services.<br />How many designated fertility specialists are there in the public sector at this time and how many designated fertility clinics?  When public patients approach their GP seeking a referral for a fertility issue, how long do they have to wait to be seen?  What method of triage is used to decide whether they can access publicly a fertility service and how long will they wait to access that service?  These are key questions and I suspect the answers to all of them will be quite sad.  Nevertheless, I would be grateful to have that information.<br />Does Ms Fitzpatrick have any sense of where we fit on an international league table in terms of numbers of fertility specialists compared with other western European countries?  As a rule of thumb, for most specialties across medicine in Ireland we have approximately one fifth of the European average.  I suspect the figure for fertility services will be no better than that.<br />I urge Ms Fitzpatrick to keep up the good work.  This is a very important fight.  As I said, I have some sense of the unbelievable pain this problem can cause.  It is an issue to which we must give a higher degree of priority.</p></speech>

Coming from a volunteering background myself, it is great to see that type of commitment.  We might not even be having this discussion if not for their efforts, which speaks to Senator Crown's questions about the numbers employed and the types of services available.</p><p>  Given that the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction issued its report in 2005, the issue does arise as to whether its recommendations are still valid.  I am not involved in the sector, but it seems reasonable to question whether proposals that were made nine years ago should be re-examined before being implemented.</p><p>  In advance of this meeting, the issue was raised with me of the situation of thousands of people who are in a legal limbo in respect of the status of embryos produced by the IVF process.  Will Ms Fitzpatrick comment on that and perhaps offer the committee some direction on the matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1036" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014070300005#D00600"><p>I welcome Ms Fitzpatrick and thank her for her presentation.  This is an issue in which I am very interested and about which I have spoken at this committee and locally.  I have personal experience of family and friends who were devastated because they were unable to have children.  It is important and timely that the issue is now being debated by the committee.  One of the most pressing issues in this area is the importance of ensuring there is equality right across the board.  There are people who wish to have a family but simply do not have the financial resources to even begin pursuing fertility treatment.  Others who are availing of treatment have taken on an enormous financial burden.  Some of them are also dealing with negative equity and are struggling to balance their efforts to have a family with keeping up with their mortgage payments and other bills.</p><p>  Senator Crown asked about the services available under the public health system.  I discovered through my research into this issue that in the United Kingdom, assisted human reproduction services are available on the NHS.  The system is administered in each borough by clinical commissioning groups which adjudicate on the eligibility of applicants, most of whom are aged between 23 and 39.  In some cases, it is impossible to sanction initial or additional treatment, for a variety of reasons, but in many cases such sanction is given.  The UK model is the one we should follow.  It is not about money being thrown at people; the system is well researched and well managed and there is a comprehensive engagement with applicants.  Part of this involves examining each individual's health history to ensure he or she is up to going through a process that is very difficult, especially for women.  The physical demands alone include the injection of hormones and so on.</p><p>  I agree with Ms Fitzpatrick's proposal that fertility treatment should be included in the standard package or basket - we always seem to be talking about baskets in this context - under any universal health insurance system.  For most people, having a family is a great gift and the birth of their children a very happy time in their lives.  Unfortunately, for many couples who want to go down that road, things just do not work out without intervention.  I have personal experience of family members who succeeded in having children following fertility treatment and others who, after six or seven IVF attempts, remain childless.  This can have a devastating impact not only on the individuals themselves and possibly their relationship, but also on their parents and extended families.  In many cases, particularly where both partners have to work full-time to repay huge mortgages, couples are delaying children until the woman is well into her 30s, which may cause problems.</p><p>  As I said, I would support any initiative to ensure universal health insurance covers people who are facing this crisis.  It is a crying shame we have waited so long before moving to assist the thousands of people in this country who are facing or already going through this process and are obliged to take on a huge financial burden in order to fulfil the wish shared by most couples to have a family of their own.  Anything I can do to assist as a member of this committee, I will be only too glad to do it.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have already been asked by colleagues.  Ms Fitzpatrick indicated that one in six people in this State is affected by infertility.  How does that figure compare internationally and is the number increasing or decreasing over time?  Ms Fitzpatrick outlined an array of options that are available in this State.  Are there any options that are not available?  Are certain treatments available to private but not public patients?</p> <p>What are the long-term effects of multiple births on the babies?  How can their needs be catered for?  </p><p> In regard to the introduction of legislation, do other countries have such legislation?  Has the Minister for Health indicated that he intends to introduce legislation?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the WHO has defined infertility as a "disease".  It gives recognition to the condition.  That is good because it is treated completely differently from simply an "I want to have a family" type situation.  The WHO definition gives it clarity.  That is the positive thing about the WHO defining infertility as a "disease".  I guess each country deals with it in different ways in terms of whether it is chronic, acute or otherwise.  The Deputy asked about the population and one in six being affected.  It is 30% a female factor, 30% a male factor and 30% an unknown factor.  It can be any type of condition.  The average age of people seeking treatment is 37 years.  People are delaying their conception years until later, so it is more difficult anyway.  That is another factor in the equation.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about other Departments.  NISIG is the port of call for everything, whether IVF, ICSI, adoption or surrogacy.  We are only volunteers and only a support group.  It is much more than what we can actually do.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality is dealing with surrogacy and we hope it will deliver satisfactory outcomes for people.  The problem with all the people with whom NISIG deals is their vulnerability.</p><p>  It is really interesting that NISIG has been established since 1996 at a time when there was one clinic or two clinics in this country and there was very little social media.  One could argue we have information overload now but actually the patients or the people using the services are just as confused and just as vulnerable.  The situation is no better than it was in 1996.  We have access to information but we do not have proper structures in place to support these people.  We look to the Department of Justice and Equality for developments on the surrogacy issue.  Since I sought this meeting, I have been in contact with the Department of Health and I hope to pursue further meetings with it, but I am not quite sure about that.  It is only the start, so there is nothing further on that yet.  </p><p>  Senator Crown asked how long people waited in the public system.  Essentially, infertility treatment is done privately.  There is one clinic or two clinics which will do a few GMS people in the year but, realistically, it is not accessible to people.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

If somebody who is not privately insured and who does not have private means goes to a GP stating they have been trying to conceive for a year and a half and they believe they need help with fertility, what will happen to them?  I presume they are referred to a public gynaecology clinic.</p></speech>

There is intrauterine insemination.  It depends on the local area.  I cannot speak about the situation nationally but I know locally in Cork, they do one or two cycles.

It is a problem because treatment is much cheaper there.  One could argue it is an opportunity for these people and one cannot blame people for doing these things.  In the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i>in January, one of the Dublin clinics talked about single embryo transfer.  Deputy Byrne talked about the UK, which funds a certain amount of treatment.  Maybe the Government needs to think about funding possibly one or two treatments.  If certain criteria are met, it could fund the first one or two cycles.  As Senator Crown said, one is then offering a service for people who cannot afford it so they can have it done in Ireland.  There is less risk for the patient, less medication involved and less travel.  The chances are they will have a singleton birth as opposed to a multiple birth which is less expensive on the Exchequer.<br />We need to consider how we can meet the needs of people who can afford it.  Why should a person who can afford to pay &euro;20,000 not be treated in the same way as somebody who cannot afford it?  The UHI model states that it should be accessible to all.  Currently, everybody pays and it is quite normal to pay &euro;20,000 plus between clinics, treatments and so on.</p></speech>

One could arrive back in this country with medication dispensed or prescribed in another jurisdiction which we do not have here.  There are all those problems associated with it.  We need to regulate the situation in Ireland.  We should make this available to people, so they would not have to put themselves in that vulnerable position.  Even if we could reduce the number of multiple birth rates in Ireland, the savings there would pay for a minimum of one or two treatments initially for people.  Something needs to be done to overcome that type of vulnerability.  The service is essentially private.  That is the point.</p><p>  In regard to the 2005 report, the chairperson of NISIG was on that commission.  I attended a few of the meetings.  There is still the same problem.  There is no regulation and we have no basic data to which we can refer.  People should have that facility.  If I remember correctly, that report took many years.  There is no point doing another report if it sits on the shelf.  We can take the basics from this.</p></speech>

The support group is finding that people really do not want to be in that position anymore.  They want the minimum treatment.  If somebody has three children and suddenly they have six embryos being stored, it is a dilemma for them.  Patients are obviously more informed now and they do not want that much medication used.</p> <p>Some of the clinicians will point out that a patient who has paid almost &euro;15,000 for three failed IVF treatments will want three embryos used in any subsequent treatment.  In such circumstances, it is very difficult for a clinician to refuse the patient's wish and offer only two embryos on the basis that she is 37 years old.  If the Government were to issue guidelines on these matters, nobody would be able to argue with a clinician's decision and the patient and clinician would be protected.  We are not seeking detailed legislation, which appears to take forever to introduce, but short-term steps to regulate the area and solve immediate problems.  We could then examine the models in place elsewhere in Europe to identify what works and does not work.  My point is that we have not moved since 2005. <br />On the model in place in the United Kingdom, as with everything else, no health system is perfect.  However, under the British system, treatment is funded to a certain level and patients can then pay more for additional services.  This is probably a good model and while I am not an expert on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, HFEA, in the United Kingdom, I am sure the Department could examine what elements of the British system are suitable and could be applied here.  As was noted, everyone has problems with money and trying to sort out a career.  The United Kingdom system is a good model to adopt.  It would be good if fertility treatment was in the universal health insurance basket.  <br />In 2005, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction reported that Ireland did not have the basic elements in place, including guidelines for general practitioners and gynaecologists.  For this reason, we must start at a basic level and put in place a structure that will support people who seek infertility treatment.  <br />The figures on infertility are roughly the same here as the figures internationally.  I was also asked what options are available here.  I return to the issue of the vulnerability of the patient.  Clinics A, B and C may each offer a menu of options.  The HFEA guide in the United Kingdom provides information on what each clinic offers and applies strict rules in this regard.  Transparent data are lacking here as we do not, for example, have a single website that sets out the services provided by the various clinics.  Such information would be welcome.  <br />I was also asked about multiple births and the long term picture for babies.  While a study of children aged 0 to 5 years has been completed in Cork, its findings have not yet been published.  Data are, therefore, available and the maternity hospitals are doing internal research but little of it has been published.  <br />The issue of legislation was raised by several speakers.  The priority is to issue guidelines and take simple steps. <br />Senator Crown referred to the public relations department of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority was established as a stand-alone agency but now collaborates with the Care Quality Commission to reduce costs.  The reason we propose a role for the Health Information and Quality Authority is that HIQA has a structure in place and we do not want another stand-alone body established as that would create additional costs.  We would like one agency to deal with all of these issues.<br />People contact the National Infertility Support and Information Group to discuss good news and bad news, for example, adverse events, and we are not in a position to deal with these types of issues.  One can read horrific stories on websites such as <i>rollercoaster.ie</i>.  As members will be aware, when a clinic closed earlier this year, people read about it on a website.  The clinic's property, including embryos and tissue, was transferred to another clinic without any consultation with patients.  We need a structure in place that protects everybody when adverse events occur.</p></speech>

That is a given.  We could take what is appropriate from the HFEA in the United Kingdom and use the quality department of the Health Information and Quality Authority to set up structures.  Roughly 60% of clinics in the UK are inspected every year and the HFEA publishes on its website tables featuring all the key data on the various clinics.  We seek something simple that would protect patients and clinicians.</p></speech>

She refers to regulatory issues.  I understand all infertility clinics are registered with the Irish Medicines Board, which applies strict criteria when carrying out inspections of clinics.  Is that not the case?  I also understand that inspections take two or three days and involve going through every item, including all protocols and policy documents, and checking all information.  It is important to send out the message that high standards apply to all clinics operating here and that they are all supervised by the Irish Medicines Board.</p><p>  In the case of the closure to which Ms Fitzpatrick referred, I understand the clinic in question closed due to the ill health of the person who was running it.  This has been explained, although I accept Ms Fitzpatrick's point about the work it was doing being transferred to another clinic without consent.  The issue had to be dealt with in an expeditious manner, however, to ensure no one was left in limbo.  </p><p>  Does Ms Fitzpatrick envisage an expanded role for the Irish Medicines Board, rather than having another regulatory authority become involved, especially as the IMB already does much work in this area?</p></speech>

While I fully agree with Senator Colm Burke that clinics operate to the highest standards, I do not know if the Irish Medicines Board has a quality department.  The Health Information and Quality Authority has a model of quality and standards and is familiar with using key performance indicators and so forth.  I accept that it is preferable to have one rather than two bodies with responsibility for this area.  If the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in Britain can work with the Care Quality Commission, why can HIQA not work with the Irish Medicines Board?  I do not know the answer to that question.</p><p>  There is no question about the quality of services and the standards operating in the clinics.  However, we lack independent data and we would like the data from clinic A, B, C and D to be presented in one place in exactly the same fashion.  While one clinic may provide statistics to show it has a success rate of 50%, the clinic in question may deal only with women aged under 35 years.  One must take a reasonable approach in which all the data are presented in an identical manner in order that people can compare like with like.  We need information on results and adverse advents.  Perhaps the Irish Medicines Board has the ability to do this and it may have a quality department.  We are so used to hearing the Health Information and Quality Authority mentioned in the context of quality that the name "HIQA" comes to mind when we think of quality.  This area needs to be embraced by a single body.</p> <p>All these doctors are well used to dealing with either HIQA or the Irish Medicines Board, so I do not see any of them having a problem with either as long as the expertise is at hand.  There is no point in duplicating work if there are experts in one place but none in another.  I absolutely take the point but we lack independent data and it is exactly the same for every clinic across the board.  That is what is needed in this country.</p></speech>

Cystic Fibrosis Ireland funds its patients for treatment.  Infertility people are not treated equally, and there should be a structure in place so that everybody, whether in Donegal or Waterford, would have the same access and services available.  It is unfortunate as we are very vulnerable and spending a lot of money.  The Government is stuck for money but something needs to be done, as what is said in one way is received in another.  The data from the three units in Dublin are useful.  For example, with the audit between 1999 and 2008 of 101 births, five were a normal delivery, 70% were elective Caesarean section and 25% were an emergency section.  Even when considering the costs involved, we need to keep it simple and put something in place.  The benefit will be repaid twofold.</p></speech>

I apologise for the delay in starting this session, but as I said earlier this is the second part of the meeting, and we did not know how to gauge the time allocation.  We have received apologies from Deputies Regina Doherty, Peter Fitzpatrick and Billy Kelleher.  Senator Imelda Henry is being replaced by Senator Martin Conway.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobiles telephones should be switched off for the duration of this meeting because they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings even when in silent mode.<br />This session of the committee meeting has been convened at the request of Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor to discuss the costs and other issues around blindness in Ireland.  I welcome members of the National Vision Coalition, an alliance of health care professionals, those working with the sight loss community and service users who are doing outstanding work.  I congratulate them on the recently published study Economic Cost and Burden of Eye Diseases and Preventable Blindness in Ireland.  Members will have an opportunity to discuss the work of the National Vision Coalition and to consider the cost to the State of vision impairment and the saving that could be made from early intervention.  Senator Conway has been a very good advocate for the sight loss community and has been a tremendous role model in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br />I welcome those in the Visitors Gallery.  They are Ms Siobhan Kelly, CEO and Ms Ciara Keenan, communications managers of the Irish College of Ophthalmologists; Mr. Padraig Mallon, CEO of the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and a good friend of mine in<b></b>Cork; and Mr. Gerry Kerr, Service User Representative, who is here with his dog, Orva.  I thank them for being present.  I welcome our witnesses, Ms Maria Meehan, Mr. David Keegan, Mr. Desmond Kenny and Ms Elaine Howley.  <br />I advise that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I apologise to members for the croakiness of my voice but I have a chest infection.</p> <p>That is why I am half-hoarse.</p><p> I formally welcome to the Public Gallery, Ms Siobhan Kelly, chief executive officer, and Ms Ciara Keenan, communications manager of the Irish College of Ophthalmologists, Ms Elaine Howley, chief executive officer of NCBI Services, and Mr. Padraig Mallon, chief executive officer of the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.  Mr. Gerry Kerr is attending in his capacity of service user representative with his dog, Orva, and I welcome both of them to the meeting.  It is good to have Orva in attendance and hopefully Orva will keep an eye on and mind members.  Many witnesses appear before the joint committee and it is good to have a dog attend a meeting for the first time.  I also welcome Ms Irene Reid, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Mr. David Green and Ms Doreen Curran and Dr. Eva Lindgren from Novartis, Mr. Paul Moriarty, national clinical lead of the national clinical programme and Mr. James Dunny, National Vision Coalition.</p><p> I invite Dr. Maria Meehan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The National Vision Coalition is an alliance of ophthalmology health care professionals, those working in the sight loss community and, most importantly, service users who were brought together in 2012 by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, and Fighting Blindness.  The coalition consists of the NCBI, Fighting Blindness, the Irish College of Ophthalmologists, the Association of Optometrists in Ireland, Mr. David Keegan, Mater Hospital, Diabetes Ireland, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, ChildVision, Mr. Mark Cahill, Eye and Ear Hospital, Dr. Maureen Hillery, Health Service Executive, HSE, Ms Irene Reid, National Rehabilitation Hospital and Mr. Gerry Kerr, service user representative.  The chief executive officer of Fighting Blindness, Ms Avril Daly, sends her apologies as she is attending another event but I now wish to introduce Mr. David Keegan, consultant ophthalmic surgeon, Mater Hospital, Dublin, and Mr. Des Kenny, chief executive officer of the NCBI Group, who will present our strategy in further detail, in particular on the cost to the State of vision impairment and on what kind of savings could be made from an early intervention.</p></speech>

I wish to talk about the cost and burden of blindness in Ireland.  What is blindness?  What does it mean to be blind in Ireland?  Members should think about that for a minute.  It is frightening, emotional, disconcerting and anger-inducing.  Why should it make one angry?  Because 75% of blindness is preventable and avoidable.  Blindness is defined as best vision of less than 10% of normal vision.  That means struggling with all visual tasks up to total loss of sight, not even being able to see lights.  Moderate vision impairment is defined as best vision of just 10% to 30% of normal vision, which means not being able to drive, difficulty with reading and that performing many tasks becomes tough and problematic.  There is less immediacy in one's life.  Mild vision impairment is defined as best vision of just 30% to 50% vision in one's better-seeing eye.  This means one cannot drive and one touches loss of independence.</p><p>  One in 20 people in Ireland is affected by one of the four main eye diseases, namely, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.  This rises to more than one in two people over the age of 80.  Each individual eye disease leads to a significant reduction in well-being, which is equivalent to more than 700,000 work days or 2.1 million healthy days lost per annum in Ireland.  The financial cost to the State also is considerable.  Based on our report, the financial cost to the State in 2010 was &euro;386 million and on current trends, that will rise to more than &euro;449 million by 2020.  These costs are manifest in the Department of Social Protection through increased welfare payments and fewer people in the workforce, in the Department of Finance through a reduced tax take and the deadweight loss incurred by transferring moneys from the tax take to the welfare side and of course are felt in the Department of Health through supports and interventions for patients affected by blindness and vision impairment.  However, if we introduce interventions such as screening for cataracts and diabetic retinopathy and provide for other early interventions, we can ensure that for hundreds of people, their sight will be retained and will be saving the State hundreds of millions of euro over the coming years.  Rather than incurring higher costs, up to &euro;76 million per annum potentially could be saved, were cost-effective measures identified in the strategy concerning the four main eye diseases in Ireland to be implemented.  This does not require a significant budget increase but rather, services must be improved through efficient use of existing resources and a redeployment in current resources and expenditure.</p><p>  People with vision loss and blindness are eight times more likely to fracture a hip, three times more likely to suffer from depression and admission to nursing homes on average takes place up to three years earlier than in the case of those without vision impairment.  Moreover,the costs to the State rise significantly from &euro;1,700 per annum up to &euro;21,000 per annum if a person slips from visually impairment to blindness.  Preventable blindness is an Irish, European and global issue and not just a Third World issue.  The National Vision Coalition outlined earlier by Dr. Meehan is committed to tackling the issue in Ireland.  Many of the structures to tackle this already are in place but more help is needed from policy-makers in order that we may co-ordinate a comprehensive and cohesive approach.  This can be achieved through a national vision strategy.</p></speech>

The cancer strategy of 2006 already has led to improved patient survival rates for cancer and improved patient care.  Crucially, Ireland also is delivering globally relevant groundbreaking research in this field.  The National Vision Coalition believes this can be reproduced in respect of blindness.  The evidence for vision strategies also is available from Denmark and Scotland, with reductions of 50% in blindness rates due to macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy identified in those countries.  The recent establishment of the diabetic retinopathy screening and treatment programme, Diabetic RetinaScreen, and the HSE&rsquo;s national programme for eye care have provided a real opportunity to achieve improved outcomes for patients with sight loss in Ireland.  At present,there are approximately 147,000 diabetics on the national diabetic register under this programme , more than 6,500 of whom already have sight-threatening retinopathy.  The total projected cost of this programme over the next six years to include screening, treatment and sight-related costs is approximately &euro;100 million.  While this cost will peak in 2015 and 2016, we expect a net saving as we move into 2017 and 2018.  Although the gross figure of &euro;100 million seems high, the net figure, when one takes into account the savings from preventing of blindness and vision impairment, is &euro;21 million or &euro;145 per diabetic patient over six years.  Moreover, as I noted, this will edge towards savings after the six-year period.  The programme will also prevent 235 cases of blindness, nearly 700 cases of moderate vision impairment and nearly 2,000 cases of mild vision impairment.  For some, it will mean they can stay working and continue to contribute while for others, it means they can keep their independence and live on their own or continue to drive.</p><p>  Our job individually within the coalition is to look after patients at risk of, or affected by, sight loss and blindness.  We are asking members to help us to fulfil that role in the public interest by the adoption of this coherent national vision strategy, which pulls together all the existing and proposed components of eye care, thereby allowing us to work collectively.  A fully implemented strategy reducing preventable blindness will save thousands of Irish people from blindness and vision impairment while saving the Exchequer up to &euro;76 million per annum.  I again thank the joint committee for the chance to talk about the cost burden of blindness in Ireland and will pass members of to Mr. Des Kenny to conclude.</p></speech>

Just as the joint committee has had its first dog present at a meeting, members will now see me reading in a format they hopefully will not see many people using before this committee.</p><p>  I sincerely thank both the Chairman and Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for inviting us here today, who, with the other members, paved the way towards our attendance.</p><p>  This morning, we have given the joint committee a summary of our framework or road map for a joined-up strategy regarding eye health and associated support services.  The coalition, on whose behalf we have presented, comprises all the people and organisations that can deliver on a strategy.  The strategy can reduce to near elimination preventable blindness, as 75% to 80% of deteriorating sight loss can be arrested.  We cannot create that strategy but we can deliver on such a strategy.  We can assure the joint committee of its multiple values in savings of &euro;76 million per annum, as indicated by Mr. Keegan, to a health service under severe financial pressure.  We also can assure the joint committee that the strategy guarantees an improved independent lifestyle for people in their older years.</p><p>  As people live longer, the eye diseases of aging must be combatted.  There is no inevitability that sight loss has to darken the last years of old age.  We all have relatives or know people whose sight is, to use the usual euphemism, &ldquo;not the best&rdquo;.</p> <p>The National Vision Coalition&rsquo;s framework provides for a seamless pathway to people from their first visit to an optician to the offer of treatments in their local communities by optometrists and community ophthalmologists.</p><p> There is only a short window of opportunity from the time of the diagnosis of eye disease to achieve a full arrest of loss of vision.  If the Government does not enlarge the framework to a strategy and sees the roadmap of the coalition as leading to cost-effective services, the result will be the unnecessary and scandalous loss of eye-sight in hundreds of thousands of ageing people.  When I had my childhood accident in the mid-1950s cortisone was not widely available.  Had it been in more general use, I would not have been blinded in my right eye as a result of cross-infection from the blinding injury in my left eye.  The treatments for today&rsquo;s eye diseases are known and can be made more widely available at a fraction of the cost of the &euro;76 million to which Mr. Keegan referred.  Those savings could be adopted and made into a national vision strategy.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s blindness is unnecessary.  Where it does happen, support services such as those offered by Fighting Blindness, Guide Dogs for the Blind, Child Vision and NCBI can restore or give a new and different form of independence to people like myself.  Please do not have people reach into our services unnecessarily because the State will not invest in eye health.  The coalition consists of organisations and bodies which are joining our efforts in making a case we know has the sympathy of the Minister for Health.  I ask the committee to offer more than sympathy for our cause by helping us to get the Government to deliver on a national vision strategy.</p></speech>

I will try to elaborate on some of the points raised.  It is encourageing, and I wish it were replicated across other areas, that the National Vision Coalition is an alliance of service users and those who work in the sight loss community.  That is not always the story when people present to this committee.  I commend everybody on that approach, which is a template that could and should be replicated in many other areas.<br />The statistics are cause for concern, with one in 20 people in Ireland affected by one or other of the four main eye diseases.  It is a huge number and it increases according to the age profile of the community.  I ask for clarification on the issue of diabetic retinopathy.  Where it is appropriate for people who are diagnosed with diabetes to present for eye screening, does it apply to type 1 and 2 or is it particular to type 1, which is the more severe form of diabetes?  For the significant body people with type 2 diabetes, monitoring and diet are the key issues.  Type 1 is another story entirely.  I understand that the management of type 2 diabetes does not advise particular observation of sight and other matters pertaining to diabetes in terms of limb and foot health which present in type 1.<br />I take it that the witnesses have a plan for developing a national vision strategy and that it is not just an idea, although they have not yet committed to paper a comprehensive strategy.  Is it a document at this point in time?  They indicate that a number of goals can be achieved through a national vision strategy but there was a suggestion that such a strategy was already to hand and could be presented.  I ask them to clarify that issue.<br />In regard to what they are asking from us, after clarifying my question on the current status on a national vision strategy, we can use our individual and collective weight as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to press for its adoption by the Government so that it has the <i>imprimatur</i>and status it needs.  I can only speak on my own behalf but I have no doubt that I would be reflecting the views of all the members of this committee in saying I would be delighted to play my part in achieving what the witnesses have asked from us.  This is all the more reason for expressing gratitude to them for appearing before us, and to our colleague, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, for making the case for inviting them.  We are only as good as the information that is shared with us.<br />In regard to Mr. Kenny's comments on a joined-up strategy, I have argued with my colleagues in Government that we do not have joined-up government.  Many Departments operate in silos.  That is part of the deficiency of government.  It is not a reflection on the current occupants of the posts; it is just a fact of life.  I expect that the strategy goes beyond the Department of Health to cross Departments in its construction and approach.  Even as a layperson in this regard, I see the sense of that in respect of the areas which the witnesses seek to address.<br />Mr. Kenny concluded on the interesting point of not requiring people to reach into services unnecessarily.  I had to think about the way that was phrased but he was telling us that blindness is avoidable.  It is not that people are coming to pilfer but that such a scenario can be avoided by early intervention.  That is the critical message the witnesses are delivering.  I hope I have not laboured them with too many questions.  I thank them again for their contributions and assure them that, in my role as Opposition spokesperson on health and a proud member of this committee, I will work with colleagues of all opinions to support the case they have made.</p></speech>

The coalition represents 220,000 people who have impaired vision or are blind.  I have met representatives of the group on a number of occasions.  I know I have told them they are too nice.  They have spoken about how their cost-effective plans will save the Government money.  I would prefer if they focused on the eight principles they want put in place.  What progress has been made since the Government signed up to the WHO's Vision 2020 strategy in 2003?  In that context, perhaps they can tell us what they want to achieve before 2020.  How can we put it in place?  I agree with Mr. Kenny that when the members of the delegation walk out of here, it is not good enough for us to sympathise with them and the 220,000 people they represent.  I want to see a plan of action that we can take on board.  We can try to ensure it forms part of the strategy and budget of the Department of Health.  If it is not part of the Department's budget, we are all wasting our time here.  I ask the witnesses to outline exactly what they want.</p><p> Some of those listening in will be aware that my brother is blind.  He would tell me that he feels invisible and unrepresented in society.  Does Mr. Kenny agree with him that there is a prejudice against people who are visually impaired or blind?  What can be done?  I want to send a message to medical health people.  When my brother and I attend various consultants, he is quite often ignored even though he is the patient.  The consultants choose to speak to me and expect me to answer the questions as if he was not there.  I also have some concerns about general practitioners in this regard.  I do not refer to Mr. Keegan, about whom I heard some good things during the week.  He saved someone's life.  Are consultants in general, including diabetic consultants, and GPs trained in how to deal with the sensitivities of patients who are visually impaired or blind?  The witnesses suggested that the public is not aware of such sensitivities.  I have seen medical health professionals treating blind people in a way that is not sensitive.  Before the witnesses leave this meeting, I want them to give the members of the committee a list of exactly what they want us to do so that we are clear on exactly what to ask for when the Minister and officials from the HSE and the Department of Health come in here.  I am not asking about money that can be saved.  I am asking about what the coalition needs to prevent 220,000 people from going blind.  Can Mr. Keegan explain to the public what it should be doing?  Should people who are worried about diabetic retinopathy, cataracts or age related macular degeneration go to their ordinary GPs in the first instance?</p></speech>

If they have, perhaps the witnesses can tell me and I can check the record.  I am one of the 220,000 people who are living with the consequences of sight loss on a daily basis.  While my loss of sight was not preventable, I agree with the coalition's aim of preventing as much as possible of the 75% of sight loss in this country that is preventable.  Obviously, I have a deep personal interest in advancing this cause.  I was pleased to facilitate a meeting between the coalition and the Minister.  I am not sure whether it took place before or after Christmas.  I know the Minister is committed to the principle of a strategy.  The challenge for us is to make that happen.  I would like to speak about my role in the Seanad in this respect.  I hope that a Private Members' motion on this issue will be debated on 17 or 18 July and that the Minister for Health, whoever he or she is at that time, will reply to it.  One has to be positive in hoping that certain commitments will be made during that debate.  I would like Mr. Keegan and Mr. Kenny, who are welcome at this meeting, to comment on what is happening in other countries.  How far behind other countries are we?  I would be specifically interested to know to what extent the European countries against which we should be benchmarking ourselves have advanced this principle.  We should be using and following them as an example.</p></speech>

Today's parliamentary schedule required me to be in the Seanad Chamber to advance a piece of legislation.  I wish to ask Mr. Keegan a question that he may have answered already.  My colleagues on the committee will think I sound like a broken record because I ask a similar question of every expert we have in.  The answer is always pretty much the same.  When we are trying to persuade those who have some influence in the halls of Government to do something, it is useful to ensure they understand the scope of the problem.  How many consultant adult and paediatric ophthalmologists do we have in Ireland?  What is the ratio per head of population?  How do we compare with the figures in the UK and elsewhere in western Europe?  What is the approximate length of time one spends on the waiting list from the time one's GP decides one needs to see an ophthalmologist until one has an initial consultation?  If one is put on the waiting list for some form of surgical intervention, how long will one have to spend on it?</p></speech>

I would like to make a few small points.  The statistic that stands out is that a very high percentage - 75% - of blindness is preventable.  The witnesses mentioned that the financial cost of sight loss to the State, which was &euro;336 million in 2010, will increase to &euro;449 million, which is a huge amount, by 2020.  Will blindness become a greater challenge as people live longer?  While I accept that there is a need for a national vision strategy, I wonder what plan or strategy we are working from at present.  The examples of Denmark and Scotland have been mentioned as models of best practice.  The witnesses mentioned that retinopathy has been reduced by 50% in Scotland.  What treatment was used there?</p></speech>

There are experts on this committee, such as Senator Conway, who are better placed than me to speak on this issue.  Like Deputy McLellan, I was shocked to find that 75% of blindness or sight loss is unnecessary.  Loss of sight is probably one of the most emotional and frightening things that can happen to a person.  My family was concerned when my sister had a huge problem with her sight last year.  We are all pleased that her sight was saved because she got medical attention at the time it was needed.  I compliment the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind charity, which does a wonderful job.  When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I had an opportunity to visit its centre and to speak to its volunteers, who are totally committed to training the guide dogs and supporting those who will need them in the future.  I have read the assessment and would like to ask two questions about the eight principles set out in it.  First, can the witnesses elaborate on the third principle, which states that services should be person centred?  Second, can they give us an idea of the kind of research they believe should be prioritised?  I ask these questions as someone who knows nothing about these matters.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members for their comments.  I appreciate all of the questions.  Due to the nature of the questions, I will probably end up doing most of the talking but I would appreciate if Mr. Kenny and Dr. Meehan would come in at any stage if they want to make a contribution.</p><p>  Regarding diabetic retinopathy screening and treatment, and type 1 versus type 2 diabetics, the new national diabetic retinal screening programme, Diabetic RetinaScreen, which is overseen by the national screening service, provides for all diabetics, type 1 and type 2, over the age of 12, excluding patients who are pregnant.  They get a screening photograph and if eye disease, diabetic retinopathy, is detected on those photographs, the patients are referred to one of the seven treatment centres around the country where they will receive their treatment and care subsequently.  It does not discriminate between type 1 and type 2.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

We have published a framework document, hard or soft copies of which we can make available.  As Mr. Kenny alluded to, the framework provides a roadmap for what we feel is the best route to go.  The committee will have heard me name-check the cancer strategy from 2006 earlier on.  When one looks at that strategy, a lot of good has come out of implementing it and a similar strategy on eye care would deliver the same sort of benefits as that programme has delivered in this country.</p></speech>

Mr. Keegan might touch on that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1099" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Keegan" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014070300013#M00600"><p>I was going to deal with that a little later but I will answer it now.  The key point about the strategy is that it is a cohesive approach.  The national eye care programme looks at hospital eye services and community eye services.  It was tasked with doing that through the clinical care programme overseen by Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll.  Mr. Paul Moriarty, the national clinical lead for ophthalmology, has drafted that document.  Ms Siobhan Kelly, from the Irish College of ophthalmology, is here - I was speaking to her this morning.  That document is just ready to be published.  It document oversees the immediacy in hospital services and community eye services.</p><p>  What the strategy seeks to do is to build in a full longitudinal care plan, right from when somebody needs to go to his or her optician for glasses to the stage if, unfortunately, he or she has to attend the NCBI Fighting Blindness, guide dog services or Child Vision with cane or guide dog.  The strategy also manages to fold in as it were, much like Deputy Catherine Byrne's comment about the holistic approach.  This is a patient-centred approach.  The individuality of those with sight loss and blindness is protected or cared for under this strategy as well.</p><p>  Also dealt with within this strategy is the importance of research.  It is well known around the world that best outcomes happen in countries that adopt or embrace a research culture.  If countries are open to research, they are more likely to adopt best evidence medicine and to do so quickly.  Those countries that do not have research at their core do not adopt it and, therefore, one does not get better patient outcomes.  That is something that has been seen in the cancer area in this country also.  The strategy incorporates the eye care plan but it brings in the extra components that all the stakeholders here represent.</p><p>  I agree on the multidepartmental issue.  It was one of the startling findings for me when we did the cost of blindness study.  I was not expecting this.  I thought the cost of blindness would highlight, much like the cost of sight loss did, a lot of the costs in and around health care, but this transcended so many different departments.  The impact became immediately obvious, not only on the health services but on the Department of Finance through both the reduced tax take because fewer persons with vision impairment or blindness are active in the working community - there are notable exceptions - and the dead weight loss because where one transfers those payments from those who are paying taxes to those on the welfare side there is a leakage.  The Department of Social Protection provides payments, such as the blind pension and the social welfare payments associated with those with vision impairment but also the supports for those affected because more of them are out of work.</p><p>  Following on from that, there are also those informal care costs because there is the assistance and help that those with a vision impairment or blindness require.  We are lucky in this county we still have a good social and family fabric, but there is the lean on the time of that network.  Their productivity reduces and there is also the result of a friend, colleague or family member being affected by vision impairment or sight loss.  That is one of the hidden costs in and around this.  I stress that is a financial cost.  The economic cost is more startling, but I felt in this environment it was not relevant or, necessarily, the best way to present that data.  The economic cost is over &euro;1 billion, but that factors in loss with respect to well-being.  When one factors in the other costs it becomes an even more staggering figure.  These are the financial costs that we talk about.</p></speech>

As Mr. Keegan has illustrated there, the Deputy would have been pointing to this.  It looks as though it is a multiple need in the different Departments to join it up, but if one looks at the figures it is the outcome of neglect that is causing the cost.  The solution is simpler because it is substantially within Health and the HSE, and the allocation of those kind of resources at an early stage.  Through the clinical lead programme, we have already made a start but we are coming in as poor relations on the end of other type of interventions or strategies, and the danger is that we will not get that investment.  We have to argue for that investment to be made at an early stage.  It is a case of being joined-up in the Department of Health rather than joined-up Departments.  The outcome will be there in the longer term but the immediacy of the preventative programme lies in Health.</p></speech>

Returning to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point in terms of the joined-up thinking between the different regions, how advanced is that clinical lead being taken?</p></speech>

As I am now the national lead for the diabetic retinopathy programme, I must declare a bias.  However, it has shown us the route.  If one wants to deal with conditions on a modular basis, eye care in Ireland is one of those areas which one might be able to deal with.  We have been able to take a big issue, such as diabetic eye care, and develop a plan and strategy around it.  We have made it a national screening programme.  Proper screening programmes cover a population where a significant number of that population attend for screening and a significant number of that population are retained within that group.  That is the essence of a screening programme.<br />Earlier there was a point made about what we can benchmark off other countries.  We should be showing a lead.  We have an opportunity to show a lead on diabetes because we have brought a treatment alongside the screening programme.  We are the envy of those concerned in the United Kingdom around this.  We also have an IT system built in around this programme so that we can track the patients, right from their screening visit with their photograph, through the treatment centre, what outcomes they have and what treatments they have.  We have a fully auditable trace through.<br />If I may turn to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's question as to what we would like, we would like an integrated IT system around eye care in Ireland that is accessible by all eye care providers, right from somebody in an optician's shop through to the service bodies, Fighting Blindness, NCBI or guide dogs, so that they would have a history of those individuals.  Such integration would be a key point.  We will show, through the diabetic programme, that such is the way to go.<br />On Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's questions, although that is one of the main measures we would like, the first would be the adoption of the strategy.  The framework and the roadmap is here.  If, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out, it is adopted as Government policy, we can start working with the committee members, the policy makers, on how we will implement it.  One element would be the integration of an IT system.  We want the process put in place.<br />Looking at diabetic retinopathy as a model, the processes are now in place to prevent blindness.  In a country such as the United Kingdom that has this for ten years earlier this year the <i>British Medical Journal</i>published findings which show that, for the first time since records began, diabetic retinopathy is no longer the leading cause of blindness in the working age population.  That is a significant public health impact from introducing that programme.  We want to get the processes in place.<br />We want to replicate that for the other major diseases, such as cataract, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.  Age-related macular degeneration is a crisis that is happening in this country.  We can tackle it through getting the processes right, which are around access, proper treatments, and proper follow-up and care.  As the Danish experience has shown, when one gets that into place, one will half the blindness rates from macular degeneration in this country.  Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in this country.<br />The other measure we want is the adoption of a proper research strategy within this.  I will ask Dr. Meehan to elaborate on that.</p> <p>I reiterate that one of the key stand-out features of the cancer strategy was the involvement and involution of research into it.  I will ask Dr. Meehan to follow up on the importance of research around eye care.</p></speech>

Research obviously goes hand-in-hand with the National Vision Coalition and Fighting Blindness has supported outstanding research, as part of the coalition, for the past 31 years.  Irish scientists are at the forefront of vision research in the world.  One point of which the National Vision Coalition is greatly in favour is the use of registries because, at present, Ireland does not have a national registry of eye disease.  Therefore, we need the framework in place and consequently must work together to build our registries together to make clinical trials and better treatments happen for Irish people.  While a lot of these might take place in other countries, some will take place here and we need something that can work internationally to allow best outcomes for our patients.</p><p>  Another point I wish to make in respect of research is that with our strategy, we also need to educate.  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor touched on the point of somebody who is visually impaired being invisible and this comes from educating our secondary schoolchildren and we are also very much in favour of integrating that.</p></speech>

At present, there are 40 ophthalmic surgeons in the public sector working with the HSE.  That represents approximately 1:110,000 per population.  In Scotland, the equivalent figure is 1:70,000, while in other countries around Europe, the ratio is variable.  As it is based on the definition of an ophthalmologist, which is not directly comparable, we are better leaving it at Scotland for the present.  For example however, in Greece-----</p></speech>

While this is a crude indicator across jurisdictions, Ireland tends to be under-provided compared with western Europe in that we have perhaps one fifth of what we need.  The British tend to have approximately one quarter of what they need and they actually constitute a very low bar for comparison.  Consequently, if we have approximately two thirds of what the Scots have, I am guessing that we are even further below the European average.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Keegan" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014070300014#N00500"><p>We are.  I would have to answer that question by also including our community ophthalmology and medical ophthalmology colleagues, who account for a further 25 full-time equivalents in Ireland in both full-time and part-time posts.  That provides a better measure to then benchmark against other European countries.  In countries such as Greece, Germany and France, the ratio is approximately 1:25,000, whereas in Ireland, if one includes the aforementioned group, the ratio is approximately 1:85,000.  Consequently, we are very under-represented in this regard.  I published a manpower report that was submitted to the Department of Health in 2010, in which we recommended an additional 13 ophthalmic surgical consultants and an additional 17 medical ophthalmologists to meet that need.  That was simply in the context of bringing us up to close to the levels of the United Kingdom, rather then to European levels.  We are supported by the private sector in Ireland and many of the indicators from around Europe might merge the two sets of figures from the public and private sectors.  There are a further 40 full-time equivalents, approximately, within the private sector here.  Consequently, we seek an increase in the number of appointments in hospitals.  When one considers all the hospitals providing eye services, they would require an increase in consultant surgical staff.  However, additional medical ophthalmology staff are also required and such additional staff would be both community and hospital based.  This would tackle our waiting lists, as while routine waiting times vary around the country, in general one is looking at one to two years for a routine eye appointment.</p></speech>

Consequently, if one has a retinal detachment or acute macular degeneration and one attends the accident and emergency services, one tends to be dealt with promptly.  However, that circumstance is reflected in many conditions with which patients present.  The urgent care meets the standard but it is the less than urgent and the routine care that fall short.  The waiting time for a cataract, because it is a Government target, is nine months.  While it drifts over that from time to time, this was helped by special initiatives along the way.  Does that answer the Senator's question?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Desmond Kenny" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014070300014#N01400"><p>When one looks at the strategy and while so much can be done with the heavy lifting at the health end, I have noticed that in replies to parliamentary questions, it reaches into other areas because where people live and how they live is multi-Government or multistranded.  However, much of how one lives or how one is accepted into an included lifestyle has improved considerably over the years and decades of my involvement or experience of inclusion.  My involvement started in one of the segregated special schools, which now form part of the redress board's problems.  It led to more segmented special-type services such as limited employment opportunities.  That expanded as the years and decades passed and I believe we have become a more inclusive society.  We are now just about accepted as being equal and the day we are accepted as being superior will be most interesting.  I only jest but it is a question of to whom one is equal when one is perceived as having arrived somewhere.</p><p>  We have the care services and an infrastructure of society in which one will see we have level access, which is a barrier-free environment for all.  While that started as a wheelchair lobby, it was then realised that people have ambulatory-type problems in walking, as do women with buggies and mothers with buggies and, consequently, a barrier-free environment for all helps people who have the greatest need.  Just as visibility and colour contrast help low-vision people, it also assures one fairly quickly that the yellow rails are there to be grabbed if one is to travelling on the Luas and so on.  People will always be at a disadvantage and I do not think it is prejudice; I think it is ignorance.  It is people's need and wish to do the right thing that actually makes them clumsy in doing stupid things, such as asking does one want sugar or does he take sugar.  We have a society with organisations in which we and the Government in indirect ways have invested in the provision of an infrastructural society that has audio pedestrian crossings and that now has in place a taken-for-granted infrastructure that has been won.  There are announcements on trains that started with us - when they are working.  I note they do not work all the time on the Cork train on which I was travelling recently and the Chairman might do something about that.  However, while such announcements help us, they were provided initially at our request.  In working through the Government and through European legislation, much has been improved and a lot is happening in respect of taking the acceptance of disability and vision impairment into something that is more normal and into creating and building rights around it.  I thank the joint committee and the Deputies who have come before them for allowing this to happen.</p></speech>

How does one know in advance which symptom is urgent and which is not?  How does a general practitioner know which candidate ophthalmology patient going to a clinic has an urgent problem and which does not?  That is why the patients need to see an ophthalmologist.</p></speech>

We need a process, we need screening programmes and then we need awareness at general practice level of the condition.  There also is the question of public awareness about with what people will present.  In recent years, we have been pressing to raise public awareness, particularly now that we have treatments for macular degeneration.  As for what is an urgent condition, in this case it concerns progressive loss of vision but the Senator is aware that an urgent condition is one in which by making an intervention, one can prevent or reverse that loss.  A non-urgent condition is either when there is nothing one can do about the condition or if it can be addressed down the road.  For example, a cataract is a less urgent issue, as one can address it down the road.</p> <p>We have to educate both general practitioners and the public about identifying the signs and symptoms so these patients will be referred quickly up the system.  Proper processes will de-stress those urgent services and we can get these patients in appropriately.  The treatments are available.  It is about getting the patients treated in a timely manner.  A patient with an acute leak from macular degeneration has only a matter of weeks before they get up to the point of irreversible vision loss.</p></speech>

Senator Crown knows well about the issues of recruitment across the medical sector which must be dealt with.</p><p>  Our obligation is to provide the roadmap and then we can come back with a clear idea of the resources we need for this field.  We feel we have an idea about these resources now.  If we implement them, they will become cost-neutral because one is tackling the cost implications on the other side of the network.  I accept the point made by Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor about being a little more upfront or aggressive.  If the resources are provided, we will make a commitment to deliver on them.</p></speech>

I also thank Fighting Blindness, Diabetes Ireland, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and its chief executive officer, Padraig Mallon, ChildVision, all the doctors, nurses and other medical staff involved with the visually-impaired, as well as employers.  Mr. Keegan said people are ignorant rather than prejudiced.  Is there a prejudice for people who are blind when they are looking for work?

That is not due to expansion of opportunity or people entering it.  Visually-impaired people had a designated form of employment in the public service from the mid-1950s in the role of blind telephonists.  All members in their public service life in local authorities and what not will have encountered visually-impaired people on switchboards.  That designation is now gone.  Due to the need to reduce numbers in the public service, telephone systems have become automated.  NCBI currently supplies telephonists within the public service but this is shrinking as a designated form of employment which we regret.</p><p>  Employment generally in the public service by way of opportunity has not been expanded.  The telephonist 1 grade gave an access grade that allowed people graduate and there was an entry grade of computer programmer but these are disappearing.  The number of manual or manipulative types of jobs that visually-impaired people can do, such as making baskets or working in workshops or on assembly lines, have disappeared.  It was seen as not providing enough in earnings but when it was taken away, there was nothing left.  The problem is to have the dignity of work with a decent wage and being allowed to make a contribution to society.  There is a crisis around employment for visually-impaired people.</p><p>  We have made representations several times to the Minister for Social Protection on behalf of people with a visual impairment who are on a blind pension but who cannot get on the JobBridge scheme while those on a disability allowance can.</p></speech>

The challenge of employment opportunities for the visually-impaired or the blind, about which Mr. Desmond Kenny spoke, has not been grasped by the Government.  We need to have effective gradual programmes where companies and human resources units are educated as to the benefits of employing visually-impaired people and how assistance can be put in place to ensure a level playing pitch for them.</p><p>  I know the Minister is aware of the issues around JobBridge which need to be dealt with.  There will always be challenges in that regard.  I thank the delegations for their presentations which provided a most worthwhile engagement and hope something positive comes from it.</p></speech>

The Minister was at pains to point out in his Second Stage statement that the companies would not be in a position to cross-subsidise.  At the time I was somewhat confused because, as I set out for the Minister, the reason for the bringing together of the two companies was to ensure the airport would have a real chance of surviving on the basis of having external support.</p> <p>Shannon Airport is a going concern and has survived up to now on revenues generated by ARI.  While that was part of the group company, there was a subvention of between &euro;10 and &euro;12 million annually.  The Booz report set out very clearly that an airport the size of Shannon Airport needs between 3 and 5 million passengers a year in normal trading conditions to survive.  Notwithstanding the best efforts to create a business plan which would demonstrate the capacity of Shannon to survive on its own, it was not possible to predict or forecast that level of activity.  The expectation in the minds of all was that the bringing together of the property assets of Shannon Development would be adequate and appropriate to assist Shannon Airport to become a stand-alone entity.  Being cut adrift from the DAA, it would not be in a position to receive any State support.  As it would be now independent, that would rightly be seen as state aid, which EU rules prevent.  The Minister might expand therefore on how he sees the capacity for the airport to survive as an independent entity without access to revenues or resources other than those generated by terminal traffic or the use of its own lands.  My understanding is that Shannon Development as a company will continue to manage the assets of the old SFADCO.</p></speech>

In fact, the airport operating as an airport with an airfield can break even, which it did last year, notwithstanding that it does not have 3 million passengers.  As passenger numbers continue to increase, we are confident that the airport and airfield can be profitable.  The adjacent land in what will become Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited can also be profitable, but it will be under the same umbrella with the same CEO and board.  A secondary consideration is EU state rules.  Our best legal advice was to keep the subsidiaries separate.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the fact that the airport was largely given the independent status in a debt-free way, the best advice from Booz was that if it was to be made independent, it would need external support to deal with potential shocks.  I recognise the good work the management, staff and chairperson, Ms Hynes, have done in increasing the through-put of passengers.  I was around in 2007 when the then Government believed the establishment of two independent entities at Shannon and Cork gave the best chance of a strong future for both airports.  Notwithstanding that, the over-reliance on one particular carrier and the desire of that company to manipulate its activity ultimately put the airport in a precarious situation.  I have concerns therefore that if there was to be a significant shock to the aviation sector internationally - examples of which we have seen on many occasions in the past - the airport would not have the capacity to rely on a source of revenue Booz identified as important for its survival.</p><p>  I am concerned about the basis on which the legislation was first proposed which was that business plans could be put forward for both airports that showed their capacity to survive or not.  In the case of Cork, it did not reach the threshold whereby it could survive on its own.  The business plan for Shannon outlined the possibility of survival as an independent entity on the basis that it would have access to revenues from another source.  If that were not the case, there would have been stronger objections within the region to the removal of Aer Rianta International, which has been a significant revenue generator for the entire group of companies.  It was used to fund the expansion of what was Aer Rianta to assist in the development of Dublin Airport.  That has been successful.  It was always there and had the capacity to support Shannon in the event of a difficult patch.</p><p>  What I am trying to elicit from the Minister is the safety mechanism in place for the establishment of Shannon Airport in an independent entity, recognising the vagaries of the aviation sector.  What if there is a shock in the sector and a reduction based on a particular airline's future prospects?  What is there to allow Shannon to trade through a difficult period?  I do not see the safety mechanism in circumstances where the Minister says there is no capacity for cross-subsidisation.  I accept that the section deals with the payment of dividends to the Exchequer.  Of course, the Exchequer can decide in a particular year not to take a dividend where it would be perilous to the viability of the company.  If it is not able to meet its basic cost requirements, Shannon faces potential difficulties.</p></speech>

Subsequent to the Booz report, the Shannon task force modified and built on that thinking and effort.  What is envisaged is that the airport will operate at break even or in profit running as an airport.  Also envisaged is that IASC and the facilities around the airport will be profitable.  It is of course a possibility that in some years the airport will be loss making where a downturn in aviation occurs as happens from time to time.  That is true for any airport.  Dublin Airport ran up losses for a good few years before going back into profit.  That happens with airports all over the world.  The airport has significant borrowing capacity and reserves at this stage.</p></speech>

It would have been wrong to suggest that any one consultancy report would form the basis for the entire thinking of Government.</p><p>  The business plan I recall indicated a necessity to reach approximately 1.9 million passengers by the end of 2014.  That would have taken numbers to significantly more than is projected for this year.  Approximately 1.39 million passengers used Shannon Airport last year, which was an increase of approximately 5,000.  Projections are that there will be an increase of 10% to 12% this year, which gets numbers to 1.6 million at best.  That is 300,000 passengers short of the business plan expectation.  Projections went on to require passenger numbers of approximately 2.5 million by the end of 2017.  We are well off target in the first year, which is not to cast any negative aspersions on the people there who are working very hard to build on the economic activity in the State and take cognisance of what is happening internationally.  They are doing an outstanding job.  However, it points to the fact that the projections in the business plan which set the tone for the Government's decision to bring forward the Bill have not been met to a considerable extent.  One must suggest, therefore, that there is a very obvious need for a belt-and-braces approach.</p><p>  We all recognise that there are potentially negative consequences to going independent, but people are largely embracing the idea.  They want to make the most of it.  However, I record my concerns at not seeing the kind of protection required when one considers the importance of Shannon Airport to the wider mid-west region.  While it is clear we will not agree, I want the Minister to be aware of potential issues.  There is no impediment in the legislation to directing cross-subsidisation.</p> <p>If one wants cross-subsidisation, I hope there is capacity there that will allow the two companies to operate in a manner that works best for both.  I certainly think their interdependence is critical and is just not at board or senior management level.</p></speech>

Passenger numbers at Shannon Airport increased very marginally last year.  We are now projecting a 10% rise in passenger numbers this year, which is a very good outcome.  It will mean that Shannon Airport is about one year behind on what was a very ambitious business plan, but to be a year behind on ambitious business plan is not a bad result.</p><p>  The 2012 business plan did not envisage any income coming in from the International Aviation Services Centre, IASC, which is the centre of excellence for aviation.  Shannon has as much security as any State-owned enterprise.  All State-owned enterprises must break even and make a profit.  Shannon has as much security in that regard as any other State-owned enterprise.  In an extreme situation, it is possible for the Government to inject equity into the company but we are not anticipating that ever being necessary.  It is not that it would be allowed to close or anything like that.  That is not even foreseen.</p></speech>

At the time, we sought the views of different stakeholders.  In that context, we had a number of submissions.  I recall there was concern in a number of quarters about the borrowing potential, which I think is set at &euro;100 million.  The concern was that there might be a need to increase that and that even the borrowing would be with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of parties queried whether the potential existed to involve the Department of Finance, which tends to be quite conservative in the minds of most, about permissions in that regard.  They queried the need for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have a role in that regard.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>

Obviously, its job is to protect the public purse so it was doing its job in that regard.  At Cabinet sub-committee level, we agreed to a limit of &euro;100 million with which everyone was satisfied, including Shannon.  It is not unusual for major borrowings to have to get consent from both the parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Even something as minor as setting up a subsidiary of a State-owned enterprise or appointments to the board of a State-owned enterprise must be run by both the line Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is pretty standard in that regard.  Perhaps it is unnecessary but the view is that line Departments can sometimes be captured by their companies and agencies and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is there to have a second view and to make sure the general public interest is looked after as well.</p></speech>

They are people who from 1969 onwards transferred from the Civil Service to Aer Rianta on the urging of the Department and with the expectation that it would not involve any worsening of conditions of employment.  This was circulated by way of office notice 4/68.  That assertion was confirmed on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il by various Ministers based on questions that had arisen.  Anybody taking a look at this would believe that there was a legitimate expectation that their situation would not be any worse than if they had remained within the Civil Service.  In fact, they would argue, and I would find it very hard to disagree with them, that Aer Rianta was not a legal entity in company terms until 1998, that before then it had acted as an agent of the Minister, that all the legal documents from Aer Rianta had to be sent to the Department for signing, and that when the 1998 legislation was enacted, it made no reference to the company's staffing or any current superannuation conditions.</p><p>  This raised a legal point that was moot but serious.  How could an established civil servant prior to 1998 be transferred to a trading or non-registered company back in 1969?  While they had transferred in terms of employment, one would need to look at what their legal standing was during that period.  It would be their view that the conditions could not have changed since they transferred to an entity that only became a legal entity in 1998.</p><p>  Successive Ministers, including those from my party, have failed to address this issue.  It was easy to let it go.  Unfortunately, because of the way in which the pension issue has transformed over the years, there is little doubt that those concerned are at a very significant financial disadvantage in pension terms.  An officer in a particular grade who moved to Aer Rianta and who has a salary in 2014 of about &euro;52,000 has a pension entitlement of &euro;16,000.  However, a similar person who remained in the Civil Service would now have a pension entitlement of about &euro;24,000.  That is very significant issue and I do not think the Government can continually turn its back on it.</p><p>  I accept that my amendment has been ruled out of order on the basis that it might put some financial burden on the State.  As members of the Opposition, we do not have the capacity to do that.  However, it would be helpful if the Minister could have a look at it again possibly with a view to bringing forward his own amendments that might address this issue.</p></speech>

The matter had been raised and examined by other Ministers in the past, most extensively by Mr. Noel Dempsey who also sought the advice of the then Attorney General.  The conclusion they came to was that the people concerned ceased to be civil servants when they signed contracts with Aer Rianta going way back.</p> <p>While the office notice gave them an assurance that there would not be changes and they would be no worse off in respect of their employment terms and conditions, that assurance did not extend to future pension rights.  This was the determination when it was reviewed by the then Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey, with the support of the Attorney General.  Nothing has changed since then to alter the position.  While it is open to employees to go to the courts if they so wish, that they have not done so may indicate that their own legal advice is similar to that of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

It is not a case of the workers not believing they have a legal case.  Rather, they do not have the wherewithal to take on the State with the Attorney General defending.  Recognising that they are pensioners and their pensions are meagre compared with what they might have had had they remained in the employ of the Civil Service, they are not financially strong enough.  They are also relatively few in number, so a small contribution from a large number of people to pay for a class action and get a decent hearing is not possible.  Given how everything has changed significantly for them, they were like us in hoping for a review to address this wrong.</p><p>  I have been reading about this situation for years and I am not taking a constituency point of view.  I have taken difficult decisions in the House about Shannon Airport, Aer Lingus and so on where I believed they were justified.  Assurances were given to these employees to the effect that the move would not involve any worsening of employment conditions, but a pension is always a condition of employment.  When a comparison is made between two entities, and conditions transfer with employees, it follows that there is an incumbency, perhaps on the State, to ensure the commitment is followed through.  When entering any employment that depends on a private pension, there are no guarantees about the outcome.  For example, there could be a catastrophe along the lines of what happened to our economy.  Given that the commitment was linked to the workers' employment as civil servants, however, their clear understanding and expectation was that they would be no worse off.  For HR purposes, they were facilitating the State by transferring to the company.  The handful who did not believe the political system have been proved right.  They have retained their benefits and pension entitlements in full.</p><p>  It is difficult to justify what the State has allowed to happen, although I do not mean that in political terms.  I call on the Minister to re-examine the matter or consider entering a consultation process with representative groups.  Often, it is only decades after a particular event that we realise a wrong has been committed and the State finds itself having to pay out, issue apologies and so on.  One such wrong has been done in this case.  The current legislation is clear, in that those who transfer from Aer Rianta to the Shannon Airport company will be given commitments.  It follows that this was the express desire when people who transferred previously would not end up in a worse position.  Having read the D&aacute;il transcripts and notwithstanding the fact that the legislation itself did not follow for a long time, I do not doubt that the Legislature's intention was to ensure that all of the employees' conditions would be maintained.  While I do not want to second-guess what will happen in the courts, the Minister is aware that when issues before a court grow complex, the judge or judges often read the Houses' debates in an attempt to understand what the Legislature's wishes might have been.  It is clear from the debates in question that the desire was to give employees full confidence and that it was all just a method of housekeeping for the Department.  For example, why remain in the Department's employ when people could move to a different entity and retain the same terms and conditions?</p><p>  I am not happy to support the Government's approach.  Nor was I happy when people from my party were in government and reached the same conclusion.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not considered the issue more broadly.</p></speech>

A certain part of the business community is concerned that Cork does not have the same ability to chart its destiny.  Cork is a significant city and has a regional presence.  There is a belief that its airport could manage its affairs well and be a viable, independent entity.  That the Government is removing it as an entity completely ends the potential during the life of this Government and for some time afterwards of establishing that independent entity.  Will the Minister explain the Government's thinking in effectively ruling out the notion of an independent entity at Cork?</p></speech>

What we are doing now is dissolving the Cork Airport Authority plc as it stands but retaining the provision to re-establish it should the conditions for re-establishment of it as an independent entity be right.  Currently, the conditions are not right because of the large debt associated with the new terminal at that airport.  While Cork Airport is generating an operating profit now, it iis not sufficient to pay down that debt.  The debt will have to be paid down over time from profits made in Dublin and, perhaps, overseas.  When it has been sufficiently paid down it may then be possible under this legislation to re-establish the company and then separate the airport.</p><p>  The new management team in Cork is putting huge efforts into the development of new routes, particularly to the Nordic countries and Northern Germany and Northern Spain where currently there are no routes in operation.  While it operates 50 other connections to various parts of Europe, it has none in those areas.  The team is keen to provide a transatlantic service, if possible, and a Dublin connector service if they can get airline support for it.  Currently, the airport manager reports directly to the CEO of the ARI.  Previously, management at the airport had to plug into the middle management system in DAA, which meant HR in Cork reported to HR in Dublin and security in Cork reported to security in Dublin.  This no longer happens.  In practical terms, the airport now operates much more independently than in the past in that it now runs its own show and the manager now reports directly to the CEO.  In addition, the Airport Development Council has been established.  This comprises all of the stakeholders in the Cork region, including Cork Chamber of Commerce, F&aacute;ilte, union interests and so on who are being brought together to help drive the airport and make it more successful. </p><p>  What is being abolished is effectively a shadow company - in other words, a company with a board but no assets and no real power and an extra step of management that was not necessary.  In terms of what is happening on the ground, in reality Cork Airport is becoming much more independent than it was in the past.  We are abolishing the shell entity.  Even the directors of the board were uncomfortable with being members of a board that did not own or have any power over the airport.  We are also in this legislation retaining the provision to re-establish the airport when the conditions are right.</p></speech>

I would have expected that it would start out at the beginning of a training period with its own budget.  If management is as stated by the Minister, and I have no reason to doubt him, that type of structure would in my view necessitate an individual budget provision on an annual basis rather than a wait and see what happens at the end of the year type approach.</p></speech>

The view was that it retained all of the activity for itself and left only a small amount of business to the other airports.  The notion of independence would allow more appropriate management in that regard.  If as the Minister says the decision to retain Cork Airport within the overall umbrella is purely to get it to a point whereby it could be re-established independently then I would have thought the first step in that regard would be legislation framed in such a way that moved Cork Airport in a particular direction and provided that it be retained as a separate business entity similar to that prescribed earlier in the Bill in respect of Shannon and the two companies that emerged in that regard.  The Minister has been quite prescriptive in the methodology used to establish those two companies under a broader umbrella and referred in that regard to issues related to State aid rules.  I acknowledge that in relation to Cork Airport there is a difference because two unique companies are not being established.  However, in setting Cork Airport on a path towards ultimate independence, the expectation would have been that the entity now being formed, with the localised management structure, would have be supported by a proper budgeting regime that would show its capacity to trade independently at some point, notwithstanding the overhang of the debt, which will be met from general revenues from Aer Rianta International.  I do not propose to get hung up on this point but it is an issue of which the Department should be cognisant in terms of proceeding.</p></speech>

Concern has been expressed in Shannon and Cork about the entity that has effectively controlled the three airports.  I know the history of the establishment of the Dublin Airport Authority.  The expectation at the time of its establishment in 2004 was that separation of Shannon and Cork Airports would have come about much sooner.</p> <p>Given the fact that Cork Airport still remains part of the DAA, formerly Aer Rianta, I would have thought that pending the ability to make Cork Airport independent the Minister would have created some type of umbrella name that did not define it as the Dublin Airport Authority.  It is known colloquially as the DAA, but people in Cork rightly feel that this adds to the notion that everything is about Dublin, driving Dublin and creating a really strong airport in Dublin, while Cork is at the end of the tail, as it were, in Irish aviation activity.  While I do not wish to get involved in deciding a name, returning to the use of "Aer Rianta" as an interim step until such time as there are two independent entities might have been an appropriate way to proceed.  I am opposing this section on that basis.  I could have proposed an amendment to call it "DCA" or whatever.</p></speech>

DAA is not just Dublin.  It includes Cork and has business internationally.  It is not just about airports; it has a consulting arm and a retail arm as well.  It is not an authority but a company.  The original intention was either to return to the old name, Aer Rianta, or to rename it by giving it a new name.  When that was scoped out, the conclusion was that it would not be wise.  There were two reasons: first, the DAA is now an internationally recognised name which has some value attached to it, and, second, the cost of rebranding on the previous occasion was approximately &euro;3 million.  Given that the company is really only returning to profit now and there are problems in the pension fund, which we will discuss later, spending &euro;3 million on an expensive rebrand was decided by everybody to be inappropriate.  Instead, we are moving to "daa", using lower-case letters.  It will be a little like KPMG or CRH or EY, which used to stand for something but are now just letters.  Nonetheless, the letters DAA have value, and it is well recognised as a company not just in Ireland but also overseas.  The ideal solution would have been a renaming and rebranding, similar to Electric Ireland or whatever Bord G&aacute;is will be called, but the cost was not justifiable in the current circumstances.</p></speech>

I said I would table some amendments to this section to bring greater clarity to some of the provisions.  I also indicated that I proposed to delete the provisions in section 32A relating to replacement schemes.  These provisions were only intended to be used in a fallback situation, as an alternative to the wind-up of the scheme by the Pensions Authority in the event that the parties to the scheme could not agree on a sustainable way forward.  The deletion of these provisions will also address the concerns raised by Deputies last week, namely, the power under section 32A(4) for employers in the IAS scheme to unilaterally withdraw their members from the scheme, with the latter having no say in this.  I am deleting that section with this amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52014070300007#F01700"><p>I am inserting a new section.</p><p>  It is correct that those provisions did not provide for the consent of employees, but I remind Deputies that in the scenario we were discussing - a possible forced wind-up of the scheme by the Pensions Authority - employee consent would also not have been appropriate at that point.  In any event, the provisions contained in subsections (3) to (10) of section 32A are now deleted from the revised new section 34 which I have tabled.</p><p>  Before discussing the revised section, it would be helpful to remind Deputies of the current situation regarding the IAS scheme and how the proposals in this section are intended to assist the parties in implementing whatever solutions are agreed by them to the serious deficit in the scheme.  As I said on Second Stage, the provisions of section 34 do not anticipate or pre-empt whatever solution is arrived at by the parties.  This could even include a continuation of the current IAS scheme if somehow the massive deficit in the scheme were to disappear and the IAS fund were to find itself in a healthy surplus again as soon as this Bill is enacted.  Almost everybody now accepts that this is not a realistic outcome, but the Bill does not preclude it.</p><p>  The central problem with the existing section 32 in the 1998 Act is that it only provides for that particular outcome.  In short, it provides that any separate pension scheme that the DAA may establish for IAS scheme members must have the same pension benefits and that the terms and conditions relating to those benefits must be no less favourable than those currently applicable within the IAS scheme.  In other words, if the DAA were to establish its own separate pension scheme for its existing and newer employees who are currently members of the scheme, it would have to be essentially a replica of that IAS scheme, with all its problems and inflexibilities.  DAA and Shannon simply do not have a mandate under current legislation to introduce any other type of scheme for their members of the IAS scheme and this is potentially a serious barrier to the implementation of whatever agreed solution emerges to the problems in that scheme.  We could find, and I very much hope we have found, a compromise solution to those problems, but DAA will not be able to implement it unless the flexibilities provided in this Bill are implemented.</p><p>  It was also suggested on Second Stage that these provisions are premature and that we should wait for the current discussions among the parties to reach a conclusion.  The implication of that suggestion is that I introduce a short Bill to the Oireachtas at that stage to provide for the legislative tools to implement whatever compromise solution has been arrived at by the parties.  Leaving aside the prospect that the Houses might not be sitting, as the summer recess is almost here, that would be a very inefficient use of Oireachtas time and departmental resources when there is absolutely no need for such a course of action.  We can provide the necessary provisions in this Bill, which I hope can be enacted before the recess.  In addition, any prospect of causing further delay to the implementation of the solution to the problem, which has been ongoing for many years, is not one that should be attractive to any of us, and it would certainly be grossly unfair to the parties involved.</p><p>  The amended section 34 which I have tabled contains two subsections.  Section 34(1) substitutes three new sections in place of the existing section 32 of the 1998 Act.</p> <p>These are new section 32, new section 32A and new section 32B.<br />With regard to the new section 32, most of the provisions of this new section 32 are similar to those of the existing section 32 which it is replacing.  For the most part, therefore, it contains the fairly standard provisions governing pension schemes that appear in legislation governing commercial State companies, such as power for the airport authorities to establish superannuation schemes for staff, ministerial approval being required for such schemes and for any proposed subsequent amendments to them, power to establish a fund associated with each approved scheme from which benefits can be paid, a requirement that an appeals mechanism must be provided for in each scheme, and the laying of schemes before the Houses of the Oireachtas. <br />I have deleted subsections (13), (14) and (15) from the previous version of this section.  Those provisions were intended to give clarity  around how any new DAA pension scheme would be divided between DAA employees and those of a future Cork Airport authority if and when Cork Airport is separated from the DAA.  I felt that, while not essential to the Bill, these provisions would assist the administrative processes involved in a future separation of Cork Airport.  However, they have given rise to a certain degree of confusion and misunderstanding and it is for that reason I am removing them.<br />I have divided the previous section 32A into two separate sections for greater clarity.  These are now sections 32A and 32B.  The new section 32A will allow IAS scheme members who become members of another pension scheme to cease making contributions to the IAS scheme.  The airport authorities will be required to submit that other pension scheme for ministerial approval in the normal way under section 32, which I mentioned a moment ago.  Obviously, the employer contributions to the IAS scheme in respect of such a member would cease simultaneously and no further superannuation benefit would accrue under the IAS scheme for that member.  This is entirely voluntary and there is no obligation on IAS scheme members to cease contributing to that scheme unless they want to.  I have made an amendment to the previous version of this provision to make it absolutely clear that the member, him or herself, must agree to join another scheme.<br />The problems in the IAS scheme will still, of course, remain to be resolved by the parties.  However, this section addresses the desire expressed by some employees to have the option of putting contributions in respect of future service into a pension fund other than the IAS fund where there is a prospect of a better future benefit.  SIPTU held a vote on this issue last February and the overwhelming majority voted in favour of withholding contributions to the scheme pending resolution of its problems.  The provisions in this section provide them with that option if, on a purely voluntary basis, they wish to avail of it.<br />The new section 32B(1) provides the trustees of the IAS scheme with power, without the need for consent by members or employers, to amend the provisions of the scheme to cease contributions to the scheme by both members and employers and of course to cease the corresponding accrual of further benefits under the scheme.  This will facilitate an overall solution to the problems in the IAS scheme, whether that is along the lines of the Labour Court recommendations of May of last year, the trustees' proposals of last February, the proposals issued a fortnight ago by the expert panel or some variation of any of those proposals.  In deciding whether to exercise this power, the trustees must consider what is in the best overall interests of the scheme members.  Also, they must have due regard to the interests of the different categories of member and to any other matters they consider relevant, including the funding deficit and its implications for all members.  Clearly, an agreement among the parties will make the trustees' job in this regard a lot easier.  The trustees of most modern pension schemes would, in conjunction with the scheme's employer, have the power to cease contributions and benefit accruals in any event.  Therefore, it is not an unusual provision in that regard.<br />In section 34(4) I have made the operation of these provisions subject to a commencement order.  This is another amendment<b></b>that I have introduced having listened to Deputies' concerns last week, and the concerns expressed by Senators some weeks ago.  Having considered the matter again, it is not unreasonable that the activation of the ability to use this power should await further progress by the parties towards an overall solution.<br />Obviously if the trustees freeze the IAS scheme, there would be a requirement for a new pension scheme to be established, under which current IAS members could accrue benefits in respect of their future service.  Such a new scheme would be subject to ministerial approval under new section 32 which I referred to earlier.  Any new scheme would also of course cater for new employees, including those 1,250 new and largely young employees in the DAA and Shannon, to whom I referred on Second Stage, who currently are not members of any occupational scheme because current legislation does not allow Shannon or the DAA to establish pension schemes that are not more or less the same as the failed IAS scheme.<br />Section 34(2) clarifies that the IAS scheme trustees have the power to amend any provision of the IAS scheme that is necessary to comply with a direction of the Pensions Authority, pursuant to section 50 of the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  While it may seem strange that there should be any doubt about the power of the trustees to institute rule changes on foot of a statutory direction issued by the Pensions Authority, the potential nevertheless exists, due to the inflexible nature of the scheme, for a challenge to any such action taken by the trustees.  The subsection is designed to remove any doubt that there may be in any quarter that, in order to implement statutory directions from the Pensions Authority under section 50 of the Pensions Act, the trustees may make any necessary changes to the provisions of the IAS scheme without any requirement to seek the consent of members or employers.<br />Section 34(2) repeals section 9 of the Aer Lingus Act 2004.  Section 9 of the Act is similar to the existing section 32 in the 1998 Act applying to airport authorities.  It allowed Aer Lingus to set up its own replica IAS-type scheme for its own staff.  However, that section was never commenced and those provisions were never used.  Replicating the significant structural issues inherent in the IAS scheme does not make sense and section 9 of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 will now never be commenced.  Therefore, its retention on the Statute Book is no longer appropriate.<br />As I and previous Ministers with this portfolio have said many times, the resolution of the funding difficulties in the IAS scheme is a matter for the trustees, members, employers and the Pensions Authority.  The deficit in the scheme arose over a number of years for a number of reasons and, most particularly, because the contributions made by the members and companies have not been sufficient to match the benefits expected or promised.<br />The expert panel was established by ICTU, IBEC, my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It stressed in its report of 16 June that its recommendations represent the best possible outcome that can be achieved.  It also said that it was the view of the panel that if this final opportunity to resolve this very protracted problem is not grasped, the situation facing members of the IAS scheme will deteriorate further.  Since then Aer Lingus, which represents almost 70% of the membership of the IAS scheme, has stated that, subject to an overall agreement based on the panel's recommendations, it is prepared to increase its previous offer of &euro;110 million in respect of its current employees by &euro;36.7 million to &euro;146.7 million, as recommended by the panel.  It is also prepared to increase its offer to its deferred members of the scheme by &euro;14 million to a total of &euro;44 million.  Therefore, Aer Lingus has indicated that it is prepared to contribute more than &euro;190 million towards the resolution of this scheme's deficit.<br />The DAA has also indicated that it is continuing to review the details of the panel's report and I expect to hear positive news from it shortly.  The company has said that it believes that the panel's report represents the basis for a final and complete resolution of pension arrangements.  In the DAA's case, the panel recommended an increase of more than &euro;9 million on the company's original upfront capital offer to &euro;57.3 million in respect of active IAS scheme members.  The company has signalled a revised amount in respect of its deferred members of &euro;15.5 million, an increase of &euro;5 million on its previous position.  The ratio of payments that was recommended by the expert panel's report in respect of both companies broadly aligns with the split of membership of Aer Lingus and DAA employees within the scheme.  There has also been further contact between the DAA and the deferred members' committee in recent days which I very much welcome.  I understand that arrangements are being finalised for a meeting next week.  I have urged all parties to grasp this opportunity to deal finally with this long-standing problem.  The panel's recommendations are capable of acceptance, although I appreciate that some of the decisions necessary to achieve this will be challenging and difficult for all parties.<br />This part of the Bill, particularly the proposed new sections 32A and 32B, is essential in the context of the efforts to find and implement a solution to the serious problems in the IAS scheme.  Those recommendations, or any solution agreed among the parties, cannot be implemented without the provisions I have included in this Bill.  I apologise for being long winded but hope I have covered everything.<br />Section 23 was passed earlier but I will need to amend it as it still refers to the replacement scheme.  We are deleting the reference here and if my amendment is passed, I will need to table an amendment to section 23 on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I have seen nothing in the Minister's amendment that would negate the necessity of opposing the section.  The Minister will appreciate that this is the first time the Government has sought to legislate for a private pension scheme.  That creates great concern.  It is well worth noting the deep concern of employees, deferred pensioners and those on a pension.  The Minister said during the discussion that a committee had been established by the various stakeholders with a view to bringing forward some long-term resolution for a problem that has existed for many years.  I fail to understand the need to legislate right now.  I fail to see why we should be trying to second-guess the outcome of these discussions.  The Minister said on Second Stage, and repeated today, that he is trying to create a framework that will allow that particular group to come forward with a decision.  The Minister makes the excuse that it might be a better use of the Oireachtas's time not to be dragged back during the recess due to the cost implications of recalling the Oireachtas.  This issue has gone on for many years and I think it could hold over until the House resumes in September.  I would be much more comfortable dealing with primary legislation when we know what we are legislating for.  I think this attempted catch-all provision is not the way to proceed.</p><p>  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw his amendment.  I am sure others Members of the House and I will have no problem in facilitating the Minister dealing with this legislation, in the best interests of all concerned, when we know what we are legislating for.  We are being asked to look into a dark tunnel and try to create a platform from which a solution will come forward and then try to establish legislative provisions to meet any particular set of circumstances.  I do not think that is the appropriate way to do business.  I will oppose the section.</p></speech>

It is one thing to deal with the different entities in Shannon, but in this Bill we are dealing with significant issues that will affect the pensions of employees as well as the deferred members of the pension scheme.  While the issues are interconnected, I believe they are so serious that they should have been considered separately instead of together.  The pensions issue will have a major impact.  For instance, people who are on deferred pensions maintain - I assume they are correct - that if a person were to go on a deferred pension now they would lose about 10% but if they went on a pension in three or four years' time they could lose half their pension.  A woman in my constituency was literally crying about losing half of a pension pot worth &euro;25,000.  Her husband is 61 and has a number of years to go before he reaches the age at which he will be able to avail of the pension.  This has huge implications for people in these circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52014070300009#H00300"><p>This is the most controversial part of the Bill, which will have an impact on the living standards of thousands of citizens in their retirement.  It is of major importance.  Like the other Deputies, I do not accept that the Minister's amendment addresses those concerns.  It is inappropriate to insert this amendment in this Bill.  While the Minister has attempted to address the issue of decisions being made unilaterally and without the consent of the employees, I would argue that some of the provisions that are there are there anyway.  The Minister is at pains to say that the problem is that, under the existing arrangements, the airport authorities have to replicate the IAS scheme.  What the Minister is saying, in effect, is that he does not want them to replicate the perceived benefits that employees thought they would get on their retirement.  That is precisely the problem.  There was a reasonable expectation because people paid into a scheme over their working lifetimes in respect of which there were commitments, over which there are now a question mark.  This is an attempt to corral them into accepting something less than what they thought they would get.  I wish to address some of the points the Minister made in that regard.<br />The Minister is absolutely correct to spend most of the time during his contribution dealing with where we are, the crisis as it is and the backdrop to it.  However, I do not think he has correctly identified the root of the problem.  If we are to come up with a solution, then we have to identify the problem that gave rise to it in the first place.  The Minister reiterated that in his opinion one of the key problems with the IAS scheme was what he called the lack of contributions by both sides, the employer's side and the workers' side.  I reject that from the point of view of the employees, as the level of contribution was set by an actuary and reviewed every couple of years, with the conclusion that it was sufficient to meet the benefits as defined by the rules of the scheme.  People paid into the scheme over decades.  Existing pensioners have suffered as the amount of their contributions increased sevenfold, but the employer's contribution decreased.  The decisions that the employers took placed a major strain on the scheme.  The people who are being asked to pay the price are the pensioners, the deferred pensioners and the active members.  They are still being asked to pay that price.  We should be quite cognisant of that, because it is not their fault.  I do not accept that they should be paying the price.<br />This is the one occupational pension scheme that we are dealing with in law in this way.  I think that is dodgy.  It is my opinion that if the present scheme wanted to cease contributions, which is one of the reasons given by the Minister, there is no reason a rule amendment could not have been implemented.  As things stand, there is a superannuation committee in the IAS, but the committee has been overruled by trustees.  The Minister could implement some of the things he would like to do without the need for legislation.  An issue that has been highlighted, and correctly so, is how the pension scheme got into its current position.  The Minister would have seen the articles in newspapers in the past about the very poor financial decisions made by the trustees in relation to the scheme.  There is a question mark over whether the deficit is in fact a deficit as has been made out.  That is the basis for justifying the legislation, but is it really what they say it is?  I am sure the Minister saw the article in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>last month which questioned the basis of the actuarial valuation in 2011.  Prior to 2011, the calculations for the funding of the scheme were based on the assumption that an average male in Aer Lingus was expected to live for 20 years and a female for 23 years after reaching the age of 65.</p> <p>In 2011, a couple of years later, it changed that and added an extra six years for both categories.  How was it arbitrarily decided that pensioners would live that number of years longer than had been anticipated three or four years before that?  The consequence of making that actuarial change was the addition of a &euro;400 million liability to the pension scheme.  Therefore, a multi-million euro problem was caused by an actuarial assessment rather than anything else.  In addition, the interest rate calculations used were quite low, which meant a higher liability and deficit expressed in monetary terms.  The article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, which summed it up well, stated<blockquote><br />In summary, the members of the Airlines' Pension Fund are faced with clear proposals to cut their benefits by between ten and fifty percent, which are based on nebulous assumptions about future liabilities, ill-advised asset allocations and a now questionable re-allocation of assets into bonds at historically low interest rates.</blockquote>It goes on state that 15,000 people and their families had an expectation which is threatened because of some of those decisions.  This is a serious issue.  It is not arbitrary assessments or calculations but financial decisions made by the trustees of the scheme that were at best bizarre and at worst, in some cases, of questionable motivation.  I mentioned some of them on Second Stage.  Decisions were made to dispose of the assets of the IASS.  In essence, its property portfolio was dumped at a time when commercial property prices were escalating and everybody knew it.  The five Dublin properties that it sold for &euro;58 million within less than ten months had already shot up in value by more than &euro;10 million compared to what they had been sold for previously, and the rental income was &euro;6 million per year.  Questions have been asked as to who are the beneficiaries of some of these decisions, and about some of the advisers.  The actuarial assessment that underlay some of these calculations was carried out by Mercer, and we know that the chairman of IASS trustee is also involved in Mercer.  That person also spent a long working career with Irish Life.  <br />Suddenly, a decision was made to divest the portfolio of its valuable assets for much less than their value at a time when those assets were escalating in value, and instead to invest that money in Irish Life.  Some &euro;800 million is tied up in incredibly low-yield investment in Irish Life.  It does not even make sense that they would make such a decision.  Why did they redirect cash from the sale of equities in commercial property to a low-yield fixed-income fund in Irish Life?  That is potentially costing the pensioners, and who will pay for that?  Our job should not be to amend legislation to make up for bad financial decisions made on the backs of pensioners.  Why did the pension fund sell a broad selection of property, an equity portfolio, and tie it up in this low-yield fund in Irish Life?  What is being proposed by the Minister arises out of that crisis.  The pensioners and deferred pensioners pay for that in their living standards.  <br />The Minister has said they will have to be consulted, but the mechanisms for consultation have not been yet been defined.  Much as been said about how deferred pensioners were affected, but the pensioner group is the most excluded in this entire process.  The expert panel told them it could not and would not talk to them.  There is not a single mention of the pensioners in the expert panel report.  Let us look at their contribution.  They are the only people who have had to put moneys up-front back into the IASS to make up the deficit.  They are losing about &euro;40 per week from next January, and almost the same again if the resolution to buy sovereign annuities is implemented, in addition to the cuts they have already taken.  <br />The Minister mentioned the amounts of money that Aer Lingus and the DAA have agreed to put into the scheme.  They have not actually agreed to fund the deficit.  There is no agreement to put money back into the IAS scheme.  They are not doing that.  It is clear from the expert panel report that they have agreed to set up separate individual funds to mitigate against future losses of active and deferred pensions.  The funds belong to the individuals covered by the scheme.  The 5,000 people already on a pension are excluded from this situation.  If we enshrine this problem in legislation we are doubly excluding them, because no fund is set up to mitigate the losses of the pensioners.  They are excluded and they are suffering.  There is nothing to stop the trustees from reducing pensions further if they continue with the disastrous investment policy on which they have embarked, which I think will continue for years.  The Minister's energy should be focused on addressing those issues, if we are to help the pensioners, rather than inserting a legislative provision that does not offer them a way out of the situation.  <br />Some of the amendments I have tabled concern the replication of existing clauses - for example, the clause to protect people's pensions and pension expectations when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs broke up.  There is a fundamental conflict here because the problem with the measures we are tabling is that we are trying to protect the benefits of members, whereas the Minister is trying to loosen things up in order to facilitate an erosion of those benefits.  The Minister should address some of the financial problems that got us into this situation in the first place.</p></speech>

The section allows people who are already paying into the scheme to cease doing so, if they so wish.  This is a real issue for people.  After the Dublin-Laois match a couple of weeks ago, I met a man from Swords, probably a constituent of Deputy Daly, whose major concern is that he has to pay a couple of hundred euro per month into this pension scheme even though he does not want to do that any more.  He wants this provision put into law as soon as possible so that he can keep that money for himself or put it into his own investments.  He was very realistic about the future of the IAS scheme and did not want to pay more money into it.  This is a very positive provision that I hope people can avail of sooner rather than later.</p><p>  The second issue is that the Bill allows the DAA to establish a pension scheme for its newer staff.  There are some 1,250 staff in DAA and also in Shannon, who are unusual in that they work in a State-run enterprise but do not have a pension scheme.  This legislation allows those companies to set up a pension scheme for their staff, which is a positive development.  They often get forgotten about in this debate.</p><p>  The third issue is that the Bill facilitates the resolution of the IAS scheme.  I understand the point has been made that we should wait until there is agreement and ballots have taken place and then legislate.  I do not agree with that approach.  We can use the opportunity now to do so.  I think it makes more sense to legislate first because there will be ballots of the shareholders of Aer Lingus, which will be a difficult ballot, ballots of the staff in the airports and in Aer Lingus, and there could even be a ballot of the members.  It makes more sense to me that before they ballot they know the legislation is in place and that what they are voting on can actually be implemented.  Many times, when it came to referendums, we published the legislation first so that people actually knew that what they were voting on could be done.  I think it makes much more sense to have the legislation and the legislative tools in place first for that reason.  We do not want people arguing against a solution on the basis that the legislation is not in place to implement it.  It makes sense to put the put the legislation in place beforehand on so that people have certainty that this can actually be done.  This is a problem that has existed for a long time.  There is now a window of opportunity to resolve this issue once and for all to give more than 10,000 people certainty about their pensions and their pension rights when they retire.  It gives the companies certainly about their future liabilities, which is also of particular value to the shareholders, who happen to be the Irish taxpayers.  They will now have certainty about this too.</p> <p><b></b>Deputy Daly is correct that we have a fundamental disagreement.  It is my view and the view of most of those involved in this that the IAS scheme is unsustainable and that the only way to go now is to freeze and de-risk it and establish new sustainable schemes for the staff in the airports and in Aer Lingus.  Deputy Daly's view is different and it is that we should try to rehabilitate the scheme or create a new scheme similar to the old scheme which did not work.  That is the fundamental disagreement and I doubt we will convince each other on the issue.<br />In regard to the investment decisions made by the trustees, I am not a pensions or investment expert and I am, therefore, limited in what I can say on that.  I am sure the trustee believed the decisions made were correct and it is up to him to defend them.  It is standard with pension funds that when one moves from property and equities to bonds, one does so because one wants to remove the risk.  It is acknowledged that the return is lower, but the move is made in order to minimise risk.  In the case of personal pension funds, people tend in the earlier part of their working lives to invest in equities and properties that might rise quickly, but as they approach retirement, they move into low-yield bonds because these have a lower risk.  I imagine the motivation in the case of this scheme was to remove the risk, although the yield would be lower.<br />In general, deficits are calculated using the minimum funding standard.  The OECD conducted an interesting report on the minimum funding standard in Ireland and determined that if anything, we may underestimate our deficits.  If, for example, we used the German standard for calculating pension deficits, we would have bigger pension deficits.  I have heard the argument that we are overestimating our pension deficits trotted out a few times.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Resources and I are interested in this and we met the pensions regulator to go through this issue to see how the deficit is calculated.  The OECD looked at comparisons of how other countries do it and, if anything, we are on the side of underestimating deficits in comparison with other countries.  I assume whatever calculation was used to calculate the deficit of the IAS scheme used the minimum funding standard, but I am not certain about that.<br />Looking at pension funds in other State-owned enterprises, they usually project life expectancy to be approximately 89 or 90.  I do not know what age is used for the IAS scheme, but 89 or 90 is fairly standard for semi-State bodies and State-owned enterprises and the type of fund needed is calculated based on this.  Perhaps people will not live that long as life expectancy now is approximately 86 years.  However, over time people have tended to live longer.  While life expectancy has not increased in the past five years, it had been increasing up until then.  Therefore, it makes sense to assume people will continue to live longer and that people now in their 30s or 40s may live into their 90s.</p></speech>

Many of these concerns have been allayed by the amendments put forward by the Minister on Committee Stage and I welcome those.  Unlike Deputy Dooley, I believe there is a need for this Bill and that we need to deal with the separation of Shannon Airport legally.  However, I share his view and that of Deputy Ellis that we do not need to deal with the pensions issue now.</p><p>  To me, the Minister seems to be a bit like a market trader, where he has a few nice apples he wants to get rid of, but has a couple of not so nice apples he also wants to get rid of, so that when someone comes in to buy a bag of apples, he sticks in one or two the person would not choose.  I see no need for the pensions issue to be dealt with now when the urgent issue is the separation of Shannon Airport.  I accept the analogy regarding the referendum, that when people vote they know exactly what they are voting for.  However, there have been referenda where people welcomed in principle the concept being proposed by the Government, but rejected it because of the detail published in the Bill.  The referendum on committees is the most recent example of this and it is slightly ironic that we are sitting in Committee to discuss this issue.</p><p>  On pensions in general, are pension rights part of working conditions?  Former workers in Shannon Development have a guarantee in section 18 of this Bill that the transfer of ownership shall not operate to worsen the scales of pay and conditions of service applicable to the staff of those companies immediately before the Shannon Airport transfer.  This is of limited comfort to them, as there is no similar guarantee with regard to pensions.  Unfortunately, there is precedent in this regard.  In 1968, when staff were assigned to Aer Rianta from the Department of Transport and Power, under official notice 4/68 they were guaranteed that accepting the transfer to Aer Rianta would not in any case involve any worsening of conditions of employment.  While there was no worsening of conditions of employment, there was a worsening of pension rights.</p><p>  For example, in the case of the officials here with the Minister, presuming they are officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, when they retire, their pensions are linked to the pay of those in the positions.  However, in the case of workers in Aer Rianta, their pension was no longer linked to those in the positions they held previously but was a defined benefit scheme.  Of course, nowadays a defined benefit scheme looks very attractive relative to what is on offer with a defined contribution scheme, but nevertheless it was a lessening of pension rights for these workers.  This is something the Minister should address, particularly in regard to Shannon Development workers.  He should guarantee they will not be any worse off than they were, not just in regard to the conditions of service, but also explicitly to pension rights.</p><p>  If the Minister wanted to right a wrong of the past, he might want to look back as far as 1968.  I know he has had correspondence from some people who have pointed out the situation.  The Department seems to have formed the view that the Dublin Airport Authority, formerly Aer Rianta, has complied with its obligations with regard to pension entitlements with regard to the terms agreed at the time these workers accepted a contract of employment with Aer Rianta back in the 1970s.  However, this flies in the face of what was in a circular in 1968 and what some of the Minister's predecessors would have said in the D&aacute;il in 1973.</p><p>  Turning to more specific issues, I have looked in detail at the proposed amended section 32.  The Minister proposes to substitute this for section 32 of the 1998 Act, which was in turn amended by the 2004 Act.  There is nothing new in this proposed section 32.</p> <p>I speak of the provisions that are to be taken out, sections 13 to 15, inclusive.  Now that those provisions are to be taken out there is nothing in section 32 that was not previously in the former section 32.  Even from a draftsman's perspective of the Statute Book, I wonder why this is being done.</p><p> The proposed sections 32A and 32B relate to the discussion, or dispute, that was described in detail.  I do not see why these issues must be dealt with in the context of the formal separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority.  It was mentioned that discussions are ongoing and I think all Deputies hope they will be successful.  The discussions must be genuine and inclusive and must include deferred pensioners who feel they have been excluded up to now.  They have a legitimate concern in the outcome of discussions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-03a.1246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52014070300012#L00200"><p>I wish to respond to remarks made by the Minister.  I fully appreciate how my constituent feels and his desire to cease contributions to the scheme.  I make contributions to the same scheme and am fully aware that at the moment it is a black hole for active members.  It has been so mishandled to this point that at the moment we would not receive back what we have put in, never mind what the company put in.</p><p>  The necessity of this legislation in allowing workers to cease contributions has not been explained.  There is no reason a rule amendment could not be implemented using the existing structures of the Irish aviation superannuation scheme without legislative change.  Legislation is not needed to allow workers cease their contributions.</p><p>  The need for a freeze and de-risk strategy to save the scheme was raised by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, as if this points the way forward in giving certainty to workers and pensioners.  What sort of certainty does this provide?  The only certainty facing pensioners at the moment is that they will be &euro;40 per month worse off from January.  If the freeze and de-risk strategy continues and the predicted returns ensue, pensions will be cut further.  There is no fund to mitigate losses for pensioners and nothing to stop trustees from introducing further cuts, so I do not think this is the kind of certainty people need.</p><p>  The Minister said certain investment decisions were made on the schemes to remove risk but the facts do not back this up.  Serious analysis of the financial elements of this scheme is required.  Some &euro;667 million of equities were disposed of at a time when equity prices were rising and this is not a strategy to lower risk; it is lunacy.  There was a prime property portfolio in Dublin that could not be acquired now, such was its value.  It included properties such as the Passport Office on Molesworth Street.  This property was sold at a very poor price for Aer Lingus shareholders, although it was great for those buying it.  Those involved in buying the properties included organisations like Jones Lang LaSalle that operated as property advisers and selling agents to the IASS and gave valuations to buyers.  Jones Lang LaSalle occupies offices that will be redeveloped in that building.  Is this not strange?</p><p>  The trustee who decided to shore up &euro;1.4 billion of money belonging to pensioners from Aer Lingus, the DAA and other airport authorities in an Irish Life fixed income fund with a minuscule return worked in Irish Life for 30 years.  Is this not strange?  I find it strange because the average return on this is 1.27% per year and an annual management fee reduces this further.  This has tied up pensioners' funds and contributed to a huge risk.  Remaining assets have been invested in sovereign bonds and this is also a problem because the 15 year return on those is actually negative, that is to say, money is being lost on this investment.  According to EU statements last week, interest rates will remain low for some years and this means bond returns will remain low too.  Meanwhile commercial properties have risen in value and these have been divested.  The freeze and de-risk strategy has accumulated massive losses that endanger the living standards of pensioners.  It does not give certainty and nor does this Bill.</p><p>  I think the issues I have raised are worthy of a separate investigation.  People want to know whether the &euro;800 million invested at Irish Life is insured and what return it got in 2013.  Does the Department know the annual management fees on that fund?  These issues are the real reason for the funding crisis.  It was stated that the scheme was unsustainable but I do not believe this.  I believe very poor decisions, especially those made by the two employers remaining in the scheme, have contributed to this problem.  People were allowed to exit and this increased the strain, along with an insufficient employer contribution.  The workers are paying the price.</p><p>  The Minister said this legislation is required to allow those who are currently not in a pension scheme and are employed by the DAA and Shannon Airport to join a pension scheme.  I do not think the legislation is necessary for that purpose.  The Aer Lingus pension scheme for new employees involved the formation of a new company, Aer Lingus (Ireland), and the new employees are now members of a defined contribution scheme.  The reason new staff in the airport authorities are not in a scheme is a decision was made not to allow them do so.  There is no legislative impediment but a decision was made to deny them the benefits of a defined benefit scheme.  They could, like Aer Lingus, set up a new scheme for new employees but what has this to do with existing members of the IASS?  This amendment relates to members of the IASS.  A new scheme could be set up for those who are not members of the IASS.  Legislation allowing for a new DAA (Ireland) or SAA (Ireland) need not impact on the IASS.</p></speech>

One of the provisions that is restated but was always there has affected Aer Rianta international staff.  The provision I speak of says every scheme to which subsection (1) relates shall fix the time and conditions of retirement for all persons to or in respect of whom superannuation benefits are payable under the scheme.  Aer Rianta International is now part of the Dublin Airport Authority and it has gradually moved to Dublin Airport since the 2004 Act.  It now recruits in Dublin, rather than Shannon, but some members of staff are still based in Shannon.  They fear how this could be used, although I do not sense a conspiracy.</p> <p>The provision is already included in section 32, but their fear is that it could be used to fix their retirement age and benefits or incentivise them to leave their employment at Shannon.  There seems to be movement within Aer Rianta International to transfer as many operations as possible from Shannon to Dublin.  Will the Minister give them some comfort or allay their fears?</p></speech>

It also seeks to have such an appeals mechanism established by regulations that would outline the manner by which representatives of deferred members would be selected and recognised for the purposes of appeals.  It is sensible to make that request and include it in the Bill by way of an amendment, especially if the Minister agrees that there has to be an appeals mechanism.  I ask him to consider it.</p></speech>

Regarding a comment made by Deputy Michael McNamara, lest there be any doubt, I do not have an objection to the passage of the Bill, but, like him, I do have an objection to section 34 which I do not believe is necessary or wise at a time when we do not have clarity on a final resolution of this protracted issue.</p><p>  The Minister said he had met somebody coming out from a match who was indicative of a certain cohort of people who would like to have the opportunity not to contribute to the pension fund.  It was the wish of almost all parties in the House that we try to encourage people to remain within pension funds to cater for a time after work; I would not have thought, therefore, that we would be trying to facilitate their exit from or non-participation in a scheme.  Those people in society who have private health insurance often wonder what the benefit is.  I do not want to speak for the individual whom the Minister met coming out from the match, but the people I meet who find it difficult to continue to make contributions are looking at it in terms of what is in it for them.  If they were to see a more proactive approach by the Government to try to resolve the issues with the pension fund, they would be minded to remain within the fray, so to speak, of a private pension scheme.  Those under the age of 30 years and some under 40 often do not see the benefit of contributing to a pension scheme, but as we all progress through life, we start to focus on the benefits.  I would not like to think we are legislating to facilitate somebody's exit from a scheme but rather that we are trying to find a way to encourage him or her in that regard.</p><p>  The Minister went on to say the provisions set out facilitated the 1,200 people at Dublin and Shannon who did not have a pension scheme.  I do not object in principle to addressing that issue and take Deputy Clare Daly's point that the Minister may not need legislation to provide for those who do not currently benefit from a pension scheme.  If he were to bring forward an amendment to that effect, I would support the section.</p><p>  The essence of my amendment in opposing the section is based on the serious impact on the lifestyles of those still employed within the respective companies, those who have deferred pensions and those who have retired.  I set out in the early stages what I saw as the reduction in the pension entitlements of those individuals that in the late 1960s transferred across from the Civil Service to the airport company and in doing so identified the figures for the Minister.  One individual is on a pension of &euro;24,000, another on &euro;16,000.  I gave these figures as examples to address the question of the loss to those who believed they had a natural entitlement to the same terms and conditions.  It also indicates the poor pension entitlements of many of the people who have since retired.  We can see that their pensions are relatively low and there is provision for further reductions based on what may emanate from the talks.  </p><p>  It is ludicrous to expect us to support the provisions in this legislation - I refer only to the provisions relating to the current pension fund, not the people who are not facilitated by having a pension scheme - in advance of knowing what the final deal is.  We are not serving our constituents well if we seek to provide what might be referred to as enabling legislation when potentially we are close to a decision being taken or a resolution being brought forward.  I urge the Minister to withdraw his amendment, to accept our proposal to delete the section from the Bill, to allow every other provision to proceed and to be prepared to come back with what might even be largely the same legislation which we could debate in the fullness of time when we have all of the facts.</p></speech>

What has arisen is a ballot by staff who wanted to be able to withdraw their contributions because they did not want to continue paying money into a black hole, as Deputy Clare Daly described it.  It is not that we do not want people to invest in their own pensions.</p><p>  I understand that for a rule amendment to be made to the scheme the agreement of all members is required.  Essentially, a small number of members can veto a rule amendment.  That is the reason legislation is required on that point.</p><p>  On the 1968 issue raised by Deputy Timmy Dooley, I have reviewed the papers.  The issue was examined in great depth at the time by the former Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey, with advice from the Attorney General which stands.  When the people concerned signed contracts with Aer Rianta, they moved from being Civil Servants to being employees of Aer Rianta and did not carry pension rights with them.</p><p>  On investment decisions and so on, to the best of my knowledge, the Department does not have in-depth details of the investment decisions made by the trustees.  We are not members of and are not party to the funds.  We do not have that type of information.  </p><p>  The key difference between the new section and the old one is the removal of the provision to allow the employers to involuntarily remove staff from the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IAS, and place them with new pension funds.  That is the main difference between the old and the new sections.  We are removing that provision-----</p></speech>

The section passed by the Seanad contained a provision to allow the employers to involuntarily remove staff from the IAS and include them in a new scheme.  That provision is being dropped by this amendment.</p><p>  On the 1,250 staff who do not have access to a pension scheme, it probably is the case that there are potential dissolutions.  The Deputy is correct that their employment could be moved to a new company; that a new company could be set up.  It would be a cumbersome way of solving the problem, but that is probably the case, or we could do it by a separate amendment.  That amendment is not on the table, but, technically, the Deputy is correct in that regard.</p><p>  When it comes to the pensioners, under the Pensions Act there is a limit to the amount by which a pension can be reduced for someone who is drawing a pension.  It allows for no reduction in any pension less than &euro;12,000, a maximum reduction of 10% in a pension between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000 and 20% in the case of pensions above that amount.  It is not provided for in the Pensions Act that there can be a greater reduction in anyone's pension.</p> <p> Deputy McNamara asked about ARI scheme.  Section 34 does not have any implications for the ARI's existing defined contribution scheme.  Allowing the DAA and SAA to establish their new pension schemes for their staff will not affect the existing pension arrangements for the ARI staff.  I am happy to give that assurance.</p></speech>

Any proposal by the DAA to amend that scheme - we are not aware of any - would require ministerial approval under section 32(6).  That is nothing new.  It is not envisaged.</p><p>  With regard to Shannon Development, it is important to bear in mind that Shannon Airport Authority staff will remain as Shannon Airport Authority staff, and the staff in Shannon Development will remain as Shannon Development staff under a new name, Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited.</p><p>  It is actually quite different from what would have happened with P&amp;T or even ARI.  The staff are actually staying as employees of their existing employer.  It does not arise that we could have a repeat of the circumstances of 1968.</p><p>  On the appeals mechanism, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  It is a matter for national pensions policy than for one pension fund.  Under trust law, trustees are required to treat all classes of member fairly.  It is important to understand that within the IAS scheme, trustees are treating active and deferred members in exactly the same manner in the restructuring of their past service benefits.  However, to the extend that any member believes the trustees have treated them unfairly, they obviously have the right of recourse through the courts.  In addition, members of any pension scheme have recourse to the Pensions Ombudsman under section 131 of the Pensions Act.  The Pensions Ombudsman can be asked to rule on complaints by members, including deferred members that they have suffered financial loss occasioned by an act of maladministration by the trustee or be any dispute of fact or law that arises in relation to an act done by the trustee.  As far as I am concerned, therefore, an appeals mechanism already exists, either through the courts or Pensions Ombudsman.</p></speech>

My clear understanding of it is that, under the existing rules, the only people with power of veto are the employers.  The employer actually can veto any rule changes.  The idea that one has to get absolutely every other member, apart from the employer, does not fit with the rules as they stand.  I refer to circumstances where one person would be obstructing the whole process.  If one examines the recent rules changes that were proposed, one notes the superannuation committee of the IAS scheme, which as a role in terms of both the trustees and the rules of the scheme, was ignored in discussions on rule changes that took place recently.  I understand this legislation would undermine its role even more.  Ironically, the committee comprises four representatives of the active group, the deferred pensioners and pensioners, and currently elections are under way in respect of the system.  When we talk about consulting people and hearing their voice, we should note this is the first time where they have had only one nomination for membership of the scheme.  Such is the demoralisation that has been occurring in this regard.</p><p>  I am glad the Minister accepts the point that this legislation is not necessary for airport authority workers to go into a new pension scheme.  That is separate.  Our concern is not about that.  I, too, would contend a worse pension scheme is better than none.  If the proposal were just to set up a lesser pension scheme for new staff, I might have an objection, but it would still be better than nothing.  The problem is that the Minister is interfering with the arrangement for existing members of the IAS scheme.</p><p>  My last point is on the pensioner group.  It is not a comfort to say there is a limit to how much they can be cut and that they should not really worry about it too much.  The reality is that the group has taken many income cuts.  The group is the only one that paid in full for an unco-ordinated pension.  Some paid over 45 years, with seven increases in the contributions.  They, more than anybody, can say their paying gave them a reasonable expectation of an outcome.  It is now being eroded.  That there is a floor applying to the extent to which they can be cut is not really a comfort.  We must be very cognisant of that.  </p><p>  In essence, the Minister said the ceasing of contributions is not really necessary.  I have not been shown definitively that this cannot be done by a rule change.  New members do not constitute a reason.  Therefore, I do not believe there is any valid basis for this at all.  We would be much better off leaving it out.</p><p>  The Minister said he was not aware of the financial ramifications or details of the investment decisions of the fund, which is fine, but it is a matter of the public record now.  Some of the information has appeared in the national press.  It is of a very serious character.  Would the Department be interested in equipping itself with better knowledge as to some of these decisions, which are, at best, bizarre?</p></speech>

With regard to providing a pension fund for new airport workers, the legislation is necessary to provide an alternative pension fund for the new airport workers.  I accept there are other ways it could be done, for example by a different amendment on Report Stage or some convoluted means of moving people to the employment of a different company.  This is the only amendment on the table today to allow this.</p><p>  The operation of pension funds, etc., is not my Department's remit.  The Department of Social Protection is responsible for pensions policy.  The Pensions Authority and Pensions Ombudsman are responsible for complaints and regulation.  My Department does not want to get involved in the intricate detail of any pension fund not under its remit.  It is within the remit of other bodies.</p></speech>

The intention was to address the funding position of the Irish Aviation Authority scheme in the event of its being wound up.  My view, which other Deputies share, is that there should be a provision to ensure that until it has reached a minimum of 90% funding, there should not be the capacity to eliminate it or close it.  For that reason, we are disappointed that the section that deals with it, largely section 34, did not have the capacity to address this important factor.  We were concerned that there was the capacity to close the pension scheme with a funding standard of less than 90%, which would have a detrimental impact on all those who participate in the scheme, including employees, retirees or deferred pensioners.  The amendment would have been an appropriate way, in advance of any solution coming forward to the negotiation that took place, to put such provisions in the legislation rather than what we have discussed.  I am disappointed the section is proceeding as it is.  It looks like there is no plan by the Department, Minister or Government to address this important matter.</p></speech>

I elaborated on how a healthy company should be defined.  Companies should not be allowed to close their pension schemes.  Certain standards should be in place.  In this case we are specifying a standard of 90% funding, which is reasonable.  In section 2, I defined a healthy company as one which has positive net revenues or whose parent company has positive net revenues, and it was fair to include it.  Maybe the Minister could take on board our suggestion regarding a company being viable.</p> <p>I am not sure the Minister would be greatly opposed to the gist of the amendments.</p></speech>

Some remain within enterprises that remain operational.  For example, some of the job creation activity performed by the company is largely similar to the work carried out by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and the staff doing this work transferred to these agencies when the functions transferred across.  My understanding was that all employees in these areas would find appropriate postilions in the entities taking over their responsibilities.  I further understand there are at least two employees who are still in the employ of Shannon Development and who I assume will transfer, as set out in the transfer agreement of rights and obligations to the Shannon commercial enterprises, but who have no active role to play where they currently reside.  I seek clarity on this issue.  What is the intention in dealing with these two individuals?</p></speech>

This effort will also include seeking secondment opportunities with Shannon Development continuing to pay their wages.</p></speech>

It is intended to combat the increasing instances of persons using a laser to dazzle or attempt to dazzle a pilot of an aircraft, in particular.  By making it a serious offence and providing for substantial penalties, including imprisonment, people will think twice before engaging in such irresponsible behaviour which could have potentially catastrophic consequences.  Occasionally, outdoor laser light shows associated with concerts or similar public events can constitute a hazard to aircraft.  That is why the section provides for more substantial financial penalties to be applied to corporate bodies.  This is a technical amendment to remove the reference to &quot;prison term for a body corporate&quot; because it is not possible to send a corporation to prison.  The intention was to make a corporate body liable for a fine of up to &euro;250,000 only, but I am removing the reference to imprisonment.</p></speech>

(1) An authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation, or the security or safety, of an airport, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property at an airport, may do all or any of the following things:(a) stop a person at the airport;<br />(b) require a person at the airport to&mdash;<blockquote><blockquote>(i) give his or her name and address and to produce for inspection other evidence of his or her identity,<br />(ii) where he or she is driving or in control of a mechanically propelled vehicle (within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1961), produce his or her driving licence or learner permit (within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1961) for inspection,<br />(iii) state the purpose of his or her being at the airport, or<br />(iv) account for any baggage or other property which may be in his or her possession;</blockquote></blockquote>(c) require a person&mdash;<blockquote><blockquote>(i) who refuses to produce for inspection other evidence of his or her identity, or, if he or she is driving or in control of a mechanically propelled vehicle, to produce for inspection his or her driving licence or learner permit,<br />(ii) who refuses to state the purpose of his or her being at the airport,<br />(iii) who refuses to account for any baggage or other property in his or her possession,<br />(iv) who gives a name or address or states a purpose of his or her being at the airport which is known, or is reasonably suspected, by the authorised officer to be false or fictitious, or<br />(v) whom he or she knows not to have, or whom he or she reasonably suspects of not having, a lawful reason for being at the airport, to leave the airport, or any part of it, or he or she may remove (using reasonable force) such person from the airport, or any part of it, or he or she may arrest that person without warrant;</blockquote></blockquote>(d) arrest without warrant a person&mdash;<blockquote><blockquote>(i) who assaults, or whom he or she reasonably suspects to have assaulted, another person at an airport,<br />(ii) who commits, or whom he or she knows to have, or whom he or she reasonably suspects of having committed an offence under&mdash;<blockquote>(I) section 2A (inserted by section 65 of the Act of 1998) of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1973,<br />(II) section 29 (in relation to a contravention of section 19), 41 or 43 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988,<br />(III) section 47, 48, 49, 50 or 51 of the Act of 1998, or <br />(IV) section 44 of this Act,</blockquote>(iii) who commits or whom he or she reasonably suspects to have committed an offence under section 15(9) of the Act of 2004 in respect of a contravention of bye-laws made under subsection (3)(a), (c), (d), (e) or (g) of that section insofar as the alleged offence relates to the safety or security of the airport, airside operations or aircraft or persons using the airport, or<br />(iv) whom he or she knows to have, or reasonably suspects of having, a stolen article in his or her possession.</blockquote></blockquote>(2) Where an authorised officer, who is not a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, arrests a person under this section, he or she shall, as soon as is practicable, deliver the person into the custody of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be dealt with in accordance with law.<br />(3) Where a person is arrested under this section the person shall be taken by the member to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station and may be detained there or arrested and detained there in accordance with section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 and, accordingly, the reference in <i>subsection (2)</i>(inserted by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006) of that section to &ldquo;an offence to which this section applies&rdquo; is to be read as including a reference to an offence referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>.<br />(4) Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that there is evidence on a person or in a vehicle of an offence committed under the Airports and <i>Aviation Acts 1936 to 2014 </i>or that a stolen article is in the possession of a person or is in a vehicle, the officer may without warrant&mdash;(a) search or cause to be searched the person and, if the officer considers it necessary, detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary to carry out the search,<br />(b) search or cause to be searched the vehicle and for the purpose of carrying out the search, if the officer thinks fit, require the person in control of the vehicle to bring it to a stop and when stopped to refrain from moving it or, where the vehicle is already stationary, to refrain from moving it, or<br />(c) seize and retain or cause to be seized and retained anything found in the course of a search under this subsection which any such officer reasonably suspects to be something which might be required as evidence in proceedings for such an offence or to be a stolen article.(5) Where an authorised officer decides to search or cause to be searched a person under <i>subsection (4)</i>, the officer may require the person to accompany that officer to a place for the purpose of being so searched.<br />(6) An authorised officer may stop a vehicle at an airport and may require it to be moved for inspection to such place as he or she directs.<br />(7) Where an authorised officer arrests a person pursuant to the powers conferred on him or her by <i>subsection (1)(d)(iv)</i>, he or she may retain in his or her possession any article which he or she knows to have been, or reasonably suspects of having been, stolen until it has been established whether or not the article was stolen. <br />(8) A person who was required by an authorised officer to leave an airport or part of an airport, or who was removed from an airport or part of an airport by an authorised officer, shall not, on the same day, without the permission of an authorised officer, return to the airport or the part of the airport which he or she was ordered to leave, or from which he or she was removed, as the case may be.<br />(9) Any person who obstructs, impedes or assaults an authorised officer in the exercise of any of the powers conferred on him or her by this section, or who fails to comply with any lawful requirement of an authorised officer under this section, commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction&mdash;(a) in case the officer is obstructed or impeded, to a class C fine, or <br />(b) in case the officer is assaulted, to a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.(10) A person appointed as an authorised officer under section 48 of the Act of 1998 may be appointed as an authorised officer generally for the purposes of the <i>Airports and Aviation Acts 1936 to 2014</i>or for specified purposes.<br />(11) Sections 33, 42 and 48 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988 are repealed.&rdquo;. </blockquote>The purpose of the section is to update and restate the powers of authorised officers at airports.  Under the Airports Acts, authorised officers are members of the Garda and persons appointed by the airport authority such as the airport police.  The powers of authorised officers were set out in several Acts between 1973 and 2004.  Some of the language used in them does not reflect modern usage and needs to be updated.</p></speech>
