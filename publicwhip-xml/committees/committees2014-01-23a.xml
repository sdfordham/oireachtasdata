For the record, it is No. 3A.4 from Mr. Paul Maloney on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA.  When it attended our hearings, one of the issues that we considered related to the credit card.  It is paragraph 8 in the documentation.  However, it now appears that he did not have a credit card.  He did not have access to the records for almost five years.  If we wished to send them to him for comment, he would be pleased to reply.  We should follow up this matter of credit card expenses with correspondence.</p></speech>

Following the meeting, we sought papers from the three bodies concerned.  The key points are that, in August, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approved &euro;15,000 as an appropriate amount for removal expenses.  In November, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht wrote to the gallery agreeing to sanction &euro;20,000.  By the time the National Gallery wrote to the individual concerned with the offer, the amount had increased to &euro;40,000.  There is a conflict in the papers.  I suggest that we refer this note to the three bodies and ask them for a comment for next week.  After that, we can include the matter in a report.</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and visitors in the Public Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  A number of complaints were made to the committee following its previous and other meetings in relation to interference from mobile phones with the sound quality of the transmission of those meetings.  The clerk has also received complaints from the public on the issue.  I ask members and witnesses to remove their phones from the desks and to ensure they are switched off.</p><p>  Before we begin, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the provisions within Standing Order 163 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  </p><p>  I welcome the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and invite him to introduce his officials.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014012300004#C00400"><p>As members of the committee will be aware members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may issue a fixed charged notice to the drivers or owners of vehicles for certain road traffic offences.  These include offences committed while driving, such as speeding or driving while using a mobile phone and compliance offences such as illegal parking and failure to display an up-to-date motor tax disc.  The penalty associated with a fixed charge notice is a fine or, for most offences committed while driving, a fine and the attachment of penalty points to the driver's licence.</p><p>  One of the key objectives of the fixed charge notice system is to contribute to safer driving and reduced road accident casualties.  Most drivers and vehicle owners usually comply voluntarily with the relevant laws.  Unfortunately, some drivers may only act in a compliant manner if they perceive that there is a reasonable probability that they will be detected if they commit an offence and that such detections will result in the imposition and enforcement of significant penalties.  A perceived low probability of detection or perceived widespread failure to impose penalties following detection could result in increased frequency of commission of offences.  Any widespread perception of arbitrary or partial application of enforcement of the law by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could undermine the deterrent effect and public acceptance of the system.  </p><p>  My office has previously examined and reported on three occasions on the system of control applied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the fixed charge notice system or its predecessor, the OA-the-spot fine system.  In July 2012, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contacted my office seeking a meeting to discuss concerns he had about the current operation of the fixed charge notice system.  The individual alleged that in many cases fixed charge notices had been cancelled corruptly and illegally.  It was also alleged that a number of persons who had benefited from one or more cancellations of fixed charge notices for speeding or dangerous driving had subsequently committed similar offences or resulting in some cases in deaths or injury to themselves or third parties.  </p><p>  The information presented to us appeared to indicate that matters reported in previous reports had not resulted in improved or sufficiently improved control systems within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  For this reason, I initiated an examination by staff of my office of the fixed charge notice system.  Examinations by my office generally focus on the adequacy of systems, procedures and practices implemented by the bodies audited by me.  Other than to record relevant facts about the actions of individuals, I do not have the remit to investigate or report on the behaviour or motivation of individuals.  Accordingly, the examination undertaken by my office did not seek to address the allegations of corruption and illegality on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or of alleged offences committed by members of the public.  That is the background to the examination.</p><p>  I will now deal with the report findings.  I draw the committee's attention to paragraph 7.11 of the report which summarises the results of our analysis of the fixed charge notice data for 2011 and 2012.  The results are expressed in terms of the percentage of detected cases where a decision was made to initiate a fixed charge notice.  The available evidence indicates that where a notice was initiated two out of every three drivers paid their fine within the specified time.  Where relevant, penalty points were added to their licence record.  In a further 10% of cases, the fine was not paid in a timely manner and the recipients of the notices had their cases determined in court.  I should point out that the examination did not include a review of those cases that are determined in court.  </p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has adopted a clearly stated policy in relation to the termination or cancellation of fixed charge notice cases.  This is set out in the force's manual for the system.  The policy requires termination in certain cases where statutory exemptions are provided for subject to specified conditions being satisfied.  This includes, for example, emergency response vehicles detected speeding by speed cameras.  The policy also specifies a number of exceptional situations where relevant Garda district officers may use their discretion and terminate a case if relevant facts are established.  While the policy is clear, we found that the operation of the fixed charge processing system did not accord with the termination policy in certain key respects.  In particular, the system allowed cases to be terminated on additional unspecified discretionary grounds over and above the exceptional circumstances specified in the policy statement.</p> <p>Also, senior officers who had the facility to terminate cases on the processing system were not restricted to doing so only for cases within their district or unit.</p><p> There is also evidence that the policy on termination of cases is not being applied consistently.  The rates of termination in many districts appeared too high to be considered reflective of exceptional circumstances ranging, for example, from 0.1% of cases initiated in Birr district to over 5% in Ennis, Roscommon and Sligo districts.  That is more than 50 times higher than in Birr.  In the samples reviewed for this examination, a significant proportion of cases appear to have been terminated in circumstances that do not satisfy the stated policy.  Absent and inadequate records and the recorded facts of many cases give rise to concerns that many cases have been terminated without due cause.  Furthermore, there are grounds for concern that certain outside district cases may have been terminated without appropriate authority.</p><p> Almost one-third of fixed charge notice cases are initiated by garda&iacute; who intercept motorists and record details of offences on notepad forms.  The design of the control system for the notepads potentially allows for effective control of the forms, but this was not achieved in a significant proportion of cases because over 7% of the notepad forms are not accounted for.  As notepad users were not required in practice to account for every form, this created scope for effective cancellation of fixed charge notices subsequent to initiation outside of the formal notice cancellation procedure and without the appropriate controls.  A related issue is that a significant number of the 3,000 cases which became statute barred in 2011 and 2012 was due to late entry of data from notepads and hand-held devices onto the processing system.</p><p> Over 21% of fixed charge notices in 2011 and 2012 did not result in timely payment and resulted in the issuing of a summons for service by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We found that more than half of the summonses issued in 2011 cases were not served, leading to the cases being struck out in court.  As a result, one in nine detected fixed charge notice offences was unpaid but did not result in a court hearing.</p><p> Members may also wish to note that in a previous report in 2003 we reported that there was an impediment in the fixed charge processing system that resulted in an inability to take appropriate action against drivers of company cars.  In this report, we note that 1.2% of 2011 and 2012 cases were not pursued because the notice was issued to a company and the company did not identify the driver.  We also found that approximately 600 vehicles had three or more terminations of notices in the two years examined.</p><p> Overall, the examination concluded that, because of significant weaknesses in aspects of the operation of the fixed charge notice system, a substantial proportion of detected offenders, up to one in five, did not pay their fines and did not end up in court.  In my view, those operational weaknesses must be addressed urgently by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant agencies to underpin the effectiveness of the system and ensure fairness and continued public confidence in, and acceptance of, the fixed charge notice system.  I have made a number of recommendations in my report aimed at addressing the key control weaknesses identified in this examination.  The Garda Commissioner has indicated that he accepts those recommendations and I understand he has provided the committee with an update on progress in their implementation.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General found that the termination rate was approximately 5% and the O'Mahoney report found that it was 4.55%.  Both reports have identified issues within the fixed charge processing system that require corrective action and I fully accept and am fully committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on improving the system and how it interacts with the Courts Service and the driver licensing system.<br />In the last number of months, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented a significant number of measures relating to the fixed charge processing system, which I will outline below and in more detail in the briefing document provided to the committee.  With reference to the findings of the O'Mahoney report, disciplinary action has been taken against a small number of personnel and written advices have been issued to a further number as to the necessity to conduct matters within policies and procedures.  On 30 August 2013, I issued a new directive to all members of the force in respect of the cancellation of fixed charge notices.  This new directive will, I believe, provide greater clarity on the role of the cancelling authority and thereby enhance the procedures for cancellation.  The new directive, which was issued prior to the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, reflects recommendations contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the report from the Garda professional standards unit and the report from Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney.<br />In addition, all policies and procedures associated with the general management of the fixed charge penalty system, FCPS, have been revised through an updated FCPS user manual.  This manual has been forwarded to the Garda Inspectorate and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for their observations.  When this review has been completed, a summary of the policies relevant to the general public will be made available via our website <i>www.garda.ie</i>and our social media channels.<br />Before dealing with specifics, it might be useful to give a broad overview of the fixed charge processing system which may help to contextualise the relevant issues.  It is important to state at the outset that fixed charge penalty notices, FCPNs, were introduced in legislation to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with one of a range of measures to tackle and reduce poor and dangerous driver behaviour, not as a revenue generation measure.  FCPNs play an important role in reducing road fatalities and that is their primary objective, not providing revenue to the State.  The fixed charge processing system was introduced in 2002.  The legislation provides that where a person is believed to have committed a fixed charge offence, the person may be served with a fixed charge notice and if the fixed charge is paid in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, proceedings will not be instituted.<br />Prosecution follows non-payment of the fixed charge.  A prosecution in respect of an alleged fixed charge offence will not be instituted if a payment is made during the appropriate period so specified in regard to the payment; in effect, a motorist issued with a FCPN is being put on notice that he or she may be prosecuted.  However, the motorist may avoid prosecution by electing to pay a fixed charge.  Therefore, the FCPS provides a motorist with an alternative to prosecution.  While the issuing of a fixed charge notice does not constitute commencement of legal proceedings, the issuing of a notice can, in effect, lead to a prosecution if the fixed charge is not paid.<br />The only other mechanism for the prevention of a prosecution when a fixed charge notice is not paid is to have the FCPN terminated.  Every fixed charge notice carries contact information for the fixed charge processing office should an offending motorist wish to raise any queries or need help understanding the notice or with the detection or circumstances surrounding it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.28" nospeaker="true" time="10:30:00" ><p>For the committee's information, 91,838 items of correspondence were processed at the national fixed charge processing office in 2012 from recipients of fixed charged notices.  In addition, 59,570 telephone inquiries were received and processed.  A further 65,000 payment-related calls were dealt with by fixed-charge processing system payment agents - that is, An Post.</p><p>In the normal course prosecution follows non-payment of a fixed charge.  A review of the issuing of any fixed charge notice may result in termination or cancellation and no proceedings being instituted.  Termination or cancellation occurs when it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair, proportionate or in the public interest.  Decisions on termination or cancellation are governed by Garda policy and procedures which complement the discretion vested in an authorised officer to so terminate or cancel, and are framed around legislative exemptions and in the guidelines for prosecutors as published by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>The guidelines for prosecutors issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions state that "a prosecution should not be brought where the likelihood of a conviction is effectively non-existent," and goes on to state: "In assessing the evidence, the prosecutor should also have regard to any defences which are plainly open to, or have been indicated by, the accused."  The DPP has further advised, in relation to the prosecution of driving offences, that particular acts, such as exceeding a speed limit or crossing a continuous white line, can warrant any one of a variety of responses ranging from no prosecutorial action through to a caution or a charge under the relevant legislation or regulation.</p><p>I have received legal advice that it is clear that when a fixed charge notice penalty is issued it is not mandatory that the payment must be made or a prosecution must follow.  In general terms, it is a well-established fact that the use of discretionary powers has served An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na well since the foundation of the State.  The discretion is exercised by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at every level in the exercise of their daily duties and responsibilities.  It is an intrinsic feature of good policing, the application of which continues to assist in maintaining the positive relationship the organisation has developed with the general citizenry over its history.  In that regard, I welcome the notice yesterday evening and the comments from the Chairman.</p><p>Where a possible defect is identified which emanates from the detection of the offence or the administration of the system and which cannot be rectified, the advantage is always afforded to the driver or owner of the fixed-charge notice and it is cancelled.  This is reflected in the well-established jurisprudence in the Irish legal system whereby the benefit of any doubt lies with an accused person.</p><p>During the relevant period under examination in the O'Mahoney report, from 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2012, a total of 66,407 fixed charge notices were terminated, equivalent to 4.55% of the 1.46 million tickets that were issued.  When legal and technical reasons for the termination of notices were accounted for, there remained 2.57% of the 1.46 million fixed charge penalty notices issued in the review period that were terminated by authorised officers exercising discretionary powers, which equates to an average of 10,701 terminations of this nature per year nationally.  To put the figure in context, it equates to less than two cancellation notices per week per Garda district.  As the committee will be aware, Garda districts can range from between one and six stations.</p><p>As well as fulfilling its primary purpose of increasing road safety, as evidenced by the significant fall in road fatalities since the introduction in 2002, it should be noted that the fixed charge processing system also provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative for citizens and the State to hundreds of thousands of road traffic prosecutions being dealt with by the courts each year, with all the associated costs of same.</p><p>In closing, and as outlined further in a briefing document that I furnished to him and his committee recently on his request, on foot of the O'Mahoney and Comptroller and Auditor General reports, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has introduced a number of measures that have strengthened the procedures around the cancellation of fixed charge penalty notices, as well as greater oversight and auditing of the system.  The impact of these measures has already been seen with internal audits on the fixed charge penalty notice cancellations in November and December showing that 100% of these cancellations were carried out within policy.</p><p>On the matter of summons and non-payment, there are long-standing issues in this area outside our direct control such as drivers being from other jurisdictions, foreign nationals leaving the country before they can be served or people paying.  However, on matters within our control, we will continue to work with the relevant State bodies such as the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Courts Service and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as making internal changes, to address the points raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p><p>In conclusion, as I think we have shown with our swift action in relation to the findings of the O'Mahoney and the Comptroller and Auditor General reports, we are committed to ensuring that the fixed charge notice system is operated in an effective and efficient manner - fairly and consistently - so as to ensure it has the confidence of the public and, most importantly, that it continues to play an important role in improving road safety by reducing poor driver behaviour.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I wish to point out that I am related to Mr. Ruane, who is seated at the top table.  This issue has continued for a long time.  Part of the reason it has received public attention and why the public and ourselves are so interested in the matter is that the perception has been created that if one knows someone in the Garda, or knows a garda who works in a station, and one receives penalty points one can get them cancelled.  There is a perception that there is a way to usurp the law and get penalty points or a fixed charge notice cancelled.</p><p>  Today we are discussing a very detailed and good report prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He examined the procedures and processes that were in place.  The report uses a number of samples of discretionary cancellations.  It portrayed the system as not working, one where accurate reasons did not have to be given and in many cases reasons were not given and a space left blank, and supporting documentation was not supplied to back up assertions that were made.  In many instances - in the district offices - the only documentation available was merely letters from people seeking to have the document put out.  I have not found anything to rebut the assertion that this was not the case.  With regard to the two reports prepared by the Garda, I have also not seen anything to rebut the assumption or assertion of flexibility, ability and culture concerning a large number of cases - 10,000 cases - that if one knew a garda one could get off and get one's penalty points cancelled.  Given one's inability to go through all of the 40,000 cancelled notices, how does the Commissioner satisfy himself that this was not the case?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014012300006#E00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Can I first of all say to the Chairman that the system itself, as a system, is working very well when one considers that 95.45% of fixed charge notices issued go through to payment stage without any issue.  The issues that the Deputy has highlighted speak to the 4.55% that is highlighted in the O'Mahoney report.  As indicated in my opening remarks, when one breaks the figure down one is dealing with 2.57% of the entirety of the tickets that were cancelled during the period that was looked at.  That period substantially covered all of the allegations that were made.</p> <p>It is very clear that, holistically, the system itself is working very well.  It is the case - I have adverted to the figures, as has the Deputy - that 10,700 cancellations on a national basis looks to be a very strong headline figure but when one distils it down, one is talking about fewer than two tickets per week per Garda district.  I accept, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has already highlighted to us, the variations within districts, so one factors that in as well.</p><p> I suppose my initial observation in regard to the Deputy's question is that there are two elements to that 2.57%, about which we are speaking.  First, one is looking at the system and the process and, second, one is looking at the information that grounds the decision-making process.  The system and the process have been found to be weak in a number of areas and the information I have provided to the committee clearly speaks to rectifying those issues.  As I indicated again in my opening remarks, the inspectorate and the Director of Public Prosecutions have been provided with a copy of the new draft guidelines we propose to shore up the weaknesses that have been found within the system.  It is appropriate that both of those agencies have the opportunity to view them because if we are charged with responsibility for enforcing, then clearly there is a discretionary aspect to that enforcement.  We are, in a sense, agents of the Director of Public Prosecution, so it is appropriate that office looks to see if there are any other fault-lines before we proceed to finally issuing guidelines.</p><p> Turning our attention to the second element of that process as I see it, the decision-making process, I cannot say I am happy with some of the issues that have been highlighted, in particular some of the issues highlighted in the public domain - again, resulting from a lot of the information provided in the O'Mahoney report.  It is very clearly the case that anyone who goes into the PULSE system and is brought to the fixed charge processing system will have a very limited view of the cancellations in terms of what he or she sees.  It is the case that record-keeping has been poor.  There is no doubt about that.  In some cases, the free text box had not been populated.  We will have seen, for example, excuses such as bees worrying livestock, or words to that effect.  At first glance, one could almost be entertained by it but I looked at the letter and the documentation behind that particular notice and the petition the relevant superintendent had in regard to that case.</p><p> I do not want to get involved with individual cases, as it would not be appropriate.  In fact, I am seeking to protect individuals' information.  However, by way of highlighting it as an example of what I am talking about, this person was engaged in very substantial voluntary work on behalf of the community and he happened to be a beekeeper.  His wife telephoned him when he was out attending to that voluntary work to tell him the bees were, in her view, out of control, so there was a need to get back to the house quickly to bring matters under control as there were livestock and people in close proximity.  He was caught speeding somewhere in the region of 9 km over the speed limit.  He was a man who had been driving for many years and who had never transgressed.  All of these things were taken into consideration when that decision was made by the officer who took the view it merited cancellation.  A person going into the fixed charge penalty notice screen will not see the documentation behind the individual case.  I do not want to go any further, otherwise I might identify that individual who is absolutely entitled to privacy.  That is the type of thing I am talking about.</p><p> I do not subscribe to the view somebody in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who has the opportunity and authorisation to cancel a ticket will do so because of who someone is in society.  I have an opinion in regard to some of the decisions I saw but I think no matter who one is, whether one is a politician, a sports personality, a dignitary or a VIP of whatever description, if one is a citizen of this country and one feels one has a genuine entitlement to petition an authorised officer involved in the decision-making process, the right to do that is open to one as an individual.  Indeed, one can carry that process through to the court stage.  If one is not satisfied and a ticket does not get the reception one thinks it might, there is absolutely no reason one cannot go into the District Court and make the same pleas.</p></speech>

He said the system or the process was weak and that there were flaws in it and that the decision-making based on it was often not transparent, that no reason was given in some instances or that there was no back-up documentation.  There is a bad system and decisions which cannot be backed up.</p></speech>

They either go through Thurles, or we have back-up to go with them.  Approximately, half go down to discretionary grounds, usually through district offices.  This is the place where this accusation and the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report and by members of the public are raised.  We will agree that the system is weak.  If the system is weak and decisions are made which are not backed up - there is no reason or documentation - would the Commissioner accept that, at the very least, the system in place could credibly give rise to the possibly that there was this kind of attitude and favour system in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014012300007#F00700"><p>In a number of these cases, the particular officers could account for the reasons tickets were cancelled, even though documentation was not available.  When one looks at the totality of the very serious allegations made of corruption and malpractice - very serious criminal charges - no thread of evidence has been found to date and nobody has come forward to provide that type of evidence.  Many allegations are being made but nobody has provided any evidence of corruption or malpractice.  There is certainly evidence found in Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney's report of people acting outside the process.  As the Deputy knows, in three particular cases, 661 notices, the Assistant Commissioner had sufficient concerns to alert the Assistant Commissioner in charge of internal affairs that these matters needed to be inquired into through a disciplinary investigation.  He was laying bare the facts as he saw them but he very clearly said he did not come across criminality, which is a very serious issue for us as everybody will appreciate.</p></speech>

If it is the case that there is justification for a cancellation, that would be accepted.  I do not expect a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to get involved in doing favours for their friends, family or anybody else.  I would expect that all decisions would be based on a solid foundation.</p></speech>

I am trying to arrive at a meaning for "corruption".  To be pedantic, does the fact that I cancel penalty points for a friend as a favour, for which I get no benefit, mean that it is not corruption, while if somebody paid me to cancel the fine it would be a case of corruption?  I am trying to find out if this level of activity - informal, doing somebody a favour - qualifies in the report as corruption.</p></speech>

That is all I can ask of the members of the force.</p><p>  Whether the petitioner is a brother, sister, mother or father of the member of the force should not really come into it.  It  is either right or wrong.</p></speech>

I understand there was a random selection of 672 fixed charge notices and the examination found no evidence of any act of criminality or corruption.  I am trying to tease out what this statement means.  Does "corruption" mean that I must take money to cancel a fixed charge notice?  Does corruption mean I was doing a favour for a friend?  Perhaps the person who wrote the report can tell me what that means.</p></speech>

That is the reason he is here.  Corruption does not appear to be defined in law, but in my view it would have the ordinary meaning applied to it.  The corruption of public officials is catered for.  When one is talking about that type of corruption, one is talking about somebody who has received money, a favour or remuneration, but as far as I am concerned, that is where it lies.</p><p>  I can do no more than say in response to the questions put by the Deputy that I would expect all of my officers to act fairly and appropriately, and in circumstances in which they found that there was justification for cancelling the ticket, that they would do that; otherwise, that they would reject the petition and send the ticket forward for summons.  All I can do is provide guidelines and there is a reasonable expectation that people follow those guidelines.</p></speech>

I have seen the report that has been updated from the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and how the new processes will be put in place to ensure that this will not happen again.</p><p>  This issue has come to the fore because people agitated to make an issue of it and demanded that it be made public, saying that if one knew a garda - for example, a family friend - or somebody who worked with garda&iacute;, one could get the penalty points cancelled.  It was not the case that money was exchanged or that favours were being done in return; it was simply because of the personal relationship that a liberty existed.  We have identified that the system in place was weak and there was very little back-up information.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has expressed his concerns about the system.</p><p>  When the allegations were investigated 672 fixed charged notices were examined, but the conclusion was reached that there was no evidence of criminality or corruption.  What I am trying to rule out is whether there was evidence that if one knew some garda&iacute; one would get one's penalty points cancelled or that there was a lax attitude or a disregard for the process.</p></speech>

It is the case - I am sorry for the repetition - that I expect members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are charged with this responsibility to act fairly and impartially, regardless of who these people are.  Of course I am alive to the allegations and of course I am reading about them.  Let us be clear.  I am not saying the system is weak - as the Deputy mentioned a few times, there have been weaknesses identified within the system, but the overall process is quite substantial in terms of success.</p></speech>

I have clearly indicated to the Deputy that if he is suggesting that a family member or somebody close to the superintendent or the inspector after him can somehow or other influence a garda to look after the ticket, that is not conduct I would accept as being a valid reason for the cancellation, nor could I ever stand over that.</p></speech>

In his investigation Mr. O'Mahoney looked at a set of 189 different allegations that refer to 2,198 separate cancellations.  That is a very targeted exercise and it sets out the percentage of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have had fixed charge notices cancelled, which is in the region of 8% of that particular cohort of cancellations, for reasons of being on or off duty.</p></speech>

That was from the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report in 2000.  Those concerns were repeated in 2003 and again in 2007.  Yet it took allegations, whistleblowing and a serious media storm in 2012 to have the system updated and put in place new procedures and investigations.  Why did it have to become a national scandal causing national uproar for recommendations that were made 13 or 14 years ago to be implemented?</p></speech>

Can he point his figure toward where the national scandal is?  A series of very serious allegations were made about certain cancellations and about the members who cancelled those fixed charge notices.  They have been examined in very great detail by the assistant commissioner and we have already discussed the cases that have gone to a disciplinary process.  If the Deputy is saying that is a national scandal and that these three individuals, out of somewhere in the region of 500 officers who had the opportunity to cancel notices, is a national scandal, that is fine.</p></speech>

Thank you.  A variety of changes have taken place since 2000.  I have a list of them here.  The change from the on-the-spot fines system to the fixed-charge penalty process took place in 2002.  Various speeding charges that needed to be implemented were designated in primary legislation in the Road Traffic Act of October 2002.  Section 19 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 was introduced in an effort to address the issue of company-registered vehicles.  This legislation was found to be inoperable in practice, however.  That is a particular difficulty even today.  In 2006, the transition to the fixed-charge notice system was completed with the introduction of automated payments.  This greatly enhanced the payments system.  New management structures were introduced in 2007 when the fixed-charge penalty office was decentralised to Thurles.  The introduction in 2008 of robotic vans with digital camera technology and safety cameras represented a move from the use of video, which used a wet film, to the use of digital technology, which provides for a more enhanced system of capturing the offender.  All of those things were introduced.</p><p>  The most significant element of the audit system that is now in place is the fact that it has three tiers.  First, we have our own internal audit unit, which randomly chooses a number of districts and divisions and looks at the systems and processes in place.  Second, the professional standards unit, which is an independent statutory unit that I am obliged to have in place to examine how the garda&iacute; do their business, comes in and looks at the decision-making process.  Third, the assistant commissioner in charge of the traffic unit, who is present at today's meeting, comes in and looks at conflicting interests that may exist.  That is of relevance to the Deputy's last point about cases involving a close family member or a person of notoriety.  The assistant commissioner examines those issues in the various districts and divisions.  He ascertains whether there was a conflict and, if so, what was done about it.  He demands to see the paperwork in all such cases.  They are the fixes we have put in place now to try to address all of these concerns.  A great deal has been happening incrementally since 2000.</p></speech>

That continued until 2012.</p></speech>

I should qualify what I am saying.  I am not excusing it.  The Deputy is absolutely right to say it occurred.  Of course it did.  That screen does not give the complete picture.  One has to go behind that screen to find out why the cancellations occurred.  It is true that documentation was not available in all cases.  That is an accepted fact.  That is what the assistant commissioner exposed in his report.  There is nobody hiding anything here.</p></speech>

The perception that things were being fixed or written off inappropriately was not acted on fully at that time.  There was something wrong in the corporate governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given that this was not fixed promptly and fully at that time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014012300009#H00800"><p>Yes.  I understand the Deputy's point absolutely.  I accept those criticisms.  Of course I do.  All I can say is that in a highly regulated corporate body like An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, directives are issued and instructions are given almost on a daily basis.  All I or any of my senior officers can do is issue a set of guidelines or directives with a strong expectation that they will be implemented in full.  Those who address these directions have to make professional judgments.  For example, they decide whether to arrest somebody or to let them go.  It is difficult and complex to try to cater for discretion in a comprehensive way.  There is an expectation that people will do what they are asked to do, which is to make up their minds in a fair and balanced way.  There have been weaknesses in the system.</p></speech>

I am aware that I am probably running out of time.  The question relates to the differing termination rates at the various district levels.  It has been identified that the percentage of charges that are terminated or cancelled varies significantly from a low of 0.1% in Birr to a high of 5.9% in Ennis.  What was going on in Ennis that it had such a high level of terminations?</p></speech>

It is difficult to put one's finger on any single element.  One could say that traffic units play a significant part in the issuing of fixed charge notices.  There may be other elements - I simply do not know.  All I can do is produce the facts that are there.  The assistant commissioner has produced those facts.</p></speech>

I am still not satisfied.  Has the activity in question, whereby a garda cancels a notice for a family friend as a favour, been uncovered in any of the Garda's investigations?  I will put it as bluntly as that.</p></speech>

The Garda Commissioner asked how "corruption" is defined.  I remind him that under the reporting of malpractice and corruption Act, it is defined as covering falsehood and prevarication, deliberate falsification of records and improper influence to make personal or family gain.  Is that document circulated to members of the force?  It defines corruption.  I think that was what the Commissioner was asking.</p></speech>

I suppose I should qualify that by saying that there is currently one file with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to specific allegations against three members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When a previous file under this legislation was sent to that office, it said there was no evidence found and there was no prosecution.  That was the result of that investigation.  Each of the two files I am indicating to the committee - one has been dealt with and the other is still live with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions - has been created by two of the people who are central to these allegations.  Very specific allegations were made in these cases.</p> <p>To come back to the Deputy's question, page 25 of the O'Mahoney report, under the heading Family Connections, states: <blockquote><br />In the absence of specific information it is difficult to categorically identify whether the petitioner is in any way connected with either the terminating office or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <br />1,530 of the 1,537 terminations examined (99.5%) had no identifiable family connection between the terminating member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the fixed charge nominee.</blockquote>These are in relation to the very specific allegations that were made and identified by the O'Mahoney investigation.  This may be a good opportunity for the Assistant Commissioner to respond. </p></speech>

That is a difficulty that we had in coming to our determination.  With friends and family, the name does not necessarily mean anything.  Our examination found seven cases involving identifiable family members.  We examined those seven cases in detail and found that the people who terminated were not family members.  We did not find any family member terminating for a family member.</p></speech>

How did the process work?  Were people interviewed at Garda stations about an individual sample?  Were they asked their views on the operation of the fixed charge notice and its weaknesses?  Was such a broad scoping exercise done to judge the feeling of members of the force, talk to them about their experiences and so on, or did the exercise involve going through each case individually?</p></speech>

We decided for comparative purposes that we would look outside of the allegations that were made by the persons who made them.  We decided to look at 1% of cases.  We divided the 672 cases between all the district headquarters around the country, other than some of the districts that were already dealt with as part of the allegations.  Every one in 16 was picked at random.  To answer the Deputy's question as to whether we asked people specifically what they thought of the system, the answer is "No".</p></speech>

This could include doing an anonymous survey or having a place where people could submit their thoughts or feedback on the allegations that have been made.  This would be a way to facilitate the process without identifying themselves.  Was a broader approach taken as part of the investigation to try to get a better sense of the culture and attitude in the force?  Much of this is unprovable if one does not have any documentation.  In a system that allows for decision making to go unaccounted for in some regards, the only way one will find out is if one does a much broader testing of members of the force.</p></speech>

If there is no documentation, it creates its own problem.  These are, however, a small number of cases, particularly the ones which involved acting within policy but outside of the process.  To put this in context, if I am a superintendent in Santry and I cancel a ticket in Dalkey, perhaps for all the right reasons, with proper justification and being authorised at a particular rank to do so, the proper procedure in that instance would be to forward the documentation, if one was satisfied that there was justification for cancelling the ticket, to the superintendent of the area in which the offence occurred and let him or her make the decision.  That is what should have happened and did not happen in a certain number of cases.  That is the distinction I am drawing between acting outside of the policy versus outside of the process.  That happened in a number of cases.  However, where the disciplinary issues arise, these are matters that were deemed to be too serious and they certainly involved a lack of documentation and an audit trail.</p></speech>

In the context of the committee's mail shot yesterday, the Chairman spoke about a number of things, particularly audit trails and asked if we were fixing the system.  It is important to the discussion with Deputy Nolan that, in terms of compliance, 24 stations have been visited to date, five divisions have been inspected by the Assistant Commissioner in traffic and the internal audit unit has visited the fixed charge office unit in Thurles.  In all areas, there is 100% compliance.  It is important to put that on the record.  Does it prove that the fixes are now working?  Let us hope so.</p></speech>

The Garda Inspectorate is also looking into these matters as they relate to fixed charge notices and we have a report from the Garda professional standards unit dating from April.  When one looks through all this material, it is fair to conclude, as the Commissioner stated, that the system has become better in some ways.  That conclusion is proved by the figures.  However, the system has also got worse in some areas.  There have been marginal negative changes in respect of issues such as serving summons, inputting data, allowing offences or potential offences to become statute-barred and failing to prosecute individuals who are driving company cars.  While the data shows there have been improvements, there have also been areas in which no improvements have been made.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has made the same recommendations consistently since 2000, yet there has not been any improvement in some categories.</p><p>  I will start with the positives.  With regard to the collection of fines, the position 13 or 14 years ago was that more than half of such offences went unpunished.  The rate of collection has improved, with only 20% of fines going uncollected today.  The cancellation rate for on-the-spot fines was approximately 8% in 1998, whereas the most recent report cites a rate of 5%, which indicates an improvement.</p> <p>When it comes to the serving of summonses, for example, in 2000 there was about 44% non-serving of summonses but it has gone up to 50% on the latest date provided to us by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Will the Commissioner start with that issue?  What are the reasons and why has there been a marginal increase in the non-serving of summonses from his perspective?</p></speech>

It is the case that there is a greater population now, there is a transient community with people from both the North-South and east-west and there are data quality control issues in the context of registered owners of vehicles.  The Deputy is right.  Summonses are a difficulty and have been a difficulty for us for many years in terms of trying to get them served.</p></speech>

I am sorry for cutting off the Commissioner.  There are some other issues I need to get to.  In the 2000 report the Comptroller and Auditor General made a recommendation and he made it again in 2012.  The recommendation was very simple, that the Garda and the Courts Service need to work together to deal with the issues of summonses.  That has not happened.</p></speech>

In 2004, section 19 of the Road Traffic Act was introduced but, in effect, it was found to be not effective.  It is the case that one can register a vehicle in a company name.  We are working very closely on the issue.  There are a number of people involved in this matter because we view it so seriously.  The Road Safety Authority, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Courts Service are all working together to try to address this.</p></speech>

I will start with that again.  I must press the Commissioner on this.  This is fairly basic stuff.  There are a lot of reports, including Comptroller and Auditor General reports but in some cases there has been no movement whatsoever with regard to changing the law and putting into place the procedures and systems to actually improve the system.  In some cases it has improved but in other cases there are serious lapses, organisational lapses, legislative lapses and I do not think it is fair to say it is simply a matter of law enforcement.  The Commissioner has a critical role with regard to identifying gaps in the law and communicating them to a Department so it can fix them, whether it is the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but it has not been done.</p></speech>

We are meeting those involved and are indicating the difficulties and the problems we have.  On many occasions a discussion has centred around an individual's driving licence particulars being associated with a particular vehicle, for example, and maybe that might help to address the issue.  In reality, what does one do with the employee who is employed by a large transport company who is driving a variety of lorries?  The bottom line here is that under section 103 of the Road Traffic Act there is an obligation on either the secretary of a company or some company official to indicate who was driving the lorry.</p></speech>

At the time 5,500 cases were flagged as being statute-barred in a particular period.  In 4,561 of these no reason was stated in the computer file.  The Accounting Officer at the time told the Comptroller and Auditor General that the reason for the high number of statute-barred offences was due to a backlog of offences relating to the introduction of the new penalty points system.  The Accounting Officer at the time, not yourself obviously, stated that since the backlog was now clear that - I stress - the situation should not arise again.  In the current report the Comptroller and Auditor General examined over 3000 offences detected in 2011 and 2012, yet it is still a problem.</p> <p>There were 3,000 offences detected in 2011 and 2012.  It is still a problem.  It results in a huge loss of revenue from the Exchequer.</p><p> I do not think we can point the finger at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or any other Department.  This is basic inputting of data.  Court proceedings must be initiated within six months of the offence&rsquo;s being detected.  If they are not it will be statute barred.  Why is this still a serious problem ten years on while the State is losing huge amounts of revenue because data is not entered?</p></speech>

If a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who applies for a summons for a specific offence, whether it is a road traffic or any other matter, does not deal with that within the statutory period of six months it is statute barred.  That is one aspect.  The other is the notepads that we use.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, and the O&rsquo;Mahoney report, identified problems for us in that respect.  We have implemented a new system whereby all of these pads, which come in batches of 20, are bar-coded and accounted for.  An accounting regime has been put in place.  I expect to see improvements on that aspect.</p></speech>

The inspector in the district has to make a return on a monthly basis to the fixed charge notice.  It is the case, when people are out on mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints or other road traffic duties in very inclement weather, that these forms are destroyed and are mislaid.  All of the human elements come into play.  I am not using this as an excuse but these are issues that arise in the course of ordinary everyday business.  It is up to us in management to ensure that there are sufficient checks and balances to ensure that no summons is statute-barred.</p></speech>

I have to make the observation after going through all of this information dating back to 2000, and the four reports and sets of recommendations that the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office have made over those years, in those three areas I have outlined there has not been much improvement.  In some areas there has been.  To be fair it has been very positive.  The system in many respects is far more rigorous.  There are areas where I am to an extent at a loss to figure out why the improvements are not greater.  That is merely an observation.</p><p>  Since the new policy was issued in August, what improvements have been made and can Mr. Callinan give us some detail on the kinds of figures, if they have improved since then, across the board, since the new policy was initiated in August?</p></speech>

Mr. Callinan said that there is a statutory requirement to have that unit.  When I look across all these areas I ask myself, while all of this has been going on for the past 13 years, what has that unit been doing in these areas?  What is its role?  How often does it meet?  Mr. Callinan said it is a statutory requirement to have it but how effective is that unit?</p></speech>

It is an entity in Garda headquarters.  I was statutorily obliged to set it up.  As the Deputy can imagine from its title it considers professional standards for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would typically go into a district or a division and examine the processes in operation and bring back recommendations across the whole system, not just penalty points.  It makes recommendations and reports to local management.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned what has been happening in trying to correct this.  Apart from those three tiers, the Assistant Commissioner, the professional standards unit and the internal audit unit, there are several changes in respect of the cancelling authority and redefining its area.  In other words, superintendents in the new policy are not now in a position physically to access a machine and cancel it.  It has to go to the fixed charge office with the recommendation to cancel or not.</p><p>  A similar tracking system is in place in respect of the notepads so that a return goes every month to the fixed charge office which is auditing.  I mentioned the three units.  They are some of the things that have been happening since August under the new policy arrangement.  Of course if there are other recommendations from the inspectorate or the Director of Public Prosecutions we will consider them and if we can factor them into the policy we will do so.</p></speech>

He has made that clear and the committee has accepted that.  It is fair enough but can Mr. Callinan fill me in?  I have a concern about the information that it seems is now frequently given to Members of the Oireachtas and committees.  In some cases it might constitute a fragment of the information around one particular case, or an alleged offence.  This committee needs to be careful about how it deals with that information because it does not give the full picture.  Is that Mr. Callinan&rsquo;s opinion too?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014012300012#L02000"><p>That is absolutely the case.  If one considers the allegations that the Assistant Commissioner has examined on behalf of all of us it is very clear that in a substantial portion of the allegations the people who complained about corruption, malpractice, cancellations of all types had very limited access to the decision-making process.  They simply did not have access, to put it in a nutshell.  They opened a screen in the PULSE system and looked at a snapshot of the actual event but they did not see the complete picture.</p></speech>

What constitutes the full picture beyond the screen?</p></speech>

If the trail exists one would have to examine it to see the circumstances, to see if it has been done correctly and whether the professional judgment exercised was proper and appropriate in the circumstances.  That information is not available from these screen shots; one must go behind them.</p><p>  For example, when dealing with the fixed charge notice system, in some instances the juvenile diversion scheme is at issue.  Once a date of birth is recorded for a driver, it will automatically go to the fixed charge office for cancellation under the juvenile diversion scheme.  Therefore, there are elements which are not visible when one looks at a screen.</p></speech>

Let us say I agree with the Commissioner and that I have a similar concern.  I am not questioning anyone's bona fides - whistleblowers - but I am getting to the nub of the issue.  The Commissioner is saying that in his opinion he cannot make a decision or an analysis based on a fragment of information.</p></speech>

Far be it from me to criticise the important work that goes on in this committee, because it is necessary and important that we are called to account, as we should be.  As the Accounting Officer for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I have a statutory function under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to direct and control the force.  The only effective way I can do that is to have a proper disciplinary regime in place so that when people step outside I have access to sanctions.</p><p>  I should preface my remarks by indicating that one of the people who is now engaged in this so-called whistleblowing exercise is a person who is a serving member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as I understand it.  If that is the case, then he or she is subject to the disciplinary regulations.  It is the case that at any time, at any place, anywhere, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can step outside the ordinary standards expected of that member.  If that is the case then I would have to consider whether I would have access to the disciplinary regulations to deal with that issue.  I am not for a moment suggesting that I will go down the road of exercising discipline in this particular case but it is certainly something on which I would have to reserve my position.  If I am asked in general terms whether it is appropriate for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to use this committee as a platform for exercising whatever it is he or she wishes to exercise and make unsubstantiated allegations or provide sensitive personal data to a third party - such as this committee - then I will have to seriously consider my position and their position.  I have already indicated to the Chairman that I have very serious concerns about the information, the data, that has been passed on to the committee.  I am not aware of what is contained in that data but I can only presume it from the response of the committee.  I have no issue with the committee taking legal advice and deciding how best to do its business but it is the case that I have also taken advice and I am told that, as we speak, I am in breach of the Data Protection Act and that it is possible that the person who supplied that information is in breach of the Data Protection Act.  This is clearly a matter on which I will need to take action.  I will reserve my position with regard to how I will deal with that.  If I am asked in a general sense whether I would be in favour of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na coming in here and using this forum, this committee, to expose material in the fashion in which it has been exposed or to make allegations that have not been substantiated, I think that is fundamentally wrong.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014012300013#M00900"><p>If I may put it this way, I do not know what the committee has at its disposal.  Certainly, if it is anything like the level and extent of the knowledge that the assistant commissioner had at his disposal about the allegations made, if that mirrors what the assistant commissioner was dealing with, clearly it would be impossible to make a judgment.  That was part of my concern which I articulated in the letter to the Chairman.  For instance, if the information is anonymous and if this committee were to rely on providing statistics in a public forum, then we are in a very rocky place unless these matters can be explored and properly teased out.  I have indicated to the committee that there were issues within the system that needed to be corrected, and this has been done.  However, I emphasise it is very important that as a disciplined force we do not allow a situation to occur in which 13,000 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na start making complaints about one another and investigating one another.  We have to exercise some form of control.  It is important that as Commissioner I have control and authority over the force.  How can I manage the force unless I have access to that type of control?  The organisation could not perform its policing or security remits if I and my officers were not in a position to exercise that type of control.</p><p>  I do not want it to be said that I am considering disciplinary action with regard to these people.  I have given it very careful consideration and I will continue to do so.  However, there may come a point at which I will have to seriously consider this matter for all the reasons I have indicated.  I cannot allow a situation to continue where information is being bandied around.  I realise people are relying on a certain section of the law as an authority.</p><p>  Wrongdoing by any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not be tolerated by me or by any member of my officer corps.  The committee can take that as a given.  There is a difference between reporting wrongdoing and consistently putting about large volumes of material.  These are the parameters I must consider.  When I became aware of it, I issued a very clear direction to the two members involved.  We had a discussion with Deputy McDonald on the last occasion I was before the committee as to when I became aware of the identities of these people and what they were saying.  I have carefully checked my records since then.  In December, following on from the information that the retired member of the force and a serving member, a sergeant, were working together to provide information and material for an elected representative, I took advice and I was advised that this was wrong.</p> <p>In light of that advice, I set about putting in place a direction to both of these individuals that if they had any problem at all or any complaint to make, the first thing they should do is to revert either to the assistant commissioner who deals with very serious allegations or any other member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I recall, I used the words "without prejudice to the confidential reporting mechanism," because I fully recognise and support the confidential reporting system in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and elsewhere.  Everybody, not just in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is entitled to be in a position to confidentially report matters of wrongdoing that come to their attention.  At the same time, these individuals have a responsibility as well, and the making of allegations that cannot be substantiated on a regular basis is a particular difficulty that I may have to deal with.</p></speech>

Given that we have exchanged correspondence on this matter, like any committee of the House or any individual, we took legal advice on the matter and we retained the box of information.  I simply want to place on record that we were given the opportunity to examine the box to see whether it was of any relevance to the committee.  The members decided that it was, and we authorised the clerk and the person giving legal advice to the parliamentary system to analyse what was in the box.  Any personal information was redacted because that is not our business.  Our business is the loss of money to the State should a system not be working properly.  That is exactly what we are about in this case in analysing the information we received.</p><p>  I am sure the box of information contains the same type of material as that referred to by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney.  We set out that material yesterday at a private meeting and issued it to members, redacted and fully compliant with the Data Protection Acts.  The Commissioner is quite welcome to a copy of that information.</p></speech>

Yesterday we received a letter which was sent to the justice committee on 12 January and received by it on 15 January, which makes further very serious allegations in regard to all of these matters.  I am saying this to inform Commissioner Callinan of the work of the committee.</p><p>  I want to address the issue around the information that is there.  The original information from PULSE gives the garda name or number - I forget which it is - and an indication as to which member of the Garda would have taken the action to remove the penalty points.  However, one of the whistleblowers, respecting the data protection provisions and leading us to this point, provided us with the information which told us, for example, that a certain number of penalty points were struck out for a particular family.  We do not know what family it is.  He went to the bother of quantifying the cost of the total loss to the State.  He says it runs to &euro;4 million to &euro;6 million, which is not perhaps much different from the figure that is reached when one works out either Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney's figures or those of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>  The Commissioner gave an example earlier of bees worrying livestock.  I was struck by a number of examples that were contained in one of the whistleblower's report whereby a senior person had his or her penalty points struck out because he or she was on his or her way to court.  The whistleblower went to the bother of finding out that there was no court sitting on the day in question.  He also went to the bother of looking into a situation where a garda who was stopped did not receive penalty points because, it was stated, he was on duty.  Apparently, several penalty points were at issue here.  The whistleblower states that he investigated the case and found that the garda was not on duty when the incident took place and it did not take place in the area where he normally would be working.  In fact, he was on sick leave.</p><p>  I am not saying these things to embarrass the Commissioner or the Garda in any way.  I am simply saying that this is the type of information that is circulating around the Oireachtas.  Would it not have been possible to bring in the two serving garda&iacute; before one of them retired and have a man-to-man discussion with them in regard to their duty, as they saw it, to report what they considered wrongdoing and, in some cases, what was described as corruption under the definition we gave earlier?  As proper members of the force, willing to give this information, they have put their jobs on the line.  That is what happens to whistleblowers - they sometimes become the victim.  Was it not possible within the force to create a situation where they were brought forward in order to give that information?  They provided the information to the committees of the Oireachtas because it was suggested that this was the proper way to do it.  There is an issue here in that the matter must be dealt with in some way, because it is damaging the reputation of the force and people are wondering if what we have heard is true or false.  That is really what we are about here.</p></speech>

That is one element and one side of the story.  I recognise a number of matters he has mentioned by way of example.  One or two of them have been bottomed out.  I will say no more about that.</p><p>  It is clearly the case that on 14 December 2012, following legal advice, I presented an opportunity to these individuals - not alone did I present it but I directed them - that if they had any of that PULSE material in their possession, to hand it over, because they should not have had it in the first instance.  None of us should.  Second, I advised that they had an opportunity, without prejudice to the confidential reporting system - that is very important, and I have copies of the directions I gave to these people - to come forward with absolutely any complaint they had to the assistant commissioner.  I would expect that any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would know the channels of communication in the case of wrongdoing.  I have already indicated to the committee that anybody who sees or hears about wrongdoing would be expected to take action, and that action could be on their own, through their superiors or through the confidential reporting mechanism.</p> <p>That is a clear direction that was issued in June 2012 in the context of the last point the Chairman mentioned.</p></speech>

That is a clear indication of my intent that if they had knowledge of any matters of wrongdoing, they should come forward with the information.</p><p>  Both of these people have engaged with the system at different points.  On 1 September 2012, one of them made very serious allegations under the anti-fraud policy to a chief superintendent.  When asked at the time whether he had any other issues, he indicated he had not.  That file has gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I may be incorrect but I think it involved in the region of 20 specific complaints against one member.  The DPP issued a direction that there be no prosecution.  In June of last year, the other person made a specific complaint under the anti-fraud policy against three individuals and I think there were 17 specific cases of alleged criminality.  That matter has been investigated and it is with the Director of Public Prosecutions right now.  So they have chosen - very carefully - when to act and when not to act.  This is another feature of what is going on.  All of these things are of great concern to me in terms of exercising the proper controls that I need to exercise so that we, as an organisation, can function.</p></speech>

We agreed that we would hear his evidence on Thursday next.  I think the Commissioner should be aware of that.  In the letter to which I referred earlier, the second whistleblower has stated, "I am willing to give evidence to your committee at the earliest opportunity".  That just arrived this morning, so it will be with the correspondence circulated to members.  That is the state of play at present and, as indicated, the information is before us in redacted form in order that there is protection for both the individual garda and the individual who was stopped.  It is disturbing to read the material involved.  There is a need for a comprehensive response to this document and to what are being presented as facts from the Commissioner to the committee on another time.  To be fair, I will not discuss the matter in detail because the Commissioner has not seen any of the documentation.</p></speech>

I am the Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am the person answerable to the committee, the Minister and the Government in respect of revenue streams and efficiencies and processes within the system.  There are ample fora within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if an individual or individuals have issues that they wish to highlight in terms of reporting matters of wrongdoing.  I think it is grossly unfair that this situation has evolved.  I certainly do not want to interfere with the important work of this committee.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  The committee has lots of things to consider but I cannot, in all fairness, have a situation where members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are coming in and making very serious allegations of a criminal nature - and a disciplinary nature - and using a platform such as this committee to air their grievances, without my having a response.  I have not seen any material the committee has.  It is grossly unfair.  I should have an opportunity to deal with this situation and make very cogent arguments if that is what the committee would require of me to make in advance of people coming in here and - let us put our cards on the table - airing certain matters.  I will not say they are pursing a particular agenda but they may very well be misguided in terms of the state of the information they feel the have.</p></speech>

That may very well be the case.  However, where members of my force are coming in and making very serious accusations of a criminal nature against my officers, then that is an extremely serious matter.  It is a matter that should be dealt with by either myself or by other fora.  If there are matters of such a serious criminal nature, I think the Director of Public Prosecutions should be involved.  There are clear obligations on the people who are making these accusations.  I am only repeating myself, I know that.</p></speech>

We will pass on the information so that he will be aware of what the committee is examining.  That is only fair.  The committee has not, as yet, decided whether the matter will be dealt with in public or private session.  That is a matter with which we will deal next week having heard the Commissioner's evidence today.  So the issue will come back onto the agenda for next Thursday's meeting.</p></speech>

People will be aware - and it is a matter of public record - of how I do my business and how this man beside me, Deputy Commissioner O'Mahoney, does his business.  We have, and I have said this in the past, both been involved in investigations where we sent our colleagues to jail.  Not a very pleasant exercise I can assure everyone sitting in this room.  We have had an occasion where one of our own colleagues' wives collapsed in front of us when he was sent to jail.  So no one can point the finger at me and say that I will not take firm action if I have any hint of wrongdoing.  It is not a question of acting in a particular way to suit my particular circumstances, it is about fairness to both the organisation and to the control and discipline that requires to be intact within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to allow it to carry out its functions.</p></speech>

In his initial contribution, the Commissioner referred to Garda discretion.  He referred to one matter in the context of bees worrying livestock.  While I very much hope that the cows involved were okay, he can see - from the public's perspective - it seems unusual that discretion was used in that case.  Are there any controls relating to Garda discretion or is any advice provided in respect of what is actually considered such discretion?</p></speech>

However, in terms of the actual professional judgments that are required to be exercised, all of the things one would expect ought to be an ingredient of that process, namely, fairness, transparency, audit trail and reason for the decision.  These are all of those things that we are now ensuring are in place.  We recognise that there were weaknesses in the system and that this did not always happen.  Of course there will be variations and I dare say that if one counted the people that are in this room and presented 20 scenarios to each and every one of them, we may not all come back with a uniform decision-making process.  Discretion is a difficult area to be either descriptive or prescriptive about.  We depend on people to do the right thing.</p></speech>

However, what might constitute discretion to one member of the force might not constitute it to his or her colleagues.  Members of the public would be concerned with regard to situations where certain members of the force might use common sense in respect of particular matters while their colleagues might insist that the law has been broken.  I am trying to discover the checks and balances that are in place within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>Is there a meeting every month to find out how Garda discretion was used that month?  Are those checks and balances in place?  </p></speech>

There are all sorts of reasons that summonses are not served.  Where it is the case that we are falling down, every district officer is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the summonses sent to his district are served.

The Committee of Public Accounts is not just interested in the issue of terminations.  Rather, we are interested in the system in its totality and what revenue might be lost to the State.  When we step back from that and look at the significant weaknesses, it is more akin to one in five according to the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of the system not being robust enough.  One in five is an important figure because it is a huge amount of fixed charge notices that are not being dealt with, not because of corruption or anything like that, but because the system is weak.  When we acknowledge that and the potential revenue lost to the State, it is important that we have a proper management plan to get from one in five to one in ten and less than that.  Deputy Connaughton spoke about the integration with the Courts Service.  The Comptroller and Auditor General recommends that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na integrates better with the Courts Service to find out exactly where it led to prosecution, how many cases, the amounts that were raised, etc.  Are there timelines for implementing the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Is there a person in charge of delivering certain objectives?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, the inspectorate has been tasked by the Minister with looking at this area as well.  It may have additional matters that need to be catered for.

So in terms of strike-outs that is a matter for the courts.  What I would earnestly hope to be in a position to do is to give an indication that our rate of summons serving has improved dramatically and that the attrition rate does not fall below an acceptable level in terms of how we are doing our business in terms of cancellations and that that audit trail and the layers of audit that we have in place are actually working effectively.

However, when we look back to when these issues were first raised regarding the system itself and while we can talk about things that were implemented, without seeing a plan with indicators and timelines and whether they were met, it is difficult to judge what has happened since then.  If we were to look at this system again I would like to be able to judge if we were still at one in five not being dealt with sufficiently or if we had improved how that improvement had come about.</p></speech>

I would hope we would be in a position to improve our lot in that process.  However, issues where summonses go to court and are served are separate from our business.  In the context of statute-barred tickets, I would hope to be in a position to improve that 0.4%.  It is relatively small but nonetheless with figures behind it-----</p></speech>

I do not think it would be appropriate to set a target that is acceptable.  I think we would have to go for zero on that particular issue.

We should have a system that collects the revenue that should be collected for the State and imposes the penalty on the individuals for the law they have broken.  However, we need to see how we get there or else we could be here in 12 months still with 2,000 statute-barred cases even though we wanted to reach zero.

However, there is a section in the Road Traffic Act I mentioned earlier on - it is 103, I think - where there is an obligation on whoever has the vehicle registered to indicate to us who was driving.  There are all sorts of legal issues around this, but we would hope to be as proactive as we possibly can in extracting that information, which is the only way we can impose penalty points because these cases have successfully been challenged in the courts.</p></speech>

We could then measure against that 3,000 so that if a year later it was only at 2,000 we might be wondering why it is not at zero and the Commissioner might be saying the Garda wanted to get there as quickly as possible which is not a timeline but an aspiration.  I am trying to figure out why there is not one person whose job it is to bring the system from one in five to a specific lower figure.  There should be a timeline in each area, including summonses to companies, statute-barred cases and summons not issued but court dates held, for example.</p></speech>

Absolutely the Deputy will see improvements; there is no doubt he will.  Will one ever get to the stage where one will correct all of the issues?  It is a wider question.  If one looks at the summonses that have not been served - 11% - that is a huge chunk of the 28% where there is no sanction.  So that is an area we have to work harder on - all of us - to try to get those summonses served.</p><p>  In relation to the cases that are terminated, we have already dealt with that and the Deputy has adverted to it - the 4.55%.  The 2.57%, I think, is probably a realistic figure in terms of terminations because if one looks at the national figures and the national average that the Comptroller and Auditor General has mentioned and put up on the screen earlier, it is around 2.2%.  We are at 2.57%, so-----</p></speech>

I am talking about the totality of what the Commissioner will be reporting back to the Minister in the future in how we improve this system as a whole and I have been giving specific examples.  For example with the 11% for the summonses not issued, a fixed-notice fine was issued but no fine paid and no court summons so no court hearing.  The Commissioner could set a target getting to, for example, 3% in two years time.  He can then chart a plan as to how to get from 11% to 3% so that when we look at this in a year's time, we can see how the Garda is doing against that plan.  Does such a plan exist or is it just an aspiration to do better?</p></speech>

We are making sure that we get a sense of these summonses - the higher proportion of them that are not being served.  We are doing that type of work.</p></speech>

That is the most effective and efficient way of ensuring that the summons will actually be served, but we will be monitoring those areas.</p></speech>

Most of it has been addressed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to 92,650 cases struck out because there was no summons issued but there was a court date.  Who has issued the summons in that instance?  Is it the garda who noted the offence and reported it?  He is then responsible for issuing the summons.</p></speech>

It is the Courts Service that generates the summons and it forwards them on.  At the moment, it is coming to the district where the garda serves who is in charge of the case but we are looking at other ways.  Perhaps it might be more appropriate to send the summons or set of summonses to the district officer where the person resides but that again presents its own problem in terms of the garda tracking where his material is.</p></speech>

Many of the points have been covered.  I have a few brief questions.</p><p>  In regard to the issue of this committee meeting with the whistleblower and the conversation the Commissioner had with the Chairman earlier in the meeting, I understand that the Commissioner would welcome receiving a copy of the redacted material which we have in our possession, which will happen, and he will take a look at the box of information that we also have.  Would he be happy to look at the box of information that we have?</p></speech>

In an effort to assist us with our look at this matter, is he going to look at the box and then endeavour to respond to us on the contents of the box, or what is his intention?  What is the Commissioner hoping to garner from looking at the box?</p></speech>

If they are similar in content and number to the items that Mr. O'Mahoney had to deal with, it must be considered that process took five months, five chief superintendents, six superintendents, 28 dedicated members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to other staffs, our IT people and our analysts.  All of those had to come together and work on this almost full time.  So you will appreciate, if we are getting a box of documents of a similar nature to what we have had previously, it will take some time to get through it, but where there is duplication, we can deal with that pretty quickly.</p></speech>

I think it would certainly have an adverse effect on the maintenance of discipline and good order in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that would be my primary concern - not, in any way, shape or form, to interfere with the good work that this committee does, absolutely not.  That is why I am here, after all - to answer any question at any time in regard to revenue streams and any other matters that come to your notice that you wish to put to me.</p> <p>It is important that if I, as Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, am performing a statutory function, I should not be usurped by subordinates in terms of how I do my business.  I know I am repeating myself, but there is very clear avenues for people to go down - in terms of wrongdoing - and I would not for one moment want any particular member of this committee or any member of the public to be of the impression that I am trying to hide from wrongdoing.  My view is that if any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at any rank, anywhere, anytime sees wrongdoing, there is an expectation and they have a statutory obligation to act on that wrongdoing.  How does one do that?  Every garda knows that one reports through one's authorities or one goes through the confidential recipient if matters are so sensitive that one feels one cannot go any other route.  I am totally in support of the confidential reporting mechanism.  I have it in place.  It is working well within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and anything I get from the confidential recipient, I will act on immediately and report back on.  Those opportunities have been presented to these two people in the past, in December 2012.  They choose not to use that vehicle.</p></speech>

Can he clarify - he has discussed some of these matters to some degree already - the  issue of a garda at the appropriate rank cancelling a fixed charge penalty notice from outside of their district?  Why would that happen?  It is a genuine question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014012300019#S00300"><p>It has happened.  Maybe people might feel that they have the authority; if one is a superintendent or inspector acting, one may feel they have the authority.  Some may have contacted their colleagues, they make an agreement and it is cancelled.  That is not going to happen any more.  The decision is made, the recommendation is made and then it is forwarded to the fixed charge office in Thurles and they are the people who will terminate it, so there can be no fudging on this now.  If I tried to cancel a ticket - as has happened in the past - in the Deputy's area, I could have done that but I cannot do that any more.</p></speech>

I know the Commissioner has given some examples already as to why this might have happened in the sense of people rushing about their business - garda&iacute; are busy - and just not filling them in?  It that what the Commissioner found?</p></speech>

I certainly could not disagree with it.  There might be other reasons, of course, but one would have to concede there was an element of sloppiness in terms of the recording process in a small percentage of cases.  With the Chairman's permission, perhaps I will ask assistant commissioner, Mr. John O'Mahoney, to make an intervention in response to Deputy Harris.</p></speech>

Again, I would have to go check the dates but I think it is July 2010, and I am open to correction there.  Prior to July 2010, the common field was not part of the fixed charge penalty - it was not there.  It was brought in July 2010 as part of a PULSE release to assist with providing more information as to why those were terminated.   If one looks at one's screen today and one looks at an offence that was terminated prior to 2010, one will see a blank screen.  Any incident prior to 2010, if it is looked at today, will show as blank.  One will also see a blank screen where the offences have been terminated in Thurles because it is not a requirement in Thurles.</p></speech>

I accept the 95% or thereabouts figure because we have that roughly in the Comptroller and Auditor General 's report and in the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney's report.  We are homing in on the 2.7%.</p></speech>

We are acknowledging that 95% plus is beyond question but it is the 2.57%.  When I look at some of the information we have been sent and some of the information that has appeared in both reports, it makes sense that garda&iacute; have to apply discretion, and I accept the Commissioner's comments on that.  It makes sense that somebody could be sick once and in a rush or somebody could have a family emergency once and be in a rush or the issue with the bees could happen once but where I have a difficulty is where I see some examples of the same individual having points cancelled on multiple occasions or when I see the same family having points cancelled on multiple occasions and often by the same officer.  That does not sit right with me.  Could the Commissioner comment on that?</p></speech>

I concur with the Deputy's view.  It is the case now that we are trying to bring about a more focused and integrated IT solution to people who are making decisions around cancellations so that they can see this very quickly.  It is a very complicated and convoluted process to get in and check to see whether an individual had received points previously.  That is a piece of work that is going on at the moment and we would hope to bring that matter to conclusion very speedily.  Certainly, it is the case that if a person, for no good reason, has broken the law and been found to be speeding on a consistent basis, then absolutely it should not be tolerated, but in a number of cases where some of these allegations are made, there have been very genuine reasons that the person looking, at face value, could not see beyond a particular screen - persons delivering blood, for example, in an emergency situation-----</p></speech>

Let us take the Commissioner's example of the person with the bees.  I do not mean to trivialise it but that person was speeding, they were breaking the law.  They might have had to rush home but, ultimately, the life of a person is obviously more important than the life of the livestock or of the bees.  If the garda&iacute; decide, with supporting documentation, to apply discretion in that instance, fair enough, that is a judgment call, but if that person - I am not saying they did - came in contact with a garda again, surely it would be a bit much for the garda to apply discretion to the same person twice, if he was speeding and rushing back to deal with the bees again or whatever.  That is the point I am trying to make.  It is about the multiple occasions.</p></speech>

That rate strikes me as particularly high, notwithstanding the explanations Mr. Callinan gave previously and his efforts to address some of the shortcomings.  How does he account for this?  From reading the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and previous examinations of the issue, I understand monthly reports are available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on terminations per district.  Did no one raise a red flag?  I assume this is consistent and not just a spike in one particular period reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Surely those responsible for managing the district identified this as an issue, examined and investigated it and tried to identify what was at issue.  Was that not the case via the monthly reports?</p></speech>

The Commissioner dealt with the issue of allegations in the public domain in respect of family members and relations of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some seven identifiable family members had terminations and there was no direct link made between a family member intervening on the PULSE system and terminating the fixed notice penalty.  Is it the opinion of Mr. Callinan that it is never appropriate for a family member to terminate a fixed notice penalty for another family member in any circumstance?</p></speech>

It is not disseminated to a third party.  There is a technical breach here in regard to doing what they are doing because one should not be on the PULSE computer system, trawling the system, looking for issues unless one has a specific purpose.  The data protection laws are quite specific.  We are afforded great latitude under those laws in terms of the prevention and detection of crime.  What are these individuals doing in their particular place of work?  Obviously, they are charged with the responsibility of protecting the communities where they work.  It is very clear to me from the amount of documentation that I have seen in the assistant commissioner's report that countless hours must have been spent on the computer, searching and printing.  That is clearly wrong.  By any stretch of the imagination, that is wrong.  It is a far different matter if a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na observes something that is wrong, that he or she knows is wrong, and reports that or needs to get into the computer system to find out the particular circumstances surrounding it.  That is one thing but to go into a system and trawl through the system looking for difficulties or perceived wrongdoing is patently wrong.  That is not to say that if a member is aware of wrongdoing and knows that there is wrongdoing, that he or she should not report it.  They are two different things.  Am I making myself clear?</p></speech>

I have one final question.  On a general note, in the context of people driving without insurance, tax or NCT certificates, in this modern age of computers, what strides is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na making in terms of linking up with various databases so that it can identify people who have not paid their car tax, insured their cars, renewed their driving license or put their vehicle through the national car test?  Where is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at in terms of the robustness of its systems?</p></speech>

We are in collaboration with the national fleet database, to which we have access in terms of getting particulars on that.  We have also been collaborating with the Irish Insurance Federation in the context of getting details of insured vehicles.  However, there has been a certain amount of difficulty in this area.  It is very difficult to keep up with changes of ownership and so forth.  We are reviewing that system at present.</p></speech>

I do have a strong view that in matters of this importance where clearly members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are making very serious criminal accusations against other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and producing personal, sensitive, individual data, that this is not an appropriate forum for any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be involved in that exercise to use this committee as a platform.  I fully respect the committee and subscribe to the work it is doing in the context of how people conduct their business in terms of value for money.  I accept loss of revenue streams is part of that but the appropriate person to deal with those issues is the Accounting Officer, namely, the Commissioner.  I do not believe a sergeant, garda, inspector, superintendent or anybody else should be here discussing those matters.  I am a legitimate target for all of those questions.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Callinan is the last person the matter should be discussed with and who should make adjudications on it.  If it were a specific allegation against one person or one matter of discipline relating to the force then that would be fine but Mr. Callinan is aware of the scale of the problem.  We will differ about the numbers.  Mr. Callinan has referred to 10,000, which is approximately 300 a day.</p></speech>

To me, that is systemic, whether Mr. Callinan likes it or not.  If Mr. Callinan says that is unsuitable to be discussed here I suggest that it is perhaps unsuitable to be discussed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well because the finger is being pointed at Mr. Callinan and Assistant Commissioner O&rsquo;Mahoney.  It is saying their force is indulging this practice and it is taking place on their watch.  The people who should make judgments on that surely should be somebody else, some independent body.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.</p> <p>My position is very clear.  Anyone who makes any report of wrongdoing to me, I will deal with it very seriously.  I am sure I speak for my officers beside me and elsewhere when I say that is the case.  We will not be isolating anyone who makes a complaint of wrongdoing against another member of the force.  We have many examples within the disciplinary process where we deal with people who transgressed every year.  We are certainly not perfect, nor would I ever profess to come before this committee and say so.  We have difficult problems.  As one can imagine, in a force of over 13,000, dealing with such complex issues, of course we will have difficulties.  However, the Deputy should be very clear that, from my perspective, as Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I will not allow anyone reporting wrongdoing to be bullied, harassed, intimidated or whatever adverb or adjective the Deputy chooses to use.  That will not happen on my watch.  There is a mechanism and procedure for reporting wrongdoing which should not be going off to a third party with a whole raft of serious allegations, criminal and otherwise, and producing them elsewhere.</p></speech>

However, he spoke in a slightly alarming way that he has control and authority over the force.  Of course, he does.  However, when there is an accusation of a systemic problem, which there is, and the finger is pointed at him and the assistant commissioner, John O'Mahoney, then they are the wrong people to make a judgment on it.  They should have said this is serious, these are multiple allegations and we will refer it to a third party.  The result would be that the public would have confidence in the decisions that have been made as a result.  For the Commissioner to say that it should not come to the Committee of Public Accounts and be left with the Garda is very difficult to justify</p></speech>

That is why we have an inspectorate examining the system and an ombudsman examining how we do our business.  I find there is a certain irony in that the very person charged with policing the security of this State, the person we all put our trust and belief in on a daily basis, the man responsible for all of these serious matters, is the very person who stands accused by the Deputy&rsquo;s submission of not being open and transparent or producing a report as such.  I find that extraordinary.</p><p>  I do respect the notion that garda&iacute;, in certain circumstances, should not be investigating one another.  That is why we have the ombudsman commission to deal with those cases.  Clearly, here, however, we have two people, out of a force of over 13,000, who are making extraordinary and serious allegations.  There is not a whisper anywhere else or from any other member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however, about this corruption, malpractice and other charges levelled against their fellow officers.  Frankly, on a personal level I think it is quite disgusting.</p><p>  That said, I have openly admitted here to this committee that there were difficulties within the system and that we have addressed them.  That is where the Deputy and I will agree to differ, with the greatest of respect.  I do respect what the Deputy is saying to me.</p></speech>

Would it be fair for me to summarise his position as follows?  Of the notices issued, discretion was exercised in 2.57% of cases, a minimal number.  Where there were difficulties, question marks or inconsistences in respect of those, he attributes them to poor record-keeping or confusion among those at the rank of superintendent in respect of the circumstances in which they had the authority to strike off these penalty points.  He agrees with the report of his colleague, Assistant Commissioner John O&rsquo;Mahoney, that there is no evidence at all of wrongdoing, much less criminality.  Is this a fair summation on the issue of the striking out of these penalty points?</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the fact that it was not 300 per day but 30 per day in terms of cancellation of these notices, in view of the fact that seasoned and senior officers with experience and so on were stepping outside of agreed processes, it would be fair to describe this as a systemic issue, rather than isolated incidents or rare occurrences within the system.

He has consistently cited the 1.46 million of these charges that are made and has stated that out of that, there is only a dilemma, an issue or something irregular in respect of approximately 66,500 of them, as though that somehow resolves the matter and indicates the system is okay and there is not a problem.  Does the Commissioner not accept it is this very notion that there is or may be a small percentage of people who, either by virtue of their status in society or their relationship with a particular garda, get special treatment?  Does this not actually go to the heart of the concern?</p></speech>

That 66,407 reflects a three and a half-year period, that distils down to 10,700.  Moreover, as we have described earlier, we have the figures all the way down to less than two per week per district.  If the Deputy believes that to be too many, that is fine and she is entitled to her view.  I am putting it in perspective for her.  What I do not subscribe to is the issue of 5%.  I already have indicated that the 5%, or the 4.55% that Mr. O'Mahoney found in his inquiry, is distilled down further to 2.57%.  Consequently, I have not conceded at any point in our discussion and nor will I concede at any point in the future to the notion that if one knows a garda or a superintendent or an inspector and because of the relationship one has with him or her, matters will be looked after.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I take the view that people must act professionally and where they do not, they are disciplined or are sanctioned in some other fashion.  As far as I am concerned, it is a straight cut.</p></speech>

I am trying to ascertain and establish facts here and it would be of some comfort to people not to so much hear the Commissioner say it is only so many in a given week or a given year because that does not resolve matters.  Arguably, if as many as a single individual enjoys favourable treatment above 1 million others-----</p></speech>

There might be a question mark over making an assertion based only on the PULSE records because there could be other corroborating information, such as letters or submissions of whatever nature.  The Chairman has correctly informed the Commissioner that he can have view of the material that has come before this committee.</p> <p>We are disadvantaged to the extent that we do not have the opportunity to see the kind of corroborating material the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney, and the Commissioner have access to.  The Commissioner mentioned the case of the beekeeper and the livestock by way of illustration.  Would it be possible, in some sample cases where there are question marks that would cause alarm to this committee and others, for us to have an exchange of information in redacted form so that we could see some of that background information?</p></speech>

Part of the exercise we did was examining the information on the PULSE system.  Part of it was also examining the reasons in a sample of 300 notice termination cases.  In those circumstances we arranged, with the co-operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to visit six districts where we asked for files for 50 randomly selected cases.  The reasons that were recorded on those case file include the bees attacking livestock, being late for a religious ceremony and rushing to collect a relative from a bus station.  People have to submit a letter of application for a cancellation, and many of them said the driver was speeding on the way to a hospital or GP appointment or visiting others in hospital.  Those examples are taken from letters that applicants submitted.  We also made the point that in many cases there are circumstances that are capable of further documentation being provided to substantiate the circumstances of the case.  In many cases there was no documentation to substantiate the claims that were made.</p><p>  I take the Commissioner's point that in any circumstances such as this an element of judgement is being made.  I am not trying to second guess the situation.  Another relevant piece of information is shown in figure 7.6 and the disparity between one region and another where there is a difference of 50 to 60 times in the rate of cancellation.  These were the pieces of information I took into account when I arrived at the conclusion I express in 7.81 that, "Absent and inadequate records, and the recorded facts of many cases, give rise to concerns that many cases have been terminated without due cause."  That is as far as I can go in it because I did not interview the individuals involved in the offences or the garda&iacute; involved in making the decisions.  There are also grounds for concern that certain "outside district" cases were terminated without appropriate authority.</p><p>  Earlier, Deputy Deasy asked if we can draw conclusions here without seeing the information.  I am presenting this information.  An exercise has been carried out, the background documentation has been examined, and these are the conclusions I have drawn based on that work.  Deputy McDonald's idea of asking for further redacted information is replicating the work I have done in some of these cases.</p></speech>

The Chairman referred to one or two particularly serious instances where question marks arise over court dates, where we are advised there was no court date, etc.  I take the point that the PULSE system is not a comprehensive account of any individual case.  That is a fair point, but it is equally fair to say that whereas one may feel disadvantaged not having seen the material that has most recently come to this committee, we as committee members are at the disadvantage of not seeing in any form the substantiating material which the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney assure us exists.

I recognise the committee's remit in terms of its responsibility to the taxpayer, of whom I am one.  It is important that I be as open and transparent as I can be about the funding streams allocated to me and the potential loss regarding systems and processes and that I am the appropriate officer to deal with these issues.  If I have a fundamental difficulty with someone who is making the allegations in the first instance being here and discussing them, I would have a similar difficulty with providing further information in that light.  If there is a single ticket item - excuse the pun - or a single issue about which the Deputy might need confirmation in the context of a revenue stream or a matter of that nature, perhaps we can deal with it through correspondence.

I want us to go back now to a conversation we had the last time the Commissioner was here in respect of the whistleblowers and the sequence of events as they unfolded.  The Commissioner said repeatedly here that there are appropriate forums in which a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can bring forward concerns or allegations.  This, of course, is what happened in March 2012, when two serving officers came forward with concerns and allegations in regard to wrongdoing in the writing off of penalty points.  We know that in July of that year - the Comptroller and Auditor General reiterated it this morning - a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na approached his office.  We know that in August 2012, a similar approach was made to the CEO of the Road Safety Authority.  We know that in the autumn of 2012, approaches were made to Members of the Oireachtas and that the public focus on these matters came at that time.</p><p>  On his last visit here, the Commissioner told me, and repeated it today, that these matters came to his attention in December.  I have never heard from the Commissioner, or anybody else, an explanation as to why it took from March until December, not alone for these matters to come to his attention from the confidential recipient, but for any action to be taken.  Will the Commissioner explain that delay to me today?</p></speech>

I had reservations, not having looked at the file for quite some time, on the date the Deputy gave me of March 2012.  When I went back, I pulled the file to have a look see and quite clearly, on 4 April that year - the following month - it was the case that the confidential recipient reported to me, as I have already outlined to the committee, a report he had received in regard to his superintendent, who had cancelled four penalty points.  That was it - sum total.</p></speech>

Meanwhile, the Comptroller and Auditor General had contact from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the CEO of the Road Safety Authority had contact from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Members of the Oireachtas were furnished with information in respect of this matter.

He indicated he was working with the other member at the centre of this particular issue to supply information and documentation to an elected representative.  The sergeant asked him why he was doing it and that he did not think he should be doing it, and they had a conversation.  He reported the matter and this is when I became aware there were two people, as one of them indicated he was working with another member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in trawling a system looking for wrongdoing and reporting it to an elected representative.  This was the first occasion I became aware of it.  Following on this, and within a week or so, on 14 December I sent a direction to both individuals and told them - I directed them - to desist from what they were doing, that they were in breach of the Data Protection Act and probably other offences also, and if they had any issues, problems or complaints that they should contact the assistant commissioner dealing with a very wide investigation on wrongdoing, without prejudice - and this is important - to their entitlement to go to the confidential recipient.  This is important.  We heard nothing from them until one of them used the anti-fraud process in June last year.  Previous to that, before the Assistant Commissioner embarked on his allegations inquiry, one of them had gone through the anti-fraud process.</p></speech>

The reason by the way that this element is so important is that, in respect of accountability structures, provisions and protections for whistleblowers are essential, albeit as an action of last resort.  The Commissioner said it is extraordinary that only two officers came forward out of a force of 13,000 officers.  Others have responded that it would be extraordinary if more than two came forward given the nature of these matters.  For me, the case for the committee to hear from the whistleblower or whistleblowers is now compelling.  I have not yet heard testimony from either individual but I am certain from what I know that they would strenuously contest that account and defend the position that they acted absolutely within the procedures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including making a full report to the confidential recipient.  The committee needs to get to the bottom of that matter.</p><p>  The Commissioner expressed concern about the use of the committee as a platform from which individuals might exploit opportunities to make wild allegations or unsubstantiated claims.  Looking at the matter from the point of view of whistleblowers and in a balanced and objective way, we cannot allow the committee to become a platform from which to disparage or cast question marks over the good name of those two individuals who came forward.  Does the Commissioner appreciate that?</p></speech>

We can just leave it at that.  I will put one or two questions to the Commissioner.  I will not delay because we have had a long session.</p><p>  I made a public statement about whistleblowers and how they are treated and so on.  I, therefore, feel obliged to address it in this forum before we end the meeting.  Both whistleblowers have approximately 30 years experience but my interpretation of their side of the story is they came across wrongdoing as they saw it and they decided they were going to take proof for evidence from the PULSE system.  They then used the mechanisms open to them relating to the confidential recipient and so on and they put their case.  For some reason or reasons, they lost confidence in the system of reporting and then they obviously decided to make the information available publicly to Oireachtas Members and they quoted various Acts for doing that.  Does that not explain, in the context of the volume of information that is now in the public domain, the lack of confidence they had in the system and their desire because of their commitment to the Garda and their belief in the uniform they wore, that when the saw this, they wanted to report it and they wanted action taken?  They were not convinced by action that was taken.</p><p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Mahoney said he did not speak to either individual and I understand the Commissioner issued a directive.  Did the Commissioner and Mr. O'Mahoney not speak to each other?  Is there not room to discuss with a serving officer the issues he raised?  Where stands that type of approach?  Would Mr. Callinan, as the boss, not contact the whistleblower and invite him into his office for a chat?  I ask this in the context of what would happen in any normal business.</p></speech>

The Chairman already adverted to the fact that these individuals in question are experienced members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They know many people, far and wide, and if they had chosen to knock on my door at any moment in time, by God, I would have that door opened, I would be sitting them down and I would be investigating the allegations very thoroughly.</p></speech>

In the correspondence, one of the whistleblowers writing to us today states: "I discovered over 200 senior Garda officers terminating fixed charge notices inappropriately and, in most cases, corruptly."  This is going to appear as part of the documentation submitted to members of the committee.  I would have thought the reaction to something like that would be for the Commissioner or his senior officers to call them in and ask how they discovered this information, although we know how they discovered it, and investigate whether the information stands up in any way.  The information is causing damage to the force but I have to rely on the fact that the two individuals have 30 years experience.  The individual who described himself as a serving sergeant states: "Having been treated the way I was for reporting the above [which is all of what we spoke about earlier in the meeting] I don't think I would do it again. It destroyed me, my career and my family."  Given the years of service and the structure of the force, is it not time for one of the bosses to speak to these individuals?</p></speech>

Now that the Chairman has raised the issue, one of these people contacted me in April 2013 and wanted to know why I had not interviewed him as part of the investigation.  That was when it became public that my investigation had been forwarded to the Minister.  At that stage, I spoke with him and asked him again that if he had any information I would be willing to listen to him, to sit down and to give him a fair hearing.  That was on 23 April.  Subsequently, for somebody who did not have confidence to report within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, he did report through our fraud policy in June 2013.</p> <p>He reported somewhere in the region of 17 separate allegations relating to three members.  A full-scale investigation was carried out into the matter under a chief superintendent and a file was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.</p><p> Further on my answer to Deputy McDonald's question on whether I engaged, I did not engage because I had information from the PULSE system.  Bear in mind that I was doing my examination and finding that, in most cases but not all, what was on PULSE did not accurately reflect what these people were alleging.  In fairness, if they had had the full information, they might not have made the allegations.  I had that information.  Bearing in mind the issue of confidential reporters and confidential recipients and honouring that system - indeed, one of these people is still anonymous or has not gone public - I would have gone back to the Commissioner had I any reason to interview those people and asked him whether I could find out for definite who they were.  I would have certainly engaged with them during the course of my investigation.  That was prior to 28 March.</p></speech>

If something goes wrong on the floor of my factory, I find out the name of the person who might be involved and ask him or her into my office for a discussion, particularly when the information being put into the public domain is damaging my company.  I am not telling Mr. Callinan how to do his job, as I would not dare do that, but this would appear to be the commonsensical, simple way to deal with the matter.</p><p>  When one analyses this situation, there is not much difference between the type of material that the Comptroller and Auditor General or Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney examined and what is available to the committee.  However, it has been made available everywhere.  It is out there.  Surely someone needs to discuss with the person or persons the reasons he or they are putting it out there and look at the names, Garda numbers and so on involved to see whether this man's case stands up.  I am only asking from a practical point of view.  Can someone not bring about a resolution to that in this way?  Of the two whistleblowers, one with whom we have been dealing has asked to appear before the committee next Thursday.  We must deal with it in private or public session and reflect on what has been said today.  The members want to hear from that whistleblower, but not to know names, places or how something happened.  For example, the whistleblower referred to file No. 204, whatever that means, and stated that attached were a number of tickets terminated for the first ten months of 2012 and that, having taken a generous percentage off, some 25%, the amount of revenue lost was serious at &euro;720,000.  We do not know whether this is right or wrong.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the 2014 Revised Estimates for public services, Vote 37 - Social Protection.  The Revised Estimate contains information on how money allocated for each programme in 2014 is to be spent, along with the Estimate for 2013; the number of staff connected with the programme in 2014 and how this compares with 2013; performance-related information, with departmental key outputs and context and impact indicators for 2014 and the corresponding information for 2013.  Information is also provided in regard to the Social Insurance Fund and appropriations-in-aid.</p><p>  Consideration of the Revised Estimates provides us with an opportunity to review whether targets set in the distribution of moneys across the Vote are appropriate in all the circumstances and demonstrate best use of resources.  A timetable for today's meeting has been circulated.  It allows for a brief opening statement by the Minister followed by a discussion on each programme listed in the Estimate.  To ensure we do not spend lengthy periods on any particular programme, I ask members to ensure they ask questions relevant only to the programme under discussion.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I now invite the Minister for make her opening statement. </p></speech>

My officials have provided detailed briefing material for the use of the committee at this meeting.  This builds on the changed format introduced last year and is designed to better reflect the new performance-budgeting approach to the Estimates process.<br />Understandably, there has been huge concern about high levels of unemployment and the associated costs in recent years.  However, leaving aside the financial challenges posed by unemployment, the scale and scope of the Department's other expenditure, including its critical role in the social and economic life of the country, is not always fully appreciated in public discourse.  As a starting point today, it is useful to examine the Department's expenditure on its various programmes in 2014.  These are outlined in table 1 of page 3 of the briefing.  <br />The biggest single block of expenditure in 2014 will be on pensions, amounting to &euro;6.5 billion or just over 33% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on working<b></b>age income supports,<b></b>including jobseeker's and one-parent family payments, accounts for some 25% of overall expenditure or &euro;4.9 billion.  Expenditure on working age employment supports,<b></b>including T&uacute;s, community employment and various employment supports, accounts for more than &euro;1.07 billion or 5.5% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure provision for illness, disability and<b></b>carers accounts for more than &euro;3.3 billion or almost 17% of expenditure in 2014.  In total, payments to carers will amount to almost &euro;806 million, which is a significant increase.  Expenditure on children and families<b></b>accounts for nearly 12% of expenditure or just over &euro;2.3 billion.  Some &euro;281 million will be spent on family income supplement, which is provided to people on low wages, with children.  This is an increase of some &euro;52 million on the allocation for 2013.  Expenditure on supplementary payments, agencies and miscellaneous services<b></b>accounts for &euro;926 million or 4.7% of overall expenditure.  The principal items in this category include rent and mortgage interest supplement, the household benefit package, free travel and the fuel allowance.<br />On claims processing, members may recall that at last year's meeting regarding consideration of the Estimates concern was expressed about delays in processing payments, particularly in relation to certain schemes.  These backlogs must be seen in the context of the huge additional administrative impact of the recession, with which the Department has had to deal in the past five years.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the live register rose by 127,000 in the first six months of 2009, an unprecedented level of increase, and by 253,000 over the three-year period from end-2007 to end-2010.  Dealing with numbers of this magnitude - made up mostly of persons who had not previously been in receipt of unemployment benefits or had ever seen the inside of a social welfare office - has been a significant ongoing administrative challenge.  To address the backlogs in relation to certain schemes, we set a target last year for significantly reducing delays in respect of four schemes in particular, namely, carer's allowance, invalidity pension, disability allowance and family income supplement.  I am pleased to say that the backlogs have in the main been significantly reduced.  Table 15 of the briefing shows that the number of pending claims at the end of 2013 had reduced year-on-year by 68% in the case of carer's allowance, with a much bigger spend and numbers as a consequence; 45% in the case of invalidity pension and 35% in the case of disability allowance. </p> <p>Furthermore, the family income supplement, FIS, scheme is now totally up to date and delivering a fast and efficient service to families on low incomes with children and working parents.  Table 18 shows that first-time FIS claims pending at year-end are down by 72% year-on-year, while renewals pending are down by 86%.  All first-time claims and renewals are now processed promptly on receipt.  That is conditional on people giving the information required, as Deputies will appreciate.  Major progress has also been made in other areas, and the clearance of backlogs, as well as prompt processing in all areas, will continue to be a key priority in the Department.<br />It is essential that we maintain public confidence in the welfare system by vigorously tackling any fraudulent activity.  The vast majority of people on social welfare are claiming only the correct entitlement due to them.  However, a small minority are not and a range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that control activity is appropriately focused.  In this regard, fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced in recent years and are subject to continuing review.  Overall, this is resulting in less opportunity to commit fraud and less chance of claims being in payment at an incorrect rate through fraud or error.  Approximately 1.1 million reviews were carried out in both 2012 and 2013, and the savings achieved in 2013 were &euro;632 million<b></b>or approximately 5% less than those achieved in 2012.  This is the prevention of expenditure that would have taken place if the control and checking had not been done.  This outcome is not unexpected given the decline in the live register, with people going back to work, and it demonstrates that the Department's more intense control focus in recent years is having a positive preventative impact on the level of fraud and error in the social welfare system.<br />Factors which have contributed to preventing and reducing levels of fraud and error have included the following examples.  One-parent family claims are now dealt with in local offices and all customers are reviewed annually to verify their ongoing entitlement - to ensure the relationship status has not changed or that a person has not gone back to work, for example.  Systems and data exchanges between the Department and other State bodies are being enhanced on an ongoing basis, and the Department is now acting on information received through these links in a more timely manner.  Commencement of employment information from the Revenue Commissioners is now received weekly and acted upon automatically.  Prisoner data is now exchanged weekly, and if somebody is sentenced and sent to jail, the data is passed to us.<i></i>The integration of the General Register Office into the Department has resulted in the timely notification of births, deaths and marriages to the payment systems.  If people have a baby, the processing of their child benefit claim is really fast nowadays.  Looking ahead, the control savings target for 2014 will be finalised shortly in the context of a new fraud initiative covering the period 2014 to 2018. The latter is currently in preparation and is expected to be launched in April 2014.<br />I will now turn to the ongoing roll-out of the public services card, PSC.  This has been introduced to enable people gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving people's privacy to the maximum extent possible.  The card is designed to replace other cards within the public sector, such as the free travel pass and the social services card of this Department.  It will make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers and cut down on multiple claiming.  One of the other key benefits relates to the robustness of the identity registration process in order to minimise abuse.  The registration process includes facial image matching in order to prevent a person using more than one identity, which is a key deterrent with regard to potential abuse.  It is already proving successful, with a number of cases detected in which individuals were using various identities to make multiple claims in different offices.<br />The card is a key initiative in the new public service reform plan.  Discussions on the expansion of the public service card to other public service customer bases are being advanced.  The roll-out to pensioners has already commenced, and in February an additional postal registration process is being introduced and will be offered to an additional 200,000 people over 66 years of age who are in receipt of a Department pension and paid at a post office in 2014.  The process will involve a minimum of inconvenience to the customer.  Approximately 515,000 cards have been produced and are in use, and it is intended to issue cards to 3 million of the adult population by the end of 2016.<br />Turning back to unemployment, tackling this problem remains the Government's number one priority for the foreseeable future, but we are moving decisively in the right direction.  Last October, the live register fell below 400,000 for the first time since December 2008, and there was further improvement in November and December.  In live register terms, we are back to the rate from 2007 and 2008, which is great news for the people who are going back to work.  This will also significantly reduce the pressure on social welfare expenditure.  The standardised unemployment rate is now 12.4%, very close to the European average.  Although it is still much too high, this rate is still remarkable, as at the height of the unemployment crisis it was as high as 15%.  The positive trend in the reduction in the number of people on the live register is to be welcomed.<br />Recent CSO data showed that more than a thousand people a week are returning to work, which is proof that the measures taken by the Government to stabilise the economy and address the unemployment crisis we inherited are paying off.  There is still no room for any sense of complacency, as unemployment is still at a very high level.  In particular, the number of people who are long-term unemployed is a significant cause for concern, as past experience suggests that people who are long-term unemployed face the greatest challenges in securing employment, even during periods of economic recovery.  New entrants to the labour force may well be selected by employers, for example, in preference to the long-term unemployed, so the role of employers in helping people back to work and assisting the Department with the various schemes we operate is critical.  This is where the Pathways to Work strategy overseen by the Department will continue to play a crucial role.  Through Pathways to Work I am confident that we will build on the progress made to date and ensure the number of people, including young people, taking up or returning to work continues to increase.  Key to the success of Pathways to Work is the continuing roll-out of the new integrated employment and support service, Intreo.  There are now 43 offices up and running, with a further 17 to come before the end of this year.  The Intreo one-stop shops facilitate jobseekers in accessing income and employment supports in one place for the first time.  Intreo also offers a range of supports to employers who are seeking to find new staff, such as the wage subsidy scheme JobsPlus.  I appeal to all members when they are meeting employers to remind them of the Intreo service, which is a public employment service free at the point of use and access, as we want them to take it up.  It includes valuable schemes such as JobsPIus and can convey the calibre of candidates on the live register.<br />I have touched on just some of the key developments in 2013 and priorities for the year ahead.  I look forward to our discussion in that regard.  I thank the staff from the Department, who have worked to clear all the backlogs in a time of unprecedented demand.  We have also managed to transform many of our information technology services, and the staff have been enormously co-operative in achieving that goal while serving the people who use the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I add my congratulations to the hardworking staff in the Department on the work they have been doing, particularly in respect of backlogs.  There is still some work to be completed but much good work has been done and I acknowledge that.</p><p>  There has been much discussion about the potential burden that pensions will place on the Exchequer and on society in the years to come due to the demographics.  I note the projected increase in expenditure on pensions from last year to this year is very slight at less than 1%, but I presume that will change as the years pass.  Nevertheless, it represents one third of social protection expenditure, which is a significant proportion.  From 1 January last, a person who reaches 65 years of age this year will no longer be able to apply for a transition pension.  What does the Department expect to save?  Whatever the gross saving might be, I contend that the net saving will be far less.  If somebody turns 65 and does not have a job and cannot get the transition pension, obviously they will have to access some other social welfare payment.  I expect that accounts for the great majority of them.</p><p>  In the summer legislative programme there is further proposed legislation on pensions.  Will the Minister give us an idea of what she has in mind for that?  I was not aware that we would be dealing with further legislation on pensions in this session, so perhaps she will give an indication of what is intended in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.803" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300005#D00300"><p>Table 3 on page 6 gives the summary.  Deputies will see that for the State contributory pension there is extra spending of &euro;160 million provided for this year.  Members of the committee will be aware that every year of the three years I have been involved in budgets I have had to provide between &euro;160 million and up to &euro;190 million in extra spending on the extra numbers of people in our population who become entitled to the contributory pension or the lesser numbers who become entitled to a non-contributory pension.  The extra cost to the State over the next five years for pensions for people over 66 years of age and also widow's and widower's pensions is estimated at approximately &euro;1 billion.  It is in the order of &euro;1 billion every five years.  That is a cost the Department must meet, and in times of very straitened resources we must do that largely out of existing envelopes of expenditure.</p><p>  With regard to the State transition pension, the Deputy will know, because he was a member of the Government at the time, that a Green Paper and a pensions paper were produced in 2007 and 2009 which indicated, based on the actuarial studies, that there would be a greater cost for pensions in Ireland for the Irish State because of the growing number of older people in the population.  More of them are insured, which is fantastic.  They constitute a growing number in the overall numbers of people becoming entitled to the State pension.  They are also living longer.  The last actuarial review of the social insurance fund, which I published in 2012, showed that the shortfall was in the order of &euro;1.5 billion in terms of expenditure.  Since then, with some changes in PRSI, we have narrowed that gap, but the additional cost over the next five years will be &euro;1 billion overall.</p><p>  In respect of people reaching 65 years of age, the Deputy will recall that in the social welfare Bill we passed recently in the context of the budget, I changed the arrangements for people over 62 years of age.  Most Deputies strongly approved of it.  People over 62 years of age on jobseeker's allowance now just have to go to their local Intreo or social welfare office and sign on once a year.  If they wish, they can get their money by electronic fund transfer.  They do not have to take part in activation arrangements; they can if they wish, but they are not obliged to do so.  With regard to people who turn 65 years old, if they qualify for a jobseeker's benefit, that continues undisturbed for the year.  The Deputy is correct that a significant number of people might well be on other types of social welfare payment.  They will continue on those for the year and then transit at 66 years of age.</p><p>  In 2012, 11,130 people were awarded the State transition pension.  Of these, just 1,390 came from employment and 50.63% or 5,635 came from another social welfare payment.  Previously, the same trends were broadly identified in 2006 and 2007.  Members should also recall that there are many Irish people who are retired, particularly in the United Kingdom, who might have worked for parts of their working life in the Republic.  They would also apply at relevant ages for whatever entitlements they might have built up during their time working in Ireland.</p></speech>

From time to time technical changes arise; for example, in many of the recent Bills they related to European requirements regarding pension directives and so forth which periodically we incorporate, as we are required to do, into Irish legislation.  There are some technical pension amendments in almost every case.  Obviously, the last big piece of work we did in the D&aacute;il was the work done before Christmas specifically regarding pensions.  There were a couple of small social welfare adjustments in that as well.  As of now, there are no substantial changes pending.  We are largely incorporating European regulations and changes into Irish law as they arise.</p></speech>

There is no necessary pension legislation at this point in time, but it is a holding title on the legislation on which work is being done.  We had a previous experience where we did not include "pensions" in the title, as the Deputy will recall, and subsequently that was required.  In fact, there was a discussion about it on the floor of the House, so since then I have tended to use "Social Welfare and Pensions" as a working title and then to proceed depending on the detailed contents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.808" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300005#D00800"><p>I thank the Minister.  I do not have major questions on pensions, just a comment.  Obviously, a substantial amount of the money in this budget goes on contributory pensions.  Of the &euro;6.5 billion or so, it is &euro;5.5 billion.  It is a return to people who have paid into the social insurance fund.  They are getting back what they paid or invested over their working lives.  That will obviously change at a later stage with the changes the Minister has introduced, when the higher contributions that people must have take effect.</p> <p>Over the past number of years there has been a tightening up.  Obviously that has not been reflected in these Estimates as there will not be a substantial change this year.  </p><p> I have a specific question on the administration costs of the pension section even though I know that we will deal with administration later in the meeting.  We have discussed private pension funds and the great administrative costs they impose on the people who take out private pensions.  The State manages to administer a complex pension system, particularly the contributory pension, and has managed to keep the cost down to 2.9% - I refer to the overall cost to the Department.  In some ways that suggests it would be more positive, or we would be better off, if we moved towards the proposal put forward by the Minister and others for a second pension or second auto-enrolment.  Also, I believe that the administration of same should be retained within the Department, given its skills in administering pensions at a low cost to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.810" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300006#E00200"><p>First I will answer the Deputy's query about the changes in required contributions.  I wish to draw attention again to the fact that the KPMG actuarial review in 2012 stated that the pensioner support ratio in Ireland is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual person of pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and 2.1 workers by 2060.  In other words, the number of people at work is in decline relative to the number of people on pensions.</p><p>  With regard to the number of contributions required, the legislation regarding the 520 contributions was passed in 1997.  It had a very long lead time: part of it was implemented in the early 2000s and the next part of it fell to be legislated for in 2012, to come into effect in 2013.  One must plan for pensions because it is so important to have an adequate income for people in retirement.  It is a fact that, as we move forward, we require people to have 520 contributions and to have contributions over a ten-year period.  In a lot of cases in Ireland we required a much lesser period, plus we gave credits to people who were out of the labour force because of particular home duties.  As the number of workers is declining relative to the number of pensioners, if we want people to have the kinds of pensions that they and we aspire to then we need to ensure that we have a sufficiency of contribution.  </p><p>  I commissioned the OECD to carry out a review of the Irish pension system.  It found that Ireland provides a very strong level of State pension, which is a good thing about Ireland.  All political parties have been in agreement and have strongly supported the situation.  The OECD suggested that Ireland should have a supplementary pension contributory system on either a mandatory enrolment or an auto-enrolment basis.  As I have told Deputies before, the Department has carried out very detailed work and is discussing it with colleagues in the Department of Finance, because this matter is really important for people's futures and for when they retire.  I am in discussion within Government on how best to progress the idea over a period, particularly as the economy improves.  Obviously a supplementary pension is a way for people to save more money for their pensions.  Some 50% of people in work have no pension cover other than State pension cover.  If some people do not have enough contributions they will find themselves receiving a very low rate of payment on retirement. </p><p>  As we speak we are changing the governance of the pensions regulator.  One of the things that I want the new pensions council to focus on is pension charges, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned.  I commissioned a report on pension charges in Ireland.  It was the first time the matter was formally examined by the Department of Social Protection and the report indicated that questions must be answered.  We need to ensure that people who save for their pensions, perhaps through deductions from their wages by themselves and by their employers, get the best value.  It is something we will return to, because we want more people saving for pensions.  We do not want the pensions industry ripping people off with bad-value deals.  For example, silent costs can be relatively high, which leads to people discovering, on retirement, that they have paid significant sums in various fees and charges and ending up with a lower pension than they thought they were contributing to.</p></speech>

I was not sure what today's meeting was about but I gather that it is a presentation of what was stated in the budget and how measures are implemented.</p><p>  I wish to raise a few issues regarding pending claims for the invalidity or disability pension.  We have discovered that there is not a one-size-fits-all pension.  To qualify for an invalidity pension one must fit the criteria set down by the welfare office.  Sometimes people do not meet the criteria, and I want to ask the Minister how her Department deals with such cases.  A person applying for the invalidity pension must prove that he or she has been out of work for at least a year.  A doctor must confirm that is the case, but many doctors do not like making such a claim because they may not know what the illness is.  I have heard about a couple of such cases in my office.  I know the Minister cannot discuss individual cases but I seek her overall view of the matter.  A situation seems to have developed whereby applications for an invalidity or disability pension are returned for review or appeal and more letters from consultants, doctors and specialists must be supplied.  Is that the case?  How are the criteria being implemented in the relevant sections in her Department?</p><p>  The Minister mentioned that 1,000 people are returning to work per month.</p></speech>

The last matter raised by the Deputy relates to a later programme.  Is it okay if the Minister responds to the Deputy's questions on pensions now?</p></speech>

Will the same system apply if the pension age is extended to 68?  What will happen to the jobseeker's allowance in 2018 when a person reaches 67 years?  Will the scheme be extended for a year after a person reaches the age of 66?  Does the Minister understand my questions?</p></speech>

We sent all of our material to the Clerk of the Committee over a week ago.  I do not know if the Deputy's personal assistant has had an opportunity to examine the material.  We have forwarded a lot of documentation and information, as requested by the committee.</p> <p>If someone is coming up to pension age, he or she should send his or her details to the Department, as most people do, some three months before he or she expects to retire.  He or she can be assured of a first-class service because the structures for establishing old-age pension entitlements are very good, particularly those for insurance based contributory pensions, with which there are not many difficulties.  Persons who have not made contributions and are looking for a non-contributory pension often have to supply more information.  If people want to know where they stand, they can approach our offices and we will try to give them the information.  Sometimes they have broken periods of employment and the employers have long since gone out of business.  We do an awful lot of work to help people.  Some 93% of contributory pensions are awarded within five weeks of application.  This is a significant payment which carries other entitlements.  It is, therefore, a very good processing time.  If people want information in advance to check their status or look back on different periods of employment, the staff of the Department are very helpful in providing assistance.</p></speech>

The Minister has recognised the uniqueness of the group in accepting that it can avail of jobseeker's benefit for the full year.  There is a recognition of its position.  Another group arrives at the age of 65 years in the expectation that it will be on the transitional pension ahead of receipt of the full contributory State pension.  People in this group who are already unemployed, receiving jobseeker's allowance and have been means tested in respect of a working spouse have an extra year in which they receive nothing, as they do not qualify on the basis of the spouse's income.  Is there some way of giving them some recognition in the same way as has been done for those in receipt of jobseeker's benefit?  I am talking about the contributory pension.</p></speech>

If people do not qualify for jobseeker's allowance in the first place, they are unlikely to qualify for a non-contributory pension, perhaps because one of the people involved is working.</p></speech>

It is means tested and I have no proposals to change this.  The changes to pension age were broadly set out in the financial framework of 2011 which followed a Green Paper and a paper on pensions launched by the Department in 2007 and 2010.  They were broadly agreed to by everyone and, subsequently, when the country entered into difficulties, it was one of the items agreed to in the financial framework in 2011.  This was indicated in the information given to the IMF at the time.  Recognising the cost of pensions in Ireland and other countries and making sure over a period of time that we provide for pensions is absolutely fundamental in ensuring sustainable finances from a market point of view.  The changes in Ireland were widely welcomed and acknowledged by observers of the economy in terms of its rating.</p></speech>

We engage in consultation with people with disabilities and organisations that represent those with disabilities.  At official level we frequently sit down with organisations to discuss how the structures work.  I have received, on behalf of the Department, positive feedback from members of all parties represented in the House on the system for awarding invalidity pensions and, specifically, dealing with the backlog.  Deputies have spoken privately and publicly on the floor of the House to thank staff in the Department for dealing with the backlog.  I do not quite understand the point made.  We inherited a difficult situation because of the explosion in the overall number of claims in respect of the vast number of people who became unemployed.</p><p>  Medical assessments are carried out by qualified medical practitioners.  It is based on what an individual's medical advisers have advised the medical assessor.  When people make claims, they do not always bring forward all elements supporting the application.  When assisting someone to make an application successfully, it is important that all of the medical information indicating why he or she should be awarded an invalidity pension be submitted as early as possible.  The medical review and assessment service is the principal control mechanism for the illness and disability schemes administered by the Department.  Medical assessors carry out desk assessments of medical evidence and reports which are supplied by clients.  Where required, they conduct in-person assessments in order to provide a second medical opinion for the guidance of deciding and appeals officers.  All assessments are carried out in accordance with the accepted guidelines of the Irish Medical Council.</p> <p>It is very much dependent on the medical evidence, on the medical assessor assessing that evidence and then advising on how the application should be dealt with.  The deciding officer has no capacity in the context of the technical, medical evidence submitted.  The deciding officer gets advice from the medical assessor and makes his or her decision accordingly.  </p><p> A lot of work has been done in recent years on the forms to make sure they are readable.  We have taken on board advice on the use of plain English and on the style of the forms.  We have made every effort to ensure that those filling out the forms or those assisting them are given accurate, up-to-date and complete information.  That assists people in submitting their claims.</p></speech>

Looking at the overall figures here, the provisional outturn for 2013 for expenditure in this area was &euro;5.5 billion while the projected outturn for the current year is &euro;4.883 billion, representing a reduction of 11.2% which is quite significant.  What rate of unemployment is the Minister projecting?  I have a few more questions but perhaps the Minister would like to answer that one now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.830" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300008#G00600"><p>Yes, I can give the Deputy the numbers.  The rate of unemployment will be a function of the numbers of people at work in the economy, immigration, emigration and so forth.  Last year, the average live register figure was 419,000.  As I said in my opening statement, in October of last year, the register fell below 400,000 for the first time.  The register is somewhat seasonal and goes up and down at different times of the year.  It rises, for instance, at this time of the year for a period and then falls again as the weather improves and so on.  There are seasonal variations in the register.  With that in mind, the projected average that we are working on for this year is 390,000.  I must stress that the figure is an average.  At this time of year, in deepest winter, the average will be higher than that but when we come into the summer and early autumn, we would expect the average to fall significantly.  We expect the fall to be significant from autumn onwards and into the pre-Christmas period.</p><p>  The average unemployment rate was 12.4% based on the last available figures.  Given that the last published European average unemployment rate was just over 12%, we are now moving very close to the European mean.  While that is a very high unemployment rate, it compares very favourably to where we were drifting towards, which was over 15%.  When the Government came into office in 2011, the big fear then was that the live register would hit 500,000.  In the event, it never did but 12.4% is very high.  Obviously, the rate is even higher for younger people.  We have an enormous job of work to do to get more people back to work.  To reiterate, the figure last year was 419,000 and this year it is 390,000.  That places a very significant demand on the Department.  If we achieve those numbers on the live register, we will achieve very significant savings.</p></speech>

The most significant change in that regard is the reduction in the income disregard which means, in plain English, that if a lone parent goes out to work, that work, which is often part-time, will be less valuable and he or she will get less money.  I fail to see how that is an incentive.  It is a disincentive.</p><p>  It is projected that spending on supplementary welfare allowances and exceptional needs payments will be reduced by &euro;2.1 million.  What was the total spend on these last year?  As the Minister will be aware, there is an anomaly in the FIS system whereby if someone is eligible for FIS, the payment continues for 12 months, even if that person's circumstances change completely within a matter of weeks.  A person may no longer be entitled to a FIS payment but will receive it for 12 months, regardless.  Equally, another person may be entitled to a greater payment than the one he or she is receiving but the rate stays the same for 12 months.  I understand the administrative difficulties involved in addressing that but has any effort been made in that regard?  </p><p>  Finally, in the context of JobPath, what is the ratio of officers to unemployed people at the moment?</p></speech>

Let us take a lone parent with one child who is offered a job which pays &euro;300 per week.  If that parent applies for FIS, he or she will get an additional &euro;120 per week.  More and more lone parents who are now in work are very significant beneficiaries of FIS.  The significance of that is that if a lone parent is offered extra hours or a higher rate of pay, for instance, he or she can take that up because the FIS payment is static for a year, as the Deputy already pointed out.  We are now up to date with current and under-review FIS applications.  Quite a big backlog had built up.</p><p>  Self-employed people who become unemployed or farmers who suffer a catastrophic change in their income circumstances, due for example to bad weather, can now bring information to the Department on their current circumstances.  In the past, such people had to provide information on previous years, including their accounting records, tax returns and so forth.  People in that category now have quite a significant potential entitlement to a social welfare payment.</p><p>  On the FIS, we would like to make the system more flexible.  The advisory group on tax and social welfare is, at the request of my Department and the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach, looking at the interactions as they apply now with regard to FIS to try to make it as attractive as possible for people to go back to work.  We have not had any further major systems changes since we last discussed this issue, except that we are now bang up to date, which is enormously helpful to people.</p> <p>Of those who exited the one parent family schemes in July 2013, some 1,500 or 24% transferred to family income supplement, FIS, while others transferred to the jobseeker's allowance.  Let me emphasise that next year we will spend in excess of &euro;280 million on FIS which is an enormous help to families who are offered low paid work.  Recently I was on the radio programme, "Today with Sean O Rourke" in which Paddy O'Gorman had live clips from the social welfare office in Navan.  Two or three of those interviewed were men with partners or spouses and children who said that around Navan much of the work on offer was minimum wage which was for single people, but in fact, with a FIS top-up the income of a couple with three children in which one partner worked 39 hours a week at the minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour, would be an additional &euro;225 a week.  Neither employers nor people who are unemployed understand that.  There is a commitment to pay it for a year after which time it is reviewed and will depend on one's circumstances.  The top-up of &euro;225 a week for a person who works for 39 hours a week on the minimum wage makes it comparable with other work.  In all of the new Intreo offices we now prepare for people "a better off in work" statement.  The Deputy may have seen an example of it on the day we were in Limerick.  That allows somebody to put in their details, including partner and children and to show his or her entitlement to FIS, having worked for 39 hours at &euro;8.65 per hour.  A single parent with one child who earned &euro;300 a week would get a top-up of &euro;120.  It is a significantly generous payment.  That is the reason that lone parents, in particular, are turning to it.  Many employers use the minimum wage as a baseline but pay two or three euro above it </p><p> I did not answer one of Deputy O'Dea's questions.  We have more than doubled the number of case officers working with unemployed people on activation measures.  We are considering working through some external partners and a tendering and information process has been under way for some time.  There was a meeting in the Department in early January for further information on potential tenderers but because of the very significant numbers of people who are still unemployed and the opportunities that are there, I would be anxious to increase the actual number of case officers dealing with people.  The number has doubled.</p><p> I will now deal with the issue of urgent needs payments and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  An applicant for a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme now has an appointment for a meeting in offices that have converted to the Intreo system.  The actual number of supplementary welfare allowance payments has fallen very dramatically because people now come in with the correct information.  I think Deputy O'Dea might be aware of it now from the way the system is working in Limerick, the people can be dealt with and go on to their appropriate payment very rapidly, sometimes without recourse to SWA at all.  What we are also doing is that as the Intreo offices roll out we are having community welfare officers on hand in the large Intreo offices to deal with people who have special needs payments.  In fact the volume of people on supplementary welfare is falling very dramatically.</p><p> We issued guidelines to all the staff in January, setting out recommended maximum amounts for supplementary welfare payments.  The recommended maximum amounts do not affect the discretion available to individual officers if he or she comes across particular hardship.</p><p> The urgent needs payment is a payment that can be made to persons who would not be entitled ordinarily to SWA, for instance people affected by the aftermath of the recent floods or a domestic fire in which their immediate needs may not covered by insurance.  It is possible to make urgent needs payments for absolutely required domestic items such as a cooker, help with the heating system or in a fire or flood with food, clothing, fuel and so on that may have been destroyed.  In that case the legislation also provides that the urgent need payment can be recovered in whole or in part if the person is working or the loss is subsequently covered by insurance.  Last year the amount of money spent on special needs payments was a relatively modest &euro;102,000.  The payment on the ENPs last year was &euro;35.6 million.  In 2014, we have provided an Estimate for &euro;31.3 million, a reduction of about &euro;4 million.  The Deputy may recall that community welfare officers worked for the HSE and we supplied the funding.  More than 1,000 of them joined the Department of Social Protection in October 2011 and are now fully integrated into the Department.  Many of them have now become employment officers because they have very important and significant skills and experience of interviewing people.  We are grouping the resources of the community welfare officers in the new Intreo offices to which people come in regularly.  That has actually led to very significant efficiencies and, as a consequence, reductions in expenditure.  In fact many of those people are now working helping people to get back into employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.836" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300009#H00200"><p>I have follow-on questions.  I will stick to the exceptional needs payments, in particular the fact that changes in what was categorised as an exceptional need led to a substantial reduction in what was paid out.  The Estimate for last year was more than &euro;45 million but &euro;35 million was spent.  If the community welfare officers are now being located in Intreo offices, is it making it more difficult for people to access the community welfare officers?  It is not a problem in an urban area but in the past community welfare officers seemed to be more accessible.  I have had a number of complaints in the past week and I am still processing the difficulties in accessing community welfare officers for exceptional needs payments.  I presume that some of this will have been triggered by clearance following on from the storms of recent days.  I will forward the details to the Minister.  Will the community welfare officers in Intreo offices be as available as they were in the past?  There is also the issue of capacity as the Department rolls out the Intreo offices.</p> <p>If one knows how many people each official in an Intreo office is allocated, one can predict how many staff will be required to operate at the capacity needed to deliver the service for unemployed people promised under the Pathways to Work strategy.  Some of those in the system are subsequently referred to local employment services and so forth.  What is the shortfall in staff and what needs to be done to make up this shortfall?  This information will determine the JobPath for which the Department is tendering, namely, the new scheme under which the Department will roll out a service through a private concern or joint venture.</p><p> If the current number of staff is inadequate, is this because the recruitment process or the retraining of officials has been slow?  I understand a significant number of staff have done additional training and upskilling in recent years and are in a position to deliver the service.  I presume that as these staff come on stream, the Department's capacity to deliver the service increases.  How many staff are needed to provide the Department with a full capacity to deliver on its promise?  Is the figure a multiple of 100, a multiple of ten or in single digits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.838" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300010#J00200"><p>On special needs payments, the Deputy will appreciate that when this system operated in the old health boards and Health Service Executive it involved different regions or area and the level of oversight was limited to perhaps a town or region.  In some areas, there was a strong tradition of making a payment for certain events, while the same payment may have been unheard of in other areas.  The most striking payment, one which the Deputy and I have discussed previously, was the custom in Dublin of paying a special needs payment of approximately &euro;300 for a holy communion ceremony.  In many other counties, especially in the north west, no one had heard of this payment and none was made.  When the community welfare officers joined the Department much more information became available at national level on different practices at local level.  What we have done is standardised special needs payments and set out maximum payments for the purchase of items such as prams, buggies, cots, child and adult clothing and certain household appliances.  This is a reasonable approach as the information collected at national and local level shows a significant convergence in prices nationwide when one takes into account large stores specialising in particular areas.  The Department's decision to cease paying money for religious ceremonies last year contributed to the reduction in expenditure on special needs payments from &euro;52 million in 2012 to &euro;35.6 million in 2013.</p><p>  On the issue of accessibility, those who are in receipt of a jobseeker's payment or social welfare assistance payment must regularly attend their local Intreo or social welfare office to sign on and confirm they are still in the country and available for work.  It makes sense to locate the community welfare service either in Intreo or social welfare offices or close to them given that their customers are attending these offices in any case.  The Department has greatly increased its use of an appointments system.  The practice in the past was that a large number of officials held a clinic for one hour each week or fortnight which was attended by a couple of people or perhaps no one.  Given that people are visiting their local office regularly for different purposes, it makes sense, in a time of scarce resources, to provide the service in these offices.</p><p>  We are also providing a telephone service.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will be aware, many people do not want to queue up in a public office and would prefer to do their business privately.  Modern technology and communications provide significant scope for contacting community welfare service officers by telephone.  As a result of changes we have introduced, customers are offered a dedicated service and officers will call to a person's home by arrangement.  We are introducing a more modernised service, with modern information technology and telephone contact.  I accompanied community welfare service officers visiting those who were worst affected by floods.  As Deputies will agree, they provide a compassionate and considerate service to families who have been affected by disasters.  </p><p>  On staffing numbers, we have more than doubled the number of employment services officers to approximately 800.  The local employment services were introduced with the F&Aacute;S employment services and are very valuable.  We are utilising them very extensively to help unemployed people, particularly those who are far from the labour market, on their journey back to work or education.  Members will also be familiar with these services from their localities.  </p><p>  As I noted earlier, in 2009 we saw a catastrophic increase in the number of people on the live register.  Over a three year period, the number increased by more than 250,000 people.  As we get people back to work, I hope the numbers seeking to avail of these services will continue to fall.  The catastrophic fall in employment in the period leading up to the change of Government created a large backlog of cases.  We will seek to obtain additional assistance to deal with this spike, as we have done with success through the local employment services.  A number of other organisations also provide a dedicated service and significant assistance to people.  For instance, Congress centres provide a range of information services in a number of different locations.  I am anxious to see not only the commercial private sector but potentially also the not-for-profit sector tendering for and being involved in some of this work.  It would help us to identify employment opportunities and get people back to work faster and be of service to employers.</p><p>  There are different international ratios in respect of the number of unemployed persons per case worker.  We have been taking advice on this matter and we will examine contracts on a periodic basis to make up the deficits in line with what the Government agrees is appropriate given the numbers of unemployed people in need of assistance.  </p></speech>

Generally, when England sneezes Ireland catches a cold.  The general thrust in its employment regime and for people going back to work is to have an emphasis on being self-employed or that people work zero-hour contracts.  Many people there are underemployed as a result of the hours they get.  How does the Minister believe this will affect the family income supplement, especially for people with families?  Will it increase the amount of money that will have to be allocated to the family income supplement?  I know from past experience and when I worked in a personnel section that many people did not even know that FIS existed.  It was altogether under-used and under-accessed.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that if children are living in a household where no one goes to work, sometimes the outcome for those children is far below what all of us would desire, even in terms of attendance at school and going on to third level education.</p><p>  Let us consider the economies of Sweden and Finland.  I highlight these two countries because they do not have large populations whereas Britain has.  We might be better off looking at some of the Scandinavian and northern European countries, where they have strong social welfare systems and support systems but also strong back-to-work, back-to-education and back-to-training systems.  Both Finland and Sweden had bank and economic collapses 20 years ago or more, and not only that; their nearest neighbour, the old Soviet Union, crashed.  The economy in what was the old Soviet Union, which then became Russia, collapsed and was utterly chaotic for a period.  I have followed closely what those countries did.  During the recent Presidency of the Council of the European Union, when I chaired the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, I learned that those countries have a strong social consensus.  They believe it is important to provide people who are in need of supported income with income support.  This provides for social cohesion but in terms of the economy it helps money to circulate in a Keynesian way as well.  It boosts the economy because people who are on a pension spend money in their local shops and so on.  Those countries have a public employment service, as we now have, located in their social welfare departments.</p><p>  The first time a person goes in to sign on and get a jobseeker's payment should be the first step in going back to work.  That is absolutely critical.  The idea is to change what the International Monetary Fund has described on several occasions as a somewhat passive social welfare structure in Ireland.  The fund has said it is good but passive and that, basically, the emphasis is on paying benefits.  I would prefer an active system where people get income support but we also help them actively to get back to work and into activation - that is the technical term.  It is important that this should happen.</p><p>  I maintain there are many differences between our system and the system in the United Kingdom.  I would prefer the northern European model.  I prefer to look at countries such as Austria, which has low rates of unemployment and a small population.  It is a small country like ours.  I prefer to look at Finland.  It is interesting to observe what is happening in the United Kingdom but I am unsure whether much of what that country is doing is applicable socially to the Irish situation.</p><p>  I have read reports of the programme to which Deputy Collins is referring, but it is essential that the social welfare system is in place to support people and that people are treated with dignity.  When people become jobseekers under our system, they sign a contract with us, and have done since I became Minister, to the effect that they will do everything required to get themselves back to work and we must help them back to work.  That is our social contract.  The British may have a different approach but I would not be led by what they do.</p></speech>

However, the type of work being created now is not the steady work that existed eight or ten years ago which was full-time and permanent up to retirement.  Much of the work now is precarious.  What is the impact of this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.845" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300011#K00600"><p>I agree with Deputy Collins and that is rather worrying.  One of the reasons I am a strong advocate of Ireland's need for a debt deal from the European Union down the road, because of what happened with the banking collapse, is so that we can invest in the training and education of our people.  The calibre of jobs that people apply for and the income outcomes are heavily related to the level of education they have undertaken.  Essentially, if we have a highly trained and highly educated workforce, then, all other things being equal, the income and wage levels of that workforce will be stronger.  However, if we have a low-level or low-paid workforce then the income levels will be lower and the work, as Deputy Collins described, will be more precarious.</p><p>  Why are we paying jobseekers the family income supplement if they go back to work and they have children?  The reason is that the international and national evidence shows that if a person - this applies particularly to young men - becomes unemployed for more than six months then his self-esteem and self-confidence plummets.  This happens even if the company closed down.  Six months becomes a year, which becomes two years, and then people start blaming the unemployed person.  We are spending money on supports in work to employers with JobsPlus.  We are spending money on supports to families in work with the family income supplement.  This is because all the evidence is that it is better if we can get people back into participation in the labour force, back into education and into participation at local level in community employment schemes, T&uacute;s or JobBridge.  Some people have come out of college with high levels of qualification but are unable to get a job because of what happened in the recession.  If we can get people back to work and then support them with continuing relevant training and education we can raise income levels.</p><p>  Deputy Collins is right to say that the family income supplement was rather unknown and not taken up.  With changes in technology in the Department and on the part of employers' payroll systems, it is far easier nowadays to have FIS applications made in a timely way and we are far better able to respond to it.</p><p>  Two things are important.  The first is to get people back to work.  One of the highest levels of minimum wage is in Ireland, at &euro;8.65 per hour.  However, if a person only gets ten hours of work, that is only &euro;86.50 per week.  A person would be unable to live on that, certainly not if she is an adult with children.  We need to get people working enough hours in order that they have enough income.  If they need a supplement because they have children then the family income supplement is available.  We pay the universal child benefit as well.  Anyway, it is important that our system ensures that a person is always better off in work and the family income supplement is a major support to that end.</p><p>  We are improving it as much as we can.  It would be helpful if Deputy Collins or any Member let people know about it.  When I was on "Today with Sean O'Rourke", Paddy O'Gorman was in the studio playing the interviews he had done in Navan.</p> <p>What stood out was that the three men who were very nice people had mentioned having children, but not one of them was conscious that with two or three children he would receive very significant assistance.</p></speech>

Another way of looking at it is that, in effect, we have spent &euro;250 million, which has been increased to &euro;280 million, to support approximately 50,000 families who are in work but so poorly paid that the State must intervene to keep them out of poverty.  Do we need to have another conversation about what the Minister has mentioned before, a living wage?  We spend a great deal of time discussing the social protection system and words such as fraud, dependency culture and so on always come into the conversation.  When I dig deep into the figures, it appears that there is an element of corporate welfare, whereby the State is spending &euro;280 million to support those in work because employers are not giving them enough hours, as the Minister said, or not paying them enough.  Where do we strike the balance?  How do we ensure those who are in work are paid a dignified wage and not dependent on the State?  How do we strike a balance between supporting those whom we need to support, to encourage them to stay in employment and have that routine in their lives which, as the Minister said, is crucial, and talking to employers about their responsibility to lift people out of poverty, without having to depend on the goodwill of the social protection system?  There is a serious conversation to be had about culture, values and dignity in the workplace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.848" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300012#L00300"><p>I am making my calculations.  If somebody was to take up a job at &euro;8.65 per hour for a 39 hour week, he or she would receive a gross payment of &euro;338.52.  If that person were single, he or she would receive &euro;188 per week on social welfare.  The comparison is absolutely clear for a single person.  There have been discussions, particularly in Germany, about raising the minimum wage as a way of increasing domestic demand by putting money into the economy through the hands of workers.  The critical issue for us is that because ours is relatively high it is very advantageous for a single person, but when one is paid an income, an employer does not take one&rsquo;s family responsibilities into account.  An income of &euro;338 per week for a person with two or three children and a spouse is, relatively speaking, much lower.  Family income supplement for a family in that situation with three children would be &euro;225 per week.  That would bring total earnings up significantly, to approximately &euro;550 a week, a significant amount in the context of earnings in Ireland.</p><p>  How, in general, can we raise people&rsquo;s wages?  The critical factor for the economy, particularly for families with one or two adults and in which nobody has meaningful work, is that these children are most at risk of having negative or poor educational and employment outcomes.  Economic planning needs several elements such as investment in training and education because, broadly, the higher the level of one&rsquo;s education, the higher the earning potential when one goes out to work.  People on low wages need an adequate social insurance system because even a single person, once he or she has paid tax and the universal social charge, contributions and so on, would not have much left to pay into a pension scheme.  As the economy recovers, when employers take on people, they try to decide whether they will add value to their business.  The cash flow from the bank may not be very strong, which is why we offer JobsPlus to employers.  If they take on someone who has been on the live register for over a year, we offer &euro;300 a week, which is a significant supplement.  If the person has a family, he or she may also receive family income supplement.  That may allow the employer to pay the person more.  It certainly reduces the cost to the employer.  We are also preparing in-work statements for people in that situation to show that work has to pay.</p><p>  The other big poverty trap is met by someone on rent supplement who is living in private rented accommodation.  We have done a great deal of work to run the first pilot scheme to transfer the scheme to the local authority in the spring, in Limerick.  That is a difficult, challenging job because there are 66 local authority rent schemes, all with different computer systems, different levels of rent payment and so on.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has a big job to do in that respect and is working on it.  The aim is to get people back to work.  We may subsidise it initially, but as the economy recovers, the demand for labour will drive wages up.  Many employers pay above the minimum wage.  It is critical for someone starting out to be given enough hours.  There really is no argument for single people between getting &euro;188 in social protection and &euro;338, minus a small amount of pay-related social insurance, PRSI, and USC, on the minimum wage.</p></speech>

How are we doing in respect of waiting times in the appeals office?  Is there an equally successful performance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.850" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300012#L00500"><p>On 31 December 2012 there were 20,414 appeals in hand.  On 31 December 2013 there were 14,770, a fall of 28% in the backlog of appeals.  During 2012 a total of 32,588 decisions were made.  During 2013 a total of 38,421 decisions were made, an increase of 18%.  We are beginning to get through the backlog, but it is still significant.  As our technology improves, I hope we will be able to deal with a significantly greater number of cases through review rather than have to go to the appeals office which is an independent process.  Once it goes to it a certain amount of time is involved in the initiation of an appeal.  That is a separate process from the work of the Department.  It is also falling because clearing the backlog in the award of invalidity pensions has cut down on the number of appeals and is likely to continue to do so in the future.</p> <p>As people return to work the number of appeals is likely to fall.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.853" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300013#M00300"><p>Yes.  The target is to deal with the back log of 14,000 appeals for this year.  Last year's starting figure of 20,000 was reduced to 14,000.  Our target is to reduce that figure significantly in this year.  We are on course to achieve that target.</p><p>  The chief appeals officer has overseen staff training in making decisions on appeals.  If a claimant presents full information with the initial appeal then a summary decision can be made which can deal with the case then and there.  Unlike the systems in other countries, our system is not a one-shot appeal system where all the information is provided once.  As Deputy Collins mentioned, if more information is required such as additional medical evidence, our system allows for this to be presented at a subsequent stage.  If the revised decision system is working as efficiently as possible this will also help to reduce the number of appeals, as will initial decisions which have been supplied with all the required information.</p><p>  The Department has worked to ensure that the application forms are clear so that applicants have the full information.  The new Intreo offices have general reception desks which provide information on what applicants need to provide.  There is a greater emphasis on information which it is hoped will help applicants.  For example, medical letters which do not provide exact and sufficient information about the applicant's medical condition to the Department's medical assessor are not helpful.  Such information may be a personal view of the person's GP in a wish to help him or her.  The chief medical officer has been working with doctors to improve the quality of information provided to the Department and so that they understand what is required by the medical assessors with regard to description and specific explanation of medical issues.</p></speech>

I refer to a figure of &euro;13.5 million allocated for JobsPlus and &euro;82.3 million allocated for JobBridge this year.  How many people will benefit from these schemes?  I have a question about JobBridge.  The voluntary internship scheme provides experience but participants work for long periods for nothing but the basic social welfare payment.  I note that local authorities in my part of the country have taken up this scheme.  I ask the Minister to comment.</p><p>  What is the situation with regard to the youth guarantee scheme and the Gateway programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.856" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300013#M00600"><p>I will deal with the youth guarantee question first.  Before Christmas, the Department submitted the Irish application and statement on the scheme to the Commission.  We await the reply.  We also commissioned the OECD to report on how the youth guarantee might work in Ireland.  The submission to the Commission and the OECD report will be published early next Tuesday afternoon, subject to Cabinet approval on Tuesday morning.</p><p>  A pilot scheme in Ballymun has brought together all the organisations dealing with young people who are unemployed or who have left school or training before completion.  The pilot scheme will provide a complete service to these young people.  I will be visiting the project later today to hear an update on progress over the past months.  The Intreo system will be used to interview the young people who have been unemployed.  Early school leavers need to be identified to ensure they take up the available education and training places.  For those over 18 years the local social welfare officers will interview them to provide advice about career development which may result in a return to education and work training.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, has set up SOLAS which will take over the former VECs and the F&Aacute;S training centres.  We had a lengthy meeting with Solas before Christmas.  The Department will send clients to SOLAS for training, education and work experience.  </p><p>  At the end of December 2013, approximately 1,100 people were participating in the JobsPlus scheme and were in receipt of payment.  We had spent over &euro;1 million at that point on JobsPlus.  Given the level of interest in the scheme we estimate that this will increase significantly during 2014.  I repeat the message to any employer who may be listening.  If an employer takes on a person who has been on the live register for more than one year, the employer will receive &euro;300 a month by electronic fund transfer for every month up to two years that the person is employed.  If the person has been out of work for more than two years, the employer will receive more than &euro;400 a month.  This is a significant incentive.  We intend to make it attractive for employers to take on young people under the age of 26 and to make the JobsPlus offer available to employers who employ people who have been unemployed for more than six months.  </p><p>  On 10 January 2014, a total OF  6,451 interns were in the JobBridge scheme and 1,726 internship opportunities were advertised.  Since the scheme was launched on 1 July 2013, approximately 25,000 people have participated in JobBridge.</p> <p>The very good news is that significant numbers have gone on to secure further work.  In addition, significant numbers leave JobBridge after the first four or five months because they have been offered a job, either by their host employer or through a network of contacts they have established.  It has been an extremely successful initiative.  It is a voluntary scheme and not for everybody, but it has proved of value to large numbers of participants.</p><p> Some 9,000 companies have offered JobBridge experience to scheme participants and we carry out extensive monitoring and checking of all of them.  That information is then posted to the website.  The last figures I saw showed there had been some 4,400 site visits to access information on JobBridge interns, which is very high.  We also have a system of immediate web contact with either the intern or host organisation where difficulties arise, which has happened in a very small number of cases.  It is important to note that we impose no criteria in terms of participants' academic qualifications.  Some are under the impression it is just for graduates, but, in fact, the latter comprise only some 25% of all participants.  Having said that, participants do include people with masters and even doctoral qualifications.  It is very sad to have a situation in this country where young people and their families invested so much in education only for them to emerge into a bleak world of high unemployment.  JobBridge has helped large numbers in that situation.  I meet people all the time throughout the country who tell me they are very happy with their internship experience.  I attended a concert at the weekend at which I was approached by several people whose siblings or children had found this to be the case.</p><p> JobBridge has been a very successful programme, but it is only one element of a suite of departmental initiatives.  I take the opportunity to compliment the Irish Local Development Network on its work with communities throughout the State.  I was told when I initiated the programme that it would achieve nothing.  Instead, more than 7,000 people at any one time are giving 19 hours a week in very valuable community contributions, which are also helping them to get back to work.  More than 20,000 people are participating in community employment schemes, thereby contributing enormously important assistance and services to their local communities.  If we include the 20,000 participants in the back-to-education scheme at any one time, more than 85,000 people are being assisted under the various programmes.  In addition, 10,000 to 12,000 people at any one time are working on starting their own business with the help of the back to work enterprise allowance.</p><p> There is no magic bullet that will fix unemployment in Ireland.  It is about getting the country back on its feet economically and eventually securing a better deal from the European Union on the long-term bank debt we incurred as a result of the crisis.  It is about utilising the series of initiatives I have outlined, as well as the work being done by the Department of Education and Skills in training people in the skills that are in demand.</p></speech>

What are the comparative costs as between a T&uacute;s participant and a community employment scheme participant?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.860" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300014#N00400"><p>Table No. 11 on page 19 of the documentation shows that we estimate expenditure of some &euro;120 million on T&uacute;s in 2014.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.862" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300014#N00600"><p>In the case of community employment schemes, the average cost per payment to a participant is some &euro;265.26, while the figure for T&uacute;s is approximately &euro;273.95.  The difference arises because participants in T&uacute;s are drawn from the ranks of the long-term unemployed who tend to be younger and have more dependants.  This makes the average payment higher than that for community employment participants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.863" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1032" speakername="Joan Collins" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300014#N00700"><p>Are people who commence any of the programmes we are discussing taken off the live register?  In other words, are they all counted as being in employment or do different procedures apply in this regard in respect of different participants and schemes?</p><p>  On the fraud and control element to which the Minister referred, what are the criteria applying to recipients of jobseeker's payment in terms of the requirement to seek work?  Is it necessary, for example, to produce evidence of having applied for two, three or five jobs per month?</p><p>  On pensions, the Minister has made the important point that recipients of the State contributory pension have already been paid for that benefit.  In the context of fraud and control measures, will she indicate whether significant numbers in receipt of the contributory pension are having their payment cut off?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.864" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300014#N00800"><p>On the last point on pensions, the answer is no.  However, we are required by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts to carry out random checks of all headings of social welfare expenditure where people are in receipt of income support.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office has made clear this requirement in each of its reports in the past five to eight years.  It is a requirement with which we must comply by way of full surveys of a minimum of 1,000 people, including lone parents, pensioners, child benefit recipients and so on.  In addition, we write to more than 1 million people to check whether they are still residing at the address given.</p><p>  Regarding what subsequently happens to people who have signed on for a jobseeker's payment, under the new system, they are also signing on for the services of their local Intreo office which include the provision of a personal services card.  That has been rolled out in the new offices to all jobseekers.  Persons who are approved for a jobseeker's payment are required, as part of deterring fraud and abuse, to collect their money at a post office.  On the other hand, pensioners and those in receipt of other long-term payments have a choice of payment methods such as having their money paid into a bank account or their local post office.</p> <p>The Deputy will be pleased to hear that just before Christmas we signed a contract with An Post - I believe she worked for the latter in the past - which is worth &euro;50 million to it to provide social welfare services on behalf of the Department.  In rural areas and in many city suburbs, the post office is very much the location of choice for people to obtain their social welfare payments.  We also ask jobseekers to present at their local post offices because this is a further way of checking that they are in the country and available to collect their payments.  New jobseekers receive personal services cards which include their photographs and various details by means of which they can prove their identity.  Those cards can be matched against our IT and facial recognition technology.  We receive weekly reports containing photographs of persons in possession of personal services cards - the system is similar to that used for security purposes in airports - in which similarities to images of individuals who have already signed on at other offices have been detected.  The facial recognition technology allowed us to apprehend one individual with five different identities.</p><p> As already stated, people are assisted in getting back to work.  They take part in general group interviews and are then dealt with by individual case officers.  In the context of the latter, a one-to-one discussion takes place as to what is best for a particular person in terms of ensuring that he or she returns to work.  When people come to our social welfare offices, they are also profiled.  Their previous work experience and levels of remuneration, details of their education and where they live are all taken into account.  Where a person lives may be a factor in the context of how far he or she can realistically travel in the interests of taking up an employment or educational opportunity.  Based on the details provided, we arrive at what we call a probability of exit, PEX, from the live register.  If a person has a high PEX score, he or she has a correspondingly high probability of exit from the live register.  In that context, if a graduate is made redundant when his or her employer ceases operations, there will be other firms that are seeking to employ him or her.  We would say that it is more than likely that he or she will find employment within six months.  On the other hand, a person who left school at 16 and who worked in construction - he or she may have worked very hard but jobs in this area are much more scarce than previously - may need support in the context of returning to education.  An issue also arises in respect of those with little or no literacy or numeracy skills.  In order for such individuals to obtain employment, that issue must be addressed.</p><p> A series of checks, balances, means of encouragement and interviews are in place for people who are unemployed.  If a person does not respond to letters or requests to attend at his or her local social welfare office, does not respond to requests to attend for interviews or is not really interested, he or she may be busy doing something else with his or her time.  In such instances we have the power - we have used this sparingly since it became available to us in April 2011 - to reduce his or her social welfare payments by up to &euro;44 per week.  Last year, we reduced the payments of approximately 3,000 people.  Our aim is to help people on jobseeker's benefit or allowance to return to work or to avail of education or training opportunities.  Our staff are very supportive of people but we require that individuals co-operate with us.  That is the way the system works.</p><p> Reference was made to England.  I am only aware of the position in that jurisdiction as a result of certain media coverage in Ireland.  We obtain enormous co-operation from people on a voluntary basis.  I have visited social welfare and Intreo offices throughout the country and I am aware - as, I am sure, are members - of people's great desire to obtain employment and become financially independent.  The level of co-operation with officials of the Department is extremely high.  I take this opportunity to request that employers give real consideration to the talent that is available on the live register and to help those who lost their jobs through no fault of their own in returning to work.  The Department is involved in supporting those employers who assist people in regaining employment.</p></speech>

People may be able to survive for three days without payment but if they are obliged to do so for six days, they will need to have access to the services of community welfare officers.</p><p>  During the past year, the Minister commented on the child benefit system on a number of occasions.  Does she have any plans to change that system?  Is the report on child care that we debated last year dead and buried?  Has it been consigned to oblivion?</p><p>  In the context of the abolition of the free telephone rental allowance, the Minister will be aware that many people expressed concern with regard to security, alarm systems, etc., particularly in the context of the impossibility of linking the latter to mobile phones.  Has the position in this regard been resolved?</p><p>  On the abolition of the burial grant, a funeral in Limerick can cost up to &euro;5,000, while in Dublin the amount can be almost twice that.  In many instances I have found - I am sure the position is similar for other Deputies - that as a result of the cost of funerals, even when people qualify for the bereavement grant it is still necessary for them to apply to the HSE for a top-up by way of the burial grant.  From where will they get the money to bury their dead now?  Burial grants are part of the exceptional needs budget.</p></speech>

People who hitherto would have qualified for a payment of &euro;800 will not now qualify.  The latter is a small sum, particularly if a funeral costs &euro;7,000, &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000.  How does the Minister propose to square that circle?  In light of the OECD's report on pensions, which was published last year, what is the current state of play with regard to the review of pensions?</p></speech>

In the case of a widow or widower whose spouse has died, we continue to pay the social welfare pension of the person who has died for six weeks.  That is worth far more to people than the bereavement grant.</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy will agree that this is a significant amount.</p> <p>As the Deputy said, we also make exceptional needs payments, dealt with on a case by case basis, to meet funeral and burial expenses.  During the debate on the Bill I gave Deputies the details of the amounts paid in different parts of the country.  As Deputy Willie O'Dea noted, burial costs are very significant in different parts of the country.  Many of the bereavement grants were paid to the estates of people who were deceased; those who inherit an estate are often the nieces and nephews of the deceased person and who might also inherit the property of the deceased.  </p><p> In having to find savings last year which, unfortunately, we had to do because of the situation in which we had found ourselves on entering government I decided that the payments made on bereavement to the next of kin, the widow or widower, would continue, that they would continue to receive the six week payment, that a widowed parent would continue to receive the &euro;6,000 payment and that the special needs payment would continue.  These are significant amounts and all target immediate next of kin and dependants of the person who has died.  That was the best way of addressing the matter.  Given the fact that we are paying &euro;160 million extra in pension payments this year alone, as the Deputy discussed, we had to find some savings and, unfortunately, that was one area in which it was appropriate to do so. </p><p> On the new treatment of sick days, at this point in January we do not have data for how that is working out, but when I obtain more information, probably towards the end of March, I will give it to the Deputy and bring it forward for discussion.  He asked how many employers had sick pay schemes in place.  According to IBEC, 75% of employers who are members of that organisation have occupational sick pay schemes in place, by which, obviously, many employees are covered.  In the public service and organisations funded from the public service there are generally sick pay schemes in place also.  Significant numbers are covered by sick pay schemes, but I am not quite clear on exactly how many are covered.  As we develop the new scheme, I am sure we will receive more information which we will make available to the Deputy who also asked another question.</p></speech>

The grant assistance is made available to community and voluntary groups registered with the Department.  I understand organisations dealing with older people deal with local area bases in respect of community schemes and the Department.  Significant numbers were dealt with last year.  Another aspect - this is a positive development - is that technology is changing and improving and where formerly the alerts were only linkable with land lines, they are now being linked with mobile phones.  Mobile phone coverage in many parts of the country is very good and more individuals, including older people, now use and carry their mobile phone.  </p><p>  On the living alone allowance, older people living on their own receive an allowance of &euro;7.70 per week from the Department in recognition of the extra cost involved.</p></speech>

I made inquiries with one of the social enterprise offices that provided alarms and learned that they did not provide the service in the case of mobile phones as there was a problem in that respect.  I was advised that there was an issue with SIM cards.  I do not know the technology, but the information I was given was that there was a problem with mobile phones in that respect.</p></speech>

They have spoken to me about improvements in technology.  From talking to them, I appreciate it is important that people have such contact.  I stress that, in addition to the other pension payments, we pay an additional &euro;7.70 a week to older people living on their own.</p></speech>

Is this linked with the Haddington Road agreement?  </p><p>  On training and development, I assume this relates to the switch in emphasis in the Department in training people in terms of activation.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this.  </p><p>  On the issue of consultancy, what types does the Department need?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.882" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014012300016#P01000"><p>On the Deputy's first question which was related to wages and salaries, he is correct that the reduction in costs is down to the Haddington Road agreement.  It is also related to the employment control framework whereby the number of staff the Department can employ is limited by the Department of Finance on a reducing scale.  Training and development and incidental expenses under subhead 3 also include a contingency provision of approximately &euro;4 million in the event of a disaster or flood damage to an office or a fire in a premises which has to be reinstated.  That is the reason there has been a significant underspend because, happily, last year we did not have to use any of the provision which we will carry forward again this year.</p></speech>

It examines the social impact of budgets.  We pay the ESRI for that service.  </p><p>  On pensions policy reserve, about which I spoke, last year we commissioned the OECD to do some work.  There are also ongoing reviews of pension fees and costs to pension scheme contributors.  We also have an ongoing modernisation programme in the Department.  We receive advice on how to do this in upskilling and training staff on IT developments, about which I spoke.  We have what is called Business Objects Modelling Advice and Expertise.  To deal with and reduce backlogs, we have used advice extensively in updating and upgrading IT platforms.</p> <p>Other headings in that regard relate to value for money policy reviews and other such areas.  We also carried out a review of the domiciliary care allowance and how it was operating.  We get advice and technical advice on that.</p></speech>

I think it refers to jobs but it is not JobsPlus.  It involves tendering out to private companies to get people recruited for jobs.  Given that public money is going to a private firm, someone raised the importance of the need for transparency in how such companies are taken on by the Department.  Does the Minister have any comments in that regard?</p></speech>

The programme for Government contained a commitment to use, if necessary, external resources, which does not relate simply to the private sector but could refer to the not-for-profit sector, voluntary organisations or community organisations.  The Department already outsources a significant amount of work.  I referred to the contract for An Post that we signed before Christmas, which is worth approximately &euro;50 million a year.  Particularly in rural areas and smaller towns, we also have social welfare offices which are run by a local service provider who is paid a fee by the Department.  The Department has a long record of working with the private sector, the not-for-profit sector, and the voluntary and community sector.  This is not a particularly new development.  The programme is called JobPath.  What we have been doing over the last year is talking to private providers, having taken some advice internationally about how private provision has worked in other countries.  In July 2013 we issued a prior information notice in which we advised the market that the Department was considering the potential of contracting third-party providers of employment services.  We held two information sessions in July.  In December we published a request for tenders.  The closing date for the tenders is 28 February 2014.  We would expect then to be able to advance the tender process some time at the end of April or May and services, therefore, might commence in late 2014.  A lead-in time is allowed to build up for the process.</p><p>  Members might be aware that the Department of Education and Skills operates a programme called Momentum, which provides educational services.  The providers of those services have been from a variety of backgrounds, many from the private sector and some from the public sector and the not-for-profit sector.</p></speech>

One example we have currently is the local employment service, which involves locally established companies.  There are a number of those around the country.  We outsource social welfare clients to them and they give detailed advice, support and hand-holding to get people back into education or work.  We already have the model in operation.  The model for JobPath is similar.  People would be remunerated to a significant degree based on outcomes.  In other words, we will not hand over large amounts of money unless people are committing to specific levels of outcome.  The tender process is under way currently.  There has been much discussion as well of other organisations at local level seeking to build up co-operative partnerships.  I have seen references to that in the media.  We will come back to you, Chairman, when we have more information, probably after Easter.</p></speech>

Creidim go bhfuil an teanga &aacute; ruaigeadh ar leataobh go lean&uacute;nach chuig imeall na socha&iacute;, agus &aacute;ir&iacute;m anseo cuid mhaith den riarach&aacute;n poibl&iacute;.  N&iacute; chreidim ar chor ar bith gur ar an aicme pholaiti&uacute;il is m&oacute; at&aacute; an locht ina leith seo.  N&iacute;l an aicme pholaiti&uacute;il gan locht, ar nd&oacute;igh, ach n&iacute; orthu is m&oacute; at&aacute; an locht sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo.

T&aacute; rud eile foghlamtha againn in imeacht na mblianta, s&eacute; sin go bhfuil bun&uacute;s leis an bhfr&aacute;sa &quot;what gets measured gets done&quot;.</p><p>  Mura bhfuil ini&uacute;chadh agus meast&oacute;ireacht neamhsple&aacute;ch &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh, n&iacute; chreidim gur f&eacute;idir le haon duine bar&aacute;ntas a thabhairt faoin fheidhmi&uacute;.  Is f&eacute;idir le daoine tuairim&iacute; a bheith acu, agus seo ceann &oacute; shaineola&iacute; amh&aacute;in.

Let the whole thing wither on the vine.</blockquote>Bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id seo le r&aacute; aige freisin:<blockquote>When the Official Languages Act was passed over 10 years ago the top civil servants adopted a minimalist, wait-and-see approach.  They knew that without their active support the new legislation was never going to have much effect.  But what started as passive inaction on their part now seems to have moved up a notch or two to one of active undermining.<br /><br /> It reminds me of a phrase used by our President Michael D Higgins, speaking at the biennial T&oacute;stal na Gaeilge conference in Galway in 2010, when he referred to those &ldquo;for whom Irish was not half dead enough&rdquo;.</blockquote>Sin dearcadh sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il &oacute; fhear misni&uacute;il a bh&iacute; i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r an St&aacute;tch&oacute;rais.</p><p> Gealladh sa strait&eacute;is go mbun&oacute;fa&iacute; c&oacute;rais le m&eacute;ad&uacute; a chur ar fhoireann na seirbh&iacute;se poibl&iacute; at&aacute; in ann feidhmi&uacute; i nGaeilge.

D&uacute;irt Nelson Mandela:<blockquote><br />If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.  If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.</blockquote>D&uacute;irt Seamus Heaney:<blockquote>Not to learn Irish is to miss the opportunity of understanding what life in this country has meant and could mean in a better future.  It is to cut oneself off from ways of being at home.  If we regard self-understanding, mutual understanding, imaginative enhancement, cultural diversity and a tolerant political atmosphere as desirable attainments, we should remember that knowledge of the Irish language is an essential element in their realisation.</blockquote>T&aacute; rogha shimpl&iacute; romhainn idir fh&eacute;achaint siar ar an Ghaeilge mar theanga a chailleamar n&oacute; f&eacute;achaint chun tosaigh agus &iacute; mar chuid l&aacute;rnach d&aacute;r bhf&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht agus d&aacute;r bhflaitheas.

Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute;, &aacute;fach, go bhfuil d&iacute;om&aacute; an domhain orm nach bhfuil aon Teachta D&aacute;la n&oacute; Seanad&oacute;ir &oacute; ph&aacute;irtithe an Rialtais i l&aacute;thair anseo.

T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte nach bhfuil &eacute;inne &oacute; ph&aacute;irtithe an Rialtais anseo.  I mo thuairim, taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; sin drochmheas don choimisin&eacute;ir, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; timpeall na t&iacute;re.

Nuair a d'amharc ball foirne na hoifige s'againne, Colm &Oacute; Coisdealbha, ar an su&iacute;omh gr&eacute;as&aacute;in, chonaic s&eacute; go raibh na preasr&aacute;itis ar fad, &oacute;n ch&eacute;ad tr&iacute; mh&iacute; den bhliain curtha ar an su&iacute;omh, ach gur cuireadh ar an su&iacute;omh iad ag an am c&eacute;anna.  </p><p> Nuair a dhein s&eacute; ini&uacute;chadh ar seo, mar is ceart, leo, fuair s&eacute; amach gurbh &eacute; an plean a bh&iacute; acu, agus mh&iacute;nigh siad go soil&eacute;ir &eacute;, go gcuirfeadh siad amach na preasr&aacute;itis ar fad i mB&eacute;arla chuig chuile duine, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta,  TG4, RTE agus ansin, nuair a bheadh baili&uacute;ch&aacute;n m&oacute;r preasr&aacute;iteas acu, chuirfeadh siad chuig aistritheoir &eacute; mar go raibh s&eacute; n&iacute;os saoire &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh "in bulk".  Ansin, cuireann siad &eacute; sin ar an su&iacute;omh ghr&eacute;as&aacute;in.  Stop muid an n&oacute;s sin agus ghlac siad leis go raibh an n&oacute;s sin m&iacute;cheart.  Sin an difr&iacute;ocht idir f&eacute;in mheas&uacute;n&uacute; agus meas&uacute;n&uacute; neamhsple&aacute;ch.  N&iacute; bhfaigheadh duine away le meas&uacute;n&uacute; neamhsple&aacute;ch mar sin m&aacute; t&aacute; duine ag d&eacute;anamh ini&uacute;chta.  Muna bhfuiltear in ann seice&aacute;il, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir glacadh leis na ticeanna sna bosca&iacute;.</p><p> Chuir an Teachta Kitt ceist faoin mh&eacute;id airgid at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il don oifig.  T&aacute; buis&eacute;ad de thart ar &euro;500,000 ag an oifig.  T&aacute; coimisin&eacute;ir &uacute;r le ceapadh.  Creidim n&aacute;r tugadh an acmhainn airgid n&oacute; an acmhainn foirne a theast&oacute;dh &oacute;n oifig d&aacute;ir&iacute;re lena cuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh ariamh agus go dteast&oacute;dh i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; sin.  T&aacute;, ar a laghad, dh&aacute; fhol&uacute;ntas sinsearach san oifig i l&aacute;thair na huaire, agus seans nach fada go mbeidh tuilleadh fol&uacute;ntas ann freisin.  An baol at&aacute; ann n&aacute; go bhfuil gearradh siar agus gearradh siar ag leanacht a ch&eacute;ile go lean&uacute;nach.  D&aacute;ir&iacute;re, is f&eacute;idir caint faoi neamhsple&aacute;chas a bheith ag duine, ach t&aacute; neamhsple&aacute;chas teoranta ag easpa acmhainn&iacute;.  Muna bhfuil na hacmhainn&iacute; ag an oifig le dul i ndiaid ruda&iacute; le iad a fhiosr&uacute;, t&aacute; a chuid neamhsple&aacute;chas dh&aacute; ghearradh.</p><p> Chuir an Teachta Kitt ceist freisin faoin c&oacute;nascadh le Oifig an Ombudsman.  D&uacute;irt m&eacute; nach raibh fhios agam aon rud faoi.  Nuair a f&oacute;gra&iacute;odh &eacute;, n&iacute; raibh a fhios ag an Ombudsman deireannach a bh&iacute; ann, Emily O'Reilly, faoi ach an oiread.  &Oacute; shin i leith, t&aacute; m&eacute;id &aacute;irithe cloiste, ach d'iarr mise go sonrach go bhfeicfinn na mion sionra&iacute; i scr&iacute;bhinn, na leasuithe reacht&uacute;la a bh&iacute; beartaithe.  T&aacute;thar ag geall&uacute;int go mbeidh an duine neamhsple&aacute;ch agus lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht, na ruda&iacute; seo ar fad, ach go dt&iacute; go bhfeiceann muid an "small print", is deacair aon tuiscint a bheith againn c&eacute;ard &eacute; go d&iacute;reach a tharl&oacute;s.  Ag an bpointe seo, n&iacute;l a fhios agam, agus is d&oacute;igh nach mbeidh a fhios ag p&eacute; coimisin&eacute;ir a thiocfaidh i m'&aacute;it ach an oiread, c&eacute;n toradh a bheidh ar n&oacute; c&eacute;n &eacute;ifeacht a bheidh ag an c&oacute;nascadh sin.  Ach is l&eacute;ir &oacute; ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; na seachtaine seo caite, go bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist dul chun cinn leis an gc&oacute;nascadh sin roimh Mh&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair. </p></speech>

Th&aacute;inig s&eacute; aniar aduaidh orainn ag an comhchoishte an l&aacute; eile nuair a d'inis an coimisin&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn go raibh s&eacute; chun &eacute;ir&iacute; as a phost, ach tuigim go r&iacute;-mhaith c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil.</p><p>  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il ar&eacute;ir sa Seanad go raibh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn faoi Theanga Chomhartha&iacute;ochta na h&Eacute;ireann, Irish Sign Language, agus an dream at&aacute; bodhar ag lorg aitheantais dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il i mBille d&aacute; chuid riachtanas &oacute; thaobh na teanga sin.  B'&eacute; an freagra a fuair muid &oacute;n Aire St&aacute;it sa Teach n&aacute; go mbeadh an Rialtas s&aacute;sta sin a dh&eacute;anamh nuair a bheadh na hacmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il do daoine bodhar.  Nuair a th&oacute;gann muid an freagra sin i gcomhth&eacute;acs Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, &aacute;it a bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht againn agus f&oacute;s f&eacute;in nach bhfuil na hacmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; ar f&aacute;il, t&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith ior&oacute;nta.</p><p>  Mar a d&uacute;radh roimhe seo, t&aacute; daoine sna p&aacute;irtithe ar fad b&aacute;&uacute;il don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; daoine sna Tithe seo at&aacute; an-d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin Ghaeilge agus tugann siad laca&iacute;ocht di.  Labhra&iacute;onn siad ag d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; agus b&iacute;onn siad ag na coisti seo, ach n&iacute; leor a bheith b&aacute;&uacute;il don Ghaeilge le taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  N&iacute;l aon mhaith sa gcaint muna bhfuil gn&iacute;omh taobh thiar di, ach sin at&aacute; ann.  Is &eacute; an trua nach bhfuil duine &eacute;igin anseo &oacute; ph&aacute;irt&iacute; an Rialtais, ach sin mar at&aacute; s&eacute;.  D&eacute;arfaidh siad uilig go bhfuil siad b&aacute;&uacute;il don Ghaeilge ach c&eacute;n mhaith &eacute; sin nuair nach bhfuil na hacmhainn&iacute; &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il.</p><p>  Rinne muid iarratas go dtiocfadh an coimisin&eacute;ir os comhair an tSeanaid le labhairt leis an tSeanad agus t&aacute; a fhios sin ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir.  S&iacute;im nach bhfuiltear ag cur an &eacute;ir&iacute; as seo i gcomhth&eacute;acs n&iacute;os leithne.  Mar a d&uacute;radh n&iacute;os luaithe, seo an ch&eacute;ad uair i stair an St&aacute;it gur &eacute;irigh ombudsman de chine&aacute;l ar bith as a phost ar na c&uacute;ins&iacute; nach raibh an taca&iacute;ocht &aacute; fh&aacute;il aige n&oacute; aici &oacute;n Rialtas.  T&aacute; sin n&aacute;ireach agus is &aacute;bhar i bhfad n&iacute;os tromch&uacute;is&iacute; &eacute; n&aacute; d&iacute;reach ceist teanga.  T&aacute;thar, sa Rialtas, dar liom, ag iarraidh a r&aacute; go mbaineann an &eacute;ir&iacute; as le ceist na Gaeilge - go bhfuil Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as, ach go bhfuil siad chun duine eile a cheapadh.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go dtuigeann siad chomh d&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus at&aacute; an &eacute;ir&iacute; as seo.  N&iacute;or mhiste liom tuairim&iacute; an choimisin&eacute;ara a fh&aacute;il faoi sin.  &Oacute; bheith ag labhairt leis na hOmbudsmen eile a bhaineann le coist&iacute; eile, ceapaim go dtuigeann siadsan chomh maith c&eacute; chomh d&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus at&aacute; an rud seo.  Go hidirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta fi&uacute;, n&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute; mh&eacute;id ombudsmen go m'b&eacute;igean d&oacute;ibh &eacute;ir&iacute; as de bharr easpa taca&iacute;ochta.  An bhfuil aon eolas ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir faoi sin?</p><p>  T&aacute; an-bhr&oacute;n orm n&aacute;r ghlac an Seanad le go dtiocfadh an coimisin&eacute;ir os comhair an tSeanaid le cine&aacute;l state of the nation teachtaireacht a dh&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Bheadh sin &uacute;s&aacute;ideach agus chuirfeadh s&eacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar an leibh&eacute;al gur c&oacute;ir d&oacute; a bheith.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil an coimisin&eacute;ir istigh inniu, &oacute; thaobh na strait&eacute;ise de.  T&aacute; mise ag r&aacute; le fada an l&aacute; nach bhfuil sa strait&eacute;is ach cur i gc&eacute;ill.  An t-impire gan aon &eacute;adach at&aacute;, dar liomsa, san Aire st&aacute;it &oacute; thaobh cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am go nd&eacute;arfadh muid nach bhfuil cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise ag feidhmi&uacute; mar is ceart agus go gcaithfear athbhreithni&uacute; ioml&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh faoi sin.</p><p>  D&aacute;la an sc&eacute;il, is &eacute; an f&oacute;gra a rinne m&eacute; nuair a chuala go raibh an coimisin&eacute;ir ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as oifig n&aacute; nach eisean ba ch&oacute;ir a bheith ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as beag n&aacute; m&oacute;r, ach an tAire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; an fhianaise againn gur eisean at&aacute; faill&iacute;och ina chuid oibre - nuair a bhreathna&iacute;onn muid ar laghad na sc&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; daingnithe.  Nuair a bhreathna&iacute;onn muid ar an easpa taca&iacute;ochta at&aacute; &aacute; fh&aacute;il &oacute; na Ranna St&aacute;it &eacute;ags&uacute;la, is l&eacute;ir go raibh an coimisin&eacute;ir ag d&eacute;anamh a chuid oibre.  Nuair a l&eacute;ann muid na tuarasc&aacute;lacha, feiceann muid an oiread d&iacute;ograise at&aacute; aige.  Bh&iacute; an coimisin&eacute;ir agus a oifigigh ag d&eacute;anamh a gcuid oibre agus ag feidhmi&uacute; de r&eacute;ir an Achta.  Bh&iacute; siad ag d&eacute;anamh gach a nd&uacute;radh leo a dh&eacute;anamh.  Bh&iacute; siad ag comhoibri&uacute; leis na Ranna chomh fada agus ab fh&eacute;idir.  Bh&iacute; siad r&eacute;as&uacute;nach sa mh&eacute;id a bh&iacute; siad ag iarraidh orthu agus c&eacute; nach raibh siad ag f&aacute;il comhoibrithe i go leor c&aacute;sanna, bh&iacute; siad ag f&aacute;il comhoibrithe i c&aacute;sanna eile.  San &aacute;it a raibh sin ag tarl&uacute;, bh&iacute; ruda&iacute; socraithe go deas ci&uacute;in.</p><p>  Leag Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara tuairisc&iacute; os comhair Thithe an Oireachtais agus ba faoi an tOireachtas ansin feidhmi&uacute; ar na tuairisc&iacute; sin, ach le bheith f&iacute;rinneach, n&iacute;or fheidhmigh muid.  Tugadh roinnt dreamanna, mar shampla, an Roinn Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute;, agus mar sin de os comhair an choiste faoinar thagair muid n&iacute;os luaithe, ach n&iacute;or th&aacute;inig an Rialtas taobh thiar de na hiarrachta&iacute; sin.  Aonta&iacute;m le Se&aacute;n Mag Leann&aacute;in sa mh&eacute;id a bh&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; aige.  M&aacute;s tada an fhianaise a tugadh ag an Chomhchoiste Achanaithe agus Formhaoirsi&uacute; Poibl&iacute; &oacute;n Roinn Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute;, d'airigh mise an doicheall agus an ghr&aacute;in a bh&iacute; acu maidir le cur i bhfeidhm an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; molta ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir.  Bh&iacute; freastal l&aacute;idir ann agus ba l&eacute;ir uathu gur bhraith siad nach raibh sa rud seo, &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge, ach rud beag f&aacute;nach a bh&iacute; ag cur as d&oacute;ibh agus go raibh fadhbanna i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; acu n&aacute; sin le r&eacute;iteach.  L&eacute;irigh sin domsa an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt Se&aacute;n Mag Leann&aacute;in go poibl&iacute; agus ceapaim go bhfuil an ceart ar fad aige.</p><p>  T&aacute; an rud ad&uacute;irt an coimisin&eacute;ir faoi l&eacute;irmheast&oacute;ireacht neamhsple&aacute;ch iontach t&aacute;bhachtach, bunaithe ar thaighde an tagartha a d'&uacute;s&aacute;id s&eacute;.  An bhf&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; beag&aacute;n leathnaithe a dh&eacute;anamh ar an smaoineamh sin?  C&eacute;n taighde at&aacute; i gceist aige go d&iacute;reach?  C&eacute;ard iad na f&iacute;ric&iacute; ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inne a bheith ag breathn&uacute; orthu?  S&iacute;lim, gurb &eacute; at&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir, agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag labhairt go han-l&aacute;idir anseo, go bhfuil s&eacute; ag cur d&uacute;shl&aacute;in m&oacute;r os comhair an choiste seo.  T&aacute; muid anseo le hathbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  Caithfimid tabhairt faoi sin agus tabhairt faoi i bhfad n&iacute;os d&aacute;ir&iacute;re n&aacute; mar at&aacute; d&eacute;anta againn go dt&iacute; seo.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn an strait&eacute;is - t&aacute;im ag d&eacute;anamh an mholta seo don fhochoiste - a th&oacute;g&aacute;il l&iacute;ne ar l&iacute;ne, moladh ar mholadh agus dul tr&iacute;d gach cheann de na molta&iacute; airithe.  Le gach moladh, ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn f&eacute;achaint c&eacute;ard &eacute; an moladh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta, c&eacute;n dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ar an moladh sin, agus c&eacute;ard eile is c&oacute;ir a dh&eacute;anamh amach anseo.  S&iacute;lim, go gheobhaimid amach i bhformh&oacute;r na gc&aacute;sannna gur beag at&aacute; d&eacute;anta, ach coist&iacute; a bheith bunaithe.  Deirtear go bhfuil neart cainte d&eacute;anta ag leibh&eacute;al ard, ach n&iacute; fheiceann muid tada ag tarl&uacute; ar an dtalamh.</p><p>  D&eacute;anaim an moladh sin don choiste seo, go nd&eacute;anfadh muid an strait&eacute;is a th&oacute;g&aacute;il moladh ar mholadh, c&aacute;ip&eacute;is a dh&eacute;anamh amach agus an dul chun cinn ar ghach moladh acu sin a theist.  Mar adeir an coimisin&eacute;ir, ba ch&oacute;ir an teist sin a bheigh bunaithe ar thaighde.  N&iacute; hionann c&aacute;ip&eacute;is agus strait&eacute;is.  Deireann an coimisin&eacute;ir go bhfuil an c&uacute;ram plean&aacute;il teanga curtha anuas ar ghuaill&iacute; an phobail.  &Oacute; a bheith ag caint leis na comharchumainn agus na daoine at&aacute; iontu, t&aacute; cine&aacute;l gunna lena gcloigeann.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite leo go pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach go gcaithfidh siad an jab seo a dh&eacute;anamh n&oacute; nach bhfaighfidh siad taca&iacute;ocht.  Sin an meon at&aacute; ar an dtalamh, gur cine&aacute;l cail&iacute;s mhail&iacute;seach at&aacute; tugtha d&oacute;ibh.  T&aacute; an c&uacute;ram tugtha d&oacute;ibh, ach n&iacute;l na hacmhainn&iacute; tugtha d&oacute;ibh leis an plean&aacute;il teanga a chur i bhfeidhm.  Mar a deireann an coimisin&eacute;ir, t&aacute; an-chuid scileanna ag an dream at&aacute; ann agus t&aacute; jabanna eile le d&eacute;anamh acu, &oacute; thaobh sc&eacute;imeanna agus an obair eile at&aacute; ar bun acu mar chomharchumainn agus comhlachta&iacute; pobalbhunaithe, seachas an c&uacute;ram plean&aacute;la teanga.  C&aacute; bhfeicfeadh an coimisin&eacute;ir gur ch&oacute;ir an c&uacute;ram sin a bheith leagtha, seachas anuas ar na pobail agus na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is deonacha?</p><p>  Maidir leis na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga, luaigh muid cheana c&eacute; chomh dona agus at&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; faoi l&aacute;thair maidir le cur i bhfeidhm agus daingni&uacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam an bhfuil aon bealach chun cinn.  Ar ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn dearmad glan a dh&eacute;anamh ar sin ag an bpointe seo n&oacute; an bhfuil muid d&iacute;reach ag cur i gc&eacute;ill?  Aonta&iacute;m leis an gcoimisin&eacute;ir maidir leis an gc&oacute;ras earca&iacute;ochta, &oacute; thaobh nach bhfuil an polasa&iacute; nua ag dul i bhfeidhm.  Le &eacute; a chur ar an taifead, c&eacute;n moladh a bh&iacute; ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir maidir leis an bpolasa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta?  Luaigh s&eacute; c&oacute;ras cos&uacute;il leis an gceann at&aacute; sa PSNI, de r&eacute;ir mo chuimhne.  B'fh&eacute;idir go m'bhfi&uacute; &eacute; sin a chur ar an dtaifead ar&iacute;s d&uacute;inn. </p> <p>T&aacute; s&eacute; scannalach nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag deichni&uacute;r as an seisear d&eacute;ag sna hoifig&iacute; teagmh&aacute;la at&aacute; ainmnithe le comhcheangail a dh&eacute;anamh le hOifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.  Nuair a labhra&iacute;m le daoine sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s a bhfuil Gaeilge acu, deireann siad liom gur bhre&aacute; leo r&oacute;l den chine&aacute;l sin.  T&aacute; siad coinnithe in &aacute;iteanna eile, &aacute;fach, agus n&iacute;l feidhm Ghaeilge ar bith ag baint leis an obair a dh&eacute;anann siad &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute;.  C&eacute;n chaoi a dtiocfaimid thairis sin?  An f&eacute;idir atheagr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh nuair at&aacute; bac ar earca&iacute;ocht sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s?</p><p> Tuigim chomh maith an frustrachas a bhaineann leis an ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im mhillteanach i dtaobh an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.  T&aacute; an d&aacute; shampla a thug an coimisin&eacute;ir n&aacute;ireach agus scannalach.  S&iacute;lim gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn mar choiste iarradh ar ionadaithe &oacute;n Roinn teacht os &aacute;r gcomhair ag am tr&aacute;th ann, agus an t-athbhreithni&uacute; seo &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn, chun iad a cheisti&uacute; go mion ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; luaite ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir.</p><p> T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil m&eacute; ag dul ar aghaidh p&iacute;osa fada, ach n&iacute; gheobhaidh m&eacute; deis &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh le Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in ar&iacute;s.  Cuireann an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; aige faoin na preasr&aacute;itis - an cur i gc&eacute;ill a bhaineann le tice&aacute;il bosca&iacute;, agus an fh&eacute;inmheast&oacute;ireacht <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>an mheast&oacute;ireacht neamhsple&aacute;ch at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il &oacute; Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga - an-imn&iacute; orm.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil an tice&aacute;il bosca&iacute; seo ar si&uacute;l in &aacute;iteanna i bhfad n&iacute;os leithne chomh maith c&eacute;anna.</p><p> T&aacute; tuairisc ag teast&aacute;il &oacute;n gcoiste seo.  Caithfimid an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n seo a ghlacadh.  Ba cheart do bhaill an choiste gn&iacute;omh&uacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  S&iacute;lim nach leor d&uacute;inn a r&aacute; go bhfuilimid b&aacute;&uacute;il - caithfimid gn&iacute;omh&uacute;.  Molaim n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go mbeidh &eacute;isteachta&iacute; ag an gcoiste seo, ach freisin go gcuirfimid tuairisc chuimsitheach le ch&eacute;ile maidir leis an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don teanga.  Chomh maith leis sin, is d&oacute;cha go mbeidh orainn breathn&uacute; ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus an Acht Oideachais de r&eacute;ir mar a bheidh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; ag dul ar aghaidh.  Caithfimid bheith n&iacute;os saini&uacute;la maidir leis na mioncheisteanna a bhaineann leis an strait&eacute;is.  M&aacute; fhanann an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ginear&aacute;lta, agus muna rachaimid go saini&uacute;il tr&iacute;d an strait&eacute;is f&eacute;in pointe ar phointe, n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go mbeidh aon dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta.</p><p> Ba mhaith liom mar rud pearsanta bu&iacute;ochas a ghlacadh le Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in as ucht an obair &eacute;achtach at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige.  T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte, &oacute;n m&eacute;id at&aacute; cloiste agam &oacute;n l&aacute; gur fh&oacute;gair s&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; i gceist aige &eacute;ir&iacute; as a phost, go bhfuil m&eacute; ag labhairt ar son pobal na Gaeilge nuair a deirim &eacute; sin.  Is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; freisin go bhfuil an fhoireann bheag in Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga iontach d&iacute;ograiseach, an-ch&uacute;irt&eacute;iseach agus an-oibleag&aacute;ideach go deo.</p><p> Rinne lucht Conradh na Gaeilge tr&iacute; phointe, i dtaobh na gn&iacute;omhartha gur g&aacute; a th&oacute;g&aacute;il sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo, ag an gcruinni&uacute; poibl&iacute; a d'eagraigh siad i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, d&uacute;irt siad gur g&aacute; Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga a l&aacute;idri&uacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil na point&iacute; seo luaite ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir ina dtuarasc&aacute;lacha bliant&uacute;la agus in &aacute;iteanna eile, ach b'fh&eacute;idir gur cheart d&oacute; iad a mheabhr&uacute; d&uacute;inn ar&iacute;s.  C&eacute;n chaoi a bhfeicfeadh s&eacute; gur ch&oacute;ir &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh?  Ar an dara dul s&iacute;os, mhol Conradh na Gaeilge gur cheart a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil d&oacute;thain Gaeilge ag fostaithe an St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; s&eacute; luaite agam gur cheart go mbeadh na fostaithe in ann seirbh&iacute;s a chur ar f&aacute;il gan cheist gan choinne&aacute;il faoi dheireadh 2016.  Ar an tr&iacute;&uacute; dul s&iacute;os, d&uacute;irt Conradh na Gaeilge gur cheart seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it a chur ar f&aacute;il as Gaeilge do phobal na Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom d&aacute; gcuireadh an coimisin&eacute;ir a smaoint&iacute; sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo ar an taifead - n&oacute;, b'fh&eacute;idir, iad a sheoladh ar aghaidh chugainn - ionas go mbeimid in ann iad a th&oacute;g&aacute;il san &aacute;ireamh in aon tuarasc&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anfaimid bunaithe ar na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; maidir leis an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.</p><p> Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; na dTithe seo.  An t-am deireanach a labhair an coimisin&eacute;ir ag coiste Oireachtais, bh&iacute; fadhb theanga againn mar go raibh an c&oacute;ras aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in briste.  Is maith an rud a thabhairt faoi deara go bhfuil cu&iacute; curtha ar sin.  Tuigim gur fadhb theicni&uacute;il, seachas fadhb ateangaireachta, a bh&iacute; i gceist an l&aacute; sin.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas a ghlacadh leo si&uacute;d a shol&aacute;thra&iacute;onn seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; na Tithe seo - an cl&eacute;ireach agus an fhoireann a bh&iacute;onn ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge - as ucht an obair &eacute;achtach a dh&eacute;anann siad sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l aon gh&aacute; go mbeadh ar dhreamanna beaga mar sin an leibh&eacute;al c&eacute;anna seirbh&iacute;s a chur ar f&aacute;il.

N&iacute;ltear s&aacute;sta, is cos&uacute;il i l&aacute;thair na huaire, dul i ngleic leis sin.

T&aacute; an caighde&aacute;n sin leagtha s&iacute;os i gCeanada.</p><p>  Creidim go gcaithfidh aon teastas&uacute; a bhainfeadh le haon ch&oacute;ras sa seirbh&iacute;s poibl&iacute;, ach an oiread leis an teastas&uacute; a bhaineann le tiom&aacute;int, a bheith neamhsple&aacute;ch.  Samhlaigh, d&aacute; dtiocfadh an saol am&aacute;rach go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; jab a fh&aacute;il sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s a raibh tiom&aacute;int riachtanach agus go bhf&eacute;adfadh an Roinn a r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an duine in ann tiom&aacute;int, seachas go mbeadh dream neamhsple&aacute;ch ann go bhfuil an c&uacute;ram orthu an teastas tiom&aacute;na a thabhairt.  Rinne muid &eacute; sin, c&oacute;ras neamhsple&aacute;ch a chur ar f&aacute;il, i gc&aacute;s na n-aistritheoir&iacute;.  T&aacute; an ceart ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir faoin mh&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt s&eacute; faoin m&uacute;inteoireacht.  M&aacute; bhre&aacute;tha&iacute;onn muid sa strait&eacute;is, d&eacute;antar iarracht d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an oideachas ar an mbealach go mbeadh daoine c&aacute;ilithe le m&uacute;ineadh in nGaelscoileanna agus scoileanna Gaeltachta.</p><p>  Seo an &aacute;it a thagann an cheist d&uacute;inne.  Dar liomsa go mba cheart don choiste seo obair a th&oacute;g&aacute;il orthu f&eacute;in.  T&aacute;im chun cl&aacute;r oibre a leagaint amach a cheapaim a bheadh r&eacute;as&uacute;nach.  Uimhir a haon, go dt&oacute;gfadh an coiste seo ar f&eacute;in an cheist maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; pearsanra le Gaeilge sa st&aacute;tc&oacute;ras a ini&uacute;chadh, finn&eacute;ithe a thabhairt isteach anseo &oacute; na heagrais cu&iacute; agus tuarasc&aacute;il trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; a r&eacute;iteach le molta&iacute;, ciallmhara stuama ann ar c&eacute;n chaoi le dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb seo.  T&aacute; tuarasc&aacute;il mar sin r&eacute;itithe ag an gcoiste agus an fochoiste talmha&iacute;ochta agus d&rsquo;fhoils&iacute;odh ceann in Inis O&iacute;rr le gairid.  Is f&eacute;idir le coiste sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  D&aacute; mbeadh sin ann, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh muid dul trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; leis.  T&aacute; rud maith amh&aacute;in sa D&aacute;il anseo, mura dtagann an p&aacute;irt&iacute; Rialtais ann, n&iacute; chuireann siad riamh in aghaidh na tuarasc&aacute;lacha seo agus b&iacute;onn a n-ainmneacha leo &ndash;Bingo.  </p><p>  An dara rud a cheapaim go mba cheart don choiste seo a dh&eacute;anamh &ndash; n&iacute;l m&eacute; ar an gcoiste faraor &ndash; ach bh&iacute; cinneadh d&eacute;anta ini&uacute;chadh a dh&eacute;anamh ar chur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute; mh&eacute;id den obair sin at&aacute; d&eacute;anta, c&eacute; go gcoinn&iacute;m s&uacute;il ar na cruinnuithe coiste chuile sheachtain.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn cur chun oibre muna bhfuil an obair seo d&eacute;anta - mar ad&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh - le hini&uacute;chadh a dh&eacute;anamh ar chur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise.  Ach is ceart an obair seo a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gcaoi a dh&eacute;anann an PAC a chuid oibre faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; airgid, d&iacute;reach ar an mbealach fuarch&uacute;iseach c&eacute;anna agus a dh&eacute;anann an coiste sin a chuid oibre.</p><p>  T&aacute; acmhainn&iacute; le f&aacute;il &oacute;n Leabharlann ag coist&iacute; le c&uacute;namh a thabhairt &oacute; thaobh tuarasc&aacute;lacha a r&eacute;iteach agus taighde a dh&eacute;anamh.  Mar sin, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh an coiste, sa ngearrth&eacute;arma, go dt&iacute; go leagfar an dualgas go foirme&aacute;lta sa dl&iacute; ar an gcoimisin&eacute;ir nua, an obair seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  Sin mar a dh&eacute;anfadh an dream a dh&eacute;anann an ini&uacute;chadh ar na cuntais, i gc&aacute;s airgid, &eacute;.  D&eacute;antar an ini&uacute;chadh agus leagtar an tuarasc&aacute;il os comhair an choiste agus ansin go mbeadh na h&eacute;isteachta&iacute; ann.</p><p>  Ba cheart an rud c&eacute;anna a dh&eacute;anamh maidir le tuarasc&aacute;il an choimisin&eacute;ara.  Ba cheart go dt&oacute;gfadh an coiste seo ar f&eacute;in, d&iacute;reach mar a dh&eacute;anann an PAC, chuile duine at&aacute; luaite sna tuarasc&aacute;lacha seo at&aacute; faill&iacute;och ina gcuid dualgais&iacute; a ghlaoch isteach anseo agus ansin &eacute;isteachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; a bheith ann. </p> <p>Tuigeann gach duine at&aacute; i l&aacute;thair cad a tharla&iacute;onn sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin.  T&aacute; a mhacasamhail ann &oacute; thaobh an airgid de.</p><p> Bogfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; rud go mbeidh orainn a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&oacute;gartha ag an Taoiseach sa D&aacute;il, mar fhreagra ar cheist a chuir m&eacute;, go bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist ag an Rialtas cinn an Bhille a fhoilsi&uacute; sula bhfoilseofar an reachta&iacute;ocht f&eacute;in.  Ar an bpointe nuair a fhoilseofar na cinn, ba cheart don choiste seo ar bhonn trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; na cinn a ini&uacute;chadh, finn&eacute;ithe a lorg, tuarasc&aacute;il a chur ar ais chuig an Taoiseach agus iarracht a dh&eacute;anamh taca&iacute;ocht trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; a fh&aacute;il le molta&iacute; &oacute;n Oireachtas faoi c&eacute;ard ba cheart a bheith sa Bhille sin.  D&aacute; nd&eacute;anfadh an tOireachtas na tr&iacute; rud seo go cuimsitheach agus go hioml&aacute;n as seo go deireadh na bliana, is m&oacute; a bheadh d&eacute;anta againn don Ghaeilge n&aacute; mar a dh&eacute;anfadh c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le &oacute;r&aacute;id.  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; seo le cur i bhfeidhm, beidh ar dhaoine am a chur ar leataobh, seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine, chun teacht isteach anseo agus &eacute;isteacht, pl&eacute; agus ini&uacute;chadh fuarch&uacute;iseach agus staid&eacute;ar a dh&eacute;anamh agus ansin tuarasc&aacute;il a r&eacute;iteach.  Beidh c&uacute;namh le f&aacute;il leis an tuarasc&aacute;il - mar a deirim, t&aacute; airgead ag an Leabharlann obair mar sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; ag deireadh an lae go bhfuil s&eacute; tugtha le fios ag Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in go bhfuil ruda&iacute; i dtaobh na Gaeilge i bhf&iacute;or-dhrochstaid.  T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och de as ucht &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am gn&iacute;omh ceart a dh&eacute;anamh, seachas bheith ag &oacute;r&aacute;id&iacute;ocht faoi.  Mar a deirtear, is fearr coinneal a lasadh n&aacute; bheith ag mallacht&uacute; an dorchadas.  S&iacute;lim gur cheart d&uacute;inn bheith ar an gc&eacute;ad dream le coinneal a lasadh anseo agus gn&iacute;omh praitici&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh chun tabhairt faoin bhfadhb.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag moladh go nd&eacute;anfar na tr&iacute; ghn&iacute;omh at&aacute; luaite agam idir seo agus deireadh na bliana.</p></speech>

Beidh ar an Oireachtas a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht "fit for purpose", mar a deirtear i mB&eacute;arla.

Is cuimhin liom rud a tharla deich mbliana &oacute; shin nuair a thosaigh Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga ag d&eacute;anamh ini&uacute;chadh ar sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  Nuair a chuaigh m&eacute; amach le hini&uacute;chadh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gc&eacute;ad sc&eacute;im teanga go dt&iacute; Roinn &aacute;irithe Rialtais, d&uacute;irt m&eacute; go raibh m&eacute; ag iarraidh f&aacute;il amach an raibh an sc&eacute;im, a bh&iacute; ann le bliain faoin tr&aacute;th sin, &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.964" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014012300002#A00200"><p>I remind members to switch off their mobile phones.  It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode; they must be switched off or they will interfere with the broadcasting equipment.  This includes iPads.<br />On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Catherine Day, Secretary General of the European Commission.  I thank her for coming before the committee to discuss the role of national parliaments in the European semester process and the annual growth survey 2014.  She was born in Dublin and has worked at the European Commission since 1979.  During a very successful career she has covered the full spectrum of European policy areas.  This meeting will give her the opportunity to elaborate on the role of national parliaments, particularly those of the euro area countries.  We must now formulate our economic policy in co-ordination with other European Union countries and no longer in complete isolation.  This has the potential to create complete economic union and it includes the annual European process for economic policy consideration and governance.  This meeting gives us an opportunity to speak to Ms Day and ask her for her views on the European semester process, how it has worked to date and what changes she expects to see in the near future.<br />I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

I wish to set out and follow very much the structure the Chairman has outlined, but before I do so, I will set the scene.  I will be very happy to engage in a discussion afterwards, including on topics I have not raised which might be of interest to committee members.</p><p>  It is always a good practice at the start of a new year to take stock and see what is coming down the track.  This will be a year of big political change throughout the European Union.  We will have a new Commission, Parliament and President of the European Council.  We will have many new officeholders who will be in charge of driving the Union forward.  They will face a number of big challenges and probably the most immediate is how to sustain growth.  A fragile recovery is under way and we must consider how to underpin and strengthen it.</p><p>  The topic on which I wish to spend most time today is how to get more national ownership of the new economic governance process the European Union has put in place.  As the Chairman stated, those of us with the euro as our common currency must share decision-making in the future; therefore, how can we get more national ownership?  </p><p>  Another big issue on the agenda for the new officeholders to whom I referred will be the particular matters of relations with the United Kingdom and the wider debate about subsidiarity and where the European Union should be involved.  This will be very much at the centre of the agenda.  I hope that as we put the crisis behind us, the European Union can also look at the wider world, having inevitably had a very internal focus during the years of the crisis.  Committee members know we are engaged in very big and exciting trade negotiations with the United States and other partners.  I hope that in the next five years our agenda will include a much wider look at the world.</p><p>  I congratulate Ireland which had a very successful Presidency in the first half of last year and a successful exit from the programme at the end of last year.  In European terms, 2013 was certainly a good story for Ireland.  I want to consider what exiting from the programme means.  It still means major engagement with European partners.  We certainly draw the lesson from the crisis that one cannot have a common currency without much closer co-ordination of policy.  During the crisis years we were trying to put in place instruments which would allow us to work more closely together.  These go from building up funds to help member states in difficulty to having regular surveillance to avoid problems starting in the first place.  To use the inevitable Brussels jargon, we want to put more emphasis on the preventive than the corrective.</p> <p>In the heat of the crisis many necessary decisions were taken, but they were quite complex.  What we are now trying to do is to explain better to people what is behind all the legal jargon and what it means.  I like to explain it in terms of an annual health check.  When one goes for an annual check-up, one undergoes many different tests.  At a certain point one sits down with the doctor who interprets the results and gives guidance.  The guidance could be that one should take more exercise or lose some weight, or that one has serious problems that must be acted on immediately.  Often it is not just a one-to-one exercise between the person and the doctor; it is also the person and the family.  Similarly, with regard to European economic governance, it is about doing the tests on how the economies are doing - sitting down, first, with the Commission, who interprets the tests and makes recommendations, but then discussing with the family of the other member states, particularly those who are in the euro, what has to happen in the coming years.  That is a very simplistic way of describing what is very complicated and very calibrated.  There are different rules for the euro and non-euro areas and for countries in severe difficulty, countries with not too many problems and a whole range in between.  Basically, it is about making sure that in the future we are aware of problems as they emerge and that we intervene long before the problems get to the scale of what we have been dealing with in recent years.</p><p> For me one of the most important moments of the cycle is in May.  This is when, once a year, the Commission sits down with all the analyses, looks at the results of the different tests and gives an opinion on where we see a member state in relation to where it has agreed it should be, and the Commission makes recommendations.  Just as in the annual health check, one can ignore the doctor's advice, but then there are consequences.  In the European system there are sanctions and fines if countries repeatedly ignore recommendations that have been decided together.  Long before the European system gets to apportion consequences, as we have seen in the crisis, the markets judge very quickly.  If they do not think a country's economic policy is credible there is a fairly savage and immediate reaction long before the processes in Brussels get to conclude that a country is out of line.  Part of all of this process is about transparency; it is about putting the data out there and collectively drawing the conclusions.</p><p> We are in the European semester, the first half of the year.  This is the fourth time we have done it.  We have now reached a good working partnership with the member states, also involving the European Parliament and the national parliament.  I would like to provide one chart which shows a summary of the year and what happens.  I hope this is a reasonably accessible summary of what happens at different points in the year.  It is clear from the chart what the Commission does in the different months, what the European Council and the Council do, what the member states do and what the European Parliament does, including when it works with national parliaments.</p><p> The role of national parliaments is very important for us because we would like to have all of this discussed nationally in order that one gets the buy-in, that people do not see all of this economic governance as being decided far away in Brussels and imposed on member states but rather that it is a participatory process.  Certain things are decided nationally and certain things are decided collectively in the European Union.  The involvement of national parliaments varies from one country to another but national parliaments vote on national budgets, as members will be aware, because Ireland also had to change the timing of its national budget as a result of things that were agreed at European level.  From now on, the Commission issues opinions on draft budgetary plans in November of each year and then makes recommendations the following year based on that.  We have all aligned a cycle of when we take decisions so that we can then draw conclusions together.  All of this needs to be not only debated nationally but explained nationally in terms of the positive effects of taking economic policy decisions together, and we also have to be open about the constraints that go with the benefits of belonging to a common currency area.  </p><p> All of this is about organising a process so that political-level decisions can be taken based on the soundest possible economic analysis.  That is why all of the euro member states have agreed to set up independent fiscal authorities so that the members are detached from policy making in order that the sound basis is there for everyone to see.  It is why the euro area countries have now enshrined a debt brake in their national legislation but it is also why the Commission is making a particular effort to provide much more information to national parliaments.  As members are aware, there is not only the willingness of commissioners to come to national parliaments but also the possibility for national parliaments to call the economics Commissioner to appear before them if they want to debate the policy decisions that are being made.</p><p> I will make two final points.  We are working to step up our interaction with national parliaments.  In our representations - Barbara Nolan is our head of representation here - in all the non-programme countries, of which Ireland is one, we will have two dedicated European semester officers.  Their job will be to reach out to national parliaments and stakeholders such as the social partners and provide a two-way channel, passing information on each country to the Commission and then being available to give briefings on how the Commission is thinking and what is the import of decisions either taken or to come.  I would encourage the committee, once these officers are appointed in Dublin, to make use of them as a link between the European and national levels.  </p><p> Finally, I wish to make a request.  The committee is aware that Europe has a growth and jobs strategy, which we call Europe 2020.  We will be reviewing it this year and will then launch a public consultation to run between April and the autumn.  It is about gathering the input to design the post-crisis growth strategy for the European Union.  Nobody is better placed to respond than Ireland - having just come through a most difficult time, having successfully exited from the programme and having lots of ideas about where growth should come from - so I would like to see a solid and strong input from Ireland.  I give the committee advance notice that the invitation will come, but I hope it can be taken up, including by the Oireachtas.  This is an opportunity to influence European policy.  As a country that has been through much in recent years, Ireland has a particular take on it.  I hope we can get a very strong input from Ireland. </p></speech>

She mentioned the country-specific recommendations.  As Ms Day is aware, up to now Ireland's only recommendation has been to carry out the programme.  It is a one-line recommendation.  This is going to be the first year in which we will have some meat on the bones of that recommendation.  I am wondering how that will be received by the Irish public because, as Ms Day said, there is probably a lack of awareness with regard to the semester.  Everyone is aware that the bailout has finished and that we have seen the end of the troika, but the danger is that the country-specific recommendations might be seen as more diktats from Brussels.  Of course that is not the case, but the fact that the semester has not been communicated sufficiently to date might play a part in that.  Perhaps Ms Day would tell the committee how they have been received in other countries to date?  Has there been much coverage of them when they have been published and what has been the reaction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.968" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Day" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014012300003#B00300"><p>I hope that meetings such as this and other meetings that are planned will help to create an understanding of the semester.  The semester is the normal way that Europe does business.  The programme is an extraordinary response to an extraordinary situation.  Ireland is now back in the normal mainstream but because we are in a common currency area and as we have seen during the crisis, the decisions taken in one country have a direct and sometimes very damaging effect on another.</p> <p>The norm will be that countries in the euro area will pool their decision-making much more tightly.  The members are correct to ask what is happening in other countries and we have had some very interesting debates.  All of this is evolving.  I have said this is the fourth time we have been doing what I have described and we have gradually developed a better way of interacting with member states.  The chart I have to hand shows that three times a year we have a bilateral meeting with the member state to avoid surprises.  We should be sharing our analysis and examining last year's recommendations and discussing with member states what they have implemented, why they have not implemented certain measures and whether they have done certain things in a different way.</p><p> Our approach has given rise to quite a lot of discussion in various member states.  Let me give the committee two examples.  Two years ago we recommended to Belgium and Luxembourg that they take another look at their wage indexation systems.  We felt they were very rigid and causing them to lose competitiveness, both inside the European Union and internationally.  Their first reaction was that their systems were part of their way of working based on social partnership and they questioned why the Commission should be telling them why they should revisit their systems.  However, the fact that the Commission had put the spotlight on this matter led to a year-long debate, particularly in Belgium.  Instead of just assuming its system was a natural part of the landscape, Belgium started to examine why the Commission was focusing on the matter.  The Belgians, in acknowledging they had a competitiveness problem, asked whether the indexation system was a part of it.  At the end of the year the Belgian authorities did not completely follow the Commission&rsquo;s recommendation but came up with changes to the system that took away the problem about which we were worried.  They found a way of keeping the structure overall, while tackling the competitiveness problem.  In such cases there is a movement from a position in which countries ask why the Commission is picking on a certain subject to having a debate.  This leads to an understanding of why the Commission adopted its position and a realisation that the matter needs to be addressed.</p><p> This year the Commission decided it would carry out an in-depth review of Germany.  When we decided to do so, there was much comment in the German press questioning whether the Commission had gone mad.  Considering that Germany has a strong economy and not had problems, it was asked whether the Commission wanted to make Germany less competitive because other member states were less competitive.  It was asked whether the Commission was trying to drag Germany down.  This was not the case at all.  We wanted a serious analysis of the consequences for a country like Germany of having a big surplus.  Of course, it is more comfortable to have a budgetary surplus than a budgetary deficit, but we asked what the right policies would be for Germany as a country and also for Germany as the leading economy in the eurozone.  Is there a way in which Germany can craft its future economic policies so as to have a positive spillover for other member states and avoid negative spillovers?  There was a big debate in the German press for two or three weeks and many eminent German economists argued different points.  Very quickly, however, an awareness developed to the effect that the Commission had a point and that Germany had to have the debate.  </p><p> These are just two very concrete examples of how our approach works, although it may not be immediately obvious.  The way we are working together is helping member states to focus on issues on which they need to focus.  We wanted to use our approach more to help member states to tackle together issues that they would face such as raising the retirement age.  If every country has to do it, why do we not discuss it and determine where there is best practice?  We must ask whether it is easier for countries in a currency union to make moves together rather than alone?</p></speech>

Ms Day's chart on the European semester or European economic timetable is very helpful.  "Semester" is a new word that we will have to add to our vocabulary.  The process seems to focus very much on draft budgets.  The final part is the budget.  Is the process out of sync with our system in Ireland?  In other countries such as Sweden the budget is the final point of discussion.  This poses a question for our committee structure in the Oireachtas.  The committees abroad scrutinise the draft measures as part of their European scrutiny process, whereas in Ireland the budget is the starting point.  Then, when it is almost too late, we engage our committees.  Do we need to change?  I am reasonably sure the Government is open to it.</p><p>  With regard to the country-specific recommendations, in the past the Commission and the European Union &ndash; I am thinking of the Stability and Growth Pact &ndash; did not really have the necessary power to face down the bigger countries such as Germany and France.  To what extent are they now in a better position?  Particularly given some of the political commentary from the United Kingdom, perhaps difficulties of the French President and the fact that the Germans are still holding the purse strings of Europe, will the Commission apply the same rules and criteria to the bigger countries?  If so, is it now in a better position to achieve what it wants?</p><p>  This week a number of us were at the European Parliamentary Week events and we came back last night on the same aeroplane.  We hear a lot about democratic legitimacy and jobs.  We have an elected national parliament and the elected European Parliament.  The Commission clearly has a difficult job to do.  Ms Day states there will be consequences if its recommendations are not implemented.  Does she believe the Commission has sufficient democratic legitimacy?  It is the European Central Bank and the Commission that people talk about when they talk about a lack of democratic accountability.  How could it be improved if it needs to be improved at all?  How can the Commission's role within the democratic system be better explained to ordinary Europeans?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.972" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014012300004#C00400"><p>I welcome Ms Day and also Ms Nolan, whom we meet regularly and who keeps us well briefed on what the Commission is doing.  </p><p>  Ms Day talked a little about the importance of engagement with national parliaments and encouraging debate in this regard.  From an Irish citizen's perspective, it is always helpful if there is visibility or acceptance that the Commission is doing what we believe is good for us as citizens.  To that end, could I have Ms Day's view on how she envisages the Commission re-emerging?  Throughout the crisis it was largely sidelined.  We witnessed the spectacle of France and Germany taking an exceptionally hands-on approach to dealing with the crisis.  However, I do not want to go back over that issue.  Does Ms Day envisage the Commission re-emerging and taking its place as it should in the overall architecture of the institutions?</p><p>  From a strictly Irish point of view, can Ms Day give us some visibility on how quickly she believes banking union will be achieved?  Perhaps my next question is a political one that Ms Day will not want to answer.  Does she believe the completion of the banking union process will ultimately lead to Ireland being in a position to draw down funding from the ESM associated with the legacy investment in our pillar banks?</p></speech>

Ms Day mentioned policies that countries might tackle together.  I have been doing a little work on the issue of youth unemployment.  Is Ms Day aware of any strategic approach to tackling youth unemployment and unemployment generally?  Deputy Timmy Dooley spoke about the crisis, to which youth unemployment at a European level is related.</p><p>  Ms Day mentioned the retirement age.  This is relevant to all member states but some much more than others.</p> <p>While it is a huge question, I am interested in hearing a brief outline of Ms Day's views on the scrutiny of European Union legislation by different member states.  I believe Ireland is under-performing in that regard and while there are many different views and approaches, Ms Day might comment briefly on how Ireland might improve its performance.</p></speech>

First, on the discussion of the draft budget and the reason member states in the euro area have agreed that the Commission will look at their draft budgets, it is to make sure that at a stage when the member state in question can still change and the Commission still can have an influence, the budget is on track.  This is because in all the different processes, there are pathways to arriving, hopefully, to the steady state.  It is important that before budgets are decided, governments know whether, in the Commission's opinion, they are on-track or off-track, in order that it does not happen too late when all the negotiations are done and a decision must be taken.  Consequently, we do not judge the quality of the policy at the stage when we consider the draft budget.  We look more at whether it is well constructed or meets the essential criteria.  We then look at the choices that are made in the May moment to which I refer.  I honestly think it is for every member state to figure out what works best for it.  I mentioned Ireland being obliged to move forward to October with the adoption of the draft budget.  This was because Ireland and a few other countries had a different cycle from most of the other member states but that is a one-off change and now it will happen every October.  Countries are so different and organise themselves so differently that the Commission has this single moment when we must look at all the budgets because we must also compare them.  However, the question of how parliaments and governments organise themselves to get there is not really our business.  That they be at the point of rendezvous with the right material is where we bow out.</p><p>  The question about the big and small member states is really valid.  I am absolutely categoric in stating that if the Commission does not apply the rules equally to all member states, we are not doing our job and there is no hope that any system like this will work.  It is very important that the big member states submit themselves to the same discipline as everyone else and that they follow the approach.  This has not always been the case, and if one goes back to 2003 or 2004 one will see that France and Germany basically agreed to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact and the seeds of some of the problems we have seen since were sown at that point.  What is different now is that the enormity of the crisis has made member states realise that being in a common currency requires a different governance system and that all member states must be part of it.  Consequently, I do not envisage any member states challenging the system or challenging the role it has asked the Commission to play.  While challenging the interpretation of the facts, the recommendations, etc., is a different matter, no member state now is stating it does not wish to be part of this or will not implement it.  Legally, the member states have committed themselves to consequences.  We hope we do not get into this territory but if a member state was to ignore systematically both the recommendations of the Commission and the decisions of the Council, as I stated, there now are fines and sanctions as part of the system.  We hope they are the kind of deterrent that must exist on paper in order that the system has teeth, but that in member states' own interests, they would realise the need to take action long before getting to that situation.  The Commission is not only legally permitted to so do but sees this issue in exactly the same way as does the Deputy - that is, how can one have rules that only apply to some member states, as they must be applied to all.  While I do not wish to draw a direct comparison now, my explanation a moment ago about Germany and the in-depth review is a clear illustration of the rules applying to everyone.  Moreover, the trigger points in the system now are so transparent that everyone can hold the Commission to account as well.  However, the political determination to be even-handed across the member states is very strong.</p><p>  On the question of democratic legitimacy, there always is room for improvement.  However, it is very important that through members of this committee, we make clear to people that the Commission does not decide anything.  The Commission makes proposals and has a very strong power of persuasion.  It has a very good analytical capacity but everything we recommend goes to Ministers to be decided.  Consequently, it is democratically decided by Ministers who were elected by each member state.  Sometimes it is convenient to give the impression that it is the nasty Commission that takes all the tough decisions, but really, as members are aware, the decisions are taken by Ministers and, in deciding the framework legislation, with the Parliament.  It can always be improved, and that is the reason the Commission is making a big effort to staff up its representations to be good links between the different capitals and the decision-making machinery in Brussels.  It also is the reason Commissioners are stepping up their visits to national parliaments.  It also is the reason the Commission would like to have more input from national parliaments.</p><p>  Perhaps I will jump to the question about what can be done on the scrutiny of European Union legislation.  What we have seen, after an initial enthusiasm from national parliaments about getting all of the Commission proposals in draft, is that most national parliaments are swamped.  My main piece of advice is that, somehow or other, each national parliament must find a way to choose the priorities on which it will concentrate.  Members are aware that all European legislation starts with a Commission proposal.  Moreover, a lot of European policy proposals also start in the Commission.  We publish our work programme each year and publish what we call roadmaps, which are a first analysis of problems on which we are working, thereby giving an indication that there may be proposals coming down the track.  It is a question of organising with the secretariats what are the next things on which members will focus that really matter in the national context and then developing on that, rather than trying to cover everything.  The European Union is involved in so many things and there is so much going on at the same time that it is not possible.  However, I think it is very important to be selective.</p></speech>

However, I think we have become lost in the fog of the technical issues and have failed to explain to people in clearer terms the reason we are doing all of this.  Why does it matter, for example, if a country's national budget is out of line or it is doing things that are harmful to the neighbours?  Everyone can understand that is not a good situation in which to be, but we do not manage to describe it in that way.  I really think this is where the national parliaments have a role, which in a way is to be a transformative body that has the capacity to understand and follow the technical stuff but then has the capacity to explain to the man or woman in the street the reason we are doing this and not, as we tend to respond from Brussels, with an outpouring of alphabet soup jargon and technicalities of process.  While that is necessary to deliver the results, we should be explaining the issues on which we are working.  That is where we really-----</p></speech>

But of course it is shorthand for those who are insiders and if one can say three pieces of jargon, it is much quicker then saying three sentences.  However, we are failing because we then look like an impenetrable bureaucratic labyrinth, which we are not.  I hope those members who travel to Brussels would agree the institutions actually are fairly open.  However, we are somewhat handicapped by being multinational and multilingual, which is also a bit of a problem.  While we then manage to agree on corruptions of different languages to speak a secret code that we understand, we have lost the ability to speak directly, clearly and simply to people.  I believe national parliaments can play that role in between.</p></speech>

What has the Commission learned in respect of the European semester process over the three years?  Is an ongoing fine-tuning of the system under way?  Second, on the country-specific recommendations, has the Commission made recommendations in the past regarding the banking sector, which obviously had a huge role to play in the economic problems experienced across Europe in recent years?  Stress-testing is under way; has it been part of the process?</p> <p> Regarding Ms Day's comments that the markets have been judging the problems in the European processes, does she believe the markets are likely to be less jittery because of the European Semester, the processes put in place and the fact that countries will get used to those?</p><p> Ms Day commented earlier that the Irish people passed the stability treaty in 2012 and accepted the rules and regulations.  Some people may be surprised by that.  People like to know that countries have to adhere to rules and that we cannot have the runaway budgets we had in the past.  That would be a common view across Europe.</p></speech>

I was here before Ms Day arrived and I asked my colleagues jokingly the definition of a semester.  In my innocence I understood it to be some sort of programme for American students on semester here for the summer.  Ms Day said that as parliamentarians, our duty will be to demystify the work of the European Commission, explain the meaning of "semester" and so on.  She will understand the implications of the rather unsatisfactory term "six-pack".  People here know the meaning of the term "six-pack" but they do not know it in the context of the European Union.  I am on a learning stream and I thank Ms Day because I am learning while listening to her.</p><p>  I have a couple of questions.  I have been reading the annual growth survey that identifies five or six key areas including unemployment, etc. but I am mystified, and Ms Day might explain it, about the term "reforming public administration".  If public administration is being reformed I presume it is being reformed for some reason.  Is it that Ms Day believes they are all inefficient?  Does she want a structure put in place as a result of the reform?  In other words, what reforms does she seek to accomplish the outcome?</p><p>  The 2014 alert mechanism report concludes that 16 member states, which is more than half, may require an in-depth review.  Will Ireland be part of this, making it 17 member states?   I am trying to come to terms with the work of Ms Day's institution.  It is processing preliminary draft budgets of 28 countries.  Does her organisation have an army working for it that can carry out these close-up studies of 16 or 17 member states?</p><p>  Ms Day said she had a very good analytical capacity but is an analytical capacity of itself the way to resolve issues?  I am a little nervous of academics and people with analytical minds imposing their economic concepts on a nation that is dealing with a range of diverse social and economic difficulties.  I encourage Ms Day to continue the good job she is doing but for us to explain her work and objectives to the public requires us to first understand it ourselves.</p></speech>

It is not the first time she will have heard this but there is a sense among many people I meet, and it is probably a view across Europe, that the members of the Commission, the Council and those who pull the strings in Europe have no real understanding of the hardship people are experiencing.  I was woken this morning by a phone call from a journalist who told me that a learned judge is calling for the Civil Defence to be brought into my area.  The judge is talking in terms of a breakdown in social order, and this is one of his solutions.  The area I represent, which is not unique in Ireland or across Europe, has one of the highest unemployment levels in the country.  The local hospital is in the news frequently regarding cutbacks and the difficulties they cause.  The social services have never been under so much pressure in terms of the number of cases.  There is unemployment, poverty and indebtedness.  Children are going to bed hungry.  That is not unique to my area and it is not unique across Europe.  Those are the difficulties in my area and at the same time Ms Day talks about fragile economies.  People talk about the potential for growth and so on but many of the people in the difficulties I describe are in the same position they were in three years ago; it has probably got worse.  They do not see actions coming from Europe in regard to that.</p><p>  I read all the background information in which there is a good deal of reference to avoiding boom and bust cycles, and restoring economic growth.  All of that is hugely important but there is no mention of equitable growth and poverty reduction.  Will the reforms we are discussing investigate that area?  Will alert mechanisms be in place when a country posts high growth but an increase in inequality?  It is not just a matter of facts and figures; we are talking about real people who are suffering.  A figure that struck me was the number of young people leaving Ireland at a rate of one every six minutes.  That is the reality with which we are dealing.</p><p>  Is there any scope for an increase in the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank?  Many of us would argue there is a need for a stimulus package and that the EIB should alter its rules to allow it to lend on a 75:25 ratio rather than the current 50:50 ratio.  Many people across Europe would see that as a hugely positive development.  Someone spoke about youth unemployment, youth investment and so on.  To encourage growth investment should be allowed in those areas.</p><p>  What is the possibility for growth in Ireland and similar countries across the European Union?  Our GDP is 120%.  I refer to the separation of banking debt and sovereign debt.  The retrospective recapitalisation for Ireland was &euro;65 billion, which it pumped into banks, but we are not hearing that.  People are saying growth is coming down the track, there is half an agreement in place and so on but people have lost confidence in the entire process.  We know about the potential for negative social change.  That is happening across Europe with the rise of Fascist parties and so on but there does not seem to be any sense of that.  We are not getting that at any of the meetings.  Everyone is talking about the positives in regard to it but this is all happening in the areas in which we are living.  The judge speaking about my area this morning is a wake-up call but I am sure learned judges across Europe are making the same statements about what is happening socially and so on.  Ms Day's message this morning is about giving hope but the message people want to hear is that we will seriously tackle those inequalities and the burden that has been put on the shoulders of people who did not cause this crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.984" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014012300006#E00400"><p>I welcome Ms Catherine Day and Ms Barbara Nolan to the meeting.  I have two questions.  There is a good deal of support in Ireland for the idea that we would have more robust monitoring of our economic performance at a European level.  There is a much greater realisation in Ireland than perhaps in some of the other countries of the importance of Europe to us into the future and its role.  There is also a peculiar dichotomy in the sense that Europe has enlarged spectacularly in recent years but I have a suspicion that if a survey were done in the morning, 90% of Irish people would not be able to name the member states of the European Union.  To what extent will that undermine what the Commission and the members states are attempting to achieve in terms of European stability?</p> <p>The second issue relates to the Commission's role.  There is an argument that the Commission, to some extent, as the permanent civil service, is the conscience of the European Union and its job is to see difficulties coming around the track.  Does Ms Day feel the Commission has to take responsibility to some extent for the way in which the European roadmap has taken a significant hit, particularly economically, in recent years?  What way does she think the Commission in its engagement with the national parliaments should have more of a blue-skies mandate in the sense of future-proofing the Union to an extent?  I think, for example, of key issues coming down the track that could significantly undermine Europe&rsquo;s capacity going forward, such as how the age profile of our population could seriously undermine us in the years ahead.</p></speech>

I believe Deputy Murphy wishes to speak briefly before we go back to Ms Day.</p></speech>

I wish to return to the process itself and pose another tiny question.</p><p>  To tease out the matter, in March the Commission will publish the in-depth country reviews and then through the summer in May and June it will propose country-specific recommendations.  Shortly after that Ministers will discuss them and then leaders will endorse them.  The in-depth reviews will be published publicly.  Will the country-specific recommendations be published before they get to be discussed in a closed room by Ministers?  It would be interesting to know that from the point of view of accountability.  I can see why the doors would be closed on discussions between the time the Ministers discuss matters and EU leaders endorse them.  It is quite a protracted annual process and then, in European style, the final bit seems to be very tight.</p><p>  The Irish in the Commission are, broadly speaking, part of the civil service wing.  Are there sufficient Irish people working in the Commission and trying to be part of the European civil service?  I see Ms Day shaking her head and therefore assume she will say no.  How could we encourage young people who are extremely talented to get involved?  It is fair to say that the Irish do very well in large organisations around the world.  How could we get the message across that we need more Irish people in the Commission?</p></speech>

How does she think it will play out?  Should we have any concern about timescales?  Deputy Murphy and I spent the past couple of days talking to our European colleagues from other national parliaments and the European Parliament at the Article 13 conference during European Parliament week in Brussels.  One thing that was clear to us is that the European Parliament itself wants a much larger role in the semester process.  That clearly causes potential conflict between national parliaments and the European Parliament.  Does Ms Day have any thoughts on how that might be resolved in the coming years?</p></speech>

I will try to be more systematic in answering.  On the lessons learned, yes, we are learning all the time.  First, we have learned that we need more contact throughout the year with member states.  We have a lot of contact but we have these three fixed times at key moments in the cycle when we come together with the member states.  To invest more in the partnership side of it is important.  We have also learned that the Commission needs to have much more country-specific knowledge than was traditionally the case.  All departments are now doing that, so that not only are we very good on issues of policy relating to transport or agriculture but we know in detail what it means in country X, Y or Z and we can put the geographic and thematic knowledge together so that we really have a good picture and we understand the specifics for each country.</p><p>  A third lesson learned is that we have got to strike the right balance, being clear enough that a member state understands what we are trying to get at while not being overly prescriptive, particularly in how they should deliver the result.  We should not just say that a country should reform its pension system but say that it needs to align life expectancy with retirement ages, and then member states will find different ways of doing it.  Every year we try to be better at that.</p></speech>

I presume it is not required to be done for the next budget.  Does one get a number of years to make the change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.991" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Day" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014012300007#F00700"><p>That is also something we are trying to get better at, together with the member states.  If it is a ten-year project, as some of the issues that need to be tackled are, then we must see whether we can work with the member state to have the right kind of plan and see if its plan will deliver in ten years but also to check whether in year three it is ahead of schedule or falling behind and the reasons for that.  It is not just a question of what are the obstacles or why a country is off course but what we can do to help.  What is necessary is to break plans down into manageable chunks.  Sometimes it is very clear and we need to say countries should adopt a law on this or repeal a law on that.  That is something one can do in a year.  The recommendations tend not to be wildly different from one year to another but from year to year they become more nuanced because, normally speaking, the country is moving through different stages of trying to achieve big and demanding reforms.</p><p>  We have made recommendations on the banking sector.  I have in mind the 2013 round when, for Spain and Slovenia - both countries that have been tackling big problems in the banking sector - there were much more detailed recommendations to them on what they should do than to other countries.  For example, we have picked up on the housing market in a number of member states, even in countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden where, again, they did not initially think they had a problem but after much more detailed discussions they recognised that they would have to do certain things because otherwise they might have a problem.</p><p>  The semester will definitely help with jittery markets.  We have all lived through the past few years when a lot of the media predicted the imminent demise of the euro and said that Europe could not do it and was not able to address the issue.  We have convincingly demonstrated to the markets that Europe has the political will to keep the euro as a strong currency and the existential question has now been put to one side.  We can only be convincing to very hard-headed market analysts because we have good systems in place.  They want to see the transparency, the mechanisms that will push constantly for the necessary kind of sound behaviour.  That is all part of being more credible in the future.</p><p>  On the annual growth survey, it is a very good question to ask what we mean by public sector reform.  We look at this from a lot of different angles.  First, in most European countries we are used to a very big public sector, and this is expensive, so we have to look at whether the public sector is paying its way in terms of the capacity of various economies.  Then we look at the performance of the public sector.  For example, in some countries there is a very big gap between the theoretical tax take and the actual tax take.  One can see in countries such as Greece, where there is a very dramatic difference, that there is an incapacity in the public sector to get in the tax revenue that should be levied by law, but the Government needs to have the income to provide the social services.  What we want to do is to look at whether we can help.  In the case of Greece one has a number of member states giving their expertise on how to run a modern tax system.  My colleagues were telling me recently that one can begin to see a turnaround in the Greek tax collection system.  That is just one example.</p> <p>We would like to push to make public sectors more directly accountable to the citizen.  We would also like more electronic means of conducting public sector business such as doing one&rsquo;s taxes online.  This would cut out opportunities for corruption and speed up the process, but it would also mean the citizen could be directly in touch with the public sector.  It would also mean that one could enter one&rsquo;s details once rather than filling in forms duplicating information to cover each government agency or Department.</p><p> It is different in member states because each has a different tradition, with some being federal and others highly centralised.  We believe, however, that the public sector is not performing as it should over a range of issues.  For example, one could point to the quality of education, skills mismatches or, as Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe pointed out, how unemployment services are working.  In many countries unemployment services are being overhauled to make them more personalised rather than just adopt a mass approach.  These are all aspects of public sector reform and we want to look with member states at where they need to improve their performance.</p><p> There is also the issue of sharing best practice.  Most member states are grappling with variations of similar problems in the public sector.  Perhaps groups of member states can share solutions.  All the public sector employment agencies work much more closely together.  We have developed a Europe-wide job vacancy site, EURES, which has 1 million vacancies on it at any given time.  This offers practical help to member states to work better together in the interests of the citizen.</p><p> We do not have an army of bureaucrats and we do not need one.  We work with member states in trying to use their knowledge and capacity.  As our understanding of each member state&rsquo;s economy is improving year on year, one does not have to go back to the beginning every year.  However, member states do not know very much about each other.  They might know a little about their immediate neighbours.  Accordingly, we are trying to give them a more digestible picture because they now understand that it does matter to them if Greece is off track or there have been developments in Ireland or Spain.</p><p> We give member states comparative data which allows them to benchmark themselves.  National civil services do not necessarily have all of that information.  By producing tables on performance in various areas, we were able to set a benchmark, for example, for the administrative time it takes to set up a small company.  The tables showed it should not take more than three days and cost no more than &euro;100.  When some member states saw it took them between 75 and 300 days, there was quite a dramatic change and overhauling of their systems.</p><p> Members have asked if the European institutions have a heart, understand people are suffering and that there is hardship.  Yes, we do and it worries us very much.  We are wrestling with what are the right polices to overcome the problems we have.  We believe sound public finances and a functioning economy are part of the way out of the crisis.  We have proposed more targeted programmes.  For example, members will be familiar with the youth guarantee because the Irish EU Presidency helped us to deliver it.  That is a practical way of trying to give all young people not in full-time education or employment the opportunity to be taken up by the system and improve their employment chances.  In our growth strategy, Europe 2020, we have five target areas on which the European Union should be working.  These include increasing participation in the labour market and lifting 20 million people out of poverty.  We recognise that while a job is the route out of poverty for many, it is not for everyone.  We have to have policies to support and surround this.  In the crisis we are not doing very well; that is not a reason to change the target or give up but actually to redouble efforts.</p><p> In addition to the hard economic indicators which underpin the semester process, last year the Commission proposed to add a set of social indicators to give a more rounded picture of what growth we wanted to achieve.  It is not growth at any price but having inclusive growth.  While I know we publish many impenetrable documents, in many of them the concept of fairness is very clearly included.  The Commission is worried about growing inequality which we want member states to address.  It comes back to my point on taxation.  If one does not have a functioning tax collection system, there will always be people who will have to pay and those who will not be able to pay.  That is fundamentally unfair.  If it is because of inefficient systems, it should be tackled.</p><p> The idea of increasing the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank was agreed to a year and a half ago.  The bank&rsquo;s capital was increased by &euro;10 billion which it is reckoned will lead to a roll-out of investment amounting to &euro;180 billion.  There is increased activity on the bank&rsquo;s part.  The Commission has come up with more ideas for stimulating lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, but not all of them have been agreed to by member states.</p><p> Enlargement has been a phenomenal success and an economic success for the member states which have joined recently.  For the older member states, it has been a phenomenal political success to rejoin the Continent.  It is very distressing that people do not feel this but instead feel it is putting pressure on the European Union.  When we come out of the crisis, we will grow into our new size.  I am not sure so many Americans could list their 50 states.  I can never list the seven dwarves and get stuck on the fifth or sixth.  Therefore, I am not sure listing all of the EU member states is the best test of Europeanness.  We need to find some way of feeling proud of what we are achieving.  We all know from meetings in Brussels that it is extremely tedious to sit there while 27 other member states give their position.  It takes two or three hours to go around the table once.  However, it is great we are doing this.  The miracle is that, despite the complexity, we still manage to take important decisions and move on.  There is no other regional grouping in the world that is anywhere near as successful as the European Union.  Sometimes it would be great if we could focus on the positives we are achieving.</p><p> We take seriously the idea of the Commission as a conscience.  That is why the Commission&rsquo;s President, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, will soon produce ideas on the rule of law in the European Union.  We have seen problems in some member states where there is no respect for the European value of the separation of roles, namely, an independent Judiciary without interference from the political sphere.  The Lisbon treaty has a nuclear option - the taking away of the voting rights of a member state that does not respect European values.  That is an unimaginable state at which to arrive, but we need ways to see how the rule of law functions in member states before there is such a scenario.</p><p> As we come out of the crisis, I hope the Commission will go back to its long-term mandate.  What it can do to complement the work of member states is to design long-term frameworks that can take 30 years to deliver.  Tackling our aging society, for example, is part of a long-term target that we could do better together rather than separately.</p><p> Yes, I agree that the timing of the country-specific recommendations, CSRs, is tight.  It might be too tight.  They are published by the Commission at the end of May.</p> <p>Everybody knows what the Commission recommends.  Then the member states in both the Economic and Social Council and the Economic and Finance Council prepare for discussion endorsement by the Heads of State in the June European Council, which is normally at the end of June.  I think that is too tight because it allows us to have only a bilateral process between the Commission and each member state who try to say we should fine-tune the recommendations or we have it all wrong or sometimes, albeit rarely, that we should have insisted more on something.  We want a peer discussion whereby the Commission puts this on the table so all the member states can agree that this or that country should do more or less in a different area, but there is no time for that.  We can improve these matters as time goes on.</p></speech>

We work every public holiday and weekend in May to turn this around so by the end of May we can come out with the country-specific recommendations.  It must be possible to agree with the member states to advance by a few weeks into April or even the end of March so that we could come in mid or early May and have two months for this process rather than one.  It is a question of trying to move national civil services to bring us the data a few weeks earlier.</p></speech>

We will discuss the new recommendations but year by year, as everybody gets more familiar with it, the national parliaments can also discuss the ongoing recommendations, and 90% of it will be valid for the following year.  There should be fewer surprises.  A member state should know that if the European Commission has pinpointed something important that was endorsed by the other member states, and that member state has done nothing about it, it would be no surprise if the Commission comes back the following year.  As people get used to the system we will find ways of dealing with it.  We could also agree collectively to have more time to do a better job.  That would be very important.</p><p>  The Chairman asked about this year's timing.  Because the European elections are in late May, the Commission will not be able to produce the recommendations at the end of May as we normally do.  We have told the member states that this year we will produce them on 4 June, so the period will be even more squeezed.  Maybe it will be so squeezed that it will give us the basis for a debate with the member states on whether we should allow a little more time for the interactive process.</p><p>  On Irish representation in the Commission, we face a problem in the future.  During the Celtic tiger years the Commission salaries were not attractive enough so there is a missing generation of people who in other circumstances would have joined but did not.  There may also have been a tinge of euroscepticism in those days which meant people did not join.  The cohort there is ageing and many of us will retire in the coming years.  The Irish are proportionally over-represented at senior level now but that will evaporate very quickly in a few years because of retirements.  The authorities here are concerned about this and are developing ideas on how to deal with it.  We must also try to encourage people to see it as a fantastically interesting career opportunity and to encourage people to apply.</p><p>  There are many different ways to work in the different institutions and the Commission is very concerned to have the appropriate level of geographic balance.  Not on any one day but over the course of a year or two years we need to have good representation.  We need country-specific knowledge to make informed policy decisions.  Very soon we will not have enough Irish people in the Commission and we need an active policy to do something about it.  From our side, we will be encouraging that and trying to find ways to support Ireland in doing that, as we do with the other under-represented nationalities.</p></speech>

As members are aware, the general scheme of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013 was referred to the joint committee shortly before Christmas for its consideration.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the chief medical officer made a presentation to the committee by way of an introduction to this important Bill.  This is the first of a series of meetings we will be convening in the coming weeks to consider the heads of the Bill.  Today we will be hearing about the potential effects of the legislation on areas such as counterfeiting, smuggling, criminal activity and enforcement.  In this regard, I welcome from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the assistant commissioner, Mr. Derek Byrne, national support service; Detective Chief Superintendent Eugene Corcoran, chief bureau officer, Criminal Assets Bureau; and Detective Chief Superintendent Patrick Kennedy, National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  I welcome from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners Mr. Gerard Moran, assistant secretary, indirect tax division; Ms Emma Clutterbuck, principal officer, excise branch, indirect tax division; and Mr. Michael Gilligan, principal officer, investigations branch.  I welcome from the National Office of Tobacco Control of the Health Service Executive Mr. Gavin Maguire, assistant national director, environmental health and emergency planning; and Ms Laura Garvey, environment officer, National Office of Tobacco Control.  I thank everybody for being present.  This is very important legislation, on which we will be hearing in the coming weeks from a wide cross-section of those involved. </p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I have a submitted a paper to the secretariat and a submission from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which I will supplement with some very brief opening comments.</p><p>  The illegal tobacco industry is a global industry which amasses large amounts of money for organised crime gangs.  We look at it in the context of organised crime.  From our perspective, it has significant health issues, affects the legitimate labour market, returns to the Exchequer in various countries and legitimate brand holders.</p> <p>It requires a global response involving a multi-agency collaborative approach.  I have provided a written submission for the committee, to which I wish to make two amendments, with the Chairman's permission.</p></speech>

It will not come as a surprise if my remarks do not differ significantly from those of the assistant commissioner.  In deciding between a narrow and broad approach to my presentation I have opted for the broader approach in order to be helpful to the committee.</p><p>  Tobacco tax is a key policy instrument in reducing tobacco consumption and a significant source of tax revenue.  Given that illicit tobacco has a significant impact on these objectives, tackling it is a key priority for Revenue.  As we collect &euro;1.4 billion in tobacco tax and VAT from tobacco consumption annually, any material level of illicit tobacco consumption translates into a significant loss of tax revenue.  It is important that developments such as the standardised packaging legislation are scrutinised to assess their impact on the illicit tobacco market.  It might be helpful for the committee if I were to outline briefly the scale and character of the illicit tobacco problem and what we are doing to tackle it before dealing with the impact of the proposed legislation.</p><p>  Every country with high tobacco taxes has an illegal tobacco problem.  Ireland which has exceptionally high tobacco taxes and prices has a significant problem.  To provide some international context, the World Health Organization estimates that 10% of the global cigarette market is illicit and this figure rises to over 50% in some countries.  The European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, estimates that illicit cigarettes result in losses of over &euro;10 billion annually in tax revenues in the European Union.  This is a global problem which is particularly significant in a number of EU member states, including Ireland, which pursue a policy of high tobacco taxes.  In Ireland the best estimate we have of the scale of the problem comes from the IPSOS-MRBI surveys conducted for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office.  The most recent survey, conducted in late 2012, found that 13% of cigarette consumption was illicit.  It also found that a further 6% of consumption was accounted for by cigarettes purchased abroad and brought into Ireland legitimately for personal consumption.  The comparable figure for illicit consumption in 2010 and 2011 was 14%.  While we have not been able to make dramatic inroads into the problem, it has been contained and some modest progress has been made. </p><p>  The nominal cost in terms of lost tax revenues is approximately &euro;240 million annually.  This is a useful way of flagging and tracking the financial significance of the problem, but it is important to stress that this is a nominal cost, based on the unrealistic assumption that in the absence of cheap illicit cigarettes, smokers would consume the same amount of more expensive taxed cigarettes using money they are not currently spending on taxable cigarette consumption.  These caveats aside, the problem is very significant in terms of its impact on the Exchequer and undermining the Government&rsquo;s demand reduction objectives.  The tobacco industry produces much higher estimates of the level of illicit consumption and the associated Exchequer costs, but their claims need to be viewed in terms of their interest in minimising tax increases, while imposing significant price increases of their own.  All estimation methodologies have their limitations, but we are satisfied that the IPSOS-MRBI surveys provide a reasonable indication of the extent of the problem and, in particular, that the consistency of the methodology allows us to track changes in illicit consumption levels. </p><p>  As I noted, this a global problem.  It is driven by a number of key regions in Asia, the Middle East and eastern Europe where there is large-scale production of cigarettes for illicit distribution to other countries or which serve as distribution centres for illicit product.  I have circulated to members a European Commission map which illustrates the main international trafficking routes.  Internationally and domestically, the field is dominated by organised crime groups.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s response to the problem includes a number of key elements.  We work closely with our EU partners to tackle source countries and apply the maximum pressure on the governments concerned.  We also work closely with EU and other member state law enforcement agencies, particularly OLAF, to get the best possible intelligence on illicit shipments into Ireland.  We work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the CAB, the PSNI and Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom in identifying and tackling the illicit trade on an all-island basis.  We examine shipping and passenger traffic on the basis of intelligence and risk profiling.  In terms of detection technologies, we use scanning equipment and sniffer dogs at ports and airports.  We conduct regular street level exercises to tackle illicit cigarette sales.  Our enforcement activities are kept under continuous review by a tobacco executive chaired at commissioner level.</p><p>  In assessing the adequacy of our response we have had a good deal of success in seizing illicit cigarettes intended for sale here or in the United Kingdom.  In 2010 we seized 178 million cigarettes; in 2011 the figure was 109 million; in 2012, 96 million and in 2013, 41 million.  These figures show a marked decline, reflecting a shift in the way illicit cigarettes are trafficked.  It is believed criminal gangs have been moving away from very large consignments in favour of smaller volumes as a result of the number of large seizures being made throughout the European Union, including Ireland.  However, the most important measure for us is the survey data for illicit consumption which indicate containment and some modest progress.  Where possible, we prosecute those involved in smuggling, distributing or selling illicit cigarettes.  In 2013, 100 people were convicted for smuggling or other illicit cigarette offences.  The courts imposed custodial sentences in 38 cases and average fines of over &euro;2,600 in 62 cases.</p><p>  On the impact of the standardised packaging legislation on the illicit cigarette market, we are satisfied that it will not damage our efforts to tackle the problem.  We rely on our tax stamp to identify tax paid tobacco products and the standardised packaging legislation will accommodate the stamp.  We expect the new packaging rules to ensure effective security features to make counterfeiting very difficult.  The tax stamp will certainly contain all of the features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting.  </p><p>  I assure the committee that tackling illicit tobacco is a key priority for Revenue.  We are planning on the basis that Ireland will remain a very high tax country for tobacco products and will be undertaking a fundamental review of our tobacco strategy in the next couple of months.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1019" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Byrne" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300004#F00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to read my statement.  There is no evidence available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to indicate that implementation of plain packaging for all tobacco products sold in Ireland would lead to an increase in the trade in illicit tobacco.</p> <p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na notes that Australia implemented similar provisions in 2013, making it the first country in the world to do so.  However, it is not possible at this stage to ascertain from the Australian experience if there has been any impact on the trade in illicit tobacco because of this legislative change.  It is also relevant to point out that the markets for illicit tobacco in neighbouring countries differ.  Lessons learned from the Australian experience may not necessarily be directly transferable to the Irish context.  It has been asserted by certain interested parties that the move to plain packaging may lead to an increase in the trade in illicit tobacco products in Ireland.  However, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has not been presented with evidence which supports this proposition.  The quality of counterfeit goods which are readily available across international markets is so good that the identification of the authentic product is often difficult for experts in the field.  Those involved in counterfeiting can counterfeit what they need and changes to plain packaging are not going to impact on this.</p><p> The growth in international markets of the sale of illicit whites is also relevant.  This area is increasingly attractive for those involved in both the manufacture and distribution of these products.  Those involved in the manufacture of illicit whites are not in breach of copyright legislation.  This means that they do not run the risk of law enforcement action for counterfeiting offences.  It also reduces the opportunity to bribe public officials.</p><p> Representatives from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and OLAF, the European anti-fraud office, have recently given evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union on this issue.  Both organisations have significant expertise and experience in the illicit trade in tobacco products and stated clearly that there is no evidence to indicate that the introduction of plain packaging will lead to an increase in the illicit trade in tobacco products.</p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is always alert to the possibility that changes in criminal legislation and other regulatory statutes can cause changes in the behaviour of criminal enterprises.  The illicit tobacco environment, post-implementation of the proposed legislation, will be monitored closely by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Where new challenges are identified, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with its national and international partners, will respond appropriately to ensure compliance with legislation.</p><p> Turning to the Garda strategy for tackling smuggling in this regard, the 2014 policing plan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sets out its commitment to proactively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activity, including the illicit trade in tobacco products.  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to the use of intelligence-led operational tactics, including those of specialist national units.  The monitoring of such groups is ongoing and kept under constant review.</p><p> The smuggling of tobacco is primarily a revenue offence and as such is enforced by the Revenue Commissioners - Customs.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to commit to working closely with the Revenue Commissioners and other agencies, both national and international, to proactively target groups and individuals involved in organised crime, including counterfeiting, laundering and smuggling goods.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides support and assistance for the Revenue Commissioners on an ongoing basis.</p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies.  Multidisciplinary approaches are utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise, including those involved in the importation, sale and distribution of illicit tobacco, are effectively targeted, including the use of the proceeds of crimes legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Specifically, the 2014 policing plan outlines the organisation's commitment to improved intelligence gathering and surveillance and analysis capabilities; continuing to build on partnerships to share intelligence with appropriate national bodies and international law enforcement agencies; ensuring proactive policing interventions based on intelligence and analysis; utilising regional multi-agency capabilities to target persons engaged in crime; identifying and targeting organised crime groups; and targeting criminals by maximising the use of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, as amended, and asset recovery opportunities at national and regional level.</p><p> Owing to the transnational nature of counterfeit products, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works with other State and private agencies to monitor new innovations in this type of criminal activity.  This includes liaising with other policing and customs agencies in neighbouring jurisdictions.  Cigarette smuggling has been identified as a low risk high profit enterprise for organised crime groupings within the European Union.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to liaise with other national police forces, Interpol and Europol to keep abreast of developing transnational crime trends.  Ireland, like the rest of the European Union, is dealing with three main types of illicit tobacco: first, genuine tobacco which has been smuggled or diverted owing to discrepancies in price between proximal jurisdictions; second, the smuggling of "cheap whites", non-counterfeit cigarettes that are often produced legitimately and then smuggled, avoiding tax; and, third, counterfeit tobacco which has been manufactured covertly and smuggled into Ireland.</p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na approaches the policing of illicit tobacco at both national and local level.  On national operations, the intellectual property crime unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is responsible for the protection of intellectual property rights and ensuring a structured and co-ordinated approach in tackling the problem of counterfeit products and illicit tobacco.  It liaises on a national basis with investigating garda&iacute; and assist in all aspects of this criminality.  It works closely with other police forces and agencies in the discharge of its functions.  Members of the intellectual property crime unit are trained in the area of international intellectual property crime and actively involved in the provision of this training for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in outside districts.</p><p> Also working at a national level to tackle the trade in illicit tobacco is the Criminal Assets Bureau which is a member of the Cross Border Tobacco Fraud Enforcement Group, CBTFEG.  The group was set up to deal with the issue of cross-border cigarette smuggling.  It was convened arising from a workshop recommendation made at the organised crime cross-border conference in Dundalk in 2009 and is operated under the inter-agency law enforcement cross-border initiative.  Its meetings are attended by representatives from the PSNI, HMRC, SOCA, Revenue - Customs, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The group is chaired by the Revenue Commissioners - Customs.  </p><p> Arising from meetings of the group, a number of organised crime groups involved in the sale and distribution of tobacco products operating in both jurisdictions have been identified and targeted.  Two organised crime gangs involved in the trading of illicit tobacco products have been successfully targeted to date as a result of this initiative.  The Criminal Assets Bureau has been successful in seizing assets and raising revenue assessments against the persons involved in this criminal enterprise.  Matters arising from these meetings are the subject of ongoing investigation at national crime units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A recent intelligence-led operation, against an organised crime gang involved in the importation of illicit cigarettes into Ireland, conducted in conjunction with Europol and other international police agencies, is a great example of success in this area of operations.  Operation Bonanza culminated on 17 September 2013 in the recovery of approximately 10 million contraband cigarettes, cash and a stolen agricultural vehicle.  Four suspects were arrested and a file is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p> Operation Decipher relates to local, regional and district operations enforced by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In conjunction with co-operation at national level and high profile intelligence led initiatives, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to target street level offenders and the distribution networks surrounding these criminal activities.  Operation Decipher, led by the intellectual property crime unit, was established in 2013 to tackle across Garda divisions the sale of illicit tobacco products.  The focus of the operation is directed towards the sale of illicit tobacco products through local markets, fairs, shops and by individuals.</p> <p>A national day of action was held on 12 September 2013 under the auspices of Operation Decipher.  A total of 16 searches were carried out, 13 of which resulted in the seizure of illicit tobacco products.  There is a nominated Garda inspector in each division to co-ordinate activities and liaise with the national point of contact at the intellectual property crime unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The operation is increasing awareness of the illegal trade among operational garda&iacute;.  It is hoped that throughout 2014 there will be an increase in seizures of illicit tobacco products and a resulting increase in prosecutions of offenders.  At a strategic level, building the policing of illicit tobacco sales through divisional policing plans will make this issue an ongoing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1023" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gavin Maguire" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300006#H00300"><p>I thank members of the joint committee for the invitation and the opportunity to address them today.  We sent in a submission last week, as well as a short opening statement through which I now will bring members.  The HSE strongly supports this Bill as another important step in the de-normalisation of tobacco smoking in Ireland.  One in every two smokers dies of smoking-related illnesses in Ireland.  These illnesses and deaths are preventable.  Improving health and well-being is one of four pillars of reform outlined in Future Health, the government's health reform programme for the Health Service Executive, HSE.  The programme involves a shift in policy and practice away from simply treating sick people to keeping people healthy and well.  The HSE's actions in respect of tobacco control include tobacco-free campuses, targeted health promotion campaigns, the HSE QUIT campaign, brief intervention training, research and enforcement of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts and tobacco control legislation.</p><p>  The elimination of one form of advertising by tobacco companies - the use of attractive, glossy and sometimes cosmetic-like packaging designed to appeal to young people - is a hugely important step.  The tobacco industry has invested heavily in pack design to communicate to this specific group.  The evidence strongly suggests that standardised packaging will reduce the appeal of packaging and of smoking in general.  Research further suggests that standardised packaging will go some way towards reducing consumer misperceptions regarding product harm, particularly the perception that one brand of tobacco is less harmful than another, and will help to make the legally required health warnings more visible.  Tobacco companies have introduced extensive cigarette pack innovations in recent years.  The introductions of these new types of package have posed serious challenges to the enforcement of current tobacco control legislation for the HSE.  The clear stipulation of the pack features in this Bill will make enforcement much easier.  The restrictions on the wrappers of tobacco products such as cigarettes and roll-your-owns will remove the current trend of highlighting lower pack price across the top of the product, suggesting to the customer that they are selling them at a reduced price and thus acting as a sales promotion device.</p><p>  We welcome the inclusion in the Bill of the provision whereby the offence is committed by the manufacturer and the distributor, as well as the retailer.  In many incidences, the supplier stocks the machine in the shop or wherever and the retailer may not look at the product packaging until it is requested by the customer.  Therefore the onus must be on the retailer, the manufacturer and the supplier to ensure the product complies with the legislation.  Fines and penalties must be sufficient to deter the tobacco companies from non-compliance with the law and we therefore welcome the levels of fines and penalties envisaged in the Bill.  We also welcome the fact that, upon conviction, the court shall order the person to pay the costs and expenses associated with the inspections and the institution of legal proceedings.</p><p>  Roll-your-own tobacco products are a growing segment of the industry.  The increase in the pouch size to 20g per unit pack is important in the restriction of access to tobacco products by young persons and lower socioeconomic groups.  We suggest that an additional requirement for consideration should be standardisation of the pack size.  This would make packaging for slims or smaller packs less attractive to the customer.  Restrictions on the size of tobacco packaging are currently not captured under this Bill, although they are included in the Australian legislation.  It would also prevent tobacco companies from making tobacco packs smaller, thus reducing the size of the required health warning, or indeed larger with the aim of increasing the size of the brand name or business or company name that appears on the pack.  We also suggest that improved powers of enforcement for the environmental health services within the HSE may be necessary for seizing, removing and detaining non-confined products, as well as payment by the offender for destruction.</p></speech>

Incidentally, I should relay the apologies of Deputy Kelleher, who is speaking on the Order of Business.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in sends his apologies, as do Senator Henry and Deputy Catherine Byrne.  Senator MacSharry also was obliged to attend the Order of Business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1025" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300006#H00500"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Their presentations have been highly informative and, as this is a thorough way of formulating legislation, it is of great importance to members.  I apologise again on behalf of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who unfortunately is unable to attend today.  The witnesses might bear with me as I come to the questions, which I will be asking on both his and my own behalf.  As outlined in previous meetings, Sinn F&eacute;in is supportive of the planned legislation.  My colleague at European Parliament level, Martina Anderson, has done similar work in respect of the tobacco directive.  All members are clear as to the impact on health of tobacco and barely a family in the country has not suffered because of its horrific consequences.  Moreover, there is a definite correlation with regard to socioeconomic groups in that the poorer one is, the more likely one is to have one's life destroyed by these consequences.  As for any measures that can be taken to make it less appealing, there obviously must be ongoing monitoring to ascertain how effective they are in the future.</p><p>  I have a number of questions.  I note Mr. Byrne stated there is no evidence available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would indicate that the implementation of plain packaging for all tobacco products sold in Ireland would lead to an increase in the trade in illicit tobacco.  However, I have to hand a report from KPMG that appears to contradict these remarks.  To run through a couple of points, it states that there has been no reduction in tobacco consumption; that there has been a decrease of 40% in consumption of non-branded tobacco, with increases in consumption of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes of 162% and 71%, respectively; that the illicit market has seen an increase of 13%, while illicit cigarettes have increased by 154%.  As this appears to contradict Mr. Byrne's observations here, he may wish to comment on that report or whether he has an idea of who paid for it.  I also note the comments by Mr. Byrne on whites and that those involved in the manufacture of illicit whites are not in breach of copyright legislation.  Does this mean that in terms of plain packaging, the Garda will have fewer powers to secure prosecutions?  Does it mean that certain copyright laws that now apply will no longer do so if this legislation is introduced?  In respect of Garda recruitment, will some of the newly recruited staff work in the area of tobacco control - for example, in the intellectual property crime unit?  On the individual policing of illicit tobacco sales through divisional policing plans, which play an important and practical role, will this project be prioritised and resourced adequately?  Can the Garda indicate whether, on a global basis, the tobacco industry has been implicated in illegal tobacco trading?  Will plain packaging reduce illegal trading in tobacco products and what percentage of illegally traded tobacco products are actually detected by the Garda?  While these are my questions to the Garda, I have a few more for the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  In 2010, 178 million cigarettes were seized, while in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the figures were 109 million, 96 million and 41 million, respectively, yet the consumption of illegal tobacco has remained fairly stagnant.  Does this reflect a failure on the part of Revenue in which the criminals all are one step ahead and now are able to bypass its detection methods?  How is Revenue addressing this negative trend?  How are seized cigarettes disposed of?  How does Revenue get them out of circulation?  I would like to hear the Revenue Commissioners state they fully support the Government's demand reduction objectives because I am conscious that were the measure to be 100% successful it would cost Revenue &euro;1.4 billion.  I seek confirmation that everyone is on the same page in this regard.  How much does tobacco-related illness cost the public Exchequer each year, and has this sum increased or decreased over the years?  How much does the sale of tobacco products raise in taxes for the State and has this increased or decreased over the years?  Members are aware of the loss of &euro;240 million from tax revenue; how does this compare with other trades, such as music, food and clothing?  What is the impact of the European Union's tobacco products directive?  Is an all-Ireland approach needed in this regard and should members be encouraging the Northern Ireland Assembly Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Edwin Poots, to adopt similar legislation?</p> <p> One in every two smokers dies of a smoking-related illness in Ireland.  Will the witnesses remind the committee of the approximate cost of that to our health services?</p><p> On the level of fines, what is the proposed method of increasing the fines?  Is it by further legislative amendments?</p><p> I ask Mr. Maguire to expand on the last two points made, namely, potential improvements regarding the standardisation of the pack size and increased powers of enforcement.  Does he have specific ideas or recommendations in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1027" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300007#J00200"><p>I thank the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the HSE representatives for their presentations.  The message I will take from the presentation by the Garda representatives is that the Garda, the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, and many others believe there is no evidence to indicate that the introduction of plain packaging will lead to an increase in the illicit trade of tobacco products.  That is the clear message that must go from these hearings.</p><p>  In looking at illicit trade while researching and preparing to deal with this issue, I was startled to see that in 2002, evidence was given before the United Kingdom Public Accounts Committee by ASH UK which clearly showed that exports of tobacco to Andorra, for example, increased from 13 million in 1993 to 1,520 million in 1997.  Every Andorran man, woman and child would have to smoke 130 cigarettes a day to make up that amount.  That is a real example of the way this illicit trade is taking place.  There is an over-supply by tobacco companies to certain countries.  Last October, the Right Honourable Margaret Hodge appeared before the UK Public Accounts Committee and stated that the supply of some brands of hand-rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240%.  The evidence is there for us to see.</p><p>  Before asking specific questions I note what the HSE representative said about the size of the packets, which we will take into consideration in our deliberations.  My questions are for the Revenue Commissioners, and if other witnesses wish to respond I would be happy to hear their comments.  With regard to the Revenue Commissioners, has there been a decrease in resources to tackling smuggling?  We all know that there have been cuts in some areas in the recession.  If so, what has been cut?  How much does Ireland spend each year on tackling smuggling?  I was surprised when I saw the number of prosecutions.  With regard to tracking and tracing, which is one of the key provisions of the World Health Organization illicit trade protocol, which Ireland has signed up to, what is the readiness of the Revenue Commissioners in that regard?</p><p>  I refer to Codentify, a system developed by a major tobacco company, Philip Morris.  The company says it is a unique, secure 12-digit code printed onto the side of packages, but Philip Morris is donating money to organisations and agencies such as Interpol to promote and develop Codentify.  I am aware that organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society see that as a major conflict of interest.  What is the Revenue Commissioners' view on Codentify?  Does a system developed by the tobacco industry not raise concerns about compromise and reliability?</p><p>  I have a question on forestalling, which is a tax avoidance measure identified in the UK.  It is a practice whereby excessive quantities of cigarettes are removed for home use on payment of duty because an increase in the rate of duty is expected.  Is there any evidence of forestalling in Ireland?  Finally, has the tobacco industry been involved at any point in training or advising the Revenue staff on illicit trade?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1028" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300007#J00300"><p>I welcome my Garda colleagues.  I am sorry if I am being inappropriate but I would like to express my sympathy to them as it is close to the anniversary of the loss of one of their colleagues in the line of duty last year.  I know it is in everybody's mind today.</p><p>  The situation with respect to tobacco is unprecedented.  If this product had been discovered during the 20th century it would never be legal.  It is the ultimate example of something that was "grandfathered" into cultural acceptability.  If tobacco was a component of refrigerator doors, we would not allow it to be legal now in the manufacturer of refrigerators.  If it was a component of the paint used in cars, it would not be allowed - it is that carcinogenic - yet we allow people take it into their bodies.  Every fibre of every organisation associated with the public good must realise that those who make it, distribute it and sell it - sometimes good people, sometimes misguided - are involved in something which is evil and must be stopped.  We must also understand that a totally legal cigarette is just as likely to give one cancer as an illegally smuggled cigarette.  There is no moral distinction in terms of what we are doing here.</p><p>  People talk about precedents in tobacco control for other areas such as sugar and cholesterol.  There are no precedents.  If some misguided philanthropist sent containers of Big Macs to refugee camps in Africa where children were starving, the Big Macs would keep them alive.  There is nutrition in the most unhealthy of foods.  What causes the problem with unhealthy foods in general is having too much of it.  Tobacco is in a case of its own.  It brings no health benefits.  It is an addictive, toxic, cancer-causing substance which has been allowed into our culture.</p><p>  Spurious arguments are advanced against increasingly draconian measures such as the excellent measures the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is suggesting, and some of the other excellent measures Senators Daly, van Turnhout and I suggested, which for some reason have either been rejected or become terminally glued in the treacle-like bureaucracy of the health administration.  However, these are good moves.  The arguments often advanced against them is that they will decrease revenue and increase smuggling.  The decrease in revenue argument is entirely spurious.  If God appeared tomorrow on O'Connell Street and made everybody stop smoking, the Revenue Commissioners would be discombobulated for about a year but they would get used to it.  The decrease in spending on health services would take a few years to kick in, but it would kick in and it would be a saving.  The crazy argument is advanced that some of this money would disappear.  People who had money in their pockets that they were not spending on cigarettes would spend it on their families, their children, heat, education, better food and a number of socially advantageous things.  If the entire trade disappeared tomorrow, we would be better off the day after tomorrow.  It is that simple.</p><p>  In terms of the questions that must be asked, I echo those of my colleague, Senator van Turnhout.  I will stick my neck out - this is the wonderful thing about Seanad privilege - and say that on a global scale the tobacco companies like smuggling.  They encourage it, foster it and make sure it happens because it is in their interest.  Smuggling is great for them.  Most of the product smuggled is their product.  Ultimately, it is bought at their distribution or wholesale price from them.  The people who lose out are the Revenue Commissioners and perhaps the shopkeepers in border areas between jurisdictions.  The companies do not lose, and therefore I am sceptical when I hear that the companies want to lobby our Government on their concerns about smuggling.  Smuggling does something else for the companies.  It provides cheap, addictive product to impressionable children.  It is easier to get people addicted to something that is cheap than to get them addicted to something that is expensive.  All of these arguments trickle away.</p><p>  With no disrespect to the representatives, when considering the health impacts of plain packaging and increasingly draconian measures, we should not even think about smuggling.  It is great that the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and the National Office of Tobacco Control do a good job interdicting it, but this unintended collateral consequence should not be what drives our public policy.  It must be remembered - Senator van Turnhout alluded to this - that the arithmetic is overwhelming in that it suggests there is something extremely fishy about export patterns of tobacco to small countries from whence it mysteriously appears in other larger jurisdictions.</p><p>  My father sold tobacco products in his little mom-and-pop shop in Brooklyn, New York, after he emigrated from Leitrim - his shop was called Jack's Cigar Store - so I understand the cultural influences that lead people into this line of trade.</p> <p>Everybody who sells these products from the local shop to the wholesaler to the importer to the shipper to the manufacturer is dealing in death and buying into a business which must recruit 50 children per day to make up for the people who die.  Those here should remember the business plan of the tobacco industry; it comprises four words - they should write them down as the plan is easy to remember - "addict children to carcinogens".  If the industry does not do that, it will be out of business.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about plain packaging and counterfeiting and direct this to whomever feels it is most appropriate to answer on that.  Two statements were read out.  The Assistant Commissioner said that the quality of counterfeit goods, which are already readily available across international markets is so good that the identification of the authentic product is often difficult for experts in the field.  The following is the sentence I want him to address, namely, &quot;Those involved in counterfeiting can counterfeit what they need&quot;.  Mr. Moran from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners said that he was very confident that we could deal with this and that the tax stamp will certainly contain all the features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting.  Has he faith in that process?  What we are hearing and what we have read in a submission we received from shop owners and retail outlets is that plain packaging will serve to make the process of counterfeiting substantially easier and cheaper while providing a stimulus to the black market.  I would like Mr. Moran to comment on that.<br />I wish to cite what an unnamed senior customs official was reported as saying in the media.  He said:<blockquote>The Minister might be well-meaning, but he is playing right into the hands of the Real IRA and their criminal cronies.  They won't have to copy hundreds of different packs any more - because they'll all look the same.  </blockquote>Does Mr. Moran share any of those concerns?  Will the Garda and the Revenue need more resources if plain packaging is introduced?  If that serves to make the process of counterfeiting easier, do the witnesses believe those resources will be available to them?<br />Plain packaging has been introduced in Australia.  Has Mr. Gerry Maguire engaged with our Australian colleagues since the introduction of standardised packaging and can he report on the trends in Australia during the past 12 months?  It has been stated by the HSE and, I believe, by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, that the long-term goal is to reduce smoking prevalence to 5% by 2025.  Has he got medium-term targets set between now and 2025?  With all the health education and everything that is being done by the HSE, Revenue, the Garda, Deputies, educationalists, the Irish Heart Foundation and all the various groups, why has the prevalence of smoking not decreased?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1032" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300008#K00400"><p>Many of the questions I intended to ask have been asked and I will not reiterate them.  I congratulate the Garda on its success in the seizure under Operation Bonanza where 10 million cigarettes and cash were captured.  Are there black spots in the country where such activity is more prevalent?  I also have been contacted by a number of retailers who are concerned that the plain packaging will make counterfeiting easier, as outlined by my colleague Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  In fairness, the people I met understand the damage cigarettes can cause.  I got the impression from them that such activity was worse in some parts of the country than in others.  Has the Assistant Commissioner information on that and what is being done to tackle those black spots to ensure that such counterfeiting can be curtailed?  It is also a question for Revenue officials in terms of what it is doing to tackle this activity outside the greater urban areas.  What level of resources are deployed to areas around ports and cities in close proximity to ports such as Waterford and Wexford to ensure they can capture any elicit trade that is taking place?<br />In terms of the HSE's programmes, I would agree with Mr. Maguire's point about standardised packaging because it is more difficult for slims and such products, by virtue of the nature of their packaging, to carry the health messages in bold print.  That is a valid point and something we should take on board.<br />Following on from Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's point, why is smoking still so prevalent?  It is particularly prevalent among young girls and is often prevalent among lower socio-economic groups in communities.  What more can we do to tackle this problem?  What types resources will the HSE allocate, particularly in light of what Senator Crown said, namely, that we know that the tobacco industry's <i>modus operandi</i>is to try to engage young children to take up smoking?  What is the HSE doing to address that?  I know of the cessation programmes and smoke-free campuses but that relates to adults.  What is being done preventatively to ensure that young people do not taking up smoking?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1033" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300008#K00500"><p>I welcome Mr. Derek Byrne, assistant Garda commissioner, Mr. Gerard Moran, assistant secretary in the Office of the Revenue Commission, Mr. Gavin Maguire, assistant national director of the National Tobacco Control Office and their staff.  Most of the questions I intended to ask have already been asked but I would ask the following ones.  Does increasing the price of tobacco products increase the level of smuggling?  The Government has increased prices as have the tobacco companies.  Will plain packaging, which will carry health warnings and other labels currently on the packets, increase illicit trade?</p><p>  It was stated that it is estimated that &euro;240 million is lost in tobacco tax in the illicit trade in Ireland, which is broken into three categories: contraband - a genuine tobacco packet imported without paying tax and duty; a counterfeit product that appears genuine but is a fake; and illicit whites, which are cigarette products only for the black market.  </p><p>  In terms of standardising packages of tobacco, the aim is to reduce the appeal of tobacco and tobacco products, increase the effectiveness of the health warning on tobacco products, reduce the ability of the packaging of tobacco and tobacco products to mislead customers about the harmful effect of smoking in the public interest by providing for the standardisation of the labelling and physical features of the retail packaging of tobacco products and the requirement for the appearance of the cigarettes.  </p><p>  I want to outline a few statistics.  Scientists have indicated there are approximately 4,000 different chemicals in cigarette tobacco and more than 70 of these cause cancer.  Each year at least 5,200 people die in Ireland from tobacco-related disease.  This represents almost one in five of all deaths.  According to the Department of Health, 90% of lung cancers are caused by smoking and it has stated that it costs approximately &euro;1 billion per year to provide health services for smokers.  Smokers lose an average of between ten to 15 years from their life expectancy by smoking.  The average cost of admission to treat a smoker in an inpatient setting for tobacco-related illness is &euro;7,700 in Ireland.  It is estimated that the workplace smoking ban introduced in 2004 has led to more than 3,500 deaths being avoided as a result of tobacco consumption.  I also realise that the tobacco sector in Ireland accounts for approximately 5,500 jobs and is a major driver of the tax revenue, generating approximately &euro;1.4 billion per year.</p></speech>

One in ever two smokers dies of a smoking-related illness.</p> <p>It is shocking.  We are dealing with an industry of death and for it to continue, it is necessary for it every hour of every day to get additional young people addicted to tobacco.  I support the legislation promoted by the Minister and supported the targeting of young people to help prevent more of them becoming addicted to tobacco and reduce consumption overall.</p><p> I need confirmation from all agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE, that the introduction of plain packaging will not damage the campaign against the illicit tobacco trade.  I also ask them to comment on the idea that the use of plain packaging will make enforcement easier.  I believe it will not damage the campaign against the illicit tobacco trade and that it will make enforcement easier, but I would like the agencies present to respond to these questions.  Can any or all of them comment on the involvement of tobacco companies in the illicit trade?  There is a suggestion many countries are being oversupplied by the tobacco companies for re-export to other areas on an illicit basis.  I seek clarification of the reduction in the number of cigarettes seized from 178 million in 2010 to 41 million in 2013.  </p><p> I refer to the current penalties and those provided for in the Bill.  Are the agencies satisfied that the penalties provided for are adequate and sufficient to deal with the problem?  </p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na referred to street level offenders, sales at fairs and car boot sales.  There is a perception that there is little or no action being taken at this level.  I am not sure the perception is the reality, but there is that perception and I would like a comment on it.</p></speech>

I refer to the drop in the number of cigarettes seized, from 178 million to 41 million.  Does this mean that there is an ongoing trade but at a smaller scale such that the 41 million cigarettes seized is a small figure in real terms?  Perhaps the smaller number makes the problem more difficult to identify.  Are these figures an accurate reflection?</p><p>  I speak to people working in medical services who deal with medical clinics on a daily basis.  One person told me about someone who was smoking 300 cigarettes a week and said there was no way, on the income that person received, that they could buy cigarettes in shops.  I have heard this from a number of medical personnel.  Despite medical advice, people continue to smoke heavily and it is clear based on their incomes that they cannot afford to buy cigarettes in shops.  Medical service professionals have not seen a drop in the level of consumption by the people with whom they are dealing.</p><p>  With the growth in international communities in Ireland in the past 20 years, it is that much easier to keep an eye on Irish people involved in illegal activity.  What strategies have the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners taken on board to deal with people from international communities given that they do not have the same inside line that they have with Irish people?  What change in strategy needs to be adopted to deal with this issue?  I recently raised the issue of recruitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Do we need to examine the recruitment of people from outside the European Union who are living in Ireland and now Irish citizens?  They have inside knowledge of international communities.  What strategy has been adopted in dealing with this issue?</p></speech>

We campaigned very strongly for people to stop or not to start smoking.  Are we doing enough to deal with the addictive nature of cigarettes and on how to help people to kick the habit?  Alcoholics Anonymous deals with the problem of alcohol addiction, but I question whether the HSE is doing enough to help people to deal with their addiction.  There is a sense that we are abandoning people who are severely addicted because nothing can be done.  </p><p>  As I must be elsewhere at 11.30 a.m., I will read the answers later.</p></speech>

From where we sit, this is a demand-led industry.  In my opening comments I mentioned that our response was intelligence-led to tackle the criminality end of the problem.  We have challenges, like our colleagues in the Customs service and the Revenue Commissioners, in trying to deal with it.</p><p>  I was asked how strategies had changed.  We have intercepted containers.  There is a relatively small outlay for quite a high profit margin and some have taken high risks and lost a lot of money.  Separately, we have individuals arriving at air and sea ports throughout the State with suitcases full of cigarettes.  Our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners have had considerable success in dealing with that part of the problem.</p><p>  Senator Martin Conway asked me about markets.  There are little markets all over the country.  We have worked with private investigation companies and Operation Decipher has led to considerable success, with 16 raids in one day and 13 successful seizures around the country at various markets and fairs.</p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked me about the Garda recruitment campaign.  It is a function of all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the legislation.</p> <p>We think the current legislation is relatively robust.</p><p> Deputy Healy asked whether the new sanctions will prove beneficial.  We see them as being in the serious crime category.  At this stage it appears that the legislation will be quite sufficient for us to deal with the crime as an indictable offence.  That also makes it an arrestable offence for us.  The indications in the proposed legislation are that it is being treated as a serious crime, which is a welcome development.  </p><p> Other issues were raised, including counterfeiting.  Copyright is not a major prohibition for us.  We have several other pieces of legislation to deal with casual trading or trademarks.  We have sufficient legislation to deal with the matter.  We will be strengthened by the proposed new legislation and the penalties that will be imposed.  Earlier I said that we do not know the extent of the problem after the implementation of the legislation.  However, we will watch the matter very closely.  We must wait and see how enterprising criminal elements adapt to the legislation.  It is at that stage that we will be able to give some greater indications of what the situation is likely to look like in terms of what must be done by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue and Customs and Excise.</p><p> We are very closely aligned with Interpol and Europol for some of the international operations and attend various meetings.  We have hosted two conferences on intellectual property crime in Ireland, late last year and four years earlier, and 650 delegates attended from over 50 countries.  This illicit trade was very high on the agenda and is very high on our agenda.  We are very much linked with Interpol and Europol in terms of enforcement methodologies.  Profiling and tracing takes place across jurisdictions to see if we can intercept illegal tobacco products entering the jurisdiction.  Of course if we gather information there is a process whereby we will act on it immediately to detect activity, prevent the loss of Exchequer funding within the jurisdiction and prosecute the offenders.</p><p> Several other issues have been mentioned.  I am not sure if I have missed any but I am more than happy to address them if I have not done so already.  I am accompanied by the chief bureau officer from the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Detective Chief Superintendent from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  We are more than anxious to answer any further questions if I have not touched on some of the issues raised. </p></speech>

I shall address some of the issues from that perspective.  It is difficult to view the illicit tobacco trade in isolation when dealing with organised crime because it presents a considerable opportunity to earn large profits by those engaged in this type of criminal activity, whether they are organised criminals or connected to dissident groups.</p><p>  With regards the specific issue of plain packaging and its likely impact on people involved in the trade, it is quite difficult for us to address the matter because we have had little or no international experience of doing so, apart from in Australia.  The current packaging presents little or no difficulty for illicit traders to carry on trading.  Whether plain packaging presents an easier route for them to disguise the packaging is a moot point.  They are largely indifferent to packaging in terms of the trade that they engage in and that is all I can say for the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1046" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Moran" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300010#M00600"><p>I have written down most of the questions and hope that I can read my scrawly writing.  I shall try to respond satisfactorily to as many of the questions as possible.</p><p>  One of the first questions came from Deputy McLellan and related to the drop in numbers that I quoted.  It is important to bear in mind that figures for any particular year - particularly going back a few years - are easily distorted by the seizure of a small number of huge consignments.  That is why I must stress that the far more important measure for us is the survey results on the incidence of illicit consumption.  We need to highlight that fact even though the organisation has tended to highlight the seizures because everybody likes to talk about their successes.  The important measure is the survey data on the incidence.</p><p>  In my statement I said we believed that the reduction in the volumes - particularly in the most recent year - are associated with an evolution in the way organised crime groups are operating and, in particular, supplying the Irish market.  Before now, some stuff might have been routed through Ireland for the UK market.  Some of the seizures that we made in the past few years were so large that they could not have been destined for the Irish market.  Now, instead of being used as a route to other markets, the Irish market may well be served in smaller quantities from the continent or the UK.  The business of traffickers is constantly evolving and reflects their experience of the way enforcement authorities get on top of a certain situation and respond.  Traffickers keep changing their tactics.  I hope I have explained what the numbers mean and how we interpret the data.  </p><p>  A question was asked about how we dispose of seized cigarettes.  I can confirm that they are incinerated.</p><p>  We were asked whether we supported the Government's demand reduction policy.  The question was asked as though there were an assumption on the part of some people that the Revenue Commissioners are revenue maximisers.  We are not.  We simply implement the law and follow Government policy.  The job of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect whatever tax is payable and deal with whatever evasion and fraud is associated with tax.  </p><p>  An interesting question was asked about the notional loss of &euro;240 million.  I want to stress the term "notional loss" and how it compared with the tax gap or loss in other sectors.  Tobacco is probably unique in being the only area that we tend to quote a loss for because it flags for Revenue internally and for the wider public the significance of the problem.  We have good solid survey data that allows us to do this work.  Generally we do not do tax gap analysis because it is fraught with enormous difficulty.  Some tax administrations do so but they always heavily qualify the work by saying that it is usually to be relied on more as an indicator of trends than as an estimation of the quantum.  That latter bit always tends to be forgotten.  </p><p>   A question was asked about whether we needed an all-Ireland or all-island approach.  We have already adopted such an approach, and the assistant commissioner gave details.  All of the law enforcement agencies North and South meet on a quarterly basis to ensure good co-ordination and sharing of intelligence and information.  My information is that the scheme works effectively, and the assistant commissioner mentioned some of the results that have flowed from its work.</p><p>  A question was asked about the need for supply chain controls and their desirability.  That is a key issue.  Revenue is really interested in supply chain controls and a track and trace regime that will operate in the global black spots located in the source and transit countries.  There is probably not a lot to be gained from a very high-tax country like Ireland investing heavily in a domestic track and trace system if the source and transit countries are not brought on board.  A big job of work needs to be done at EU level or through whatever forum.  We must seize an opportunity to pursue what we view as problem countries at the G20 or G8 forum in order to put pressure on them.</p> <p>It is clear from the European Commission's communication on the issue that it speaks about enhanced co-operation with source and transit countries.  Members of the committee can decode this for themselves.</p><p> There was a question on whether there had been a drop in the level of resources.  Revenue has had a significant drop in the level of resources, probably from about 6,700 to 5,800 or 5,700 - I do not have the exact number.  In achieving that reduction in recent years we have maintained the number of staff involved in compliance work.  That includes the staff available to work on illegal tobacco issues, smuggling and street level activity, with which we have to contend.  We have preserved these numbers in the face of a big aggregate reduction and are committed to doing this so far as we possibly can do so.  </p><p> There was a question about the readiness of Revenue to take on track and trace functions.  The policy and shape of the administrative arrangements or regime are settled on for the European Union, but they need to go a little further.  From Revenue's perspective, our interest is in the supply chain in source and transit countries rather than in high tax countries.  If somebody starts to try to source cigarettes in Ireland to sell them in eastern Europe, he or she will go out of business quickly, unless they are diverted, as we police the area very tightly.</p><p> I hope I am not taking too long to respond.  If so, the Chairman may interrupt me.</p></speech>

Public policy on this issue needs to be settled by the various public bodies and Departments concerned.  We are not particularly interested, therefore, in engaging with tobacco interests on it.  There was a question on whether we had been talking to them.  I am aware that they have made offers to us, but we are not inclined to nibble.</p><p>  A key question, repeated by a number of Deputies and Senators, was related to the suggestion there was an increased risk that counterfeiting would be much easier with standardised packaging.  To repeat what I said in my opening statement, we rely on the tax stamp.   If they can counterfeit the packages already available, they can counterfeit the others.  We do not see a dramatic change in the landscape.  What is of primary importance for us is that we have a state-of-the-art tax stamp that is highly resistant to counterfeiting and that the technology include secret features that our scanning devices can identify.  That is what we rely on, not whether it is counterfeit.  In the future we will also rely on the tax stamp.</p><p>  I think it was Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor who quoted an anonymous Customs and Excise source who said this was playing into the hands of criminals.  I do not agree; this follows from the remarks I have just made.  </p><p>  There was a further question about resources.  I think I have dealt with that issue.  We have sought to maintain the level of resources.  I hope I stressed sufficiently in my opening statement that tacking this problem is a serious priority for Revenue.  There are two dimensions to it - lost tax revenue which is very significant and the fact that it undermines public policy on smoking in that it results in making product more freely available at a time when pricing is a key instrument in trying to reduce demand.</p><p>  I thought I was nearly finished, but I still have two pages left.  I will go through them quickly.  </p><p>  There was a question on whether there were black spots.  The answer is not particularly; that is our take on it.  It is a problem across the country.  It may be more intense in some places rather than in others, but it is widespread across the country.  There might be a socio-economic dimension to the precise availability or degree of saturation in some places compared to others.</p><p>  There was a question about the spread of resources, whether we were concentrating on the main ports and ignoring the rest of the country.  That is definitely not the case.  Our compliance staff and enforcement teams that undertake this work are distributed on a regional basis.  They are deployed at small ports and airports on a risk assessed basis.  All interventions and examinations we conduct are in the first instance on the basis of intelligence or risk profiling.  Whenever we have information that suggests some activity is warranted at a particular location, we will do it.  We also undertake regular campaigns at street level, some of which are localised and others on a national basis, to target visible activity.</p><p>  There was a further interesting question from Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick on whether increased prices resulted in increased smuggling.  Certainly, they increase the incentives.  It means that there is a bigger margin for the traffickers.  They can pitch at a price that is well south of the price of legitimate cigarettes and still have a huge margin to make super-normal profits.  Undoubtedly, the bigger the price differential, the greater the incentive.  It needs to be borne in mind that the price of legitimate cigarettes in some eastern European countries is probably about &euro;2.20 per packet, whereas here the price is &euro;9.50 or &euro;9.60.  One can find cheaper cigarettes and the cheapest one will find will be close to &euro;8.  The idea would be for prices in these countries to migrate in a northerly direction, but all of these countries tend to face problems with their neighbouring non-EU countries which have even cheaper priced cigarettes.  It is, therefore, a difficult problem.</p><p>  There was a question about plain packaging and the illicit trade and a further question about the figure of &euro;240 million.  I answered that question.  I am picking up on it again, but it gives me another opportunity to stress that it is a nominal figure.  It is useful to flag it, but it is a nominal figure based on unrealistic assumptions.  Senator John Crown also covered the issue.  People who have money would spend it on something else if they were not spending it on this product.</p><p>  We were invited to comment on the involvement of tobacco companies in the illicit trade.  A number of years ago there was a massive oversupply by the main tobacco companies in places such as Andorra, but the activities of these companies have been brought under control by co-operation agreements that penalise them if their cigarettes are found available illicitly in countries other than those for which they are produced or distributed.</p> <p>If anyone wants me to come back in on a particular question, I can do that.</p></speech>

A number of international studies dispute the study she quoted in terms of the correlation, although undoubtedly there is a correlation.  Most international experts would say that the price of cigarettes is a very important element in regard to discouraging tobacco use.  Many international reports say there is some correlation between price and illegal trade, but it is still worth increasing price.</p><p>  On the specific health issues, the Deputy said the one in every two smokers dying from tobacco-related illness was a shocking figure.  It is incredibly shocking.  On the cost of tobacco related illness to the HSE, a 2009 European study estimated the cost at over &euro;600 million.  However, it is not just an issue of cost, but of the destruction of lives.  The Deputy asked a question about increased fines being included in the Bill.  The HSE does not have a role in that, but we would encourage the Minister to ensure the fines are at the upper end of the scale.  We are involved in enforcement of current legislation on tobacco and we frequently feel that the levels of fines imposed do not act as a sufficient deterrent.  Therefore, we would call for them to be increased, particularly in the case of this Bill because we are referring to tobacco companies with very deep pockets.</p><p>  I will defer now to my colleague, Laura Garvey, on the next question concerning the two recommendations made in our opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-23a.1054" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Garvey" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014012300012#O00500"><p>In regard to the size of cigarette packages, as we know the tobacco industry has invested hugely in package design and in trying to encourage new and young smokers to take up the habit.  They have invested heavily in pack innovation.  We talk about perfume or cosmetic type packages which are very small and contain the slim cigarettes.  When these packages came out on the market originally, they resembled a tobacco product but were thinner.  On the face of it, they looked the same as a tobacco product, but then innovation changed them and they are now a very small packet which can be quickly put into a handbag and are obviously geared at the female market.  In our research, we looked at the situation in other countries.  Australian legislation has restricted the size of a cigarette packet and there is a minimum and maximum length, depth and height.  When considering regulations, we should look at the physical features of a cigarette packet so we can introduce similar restrictions.</p><p>  The tobacco industry has moved forward significantly with the roll-your-own products.  This product is now in a large box, which includes the pouch, tobacco, the cigarette papers and the cigarette rolling machine or the filters and the tubes.  These large boxes currently have significant branding, colour and advertising and the product name is in large print.  This legislation should help move away from this final form of advertising.  Now that we have moved away from point of sale advertising and from gantry advertising, this final form remains, but hopefully it will be abolished by this Bill and we can move away from branding of tobacco products.  Normalising the size of the tobacco package is also very important.</p><p>  The other recommendation we made concerns the powers within the Bill.  The heads of the Bill describe the powers in section 48 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act and suggest that the new Bill will permit us to seize products for examination.  The new legislation should ensure we can seize, remove, detain and, if necessary, destroy tobacco products.  Currently there is a two-pronged approach.  If products come into a port and are seized by Revenue, and the duty is paid on them, but they are seen as illegal imports from the point of view of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act, such as niche products or snuff or illegal products such as oral tobacco products, this would be under the remit of the HSE and we would work closely with the Revenue on this.  However, stronger powers are needed in this regard.  We also need stronger powers to deal with retail shops selling tobacco products that are illegal under the Act, for example, where warnings are not sufficient.  </p></speech>

We are part of various networks involved in this.  Initial research coming from Australia is very encouraging.  Australia has seen a decline of approximately 15% in the number of what is described as table displays of cigarettes.  This is mostly due to a 23% decline in the percentage of patrons who smoke.  What is even more striking is that Australia has noticed that calls to its quit lines soared by 78% for a period shortly after the introduction of the new packaging.  Obviously, there is an important relationship between people who make that first contact to a quit line and those who are ultimately successful in quitting tobacco.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the Department of Health's tobacco free policy document, Tobacco Free Ireland.  I was a member of the group that drafted that document and it was our aim to achieve a 5% prevalence of tobacco smoking by 2025.  The question was whether we should have an interim staged approach to the implementation of that.  The document outlines a broad range of measures designed to get us to that goal and a group is working currently on identifying how the action required should be staged between now and 2025 to get to the 5% prevalence.  That work is in progress and is well advanced.</p><p>  A number of committee members asked why the prevalence of smoking does not seem to be reducing, but we think it is.  No single study has monitored this over the years, but the various studies commissioned show a downward trend.  For example, the 2007 SL&Aacute;N study showed a prevalence of 27% or 28%.  Our most recent HSE studies, in 2012, show a prevalence of 22%, down from approximately 24% the previous year.  Therefore, we see a downward trend.</p><p>  We see as equally critical the study of health behaviour of school children.  A survey in 2010 showed that overall some 27% of children reported they had smoked at some time.  This is a decrease of nine percentage points from 2006.  In addition, the survey showed that 12% of children reported they were currently smoking, that is monthly or more frequently.  This represents a 3% decline from the 2006 figure.</p></speech>

I put this question as a former educator and as a non-smoker.  We get bombarded with statistics and documentation.  I have here in front of me documentation on behalf of a vested interest in the tobacco industry, which makes the point that smoking prevalence is quite high in Ireland, despite Ireland being one of the strictest tobacco regulatory environments.  The document cites the example of Germany which has seen youth smoking prevalence decline to 11.7% from 27.5%.  In the context of education awareness programmes and what the National Tobacco Control Office is trying to achieve, is an educational awareness policy going to succeed in itself?</p></speech>

I was going to give an overview on that in response to another question.  Various strands have been identified in this document and also within the HSE's internal policy in regard to the implementation of actions in regard to tobacco, and perhaps I will come back to those.</p></speech>

I do not have the European figures to hand but have noted that we are at the lower end of the  prevalence scale.  According to the figures that I quoted there has been a steady decline and we think that we are moving in the right direction.  We contend that a strong legislative base in this country - which will be further strengthened by the Bill - is a significant element in the decline.</p><p>  I shall move on to some other questions.  A question was asked about the prevalence of smoking but I have touched on the matter.  </p><p>  I have already answered the question on the penalties contained in the Bill.  Deputy Neville asked what we are doing to help people addicted to smoking so I shall go into detail about our broad range of strategies.  As I said in my opening statement, we have introduced various strategies to deal with the problem.  Everybody is reasonably aware of our quit campaign.  It has proven to be effective because there is a direct correlation between the scheme and the number of people seeking smoking cessation services.  We provide a significant level of smoking cessation services.  We also provide a quit line as a gateway service to the smoking cessation services.  We use multiple opportunities to engage with patients and there is patient contact both in hospitals and primary care with regard to getting smokers to avail of smoking cessation services.  We rigorously enforce the tobacco legislation through our environment health services.  We had 38 prosecutions in 2013 and we will achieve a similar if not a greater amount in 2014.</p><p>  We have a broad strategy in terms of tobacco reduction and two questions were asked.  The first question was what we were doing for people who are already addicted.  In terms of our overall strategy, we have the quit line, nicotine replacement products that are available free of charge on a medical card and we have a significant amount of smoking cessation services.  </p><p>  The other question in terms of tobacco reduction was what are we doing to stop children taking up the habit of smoking in the first place.  The broad range of our activities are focused on the area.  Our health promotion staff engage as far as they can, and within the resources available, by going into schools to alert and explain the dangers of tobacco smoke to children.  </p><p>  A significant element of enforcement is spent ensuring that retailers comply with the restrictions on sales to minors which forms a significant element of our prosecutions.  In fact 17 of our prosecutions in 2013 were in this area alone.  A range of measures have been designed to reduce the number of people experiencing their first cigarette.  I do not think there is anything else to discuss.</p></speech>

Brief intervention training is a huge part of the work carried out by frontline staff in the HSE.  We are the first contact that smokers have with the service so we try to encourage them to give up their smoking habit.</p></speech>

Does the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na share that experience?  Retailers have approached me and said that on examination of their books for any given week their takings for cigarette sales can be down by as much as &euro;4,000.  They can also see that there is a cycle of events.  I have encouraged retailers to contact the organisations present in order that their information can be shared with joint policing committees and Revenue.  Retailers have examined their books and compared one week's profits against another only to discover that their sales are down.  They have also described how the illicit trade takes place.  For example, calls are made from telephone boxes and a passing car drops a package at a location.  Retailers through their retail experience are under the impression that the illicit trade in tobacco has had a more negative impact on their business than on other sectors.</p></speech>

Has the tobacco industry been implicated in any illegal tobacco trade?  I wish to refer again to the KPMG report and the latest evidence from Australia.  Earlier I asked for the organisations to comment on the report but I also asked if they knew who paid for the report.  Since I asked my question I have received a note stating that it was paid for by a tobacco company called Phillip Morris.  That is important information and I wanted to put it on the record.  I ask the witnesses to address my two questions.</p></speech>

I am not sure that there is a particular location geographically.  It is our experience that it happens throughout the country and is quite widespread.</p><p>  I shall refer to the issue surrounding telephone boxes.  We have issues around small shops operating the trade under the counter.  We have issues around door to door deliveries.  We also know about telephone calls being made but I cannot say that it is confined to any particular area and to any particular time.  We think that the problem is spread nationally and demand driven.  We operate on the basis that community garda&iacute; are tasked to stay in touch with their local communities in order to find out what is going on.  The Deputy quite rightly mentioned that we have asked for the matter to be included on the agenda for the joint policing committees in order that we can examine the matter and build intelligence.  That means that if ten packs are sold at a particular location then we can see if it correlates with another place and decide whether to mount an operation to find the big supplier that will hit at street level.  That is the way we would tackle the problem.</p><p>  In respect of the issue raised by Deputy McLellan, we have engaged with the tobacco industry, as we are required to do, in terms of our approach to tackling the whole problem.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no evidence to suggest that the industry is involved in any illegal activity.  In so far as it goes in dealing with the tobacco products themselves, there is nothing to suggest that the industry is doing anything other than legal activity.</p></speech>

Revenue's experience is probably similar to that of the Garda.  Earlier I attempted to say the following but perhaps I did not make my comments clear enough.  We regard the matter as a geographically dispersed problem which fluctuates in different places from time to time depending on the availability of illicit cigarettes and the success, or otherwise, of our efforts to interrupt and disrupt the supply of tobacco products.  As I said earlier, it is plausible to presume that there is a socio-economic dimension.  It means that the activity is more intensive in some locations rather than others even within a very tight geographically defined area.</p><p>  With regard to whether the tobacco industry has been implicated in illegal trade, we are not particularly aware that the major tobacco companies have been involved due to certain measures being put in place.  I do not know but investigations may be taking place somewhere that may not have reached such a conclusion.  The regime that was put in place some time ago, and to which I referred earlier, had a significant impact on the problem.  The real growth area is in illicit and cheap white products where large volumes of meaningless brands are produced in far-off places that dwarf local demand.  That is an entirely illegal operation in so far as destination countries are concerned.</p> <p>We would need to have a track and trace regime and supply chain controls to have an impact in these source and transit countries.</p></speech>

I have published a list of 24 priorities which touch on almost all aspects of my Department, including an ambitious legislative programme.  An overarching goal will be to continue contributing to the Government&rsquo;s overall efforts to reduce the deficit, generate economic growth and increase employment.  All five divisions will play their role in underpinning the recovery and driving further sustainable economic growth.  The Government&rsquo;s medium-term economic strategy 2020, published in December, underlines the importance of the tourism and transport sectors to Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.  Competitive and efficient transport is vital both for domestic and export sectors and a well functioning world class transport infrastructure remains a key factor in attracting foreign direct investment.</p> <p>Investment in transport infrastructure which this year will exceed &euro;1 billion between roads and public transport is also a very direct economic stimulus that can generate direct and indirect employment.</p><p> The Government&rsquo;s medium-term economic strategy also recognises the progress made in the tourism sector.  As the sector moves from recovery to a period of new growth, I am undertaking a major review of existing policy which is now more than a decade old.  The review will be completed by the first quarter of 2014 and I plan to have in place a new strategy and action plan by the end of the year.  This year the Government is targeting a further 4% increase in visitor numbers and an 8% increase in revenue.  </p><p> In public transport I will be targeting an increase of 5 million in the number of passenger journeys, an increase of 2%.  There also will be a renewed focus on safety on the roads and at sea.  In addition, testing of new roadside drug testing equipment will begin later in the year.  </p><p> On sport, the Department will commence work on Ireland's bid to host the Rugby World Cup.  Work also will start on the national indoor arena at the National Sports Campus in Dublin and the Department will publish a new master plan for sport.  There will also be a new round of local and regional sports capital grants.  Both that round and the master plan will be led by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.  </p><p> On aviation, the Department is undertaking a significant policy review and will finalise the merger of Shannon Airport and Shannon Development, I hope before the summer.  The budget allocations before members will be critical to the achievement of these priorities.</p><p> As the sub-committee will have seen, the gross expenditure provision for my Department in 2014 is &euro;1.67 billion, of which just under &euro;1 billion, that is, &euro;982 million, is for capital projects and &euro;687 million for current spending.  This represents a 2% decrease on the 2013 budget allocation.  Most of the reduction relates to the continued application of the cuts foreseen in the comprehensive expenditure review and is line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fiscal consolidation.  Despite reduced funding, I am confident that we can deliver a very ambitious programme this year.  </p><p> The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided among five main expenditure programmes.  A total of 79% of the Vote, or &euro;1.315 billion in 2014, is allocated to the land transport programme.  This includes road maintenance, repair and improvement - &euro;751 million - at national, regional and local level; the public transport investment programme in respect of buses and trains - &euro;283 million - and public service provision payments, that is, the public service obligation, PSO, payments - &euro;221 million.  Overall, the allocation for the land transport programme has been reduced by 3% from the 2013 figure.  It is the largest programme and has taken the largest hit in 2014, with a current expenditure adjustment of more than &euro;68 million.  That said, I have managed to secure additional stimulus funding of &euro;50 million again this year for local and regional roads.  This should soften the impact of the cut in a critical part of the road network.  </p><p> Apart from the roads programme at national, local and regional level, the programme covers a diverse range of projects, programmes and agencies.  For example, it will provide for the commencement of works on the Luas cross-city project, a review of the national cycle policy framework, funding for the Road Safety Authority and the development of the online facility for road haulage operator licence applications.  I will be happy to go into more detail on all aspects of the programme, as members wish.  </p><p> The sub-committee will be keenly aware of the impact of the recent severe weather on transport infrastructure and, in particular, local and regional roads.  My Department is engaged in a Government-wide process in this regard.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, recently presented the Government with an interim report on the severe weather, with a preliminary estimate of &euro;20 million to repair damaged roads.  The Government agreed to return to the question of funding to repair storm damage when the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s final assessment of costs was available.</p><p> The tourism services programme accounts for 8% or &euro;137 million of the budget allocation and provides for the programmes and administrative spend of the two tourism agencies, namely, F&aacute;ilte Ireland - &euro;60 million - and Tourism Ireland - &euro;15 million.  It also includes a &euro;35 million contribution to the tourism marketing fund and &euro;24 million for the tourism product development scheme which, essentially, is the capital budget and has been enhanced significantly this year through the Government&rsquo;s stimulus programme and the additional money allocated specifically for the Wild Atlantic Way project.  </p><p> The sports and recreation services programme accounts for 6% or &euro;95 million of the budget allocation.  This programme's allocation has increased by 28% from that of 2013, mainly as a result of the additional funding of &euro;11.5 million voted under the Government stimulus programme for the sports capital programme and the allocation of &euro;13 million towards the development of the indoor arena at the National Sports Campus.  Both the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus receive funding through the grant-in-aid subhead of &euro;60 million which supports their respective programmes and administrative costs.</p><p> The maritime transport and safety programme stands at &euro;94 million in 2014 or 6% of the Vote.  While this is a reduction of 7% from the allocation for 2013, the programme will be supplemented by an allocation of &euro;4.8 million of unspent capital funding carried over from last year.  The main sub-programme covers the Irish Coast Guard.  I have maintained the budget in line with its requirements to ensure it can continue to provide an effective maritime emergency service, including the 24-7 helicopter search and rescue.  Earlier this month I was pleased to welcome officially the Irish Coast Guard&rsquo;s new state-of-the-art S92 search and rescue helicopter for the Dublin region.  This is the fourth Sikorsky S92 helicopter base to come into operation for the Irish Coast Guard and means that all four Irish Coast Guard bases now have upgraded helicopters.  </p><p> The gross expenditure provision for the aviation programme is &euro;27.7 million or 2% of the Vote.  The largest beneficiary of the funding is the regional airports programme - &euro;12 million - followed by funding earmarked to cover costs associated with Ireland's membership of Eurocontrol, costs incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority for exempt services and subscriptions to international organisations.  Aviation has always been recognised as a key element in our economic recovery.  In that context, I intend to publish the new aviation policy this year.  A draft policy statement will be published shortly to give stakeholders a further opportunity to have an input.  A final policy will then be published towards mid-year.  In addition, I aim to publish and enact the State Airports (Shannon) Bill which will establish, among other things, Shannon Group plc on a statutory footing.  I expect the Bill to be published next month.  Both policy initiatives will be critical to ensuring the aviation sector is fit for purpose to meet the demands and challenges of economic recovery.</p><p> I commend the Estimate to the sub-committee and I am happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

The sub-committee will proceed to consider the Estimate programme by programme, with each programme to be considered under the headings of its context and impact indicators, key outputs, financial and human resource inputs and the allocation and targets for 2015.  Administration costs will be considered under these headings when each of the programme areas has been disposed of.</p><p>  I am sure there will be plenty of questions, as the Minister's opening statement covered a great deal.  Before handing over to members, I will confine myself to two questions.  </p><p>  On the storm damage to which the Minister referred, I come from a part of the country that was heavily affected.  This issue cuts across a number of Departments, including the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Environment, Community and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They all are connected in another way in that I met a group of farmers whose access to their farms was affected because of the damage done to local improvement scheme roads to their farms which were washed away.  Will local authorities have flexibility, in respect of the funding the Department allocates to them, to attend to these issues to provide access for the farmers affected to allow them to continue to earn their livelihoods?  That is the best way I can put it.  </p><p>  Second, the Minister mentioned the Rugby World Cup and its importance to the country.  I invite him to outline the current position in this regard.  While I acknowledge we are still in the early stages, it will entail a lot of forward planning.  </p><p>  After the Minister responds to these two questions, I will hand over to members straightaway.</p></speech>

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is heading up the operation and will check to make sure the figures are accurate.  The most badly affected roads were in County Clare, in which approximately &euro;7.2 million worth of damage was done.  It was followed by counties Waterford, Galway, Mayo, Kerry and Cork, in which damage to a figure of &euro;3.8 million, &euro;2.5 million, &euro;2 million, &euro;1.7 million and &euro;2.5 million, respectively, was done.  These are the current estimates.  In addition, a lot of damage has been done to Irish Rail infrastructure.  I refer, for example, to the roof of Kent Station in Cork.  There are some issues in Waterford, where there was a landslide, as well as in Pearse Station, Dublin, where the roof was damaged again and needs to be replaced fully.  There was some minor damage to the Irish Coast Guard coastal unit stations, as well as some damage to lighthouses and at Shannon Airport.  However, as a commercial entity, that will have to be paid from the airport's own funds.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is putting all the information together and it is anticipated that it will then make a report to the Cabinet, after which the Government will either reallocate existing funds or make additional funds available which will then go to the local authorities in question to be divvied up.</p> <p>On the local improvement scheme, LIS, I have decided to allow local authorities to use up to 15% of their discretionary grant for an LIS programme if they so wish.  Both the discretionary grant and the percentage are up on last year.  When LIS was a dedicated budget of its own, it was &euro;5 million a year.  This will be up to approximately &euro;7 million.<br />It is really up to every local authority to decide whether or not it wants to do this.  Most local authorities do not.  They prefer to put the funding into public roads and say that laneways are a matter for the landowners.  In other parts of the country, they take a different view and say that some of these laneways are <i>de facto</i>public roads, maybe they are not taken in charge but they are used by many.  This will allow local authorities to make that decision for themselves and that will be welcomed.<br />On the Rugby World Cup, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and I met our counterparts in Armagh yesterday.  We have set up a committee, involving the tourism agencies, North and South, Tourism Ireland, the three Departments and the IRFU, which will map out what will be required to make the bid.  That report will go to the North-South Ministerial Council in the summer with a view to confirming what the bid will be.  The committee will figure out the structure - whether it will be some sort of company that will make the bid, who will run and own the company, and what will be the divvy-up between North and South when it comes to the capital investment needed and funding any liability if there is one at the end of it.  That is essentially what they will figure out.  As far as I am concerned, it is full steam ahead.</p></speech>

It saves me a question.</p><p>  I note he spoke of making a payment to the aviation authority for exempt services.  I thought the aviation authority was a significant profit generator.  Am I to assume that it already makes a dividend to the State but it does not show in the Department's accounts?  He might clarify whether it goes directly to the Exchequer.</p><p>  Towards the end, the Minister talks about miscellaneous aviation services.  Proposals are about to go out for aviation related consultancies.  How much is set aside for that consultancy, at subhead A4.6, miscellaneous aviation services?  He set out the purpose but not the funding for that consultancy.</p></speech>

As the Deputy stated, the dividend goes straight to the Exchequer, not into the Department's accounts.  Even though it is a commercial semi-State, it also has a regulatory role.  It is a hybrid in the sense that it does some work on behalf of the Department, particularly in the area of safety.</p></speech>

We more or less follow the American model of the FAA where safety, security and regulation is in with air-traffic control.  Some take the view that we should split it, make air-traffic control entirely commercial and put safety and security in with the aviation regulation.  I have been of both minds on that on a few occasions and I am not sure what decision will be made in the end.</p><p>  We also must have regard to European law and it seems that European law may require us to do something like that, perhaps, not entirely but to an extent.  I have not yet decided on that.  Anything requiring European law would not arise until 2020 anyway.  I suppose, if I was to talk about the IAA in shorthand, I would say that it does a good job and I would be in the "if it ain't broke don't fix it" space unless European law or other regulations require us to.</p><p>  On the consultancy,-----</p></speech>

Shannon and Knock airports seem to have increased passenger numbers but, as far as I know, in many of the regional airports the numbers have gone down or are static.  Has the Minister some way of gauging that and if there is a problem, can we look again at the subsidy at some stage?  This figure is in the Estimates, but surely our priority must be to have connectivity across the country.</p></speech>

There is the PSO, which is the subsidised flights to Kerry and Donegal.  Those are up for review this year as to whether they remain necessary.</p><p>  There is also operational expenditure, OPEX, which covers the losses where a regional airport makes losses.  The losses in Knock were small this year because it had a good year and its passenger numbers increased.</p></speech>

There are only two or three flights a week from it at this stage.</p><p>  There is also provision for capital grants for security and safety improvements only.</p><p>  The question of regional airports is always a tricky one.  Of course, the budget can always be reviewed, but the question is always whether the funding could be better spent.  If one looks at the cost, for example, of subsidising a flight from one part of the country to another, imagine what that could do on public transport.  That is always the kind of decision one has to make.  The cost of the PSO to Donegal or Kerry is probably more than the entire subvention for all the bus services in the Waterford area and it gives one an idea of the kind of decisions that have to be made.</p></speech>

In terms of general maintenance of the road network, the considerable reduction in funding to this area is leading to a pent-up problem that will surface in the near future because the NRA and local authorities are not in a position to maintain roads the way they would.  While I am not an engineer, the view of those to whom I have spoken is that it will cost a great deal more to bring the roads back to the level at which they were if this continuous reduction in maintenance funds is sustained.  As the Minister will be aware, there was a rolling programme that saw roads maintained on a seven-year cycle and now it is being extended.  The previous Government did it too.  It will demand a much heavier level of investment in the not-too-distant future, particularly if the Minister is to ensure that the roads remain safe and viable.  Has he any thoughts about that?  If so, he might share them with us.</p></speech>

It is worth bearing in mind that they get almost two thirds of the motor tax revenue paid to them through the local government fund.  They have commercial rates and property tax revenue also.  It is not solely my Department's responsibility, therefore.  The amount of maintenance on and repair and strengthening of our roads is not enough.  It will be fine this year.  There is a decent budget this year because we have called off many projects we would like to have carried out, including some of the bad bend amelioration and road-widening projects.  We have enough to ensure the roads are being maintained, but they should really be strengthened and restored more than at present.  With regard to both roads and railways, we are storing up problems for the future but I can work only within the budget I have.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister must balance his budget but the lack of capital projects such as the metro north project must be borne in mind.  I know the Minister's response in this regard.</p><p>  Expenditure on local and regional roads this year is to be &euro;330 million.  A considerable amount is required.  As the Minister said, there will probably be an additional cost associated with storm damage.  There are areas with massive potholes.  Meath is one area that always comes to mind because those affected keep contacting representatives about it.  We are obviously not meeting our targets with road expenditure.  I do not know whether the Minister could ever dig up more money and tackle some of these issues, particularly potholes.</p><p>  The roads budget has been cut by almost &euro;3 million.  I wish to tease this out.  The Minister referred to agencies and expenses.  Could he explain this a little more?  At the start of this year, there has already been a significant increase.  Some noises seem to be coming from the Road Safety Authority in regard to resources being made available.  The PSO reduction is 7%.  In this regard, I refer to the overall figure of &euro;221 million.  The Minister stated he will decrease the subvention next year and he hopes he might not have to do so thereafter.  However, if we keep decreasing the subvention, we will run into major problems with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  The Minister said he will increase passenger numbers by 2%.  Could he explain how this will be achieved?  I have always said the Nitelink service should be expanded because it is very limited on certain days.  Expanding it would certainly increase numbers and, if the service were run in a proper way, provide revenue.  Dublin Bus should be considering this.</p><p>  I welcome the roadside drug testing.  The equipment is badly needed.  If we get the system up and running, it will certainly improve road safety.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate when it will be up and running.</p></speech>

It is a great initiative and it is brilliant that it is to be introduced.  When does the Minister envisage its being introduced?  When will the officers who will be carrying out the testing be trained in, and how will this happen?</p><p>  Funding for roads has obviously decreased because the Minister is trying to work within a budget.  He has done the best he can.  I hope the additional stimulus funding of &euro;50 million will be put to good use and invested in local and regional roads.</p><p>  Could the Minister expand a little on the capital projects, the sum from which amounts to almost &euro;1 billion?  What are the bigger projects that will benefit?  Will expenditure flow into 2015?  Will all the funding be spent this year?</p></speech>

There are big and little ones.  The biggest include the Luas cross-city project.  There is to be an increase in public transport investment this year to take account of it.  Other projects include updating the Dublin Bus fleet.  Approximately 65 new buses are being bought every year, and they are pretty expensive.  With regard to roads, some of the moneys are close-out payments on roads that are actually completed, such as those in Belturbet and even Tralee.  The project in Ballaghadereen is under way.</p><p>  Some of the money is to get projects to the next stage.  Such projects include those in Enniscorthy and New Ross, in addition to the Gort-Tuam project.  Land purchase is also a factor, including along the Macroom-Ballyvourney corridor.  There are many projects covered by the budget, including new bus lanes.  Interestingly, the budget will also cover the extension of the city bikes scheme.  The bicycles are already in Dublin.  Availability is to be extended from Heuston to The O2, and bikes will also be available in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  There are to be advancements concerning the Leap card.  There is a lot covered by capital budgets.  Free Wi-Fi will be available on the entire Dublin Bus fleet by the end of March.</p><p>  We will start the work on the capital programme now.  There is no Government position on this yet but I believe it is about time we started having a new national development programme, perhaps for the period 2015-16.  The national development programme was effectively scrapped because of the economic crisis.  I would now like us to start working on this and put a new programme in place for the period 2015-16 outlining what capital investment will occur during the period in question.  It would be timely.</p><p>  As Deputy Ellis stated, the PSO reductions have been very severe in recent years.  This is one reason, but not the only one, we have had to bring about savings in the public's transport companies.  The other reason is that the cost base is much higher than it should be and much higher than European norms.  It is often amusing to hear people giving out that our PSO is lower than European norms, yet those who do so have no problem with our cost base and salaries being much higher than European norms.  We are trying to bring everything closer to European norms.  I do not see much room for any further reduction regarding the PSO.  I would like to have in place a clear five-year contract for the public transport companies.  Thus, instead of their being cut every year when the Government needs to save money, they would have certainty about their funding for five years.  They could run their services much better if they knew what their budget would be for five years.  This would contrast with circumstances in which the Government would ask them every year for a cut or, as in the good days, they would ask the Government for extra money just to do the same thing.  It is in this area that I am trying to make a change happen this year.</p><p>  It will not be easy to increase passenger numbers by 2%.  I hope part of the increase will be achieved because of the recovering economy, more people going to work, and more people with money to spend going out and about.  There will be some new services.  Dublin Bus is planning a few, as is Irish Rail.  I will let the companies tell the members about them when they are ready.</p><p>  Another objective is to ensure a much better customer experience.  This is enhanced by services such as real-time information, the Leap Card and Wi-Fi, all of which make public transport a better experience.  A certain amount of advertising will have to be done.  This is important.  Many people have not used public transport in a long time and their memory of it is based on when they were going to college, at which time one had to wait ages for a bus.  Services are much better now.  Particularly with real-time information, one can just check one's iPhone to tell when a bus is coming.  The service is much better than it used to be and routes are much shorter.  It is a question of telling people about this.</p><p>  There will be many promotions.  Members will probably have noted recently that Irish Rail kicked off its promotion of off-peak fares priced at &euro;9.99.  If trains are half empty in any case, the plan is to think like the airlines and sell the seats cheaply.  At least people would be using the trains, and trains would not be carrying air around the country, which is what happens much of the time.</p><p>  There are two elements to the drug-testing initiative.  It is hoped that in the next few months, once the legislation is passed, garda&iacute; will be able to test motorists at the roadside.  The test may involve getting motorists to walk in a straight line or touch their noses, for example.</p> <p>This will not be enough on its own but it will give a basis on which one can be taken off for blood or urine tests for drugs.  Towards the end of the year the Medical Bureau of Road Safety will tender for a roadside device which can be used to test for drugs.  We need to ensure it is robust.  There is no point in spending a load of money on something like this only to find it does not work or cannot stand up in court.  We would rather get it right than do it quickly.  We are looking at what other countries have done.  Other countries have had problems so we will proceed cautiously.</p><p> Deputy McEntee mentioned Meath.  We are doing some catch up in Meath and other counties.  Mr. Mullaney was involved in updating the length of mileage taken in charge in each county.  Counties such as Meath which had much development in recent years took a lot of roadway in charge.  The figures, which will be confirmed to local authorities tomorrow, will allow for an increase in counties where there has been much development and many new roads have been taken in charge.  It is either this or some roads which used to be national roads have been redesignated as regional roads and counties need to be compensated for this.  One will see significant increases in Louth, Meath and other places.  It needs an extra &euro;1.5 million and I hope this makes a difference.</p></speech>

Local authorities and the National Roads Authority have no power to question why An Bord Plean&aacute;la reaches its decision.  The Department could very easily fund the NRA to commission new works in Adare without knowing why exactly An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused permission in the first instance.  The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, does not have the same problem.  As the Minister is embarking on the merger of these two bodies is it timely to examine this?  We need to ensure any money spent by the taxpayer has a return on investment.  We do not need projects being put through the wringer and then turned down for a reason which remains like the third secret of Fatima and no one can find out what it is.  Application after application will be lodged and refused.  Will the Minister ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to examine this with regard to planning?  It is not the case the NRA or local authorities should be able to influence the decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la but they should be able to question why it arrived at a particular decision so at least they will not make the same mistakes when making a subsequent application.</p></speech>

Some outstanding capital projects have reduced in price considerably and probably need to be re-examined.  If there was a link to the airport, passenger numbers would increase massively over time.  I welcome what the Minister stated about Irish Rail prices and special offers.  Rail prices in this country are way over the top and I do not understand them.  It is a big hindrance to increasing passenger numbers on rail services.  Various groups have come before the committee and one is reluctant to tell them the prices are way over the top because one is afraid services will be cut.  The issue needs to be raised.</p></speech>

We have had three significant refusals in recent years in Slane, Adare and Dingle.  Not only do I think it made the wrong decision it is very frustrating that so much money was expended and so much time used only for us to end up with nothing.  Something similar happened with the children's hospital on the Mater site.  One can have one's views on the site but much time, effort and money were taken up, delays were caused and then An Bord Plean&aacute;la turned around and refused it.  This is the law and the power they have at present.  It used to be the case a Minister could override the planning authorities.  I am not sure I would reintroduce it as it could be very dangerous and certainly it was misused in the past, but there is an argument that a resolution of the D&aacute;il could be used on an issue of national importance.  It is a bigger question for the Government.  To answer the Deputy's question we need a better process.  At the very least the NRA should be able to engage in pre-planning and post-planning discussions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la just like the RPA and CIE can.  We discussed this previously when discussing Adare.  I propose to examine it in the context of the Bill to merge the NRA and RPA to see if we can include provision allowing for such discussions.  It is not in the Bill as published but we are examining it.  We will have to discuss it with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  Deputy Ellis mentioned rail prices.  I am not sure how often he goes to Britain but if he really wants to see where trains are expensive he should go there.</p></speech>

It will have to be more like airlines so when people book in advance they get a cheaper fare.  There is a sense in Ireland that one should just be able to rock up to the station at the last minute and get a decent train fare.  One cannot run a modern service like this.  We are moving towards cheaper intercity fares if people book in advance and much higher fares when people rock up at the last minute and think they are entitled to hop on a train which is probably full already.  It will be a culture shift for people and it will not be popular but it is definitely the right way to go in my view.</p><p>  With regard to PPPs if we are to draw up a new national transport plan we will have to re-examine all of the PPPs and re-cost them and see what we can go for and what we cannot.  We will also have to re-examine the business cases.  We must bear in mind when projects such as the metro north and metro west were drawn up the business cases were based on the idea the economy would grow forever.  I know this project well because I was on Fingal County Council and my D&aacute;il constituency includes part of Swords.  There were supposed to be 80,000 people in Swords today based on metro north's original business plan.  Perhaps a metro solution is not the right one and light rail would be better.</p></speech>

In recent times the extended capability on the west coast has been well utilised.  I had an opportunity to interact with the local base in my constituency and it is a very well-run project.  Discussions were held about utilising some spare capacity on the Coast Guard's contract.</p> <p>It was suggested that it could be used to do some ambulance-type work in association with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  A suggestion was made several years ago that while training the pilots and the advanced paramedics, they could be doing something of purpose to the State at no additional cost to the State.  Have discussions progressed in this area?</p></speech>

While this is welcome, it is a pity that the &euro;4.8 million was not utilised last year to address other shortfall areas such as repairing potholes and so forth.  It is important the extra helicopter has been assigned to the service.  How are the savings achieved in this area?  Are there cutbacks in the number of flights?  Has there been a restriction on services for islands?  One often hears people from island communities saying they feel they do not get the same service as that on the mainland.

In fact, they did a record number of missions this year.  The new helicopters can go further, faster, operate in icy conditions and tend to be more comfortable.  They are doing work with the HSE.

It is worth bearing in mind that, while the increase in the sports budget this year is great, it is a fraction of what was spent in the good days when money was going to the development of Croke Park and Aviva, good investments at the time by the then Government.  The sports capital budget is &euro;23 million a year which is split between the sports campus, national facilities and projects for clubs and sporting bodies.</p><p>  The national lottery funding is a misnomer in my view.  What really happens is that the national lottery pays money to the Exchequer each year which is treated more as less as another income stream.  It might as well be the property tax or something else.  The legislation ring-fences moneys from the national lottery for arts, culture and sport or any other purpose as the Government may decide.</p></speech>

It would be much nicer if it was in legislation that it had to be split equally between sports and culture but that is the way it is at the moment.  I should point that even though the sports capital budget is up, there is a small reduction in the Irish Sports Council budget, which is the current side.  However, it is not a huge reduction.  It is only about 2% or 3%.  Some of those savings will be delivered because of the Haddington Road savings.  There is no reason some of the sporting bodies should not follow on from that and implement the Haddington Road savings in their organisations.  What we have tried to do with the support for the Irish Sports Council is protect certain programmes, women in sport and smaller national governing bodies, NGBs, that do not have access to commercial income or sponsorship.  Quite graciously, they accepted it.  The larger cut is for the GAA, FAI and the IRFU on the basis that they have ticket sales and access to sponsorship.  The cuts to the smaller NGBs that do not have that have really been nominal, which is probably the right decision to take.</p><p>  There is no budget lined up for the Rugby World Cup but there may have to be down the line.  There is no cut yet.  Any small amount of money we need at this stage is being used from the F&aacute;ilte Ireland budget because it is covered by tourism at this stage rather than sport.  For the first time in a number of years, there was no overspend last year so sport spent all the money allocated to it last year.  It is a bit strange with the clubs.  They get a grant and a couple of years to draw it down.  We must guess every year how much they are going to look for because they must show they have the works done, put the logo up and all the rest of it before we pay out.  If they were all to look for the money tomorrow, it would be about &euro;70 million, which we do not have.  Thankfully, that does not happen so the Department must make an educated guess every year as to how much they are going to ask for.  Sometimes, it under runs.  It has not over run since I have been around but one day it will happen and I am sure we will find the money somewhere.  </p></speech>

Deputy Dooley asks quite rightly how we can continue that momentum.  My area of concern is how we continue to grow our UK numbers.  Our neighbours in the UK have traditionally been very strong visitors to this country.  If any initiatives are occurring in the UK, I would certainly welcome it.  The Minister might be able to expand on that.<br />In respect of capital provision, there are many good initiatives that are starting to develop around the country.  In my own neck of the woods in Waterford, both local authorities, which will be amalgamated into one local authority in a few months' time, are developing what they call the greenway.  Is there any capital provision in these Estimates to support such projects?  This particular project will link rural county Waterford around Mount Congreve gardens, which are of international significance, to the Viking triangle, into which many public funds have gone and which is proving very successful in increasing tourist numbers.  Another project is the Waterford &amp;amp; Suir Valley Heritage Railway, which is a community-based initiative that is proving to be successful and again links to Mount Congreve gardens.  It is initiatives like these that will continue the momentum and create attractions to persuade people to visit Ireland.<br />I apologise for coming late to the meeting.  The next issue is tourism-related but is also road-related.  The M9 is probably one of the only motorways in the country that does not have a service station.  I know that it was proposed that a public-private partnership would deliver a service station.  The drive from Dublin to Waterford is almost 100 km with no safe stop <i>en route</i>.  Are there any plans to provide a service station on that motorway?  It is a tourism issue as much as it is a road safety issue.  </p></speech>

Many of the festivals and events that took place last year will take place this year.  One of the real successes of The Gathering was the fact that quite a number of local authorities around the country, including Clare, really embraced it.  We would not like to lose that so we are trying to put something together that would allow us to continue to fund small local events and festivals that worked for The Gathering.  We do not know yet.  The big worry about The Gathering was always that we might have a dip the following year because it brought events forward.  There is some evidence of that on the conference side but so far, it is looking okay for this year.  The tour operators and hoteliers all say it is looking very positive and the airlines just keep adding capacity.  I am getting a bit worried that some of the flights will not work because there are so many additional ones.  There are nearly 80% more seats from Canada this year than there were last year and there are about 10% more from the US.  In the past week, both Emirates and Etihad pretty much doubled their capacity.  We have moved from the stage where we were trying to get the airlines to put on more routes to the stage where we are trying to make sure the ones they have put on actually work.</p><p>  In respect of damage to tourist facilities, there was some damage along the Wild Atlantic Way.  A distinction is made between publicly and privately owned facilities but we may be able to help repair the publicly owned ones.  Some will be insured.  Most of the privately owned ones and even some of the publicly owned ones would be insured.  </p></speech>

It is worth knowing that anyway.</p><p>  Great Britain is still and always will be our largest inbound market.  It is not necessarily the largest in terms of revenue because American and European visitors stay longer and spend more as British visitors often just take short breaks but it is the largest in terms of numbers.  The numbers are starting to recover quite strongly in quarters three and four, which is very encouraging.  GB Path to Growth, which is a report produced last year, is the template we are using to market Ireland in Great Britain, particularly to two segments of the population.  They are the older, culturally curious people and younger social energisers, as they are called.  They are wonderful marketing buzz words if you are into that sort of thing.  That change in marketing focus has helped.  </p> <p>The fact that the British economy is recovering has really helped.  Unemployment is down to approximately 7%, recovery is taking hold, they have more money and sterling is going a bit further.  That is probably the main reason for the recovery from Britain.  This year the additional Ryanair flights will help.  I am very confident about Britain.</p><p> The greenways have been funded from the tourism budget in the past.  The Great Western Greenway in Mayo was an example.  Now they are being funded out of the national cycle network under the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  He has a number of proposals on his desk, including the one to which the Deputy refers.  He has not made a decision yet but he will do so in the next couple of weeks.</p><p> There were originally plans to have two services stations on the N9, one at Paulstown and one further up in Kildare.  The one in Paulstown seems to be going nowhere but the one in Kildare should go ahead, although I could not give an exact timeframe on it.  It is linked to the contract for the N11 and Newlands Cross so it should happen soon.</p></speech>
