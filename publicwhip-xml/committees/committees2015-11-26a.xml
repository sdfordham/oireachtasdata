    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00400"><p>Last week, Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, appeared before the committee.  The Chairman raised the issue of the Fennelly commission and words were used to the effect that there should not be a blank cheque involved in that commission of investigation.  I raised the issue of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and the uncertainty with regard to how long it will take to finalise that commission of investigation, the comments of the High Court judge who is conducting it and the warning he has given that this could be a waste of taxpayers' money.  I raised this matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  If legislation is needed with regard to that commission of investigation, a financial analysis must be conducted and made public before any decision is taken to move on in that regard.  There was agreement on the sense in that in the committee last week, given what you and others articulated, especially when the judge in question has effectively put the Government on notice that, in his opinion, it is uncertain at present as to how long this will take and he wonders whether it is a good use of public money and value for money for the taxpayer.</p> <p>  The committee should consider formally asking that before any new commission of investigation, or even an extension of an existing commission of investigation, is decided upon, an analysis would be conducted as to how much it would cost, including the projection over a number of years, and that it would be made public.  That is a reasonable request considering that the Mahon, Moriarty and beef tribunals collectively cost the taxpayer approximately &euro;250 million.  The point of establishing these commissions of investigation was that they would not be tribunals.  They would be shorter and would not amount to a blank cheque for lawyers, frankly, which is what I have seen with some of the tribunals in this country.  The point was that there would be a time limit, so it would not be open-ended.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a role to play in asking the Government to consider that - at the very least and before it takes any decisions on these commissions of investigation - the length of time involved must be certain and that a spending cap might be necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00500"><p>I support what Deputy Deasy said.  When the commission of inquiry legislation was going through the Houses in 2004 and 2005, that was very much the intent behind it.  The legislation was seen as creating a viable alternative to the tribunals, which were perceived as being open-ended and costing the taxpayer an arm and a leg.  The purpose of the commissions of investigation was to be specific.  It was to focus the structure and the operation of the inquiry so it would be done with the maximum result but with minimum cost to the State.  The legislation put in place a dual structure in respect of the legal system on the one hand and non-engagement with the legal system on the other hand.  That combination of approaches would have to be achieved correctly to ensure that a vast quantity of money was not being spent, particularly by the engagement of major legal teams.  This particular case highlights that.  With regard to the Fennelly report and the IBRC, it would be worthwhile if we could find a mechanism to review the situation in terms of cost to the taxpayer in the context of the Committee of Public Accounts seeing how we could deal with it here to get some guidance and direction on the expenditure of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00600"><p>I agree with the thrust of those comments.  Obviously, the cost of any inquiry is a matter of concern and anything that amounts to a blank cheque book for legal firms or lawyers must be avoided.  However, it is important that the committee makes it clear that the issues under consideration must be fully investigated because potentially serious questions in respect taxpayers' money arise from the serious matters the judge was asked to investigate.  There should not be an impression that issues surrounding potential costs of the commission were being used in any way or for any purpose to block a full and thorough investigation.  However, it is a good idea to make inquiries and ensure that legal costs, caps, <i>per diem</i>rates and so forth are in full view and under the surveillance of this committee.  It is a fair to ask that.  Nevertheless, it is an absolute imperative that each of the deals under consideration, most notably that involving Siteserv, is fully investigated.  We should not be, nor should we be perceived to be, throwing up a further road block in achieving a full investigation of those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00700"><p>It must be said that it is most regrettable that the inquiries referendum was voted down.  Of course, it was the legal people, through their careful intervention, who largely brought that about.  It is worth making that point at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00800"><p>We had this discussion last week with regard to the Fennelly commission and IBRC.  To allay any fears, Deputy McDonald, it has nothing to do with the issue being investigated, getting to the bottom of it and dealing with it in an effective way.  However, the history of tribunals and other investigations is that once they are established by the House, they appear to get out the gap and costs are never a question.  When that happens, as history has shown, we cannot intervene.  We are told that we cannot interfere with the direction of the tribunal.  The purpose of the conversation last week, and again today, is that some restraint be put on the costs, legal fees and structure of the proposed investigation or tribunal before it sets off, so that we at least have an idea of the cost implications versus the outcomes we are trying to achieve.  We have not learned from the history of this, and there appears to be a reluctance and inability to address it.</p> <p>  Last week, we asked Mr. Watt for the figures in respect of the Fennelly commission and the IBRC.  The figures were not available that day but we were told that they could be made available to us immediately.</p><p>I understand that we still have not got those figures and that is unhelpful.  The committee is right to follow the proposition outlined by Deputy Deasy in the context of protecting the taxpayers' money because it is a more sensible, prudent and constructive approach to the work of any ongoing tribunal or investigation.  We should take this issue up next week with the Department of Finance but in the meantime we should write to the Departments concerned about this issue, make our views known and seek a response.  Hopefully we will get an input into overseeing or examining the cost of the proposals that are being put before the Oireachtas.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#C00200"><p>We should ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to structure that and to come back to the committee.  In the context of the IBRC case, the High Court judge was effectively telling the Government that this needs to be structured better, with definite timeframes and that it needs to be clear because as of now, it is not.  A High Court judge is dealing with this but it could end up being a complete waste of taxpayers' money if it is not structured differently.  We are not getting into the substantive issue of whether there should be an investigation.  I agree with the Chairman on that point.  I am conscious that there may be information that I am not aware of and that when the Government made that decision, it may have had information to which I am not privy.  I am not going to second guess that decision but we should ask for that structure to be imparted to this committee, based on what the High Court judge has said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#C00300"><p>I entirely agree with that and the points are very well made.  However, it is important that we, as a committee, put on the record that a decision has been taken that the matters at hand need to be investigated and that they speak to the issue of taxpayers' money, at least potentially.  I am not jumping to conclusions in terms of the possible outcome but it is important that we say that, along with saying that we need to see the structure.  Of course, there has to be some sanity in respect of the cost of this to the public purse.  The Chairman is absolutely correct in that regard.</p></speech>

We will ask the Department of Expenditure and Reform to give us the figures we have requested before the end of business today, given that those figures are apparently quite easy to get.  Let us have those figures; we were promised them last week.</p></speech>

We want as much complete information as we can get.  That is what we were promised last week but we should have it today.

On the question of sanity raised by Deputy McDonald and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, it might be no harm if someone was tasked with the job of costing more serious policy matters that will be put before the electorate over the coming months.  It would make perfect sense for some State agency or organisation to be put in charge and to outline the costs of the bigger proposals being put forward by every political party and none so that someone has a handle on what people are getting involved in.</p></speech>

Somebody should be charged with providing a broad analysis of particular projects that may be put before the people in the context of a general election.  That happens in other jurisdictions.  We need at least an indicative guideline on the costs that might be involved and it would be no harm to make that available to every political party and to the Members of these Houses, who want to establish costs in a real way.  I am not referring specifically to this Government but to Governments in general when I say that far too often it is only after a general election that costs get counted properly but they should be counted as we go along, in an independent way.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance has point-blank refused to do that.  We have tabled various parliamentary questions on it and my party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath has published legislation which would enable the IFAC to carry out that role.  All the Department of Finance is willing to do at the moment is to cost an individual proposal but it will not cost a package of proposals because the proposals in a package can interact with one another.  The Department will only cost individual items.  The Minister for Finance has refused to allow his Department to cost any package of proposals.  That is why the Chairman's suggestion is worthwhile because the public is entitled to know these things before the election.</p></speech>

I raise this because it is a serious issue, regardless of who is in power.  It is also vital to develop the whole concept of public accountability through the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.  The issue will have to be pursued.  The situation will change but the change is not happening quickly enough and is not keeping up with the changing dynamic in the economy and the country.  Again, we will raise the matter with the Department of Finance next week.</p> <p>  Under matters arising from the minutes, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, submitted information on the development of the hospital on the Mater site.  The clerk will prepare a short report on the issues involved which will be circulated next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Under correspondence, item 3A is correspondence from the Accounting Officers, while item No. 3A(1) is correspondence dated 20 November 2015 received from Mr. Noel Waters, acting Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality regarding clarification of an issue following our meeting of 5 November 2015.  This is to be noted and published.  We also have correspondence dated 20 November from Mr. Barry Ryan at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding NAMA properties refused by local authorities which is also to be noted and published.</p></speech>

In terms of the explanation given that the properties were unsuitable, there is a suggestion that not only were they unsuitable, but that they were unavailable.  We need some further clarification because NAMA told us a number of weeks ago that 6,500 units of accommodation were made available to the 31 local authorities but approximately two thirds of them were rejected by the local authorities.  Those properties were made available over a period of time but eventually NAMA had no choice but to put them up for sale to the private sector, where they were snapped up.</p><p>They have all been sold except for 300 units.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis and it is incredible to think that over 4,000 units of accommodation should not have been suitable for whatever reason, yet the private sector had no problem at all purchasing them for housing purposes.  We need further clarification as to why the local authorities did not take them and whether the full information was provided to us by NAMA on the suitability and availability of the properties in question.  I ask that we seek further information on those 4,000 plus units.</p></speech>

It is a good idea to get as much information on this matter as we can.  We should look to the Department to furnish us with that.  Of course, sizeable as those figures are, they are a drop in the ocean in respect of the housing crisis.</p></speech>

No. 3B(1) is correspondence dated 10 November 2015 from Mr. Patrick Coughlan of Mullingar, County Westmeath, re Castlemartyr resort, to be noted and published.  We have had previous correspondence from Mr. Coughlan on NAMA actions in Castlemartyr.  It now appears that information on local property tax payment by Mr. Coughlan was also available to third parties and to NAMA.</p> <p>  NAMA will not deal with us on individual cases but these issues have been raised directly with the committee by Mr. Coughlan in respect of this particular property.  I believe NAMA should respond to us and deal with the issues that have been raised in so far as it can.  I see nothing wrong with that.  It has been brought to our attention.  The various documents down through the last few months have been published, noted and sent on to NAMA.  We have not received a detailed response to any of it.  There are serious issues raised.  We are not lobbying or advocating on behalf of this group or individual.  We simply want to know what the position is.  I do not see anything wrong with that, given that the former and-or current property owner at Castlemartyr has made his side of the story known to us.  If necessary, we can ask NAMA to come before us and explain it.  I believe we are entitled to a comprehensive response to the issues raised.  I ask that we send the latest round of correspondence to NAMA and ask whether it wants to reply by letter or come before us on a particular day to give the explanations for all the concerns that have been raised here in public session.</p> <p>  I should point out that this is an issue for the Revenue Commissioners as well, so we can write to them.  It is the same request: to please give us the information in correspondence or, if they feel more comfortable, to come before the PAC to explain the matter and be questioned on it.  We can set that day before Christmas, it is not a problem.</p> <p>  No. 3B(2) is correspondence dated 17 November 2015, received from Mr. &Eacute;amonn Casey of Debt and Development Coalition Ireland.  It has made recommendations for the PAC based on a report by the coalition.  I do not know what coalition that is.</p></speech>

The issue is something we should not duck.  They are not asking for a full meeting but rather to meet with just a couple of us initially to make a case.  They are talking about something which is delicate but which concerns billions being lost to the Exchequer, which is a very big issue.</p></speech>

It is something the Minister for Finance intimated yesterday with regard to what is coming from Europe, specifically as it pertains to Apple.  It was not just an intimation; he was effectively saying that a lot of the criticisms of Ireland's corporate tax structure and the Apple issue were politically motivated.  We should be careful with regard to this group.  We should find out its make-up before we bring its members into the public accounts committee.  I tend to agree with the Minister for Finance.  There are a lot of countries within the European bloc that have for a long time been critical of our tax and corporate tax structures.  They are competing with us.  I just think we should be careful with regard to this particular group.</p></speech>

The documentation states that the production of the policy document was undertaken with the assistance of the European Union.  One presumes this group has been around for quite some time and has access to funding through one of the funding streams.  I agree that we should meet and see where an investigation, examination or discussion might go.  I do not think there is a question mark around the bona fides of the group itself.  As Deputy Ross said, the issues are very substantive and serious in respect of the Exchequer and the taxation regime.  There should certainly be a meeting with a view to a session here if that is what we decide.</p></speech>

We could note and publish this and forward it to the HSE for further response to questions that Mr. Haire has asked.  There is a significant amount of money involved.  The Comptroller and Auditor General may also want to examine the costs arising from the interchangeability of medicines.  We will acknowledge this to Mr. Haire and pursue the matter as outlined.</p> <p>  Correspondence dated 18 November 2015 was received from Ms Julie Gibbons re payment of water rates.  This is to be noted and published and sent to the Department for comment.  Maybe the local government audit service should examine the matter.  We will ask for its response.</p> <p>  Correspondence was received from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald re funding to the children and youth working group in Stoneybatter.  This is to be noted and published and forwarded to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for a breakdown of the financial provision allocated to this group.</p></speech>

This has been an ongoing issue for youth workers and providers in the Stoneybatter area.  The nub of it is that there is an anomaly of about &euro;76,000, conservatively, in respect of the spend.</p><p>The City of Dublin Youth Service Board, CDYSB, has given one figure and the Department has given another.  Similar services across the State are under considerable pressure, therefore, these people want clarification and a final figure on what is being spent.  Their worry is that the Department is issuing figures that inflate the spend in the Stoneybatter area and they are concerned that this be clarified, or if it is the case that money ought to be going into the Stoneybatter area but, by dint by some of some administrative error, is going elsewhere, they want that clarified also.</p></speech>

One report states the costings are &euro;100,000 and another one states they are &euro;65,000.  We should get the internal costs of this report and the breakdown of those, and who managed and produced the report.  Also, there is mention of the due diligence report that was prepared by Deloitte and O'Flynn Exhams.  We should get a breakdown of the costs of that.  Is it possible to get a copy of the minutes of the audit committees of these, or is that a request too far?  I am thinking, for example, of the audit committee of CIT.  We are going to examine it in regard to its audit.  Perhaps the minutes of the audit committee meetings might be of help to members.  With respect to the other document, we need to establish the costs of it.  How do they reach a point within the college where they produce the document for &euro;65,000 or &euro;100,000 and then somebody decides to redact it?  What is that process?  Can we ask for clarification on that?  Who decides to redact and who decides what to redact?</p> <p>  Another issue was raised in correspondence about the cleaning staff in CIT.  It came in by way of anonymous correspondence.  We should forward that for clarification in regard to their contracts and employment; the issue of sick pay and so on was raised.  Let us have the  clarification before the meeting rather than ask for this again at the meeting and not getting full clarification then.</p> <p>  Is there any other issue in regard to the work programme?  The work programme is agreed.  There is no other business.  We have agreed our agenda for next week, which is Vote 7: Office of the Minister for Finance, Chapter 1: Exchequer Financial Outturn, Chapter 2: Government Debt, Chapter 3: Cost of Bank Stabilisation, and the Finance Accounts for 2014.</p></speech>

It operates racing activities through 11 subsidiary companies, and licenses greyhound racing at other, privately-owned tracks.</p> <p>  Bord na gCon received Oireachtas grants totalling &euro;10.8 million in 2014.  Income arising from other sources includes proceeds from the operation of totaliser betting, gate receipts at tracks, bookmaker fees, and contributions from dog owners and sponsors towards racing prize money.  Its expenditure includes amounts paid out in respect of totaliser betting wins, racing prize money and Bord na gCon&rsquo;s administration and running costs.</p> <p>  The downturn in the economy has had a significant impact on Bord na gCon&rsquo;s operations, and on its bottom line.  The board incurred a loss of &euro;1 million in 2014 and has recorded losses in four out of the last five years.   As a result, the accumulated surplus of &euro;5.1 million carried in at the beginning of 2010 has been wiped out, and Bord na gCon had an accumulated deficit of &euro;0.4 million at the end of 2014.</p> <p>  I have previously reported on the acquisition of land and development of the racetrack and corporate headquarters at Greenpark in Limerick, which was completed in October 2010.  Related to that development, and investment in other tracks, Bord na gCon has been carrying a high level of borrowing.  The 2014 financial statements disclose bank borrowings at year end of &euro;22.7 million, which is little changed year on year.  </p> <p>  The 2014 financial statements were certified on 31 August 2015 and received an unqualified opinion.  However, the audit report drew attention to the deficit, and to note 25, in which the board outlines the basis on which it considers that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.</p><p>Disposal of surplus property is a key element in Bord na gCon&rsquo;s plans to improve its financial position and the level of State funding was anticipated to increase substantially in 2015.  In addition, the audit report draws attention to non-compliance with public procurement rules, which has been referred to in Bord na gCon&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control.  I should point out the incidence of non-competitive procurement has declined and we will continue to keep that matter under review.</p></speech>

Since we last met this committee, much of the focus of the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, has been on the implementation of the Indecon report.  The progress on that project has been detailed in the briefing document submitted last week.  Indecon critiqued serious structural issues within the industry and raised questions about the validity of strategic decisions taken at the beginning of the recession.  These conclusions were further elaborated in the review by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the Limerick project in particular.  It is important to state that Indecon also felt strongly that if the appropriate actions were taken, as laid out in its review, the industry then would have a viable future.<br/><br/>Realising that future will be challenging.  The enormous impact of the recession on discretionary consumer spending is obvious.  Members of the committee, more than most, are aware of the effects of reductions in income on behaviour and on the spending choices people have been obliged to make.  The notion that the greyhound industry could sail unaffected through those waters simply is not tenable.  The recession has both caused attendances to plummet and led to many trainers and owners exiting the industry.  The period also saw very significant reductions in the Horse and Greyhound Fund, which ran at more than 30% at one point.  The capacity of the IGB even to sustain levels of incentive and prize money simply did not exist, partly because of the business hit but also because of the drain on our resources to pay down significant legacy debt.  That is the reality and there is no sugar-coating it.<br/><br/>We should not discount how the cumulative consequences of deep cost-cutting within the organisation has affected investment in our facilities and the marketing of our product.  The board in 2014 took significant actions to step up commercial performance through a new strategy and more appropriate levels of funding.  These will not make an immediate impact as there will be a time lag, but the benefits of the new strategy are beginning to show clearly for 2015.  Stadium branding and all marketing materials have been developed and updated.  The Tote brand has been updated to fit with the design of the stadium branding.  There is a strong digital marketing dimension to all our commercial work.  All stadia now have their own web presence, which is linked to <i>www.gogreyhoundracing.ie</i>.  The IGB has taken over all the food and beverage operations within its stadia.  These operations are now fully integrated in terms of planning and consistency of business objectives.  Food and beverage is now a key driver of future attendance and income growth.  The profits generated through the new food and beverage arrangements will be retained within the industry.  Significant progress has been made on another major issue, namely, the pension deficit, the details of which are to go for member consultation early in the new year.  There also has been much work done on the development of new income streams, based largely on significant investment in technological infrastructure, which was hopelessly outdated in terms of market requirements.  There are some positives in terms of outturns for the year and the general economic canvass on which this industry operates.  A lot has been happening at board level, the benefits of which may not be immediately apparent but which will have significant impact in the medium and long term.</p></speech>

At our presentation 12 months ago, I stated that if this industry was to survive and prosper, it would require tough decisions, ongoing assessment of the business model, the development of new income streams and an openness to new approaches right across the sector.  During the past year, the Irish Greyhound Board has not shied away from any hard decision, including the decision to sell the Harold's Cross site, the calibration of racing and the development and introduction of key performance indicators, KPIs, for all tracks.  Commercially, the Irish Greyhound Board has introduced a new digital and marketing strategy.  As already mentioned, we have taken over our food and beverage operations and entered into commercially important drinks pouring rights arrangements.  We have established appropriate technology platforms to generate new income streams and have signed contracts with some of the most iconic global wagering names.  Increased marketing spend has enabled investment in marketing to the tour operator and incentive markets.  We have increased our presence at a number of United Kingdom and European trade fairs and all this activity should yield dividends, based on the booking cycles of these companies, from next year onwards.</p> <p>  Despite these measures, the results for 2014 reinforce the fact that improvement following years of underinvestment in the commercial infrastructure of the Irish Greyhound Board will take time to deliver.  All the initiatives are important and overdue and will position the Irish Greyhound Board to maximise opportunities arising from improvements in the macroeconomy.  Critical actions must be taken to regenerate the industry, key among these being the need to increase of the number of owners, breeders and trainers involved in the sport.  This group must be increased and renewed as otherwise, the industry will continue to contract.  We are working with all stakeholders to develop ways to incentivise ownership and in that respect, the additional allocation in the budget is most welcome.  We have concluded a full consultation with industry stakeholders and the challenge is to ensure the maximum return on investment.  The additional &euro;1.2 million announced in the budget for the Horse and Greyhound Fund is going to prize money and additional industry supports at grassroots level.</p> <p>  At last year&rsquo;s meeting, the issue of regulation and integrity was brought up.  Regulation always has been a fraught area for all sports governing bodies and for greyhound industries worldwide.  It must be stated that only a very small number of those involved in the greyhound industry are non-compliant.  This being the case, the board has championed and introduced the use of new statutory instruments to strengthen our regulatory control.  Those who breach the regulations now know they will be faced with publication of adverse findings from test results of their greyhounds, which, in turn, will be banned from racing.  This is a major step forward and is but one to be followed.  The Irish Greyhound Board supports mandatory penalties for a range of offences but this will require amending primary legislation.  I realise I am not saying anything new in stating the past few years have been very difficult for all those involved in the greyhound industry.  There is a serious attempt to put the industry on a sound footing within the resources available to us and to create an industry model that is fit for purpose and is sustainable.</p></speech>

I wish to take up one comment made by Ms Larkin in her opening statement on which she might provide members with a little information.  I believe I heard two years ago the news the Irish Greyhound Board was signing contracts "with some of the most iconic global wagering names" to increase revenue.  How much revenue will that source produce in 2015?</p></speech>

We have new markets in America, which are co-mingling our betting into the Irish Tote market.  In addition, there are markets operating in Europe, together with a trial at present with major bookmakers through the use of television product.  To set that out first, we have three different avenues for income streams.  In May 2015, we commenced live betting from America with five different companies and on current predictions, this will achieve an estimated turnover to the end of 2015 of &euro;600,000.</p></speech>

Obviously, the retention for the IGB is somewhat less.  In addition to that, we have just completed a successful trial involving television product into Irish and UK bookmaker shops.  Negotiations on a long-term contract in this regard have also commenced.  I hope these negotiations will conclude before the end of this year.  Again, this is a real ongoing contract in the industry.</p> <p>  The third area I mentioned was that of co-mingling from bookmakers in the UK and wider Europe.  Those development works are ongoing and are part of an international technological upgrade with our various bookmaking partners.  That work is scheduled to go live in 2016.  The contracts are signed but live betting has not yet started.  There is considerable international investment from both our partners and their third parties in building the infrastructure necessary to facilitate that co-mingling.</p></speech>

The legal advice, of which I am in receipt, is that the settlements are confidential and, as such, I cannot disclose the nature of the settlements themselves.

That would be a small element of it.  I am sure the settlement and compensation, which might have been paid, is where the main money lies.  I am sure the costs the IGB incurred to date were approved for in the 2014 accounts.  Did it involve a payment by the IGB to settle the three cases?</p></speech>

There was a time some years ago when the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution was 20% or 30% of the board&rsquo;s income.  It is now heading towards 50%.  The IGB is not a commercial organisation and could not exist without a taxpayer subvention of &euro;14 million next year.  We will take it that it is taxpayers&rsquo; money that is being paid out in these cases.</p> <p>  Whatever confidential agreement the IGB has entered into, it will not overcome the need to record this and have it disclosed so that the readers of the 2015 accounts will know. The Committee of Public Accounts will not tolerate a large six-figure sum being buried in the accounts without it being disclosed.  While on the one hand the board might have a legal agreement on confidentiality, the board members have a separate legal and fiduciary duty when signing off on the accounts next year to ensure they are in compliance with the law.  The legal agreement is one issue, while the fiduciary duty as a director is another.  The board members will not be able to get away from including major settlement figures in the accounts.  The reason I am raising this is because it is referred to in the 2014 accounts.  This is germane to the accounts in front of us today.  The issue involved predates 2014.  It has been rumbling along for five years and relates to a race in 2010.  Do the witnesses get the point I am making?</p></speech>

I do not want the Chairman or Deputy to think that we are holding back information.  We are not and we fully understand that in our accounts for 2015, which will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, there will have to be disclosure.  To add to what the CEO said, an agreement in principle is drawn up, for example, on when the payment is made.  That has not happened yet and we got further legal advice yesterday to hold off on commenting on the case until everything is done and dusted.  As chairman of the board, I am quite prepared to confirm here today that when everything is done and dusted we will certainly make the Department and Comptroller and Auditor General aware of the full case.  At that stage, I will have no problem making the details available to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

There was a loss in 2014 of &euro;1 million, and a smaller amount in 2013.  The figure is in the hundreds of thousands.  Mr. Meaney has said that Bord na gCon received legal advice but it is difficult for the Committee of Public Accounts - this is taxpayers' money.   It was August 2015 when the 2014 accounts were signed.  We will not wait until August 2016 to hear this information.  Arising from today's meeting, we will ask for it as soon as it is concluded and that a briefing be sent to us.</p> <p>  Mr. Meaney mentioned the Department.

Bord na gCon has been very successful in negotiating an improvement in its income for 2016.  It had &euro;13.6 million for 2015, from the taxpayer, and that will increase to &euro;14.8 million in 2016.  That is an increase of &euro;1.2 million.  Will the settlement of that outstanding legal case take a large proportion of that &euro;1.2 million?</p></speech>

Our bank overdraft - in the most difficult of times - has not increased in the last four years.  I do not expect it to increase.  The industry has been starved of cash.  I am quite prepared to say that at the moment the greyhound industry is dependent on support from the State.  There is no doubt about that.

The industry has been starved of cash.  Added to that was the worst depression any of us has witnessed so we did not have money to invest in marketing and promotion.  We did not even have money to invest in an executive.  In 2011, when I came on board, we had a CEO but no CFO or executive.  The business was cash starved and in that context, the CEO was mistress, mother and wife.  Now we have an executive in place and have extra funding.  There has been a pick-up in the economy and there is a very different outlook.  That is not to ignore the fact that we have to pay a settlement and the court costs.  We have legal reports that back up the decision.  Most of us are not legal people so we employed the best legal support we could to advise the board on the best way to deal with this.  In 2010, when this happened, none of the current board or executive was in place.  That is not the dead man's excuse; it is the reality.</p></speech>

The dog was got at in some way and the board must accept that because it would not be paying otherwise.  It must accept that some substance was given to the dog to make sure he came in last.

However, before any moneys are advanced to the Irish Greyhound Board, there is an annual submission to the Department as to what we intend to use those funds for and how we used and disbursed the previous year's funds.</p> <p>  In addition to that, the Department has sought updates from us on how we were to manage the original strategy statement of the Irish Greyhound Board, which was then updated and effectively replaced by the Indecon report last year.  In advance of getting any moneys, those documents had to be provided to the Department.  The Department then requires the greyhound board to submit six-monthly accounts together with six-monthly reports as to our progress.  Those reports must be signed off by the chairman of the board.  On top of that, the Department meets us twice a year to review on a one-to-one or face-to-face basis the commitments made at the start of the year in advance of the moneys being forwarded to us and, obviously, any ongoing issues throughout the year, together with how we are achieving budget targets, as we would have submitted to the Department.</p> <p>  As the chairman, Mr. Meaney, mentioned to the Deputy, in addition to that, the Government arrangements extend such that we are also required to report on an interim basis any unscheduled matters that arise during the course of the year if they are material, either to the financial business or to our regulatory business.  That is what is there in place of a formal service level agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#J00700"><p>I want to ask the officials from the Department about this because I am disturbed to hear the taxpayer will be handing out &euro;14.8 million for the coming year without a formal service level agreement, letters, plans and whatever.  The Chairman will be issuing a recommendation that a formal service level agreement be in place.  I am shocked to hear one does not exist.</p> <p>  I cannot understand how an Accounting Officer in the Department has not learned lessons.  I will not go back to what happened in Punchestown years ago, with money handed out without proper agreements.  There were reports done at length.  Here we are with the same Department handing out &euro;14 million a year for the next number of years and no service level agreement.  The Committee of Public Accounts will not stand over that and will be saying it is not acceptable.  It is not acceptable in any Department to hand out that amount of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  I will ask two or three questions on this.  In relation to the discussion on the subvention - it is called the horse and greyhound fund but I will call it taxpayers' money in case people think it is coming from somewhere else - of &euro;14.8 million the Department is handing out next year and the &euro;13.6 million it handed over this year, would the Department be aware approximately of the settlement that has been referred to in the High Court?  That had to come into its reckoning in some way as needing to be met from the funding.</p> <p>  I had a quick look at the amount of taxpayers' money going into the sector ten years ago.  It is in one of the charts we got.  In 2006, the State was putting in &euro;14 million.  I know the funding dropped down to &euro;11 million, &euro;10 million and whatever.  Total income on those occasions was approximately &euro;50 million, including the taxpayers' amount.  Therefore, the taxpayer was subventing the industry to the tune of approximately 28% of its income.  The chairman, Mr. Meaney, states the income has gone down and there has been an cumulative drop but the amount of the board's income coming from the taxpayer is increasing as a percentage of its income each year.  In 2014, the accounts show total turnover from racing activities as &euro;25 million and the taxpayer put in &euro;11 million.  That was a significant proportional increase in the Department's costs.  Next year, the Department proposes to give &euro;14.8 million.  Mr. Gleeson should be able to tell us whether the Department has a ballpark figure of what is a right amount for the taxpayer to be putting into the industry as a percentage of its total income?  As I said, it seems to be increasing.</p> <p>  In view of that, I would look at the governance of this.  The organisation, as Mr. Nealon recommended, could not exist without taxpayers' money.  We accept that is the case.  There is not a representative of the Department on the board.  Given that such a large proportion of the expenditure and income involved in Bord na gCon is taxpayers' money, the structure needs to change so that there is somebody there monitoring this and representing the Accounting Officer in the Department.  Essentially, the Department is handing it over to an independent company.  Not finding any fault with it, I am merely saying to protect the taxpayers' interest, the Minister should have a representative there to watch that.</p> <p>  Has Mr. Gleeson any observations on what was taken into account in how the Department arrived at the &euro;14.8 million figure?  Approximately, how many are employed in the greyhound sector because there has to be some connection between how much the taxpayer is putting into a sector and how many people are benefiting?  The following is a simplistic and probably unfair figure but the only one I can get from looking at the figures today is that there are 110 full-time staff in the organisation, although the organisation hires extra staff for catering for race meetings.  I do not even like to say it but that amounts to approximately &euro;124,000 per annum for those employed in the organisation but the staff in the organisation is only a fraction of the number in the industry.  Can Mr. Gleeson tell me the basis on which the Department arrived at this &euro;14 million, how many people in the industry is the Department supporting with this grant and how much per person in the sector is the taxpayer subventing it?</p></speech>

In the context of the settlement, it is not true to say that we knew what the settlement was, even in ballpark terms, when the Estimate was agreed.  That is not the case.  Obviously, we have had a report on it and there is a ballpark figure there now which we assume will have to be accrued in the 2015 accounts in the normal way.</p> <p>  Second, in terms of the overall financial position of the industry, clearly we have a concern.  We know the chairman, the board and the chief executive have a concern about the financial status of the industry.  When one looks at the subvention that has been given in the past, the grant to the board went from &euro;15.2 million in 2008 to &euro;10.8 million in 2014 and that came at a time when attendances were falling, when tote income collapsed and when all the impacts of the economic downturn came as well.  The board found itself in a very difficult position.</p> <p>  There has always been support for this sector from the State and successive Governments have felt it was worthwhile.  Our figures, in terms of employment, are approximately 10,000 people in employment and-----</p></speech>

I am sure that is the widest possible definition but it is 10,000 people.  Our figures show &euro;0.5 billion of turnover in the rural economy.  That is the figure we have.  That is the basis for justifying any State intervention in the sector.  The chairman has already said, and it is true to say, that if the sector did not need State support, it would not be given it.  That is a given.</p><p>Against the background of concerns about income dropping and other concerns, the Minister commissioned Indecon to produce a report on the sector.  It was published in 2013.  There was a range of recommendations in it, including on governance, regulation and the financing of the industry.  There was recognition that something had to change in terms of financing the industry.  It was a long report.  There were three main pillars to the recommendations on improving finances.  One was that the board would have to dispose of assets because it was burdened with a significant debt that was eating up resources that might otherwise have been put into the sector.  To an extent, this is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy because, in order to develop the sector, one needs to be putting money into prize money, stadiums and developing new products.  However, if one's sources of funding, from the State or commercial revenue, dry up, it has a negative impact on that.</p><p> The first part of the Indecon report suggested something really had to be done about bringing down the debt.  The only realistic way of making a really significant impact on that was the sale of assets.  There were a few proposals in the report.  They were not necessarily prescriptive but there were suggestions as to what assets might be sold.  The second recommendation concerned the development of new streams of income and new products.  The chairman and chief executive will know more about that than I do.  They have already described progress in that regard.  The third point was that there was a significant number of non-performing stadiums.  It was recommended that something be done to calibrate the cost of those stadiums to the income deriving from them.  That probably meant reducing the number of races and making sure the expenditure in non-performing racecourses did not exceed the income derived from them.  Those are the three strands of that income piece.</p><p> The chief executive has described the kind of governance arrangement within the Department.  Obviously, the board and chairman have their own responsibilities, and we have responsibilities also.</p><p> Reference was made to the presence of a departmental person on the board.  That is an arguable point.  It is not in the legislation.  We will be drafting a Bill.  We have begun to draft the heads of a Bill to respond to some elements of the Indecon report.  The Bill will deal with some aspects of governance and deal with regulation.  It might introduce mandatory penalties for offences such as doping.  The board composition is a policy decision and I cannot elaborate on it.  However, if the committee has a view on the composition of the board, we would all have to take it into account in the context of redrafting the legislation.</p></speech>

We do have corporate governance structures that are quite formalised.  We meet twice per year on the performance.  The board submits a strategic plan to us, which we examine.  Recently, we have developed a letter of shareholder expectation.  We have done it for another State agency as a preliminary draft.  Our intention is to draft a similar document for all our State agencies, including Bord na gCon.  I accept it might be better if the agreement had been in place long ago but, in any event, we have embarked on that kind of road with another agency.  Our intention is to use that vehicle across all the agencies.  That will fulfil the requirements the Vice Chairman is talking about.</p></speech>

It is good to put that figure on the record.  That is how I translate the &euro;14.8 million.  It is divided among 10,000 people, with approximately &euro;1,500 going to everybody who has a dog and who goes to the races.  The taxpayer is essentially giving money to everybody involved.  Mr. Phil Meaney might state whether this is a fair analysis.  He can understand the global picture.</p></speech>

A point I would like to add is that most of the jobs are in rural areas.  If they were to go, they would not be easily replaced at the moment.  The economists tell us that every 1,000 people who move from employment to being dependent on State subsidies cost approximately &euro;20 million.  The economist Jim Power came up with that figure in 2011.  The number in the industry may have contracted a little since 2011.  However, even if 7,000 or 8,000 were to go on the dole as a result of State funding not being in place and the greyhound industry going out of existence, it would have a disastrous effect.</p></speech>

There was a chart in the Indecon report on the profitability of the tracks.  It refers to them all and claims there was a loss of &euro;4.296 million in the track income.  I acknowledge there is other income.  I am referring to recommendation No. 8, on the calibration of the number of race meetings in poorly performing stadiums.  Are the delegates saying they have implemented all the key recommendations?  One is currently subject to the levy process.</p> <p>  With regard to recommendation No. 8, on the preparation of key performance indicators for track performance and the review of the racing programme, the delegates have said it has been implemented.  Are they in a position to forward us a copy of the key performance indicators in respect of which they have said the recommendation has been implemented?  That probably threw up what I would call a break-even figure for attendance at a race meeting.  Is it 300 or 400?  I realise it depends on the location but there must be some tracks where the figures speak for themselves.  Do the delegates believe we have the right number of tracks?  I am from Laois and there is no track in my area so I am probably not the most informed.  The delegates have probably worked that out.</p> <p>  Could I have a brief outline on the work on recommendation No. 8?  The delegates might send us some of the documentation that has been prepared consequent to the implementation of that recommendation.  It can be sent to us subsequent to the meeting.</p></speech>

First, as the Acting Chairman pointed out, we have calibrated the number of races.  We have reduced the number of least profitable races at tracks to the effect that we have taken out 89 races from the tracks in the year to date.  Obviously, there are prize money savings in respect of those events.  In addition, because of the way we have targeted and picked the races, we have managed to maintain a performance as close as possible to last year's full performance.  With the additional digital market, we have managed to maintain the level of commerciality.  While we have taken out 8%-----</p></speech>

There was an historical tradition of that happening.  Nobody likes reducing the number of race meetings but, at the same time, there is a level of co-operation among industry stakeholders to improve and better the industry performance.  That is the answer to the first part of the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question related to key performance indicators.  The key performance indicators have been built to analyse the profitability of the tracks, the subvention we are paying per meeting and per spectator, the level of sponsorship generated at track level, and the amount of Tote and commercial profits being made.  Those key performance indicators have been running for 12 months now.</p><p>The analysis arising from them has been very useful in identifying different aspects of performance and what is good and bad on the various tracks.  Different issues arise in respect of the ten IGB tracks and seven privately-run tracks and it gives us an opportunity to investigate them.</p><p> My priority for the next 12 months will be to see how much we can lift the KPIs.  By targeting specific areas of weakness we hope to bolster the entire industry.  Obviously, this is taxpayers' money and there is no guarantee that funding to tracks will continue in the long term.  My priority is to address the weaknesses.  On pulling the tracks up, every time one takes a track out there are repercussions for local industry and, while it might solve commercial issues, it might also severely undermine the dog population in an area.  It is better to see if we can solve the non-performance of tracks and other issues.  A key challenge, given that we are dependent on tracks, is the fact that the tracks are only open for some 16 hours per week.  </p><p> We will go back to the Indecon recommendations and look at what else we can do in terms of alternative sources of income to support what happens on the tracks.  We have completed a joint horse jumping event with Horse Sport Ireland under the Jumping in the City initiative, which was launched in Limerick and also takes in Cork and Shelbourne Park and was very successful.  We are exploring other such options to help bring a completely different audience into greyhound stadia because it is a State resource which is available in key urban locations and which we should be utilising.</p></speech>

My family raised greyhounds when I was growing up so I have a gr&aacute; for it.  I felt a little bit annoyed listening to the opening statements of Ms Larkin and Mr. Meaney.  Those who run the racetracks, who train and own dogs, work very hard to keep the industry going, to keep it competitive and preserve it as a form of entertainment for others but the opening statements we heard today were a little vague and there was nothing in them.  As the Vice Chairman said, some &euro;14.8 million of taxpayers' money has been allocated but Ms Larkin said a key thing to regenerate the industry was to increase the number of dog owners, breeders and trainers.  She said the extra money that had been allocated would go into prize money and additional industry support at grassroots levels and that there would be a serious attempt to put the industry on a sound footing within the resources available.  She also said she would strive to create an industry model which was fit for purpose and sustainable.  She said she was looking at exploring other options but that is all very hazy and fluffy and there is nothing concrete in it.  Can Ms Larkin give me some examples of what she means by "additional industry supports at grassroots levels"?</p> <p>  Mr. Meaney said a lot was happening at board level, the benefits of which may not be immediately apparent but which will have a significant impact in the medium and long term.  What does that mean?  They are just words and there is nothing concrete in that statement.

During 2015 the Irish Greyhound Board conducted an extensive consultation at grassroots level.  We started with our own front-facing staff, the people referenced by the Deputy in her opening remarks, and we asked them how we could bolster the industry.  We extended the discussion to the directors of all tracks and this culminated in the circulation of a document for public consultation.  The document posed a number of options as to how we might grow ownership and invest in the industry.  It discussed bolstering syndication, the leasing of greyhounds to new and upcoming syndicates and targeting prize money.  It put out a number of options to industry stakeholders but the the money available to the Irish Greyhound Board was quite limited at the time, it being mid-2015.  Nevertheless, we received a number of comments from stakeholders.  The comments differed widely, as one might expect.  Some felt we should support syndication while others felt that doing so should not be at the expense of the owner, who supports the industry on an ongoing basis, and that one group should not get preferential treatment over another.  Others felt the current funding arrangements could be broadened and made more equitable.  That is just a flavour of the comments we received.</p> <p>  The announcement in the budget of an additional &euro;1.2 million is a significant game changer for us in terms of what we can do.  In the past 12 months the Irish Greyhound Board ran over 16,000 races, which will give members an idea of the population involved in dog racing.  Of that 16,000, half of the dogs were in the mid-grades - between A2 and A6 - and one of the considerations for us is whether to target one such group with additional funding or whether to provide an increase in funding across the board.  Another alternative would be to replace earlier cuts to prize money.  We are working through these three very different concepts and there are other possibilities, such as paying run money to placed dogs to directly subvent the costs associated with bringing a dog to racing.  There are possibilities around racing clubs and around various breeding incentive schemes.  There are myriad options and we have prepared initial costings on all of them.  Our intention is for the entire board to consult, in the middle of December, with the various industry representatives who have engaged in the process in the past months, either by written submission personal representation.  The objective will be to increase pools and attendance because if we can increase ownership those owners will also attend stadia, which will have a knock-on effect on the Tote and our food and beverage offerings.  We have &euro;1.2 million and we need to spend it wisely to ensure that, with the industry input, we get the best return for our money.</p><p>I was conscious of keeping my opening statement brief but this is the thinking behind my remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil Meaney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#M00200"><p>Like Ms Larkin, I was conscious of keeping my statement as short as possible.  We live in the industry every day, and I can see how what we said could seem to be vague, but we did not mean to be vague in any shape or form.  A number of major issues have been dealt with in 2015.  The two main High Court cases predated the executive and the present board members.  A huge amount of time over recent years has gone on dealing with them and getting them behind us.  I accept what Deputy Fleming said.  While there is a cost, I am delighted they have been dealt with.</p> <p>  The deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme has used up a lot of time.  We are at the consultative stage and having it dealt with is very important to me.  The executive, with the support of the board, has put in place a deal with our bankers which is very important for any organisation.  Disposal of core or non-core assets is a big issue and we accept Indecon's recommendation.  During 2015, we have disposed of the old head offices of the IGB on Henry Street in Limerick.  This, along with other income we generated, will allow us pay down debt to the bank in 2015 for the first year since I got involved.</p> <p>  As I alluded to earlier, most of the executive, including the CEO, only came on board in 2014.  All board members, with the exception of one, are new and none of the executive was in place when I came on board in 2011.  The point I am making is that we now have a good executive with new blood on the board.  We have a bit of cash we did not have before.  This is a platform to kick on, which we did not have over the past four years in which I have been involved in the industry.</p></speech>

It has declined at varying rates each year since then.  We have changed completely the commercial strategy and the commercial operations with regard to how we approach this.  When I first started in mid-2013, commercial operations as they were and the commercial strategy were not fit for purpose.  We had a homogenous approach to the market in that we sold the product and racing on the back of the Irish Greyhound Board brand.  What we have done since, following research, is have a local market-based strategy to promote the stadia in each of their local markets, within a drive time of 45 to 50 minutes, assuming this is the maximum distance anybody will drive for a night out with regard to cost and time.  We have also launched <i>www.gogreyhoundracing.ie</i>and put in place a consumer facing racing brand rather than the IGB brand.  We separated IGB as a corporate entity and put in place a consumer infrastructure.<br/><br/>We have completely changed our digital infrastructure and we have upskilled our digital expertise.  All of our activities are dovetailed between advertising, digital activity, social media and social platforms.  We are trying to expose the industry and sport to the widest possible audience because the biggest opportunities with regard to getting leisure and racing consumers back to the tracks are with people aged between 18 and 35 years.  In the year to date, the average attendance per meeting in the IGB tracks increased by between 6% and 8%.</p><p>The position with Christmas bookings, in terms of the sales cycle this year compared to the sales cycle for the same period last year, is that we are up 18%.  Our digital strategy is part of the overall strategy.  It is about acquisition of customers and retention.  The next phase, having put in place that infrastructure, is to put in place loyalty technology and loyalty marketing.</p><p> Let us consider the journey we have come from.  We had a situation where we had a database of 100,000 customers.  It was non-compliant, in multiple formats and was effectively unusable.  The marketing department and our outside digital people have now worked through that.  We now have a functioning database of over 60,000 people.  To that database we have sent over 400,000 promotional e-mails so far this year.  That part of the journey involved putting in place the jigsaw to get to the point where we can actually put in place loyalty marketing, which is a speciality in its own right.  A tender document has gone out.  There is a two-piece approach.  The first is to ensure we have the correct strategic direction for it.  The last thing we want to do is pick a model or infrastructure that does not work, does not deliver or does not give us a return on investment.  We are taking a two-phase approach.  The first phase is to establish the strategic direction and the second relates to how that implementation is going to work in terms of technology and from a marketing point of view in light of the technology that is in the tracks.</p><p> We have come quite a way in terms of our marketing strategy, commercial operations, processes and strategies.  We are getting to the point where we have the most up-to-date contemporary tools in place to promote the leisure and racing markets.  We are also using food and beverage promotions as tools to drive attendance.</p></speech>

I am conscious of my time.  My last question relates to procurement.  We keep coming back to the &euro;14.8 million of taxpayers' money.  It is our job to ensure it is wisely spent.  A procurement officer was appointed.  According to our briefing, a procurement officer was appointed in 2013.  My briefing suggests the value of contracts identified by the audit has not been compliant in 2014.  Indeed, it has increased significantly compared to the total number of contracts identified in 2013.  If we now have a procurement officer in place, why has there been no improvement?  Correct me if I am wrong on this aspect.</p></speech>

There may be a little confusion.  The value of the sample looked at in 2013 was smaller.  Proportionately, there was more non-compliance relative to that sample than there was in 2014.

It related to defined benefit pension services.  The chief executive has advised a figure of &euro;388,000.  That item was &euro;149,000 on its own.  The Chairman referred to the advancement made on the defined benefit proposal to address the deficit.  We took a decision at the time to maintain that service provider, which provided information in respect of staff levels and years of service, etc.  Now that the process has reached a conclusion, one part of the defined benefit service has been procured and is going through a deliberative process as we speak.  The second part will be going through procurement post member communication, which will be early in the new year and tender documents are ready to go.  We are simply waiting on member communication to sign off.  From that point of view, the largest portion of the outstanding procurement would be dealt with at that stage.  Our procurement officer has stringent controls.  He approves all invoices.  One of his checks is whether invoices are procurement compliant.  From that point of view he is on top of everything that happens.  It is a commercial, fluid organisation and we endeavour as much as possible to try to get value for money.</p></speech>

However, most of us are out racing on a regular basis and we meet people.</p><p>In the difficult times when people did not have disposable income, having the couple of dogs was no longer possible.  They just did not have the income to support them.  I also think we were forced to cut prize money for a number of reasons.  That is what we are working on.  Again we are meeting all stakeholders in the early part of December with a view to seeing exactly where we should spend the money to get those people back and to get new people through syndication, ownership and encouraging young people to go into training.  It is very hard to pin down and say the reason people left the industry was X, Y or Z.  There are myriad reasons people left the industry, the same as maybe left horseracing.  There is a broad spectrum of reasons.</p></speech>

Over the course of the recession the number of owners has halved effectively.  That then has a knock-on effect in terms of the economic performance of the tracks because they are the people who come more frequently.  Earlier the CEO alluded to the fact that she has had a consultative document in terms of how the organisation is going to increase the number of owners.  Through that there will be the direct engagement on strategy to people in terms of increasing ownership and also then endeavouring to bring those who have moved out of the industry back into it.</p> <p>  I suppose in terms of those who have moved out, one has those who may have an older age profile.  One also has people who have been affected by the recession and who have emigrated.  So it is quite a mix of people who will have left.  As part of that process there would be direct engagement in terms of how one expands the base of owners which in turn pump-primes the supply chain.  It would help the trainers, help the breeding because one has more owners, more demand for dogs.  That is a critical part of it which is being worked on at the moment.</p></speech>

Bookmakers are not getting any younger.  If one looks at the bookmakers at the track, they would probably be there for ten, 20 or 30 years.  Trying to get new guys in is very difficult and it is also part of the split - I call it upstairs-downstairs.  The downstairs is the traditional greyhound man - the owners and trainers.  They really are with the bookmakers.  Upstairs are those with corporate groups or on a night out etc.  They bet with the Tote.  They are there for a good night out and they are going to bet with the Tote.</p> <p>  In essence there are two tracks that are working very well in terms of 50:50 with the Tote.  Shelbourne Park would be stronger from the bookmaker point of view.  Kilkenny would be very strong with bookmakers as opposed to the Tote.</p> <p>  Attracting new bookmakers in is very difficult, but one of the things we have seen is the new television trial we are doing at the moment with Turf TV.  We are using bookmakers in the UK, and betting shops in the UK and Ireland.  The bookmakers at those tracks which are offering very competitive odds, which is in line with the UK and Ireland, are seeing an upturn in turnover from the on-course traditional bookmaker.  It would be very difficult to get traditional bookmakers and I do not see any growth in that area.  As I said, the age profile of a traditional bookmaker must be late 50s or early 60s, similar to the UK.  The UK has the same problem.  One has 2.7 bookmakers per BAGS, Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service, and they are struggling to get bookmakers.  One needs three bookmakers at the track to form an SP for the UK.  I do not know how one resolves that bit of it.  One of the ways of resolving it, I suppose, is getting more people into tracks.  Take Galway, Johnny Morris would have been a good bookmaker at Galway track.  More people come downstairs.  One gets that type of bookmaker back.</p></speech>

As with many other industries, now is the first time the board has had an opportunity to be strategic and to look where we are going.  Things are not going to improve overnight.  If the Chairman decides to bring us back in here next year, it is not going to be all bells and whistles from where I am sitting.  There is going to be a gradual improvement over the next five years by getting people back into the industry.  I am old enough to have seen this before where the greyhound industry takes a dip and then it comes back up again.  There is no doubt we have taken a dip, a hammering, but slowly it is going to build back up.</p> <p>  Do I see the industry being able to survive without State support in five years?  Honestly, no.  I would not at this stage be able to state the number of people involved for the kind of industry it is.  For example, it has not been mentioned today that a huge number of clubs and organisations up and down the country through the medium of greyhound racing raise a huge amount of money annually.  It is very hard to put a figure on that, but I would say it could be anything between &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million.</p> <p>  For example, Kerry county board's main fundraising in the year is a big night at the dogs in Tralee.  In Kilkenny, where I live, there is an organisation, BEAM, for people who need support.  It is their biggest fundraiser.  Even though it is a very small track, annually they raise &euro;35,000 and they have done that for the past 20 years.  To look at the greyhound industry purely in the context of the taxpayer putting in &euro;14.5 million or &euro;14.9 million is unfair.  One needs to look at it in the context of the employment it gives, of the social side of it for community and for older people, and also for the amount of money it allows people to raise for very worthy causes.  It may be not always very worthy; I think sometimes political parties might even use it.  However, in general it is for very worthy needs.</p></speech>

Many of the issues have been dealt with pretty thoroughly, but it is still a very bleak picture that a debt of &euro;21 million was incurred in respect of the Limerick Greyhound Stadium project and that there were net borrowing levels of between &euro;10 million and &euro;11 million from 2006 to 2008, which are now double that sum.  Revenue has reduced from &euro;63.5 million in 2006 to &euro;28.2 million in 2013, a fall of 56%.

I can say that one of the cases relates to a property transaction that dated back to 1996 which came to light in the very recent past.  The other is a personnel matter that I would prefer not to deal with here.  The legal fees over recent years, which is all I can comment on, have been dominated by the three High Court cases settled a few weeks ago.  The legal fees are very much orientated towards those three cases.  The resolution of those cases will significantly reduce what we have been paying in legal fees over recent years.</p></speech>

The most recent statutory instruments that we concluded were instruments to allow us to publish adverse analytical findings once an animal has tested positive.  Heretofore, we could not publish the fact that we had got an adverse finding from the laboratory until the entire disciplinary matter had concluded.  With effect, from 1 October, the board is now in the position to be able to publish that at the same time as it notifies the owner or trainer of the adverse finding.  This brings much greater transparency into our regulation.  On top of that, the statutory instrument is constructed in such a way as to ensure that the dog that has had an adverse finding is suspended from racing until such time as that dog returns a clear test again.  That is a very significant advancement in terms of racing greyhounds and ensuring a level playing pitch for all racing greyhounds.</p></speech>

How come Bord na gCon has not dealt with this huge hiatus or gap that exists?  Athletes expect to be tested during their training session.  I imagine that the same should apply to animals that will contest races.  The public will bet on them and there will be prize money.  If there is no testing during the period in which the animal trains then there is no off-track testing, effectively.  That means that we just do not know what type of animal is coming into the kennels for racing.  When does Bord na gCon expect to deal with the matter?</p></speech>

It has been outlined already that the board is in the process of putting it up for sale.  What is the justification for the sale?  It is the second stadium in Dublin and is more a local than a national stadium.  It is a stadium where a night out at the dogs takes place on a regular basis.  On my side of the city it is treated as virtually a northside stadium.  I cannot understand, considering that the stadium is profitable, why Bord na gCon should sell it to defray debts incurred in Limerick.  This is Dublin and that is Limerick.  Surely a reasonable analysis of the situation would not require the elimination of a second stadium in Dublin which is profitable, local and availed of by the ordinary punter.  I know the financial problems that Bord na gCon faces but selling a profitable stadium is not the answer to a financial problem.</p></speech>

It does not make sense to have two management teams and two sets of grounds staff.  In terms of the people in Harold's Cross and the people of Dublin, whether they are northside or southside, the greyhound enthusiasts have to be looked after.  I would very much be one of the people who would suggest that when we rationalise by bringing the whole business together in Shelbourne Park, the people that go to Harold's Cross are looked after.  It is very hard to justify the two tracks.  Traditionally, and let me make this point, Harold's Cross was the Dublin man's track and maybe Shelbourne Park was the Croke Park of greyhound racing.  The greyhound population in Dublin is much smaller than it was.  They have to be looked after and they should be looked after but it can all be done in the context of one super stadium.</p></speech>

In that regard, earlier this year, as part of the Dublin City Development Plan, we made a submission to the Dublin City Council for a change in zoning of the Harold's Cross lands.  That submission was considered by the executive and members of Dublin City Council in October.  While there was support from the executive, the public representatives sought further information in terms of the proposals.  Indeed, some other public representatives were of the view that the lands should remain on a leisure basis.  From our perspective, we are now in the process of preparing a further and additional information to submit both to the Dublin City Council and, indeed, to all the local representatives outlining how we see this site might be used alternatively were it to get the zoning.</p></speech>

We could still dispose of the land with its current zoning and current valuation.  In the event that we do that, as the Deputy rightly pointed out at the start, there remains a significant amount of debt to be addressed.  In those circumstances, the IGB would be forced to look at other assets that it holds.  That would become a very difficult decision because the sale of any assets in our ownership and control, outside of Dublin, will impact on the local greyhound industry and will have a detrimental effect on the greyhound pool in that area.  The priority for the present is to continue to engage with Dublin City Council, local representatives and local Deputies.</p></speech>

Whether accepted or rejected, one way or another, the matter is likely to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I presume Bord na gCon would pursue the issue.  However, if the submission is refused, the land will have very little value in the long term, unless it is rezoned or planning permission is granted for its development.  In that case, it would make a very small contribution to reducing the organisation's debts in that area.  Bord na gCon is facing plan B in that respect.  Would it withdraw Harold's Cross stadium from sale if planning permission is not granted?  Has the organisation thought that far ahead?</p></speech>

Ms Larkin referred to there not being enough interest in Dublin.  There is not enough interest anywhere.  Attendance figures have been in decline at every single stadium.  This is an<i>ex-post facto</i>justification for the sale of Harold's Cross stadium.  It may well be the case that Bord na gCon will get little or nothing for the stadium, leaving the organisation with its debt of almost &euro;21 million.

I never lobbied for the position.  I make that quite clear and put it on the record.  That is part of the reason I am disappointed the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine did not take me in.  I am prepared to stand by my record prior to coming into Bord na gCon.</p></speech>

I am saying that it is a great pity that a prominent member of Fine Gael was interviewed by a Fine Gael Minister and given the job without any vetting procedure whatsoever.  The Government-dominated Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine does not want to interview Mr. Meaney.  He is sitting here not subject to the procedures to which other members of the board, which we have gone through, were subjected.</p></speech>

Before the Minister or both Ministers decided that all board appointments to the Irish Greyhound Board should be through PAS, I recommended that.  I am wholeheartedly in favour - and I can only talk about Bord na gCon - of the process being through PAS.  While the Deputy points out that I am a member of a certain political party, my answer to that is that I would rather see anyone being something than being nothing.  I have not brought politics to the greyhound board and politics did not enter it when the five people were being appointed recently.  We want the best people we can get on the board.  That is my position.  What colour they are is something somebody else has to deal with.</p></speech>

Does he not think it had anything to do with his appointment?</p></speech>

Deputy Ross might ask the people who appointed me.  Financially and in every other way, my appointment to Bord na gCon has been a limiting factor to me.  Deputy Ross seems to be of the opinion that this was a big scalp for somebody.  It was not for me.  The past four years in Bord na gCon have been very difficult.  I came into a situation where there was no executive.  I had come from an organisation that was very well organised and was working in a very functional way.  There was no executive in place.  To get things done through a public company is not like a private company.  We had to put a strategy in place.  What I am trying to say is that it took a while to put an executive in place.  All board members have been changed since I came in except one.</p></speech>

I do not know where Deputy Ross is coming from.  I did not lobby for the job.  I have taken it on.  I put approximately 30 hours a week into it and I have tried to make an industry that was struggling in a difficult time work along with what I regard as a very good board.

I am saying it is a political appointment.  I am saying that the fact Mr. Meaney is such a prominent member of Fine Gael was a material factor in it.  I am saying that Mr. Meaney has not gone through the normal vetting process that everybody else has to go through and that it is an unacceptable procedure.  I am not saying Mr. Meaney is incompetent, I am just saying the procedures are utterly incompetent and wrong and that he is a political appointee and a member of the political party in power.  That is what happens regularly.  Mr. Meaney is just one of many but he is one and he is in a very strong position as a result.  It is a pity that happened.  That is what I am saying.</p></speech>

We came here today to talk about Bord na gCon, the 2014 accounts, the setting up of a new executive and where we stand.  It is of no significance what is my political persuasion.  The Deputy has my permission to ask any board member or executive member whether I have ever brought politics into the IGB.  While I may have had a joke with the Chairman earlier about political parties raising finances at greyhound stadia, I presume he realises that was with tongue in cheek.  I do not bring politics to the greyhound board and when I say I do not allow anybody else to do it, that is not quite accurate.  Nobody brings politics.  Our remit is to try to turn this industry around.  It is not about who put us there or how we got there.  I will say it again in conclusion: I was willing - at every stage and I still am - to go through any process that I am asked to.</p></speech>

I have told the Deputy that, on average, I spend approximately 30 hours a week in the industry.  Obviously, not all of that is spent at board meetings.  We meet sponsors.  I will refer to the point raised about ETS.  At the time, we found it difficult to secure a sponsor for the Irish Derby.  The largest offer was approximately &euro;50,000.  As a board, we decided to go with ETS on the understanding it would pay &euro;50,000 before the race commenced.  It was as good as any other offer.  Luckily enough, we found a good sponsor after that, who is in it for the long haul.</p></speech>

Taking key positions in State bodies such as his is regarded by many, in particular by me, as being a reward for showing loyalty to a party in power.  The fact that he did not go through the procedure, despite the fact that he had made applications, is a reflection more on the party than him, his membership thereof or his behaviour therein.  It should have asked him to appear for vetting and approval.  I am ready to admit that I am not qualified to question what he has done in IGB, but I am unhappy about the method through which he was appointed.  His membership of and loyalty and service to Fine Gael were material factors in that regard.</p></speech>

It is probably true that, had Fianna F&aacute;il in its old construction been in power, Mr. Meaney would not have been appointed, but that is a reflection more on Fianna F&aacute;il than on anyone else.  What it did in appointments left much to be desired.  Let me be clear on that point.  During its long period in government it set in train the practice of awarding or rewarding its own, which is not the way to construct a board or appoint someone to a position such the one Mr. Meaney occupies.</p> <p>  I also say with some regret that, despite the announcement made by the Government that it would depart from this practice, it has not done so to any great extent.  The day people are appointed because of their willingness to serve and commit to a board on the basis of their abilities must be reached soon.  That is the ideal.  Civil servants in Departments observing the dynamic or tension there should be between Ministers and the Civil Service should have this as their value.  We should be reaching beyond the political system and the norm in appointing people.  Unfortunately, we have not distanced ourselves from the culture of appointing insiders.  We need only consider some of the committees in the Houses and who is advising them to know that, generally, it is the usual suspects.</p> <p>  I will say something about Mr. Meaney's case, not because he is from Carlow-Kilkenny but because I knew him as a businessman previously.  He has a track record, not only in terms of his membership of Fine Gael but of running a successful business.  He is an individual with integrity.  I have no doubt that he is attempting to make a contribution to the organisation in question that is in the best interests of transparency, accountability and so on, which is welcome.  The only thing that would have held me back from appointing him was the fact that he was from Carlow-Kilkenny and I might have been accused of supporting one of my own.  I might have been willing to appoint him because of his credentials.  Deputy Shane Ross's point is about an individual's credentials.  Unfortunately, that process for selecting various State appointees was not in place when Mr. Meaney was appointed, although it is now.  That is regrettable, as Mr. Meaney displayed in his correspondence to the committee in question that he would have liked to have appeared before it for no other reason than to explain his qualifications.  This committee spent four and a half hours one day discussing the issues of office accommodation and toilet rolls.  I was happy to appear before it at that meeting and account for myself.  It might be no harm if other Chairmen or Ministers did likewise.  Deputy Shane Ross gave his opinion and I am giving mine.  I respect the job being done.  As he stated, this is not personal.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a number of questions about IGB.  Its revenue decreased from &euro;63 million in 2006 to &euro;28 million in 2013.

We are going to leverage efficiencies from broadband as well.  That will help us.  IT in 2013 would not have been fit for purpose as it was five to eight years old.  We have to replace it.  We have a choice point as to whether we spend capital to replace all the servers or go with a hosted, managed service.  After a tender process, the latter was awarded to Eircom.  Again, although it hits the profit and loss account as opposed to being a capital expenditure, it was the right decision.  It gives us a great deal of security.  One hears about hacking and we have third parties to manage all of that for us.  It has more flexibility and we are able to expand as and when we can and everything is now in the cloud.  I hope to leverage savings from this going forward as the market catches up and competitiveness increases.</p></speech>

How can you enter into a confidentiality agreement when you know you cannot have confidentiality?  You are breaking the law and telling them lies, because in 12 months' time it will be in the public domain.  Not you, but whoever gets involved in it.  Something has to change around that in terms of the State and its approach to all of this.  It happens with different Departments and agencies and it is not acceptable.  It has to change.  Perhaps it is a recommendation the committee might consider in due course.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  Second, can Mr. Meaney not tell us, in terms of the three cases, at the end of all of this, without breaching confidentiality on any one case, how much it sets you back and how you deal with it?

If one looks at the Indecon report it reads like something that should be done in business anyway and there is nothing in it if you had a company that acknowledged how business should be done, how one would want to do it and was open and transparent and so on.  The Indecon report sets that out.  What was it within Bord na gCon that did not allow the organisation to comply with best practice with the result that we are at this hearing before this committee?  Why did sensible people in the industry not understand, even before they went to Indecon, that something had to be done?</p></speech>

I believe the most important thing to come out of the Indecon report is that every stakeholder, whether it was the Minister, the Department officials or the board at the time, all had their own interpretation.  We all knew something had to be done and most of us knew exactly what had to be done.  Since Indecon put it in a report we are now all working in the one direction.  That is very important.</p></speech>

It has been a layered consultation with the various stakeholders.  The announcement in the budget of the extra &euro;1.2 million necessitates further consultation and further exchange based on the findings from earlier in the year.</p> <p>  With regard to the additional costs associated with microchipping and the requirements for vaccinations, Bord na gCon organised a number of clinics in 2014 and 2015 to facilitate dog owners who wished to have their greyhounds vaccinated and microchipped and ready for export.  Those sessions were arranged to minimise costs for owners and breeders.  There is recognition that the extra legislative requirements are putting costs onto the industry as a whole, not just on breeders.</p></speech>

A road map is in place in the Indecon report.  As the Chairman said, they are the normal business arrangements that should be in place.  However, the report has galvanised the industry.  We are satisfied that Bord na gCon is implementing it.  In order to move itself away from this very difficult financial position, something must be done about reducing the debt.  There are various strands to the work, of which the sale of assets is a very significant strand.  We cannot see a mechanism to reduce the debt through the normal business processes without significant asset sales.</p></speech>

No matter what one does, there are a small number of people who will always find difficulty.  I will give an example of a contentious issue which arose when I became involved in the board and which proved to me what we were dealing with.  The board was faced with a decision on whether we should race on Good Friday and decided to do so.  I was born in the 1950s and would find it difficult to say whether we should have raced.  However, I always believe in going with the combined wisdom.  We raced at four of our major venues on Good Friday.  We received letters of congratulations saying it was right to give people the opportunity, while on the other side, a small number of people preached hell fire.  No matter what we do, we will please some people and displease others.  Such is the industry we are in and we must try to work with the majority.</p></speech>

The response Bord na gCon published on 10 October 2014 detailed the action point "Developing co-mingling contracts and income streams" and stated, "William Hill and other similar agreements secured, contracts ongoing".  Another action point is "Conclude negotiations with TV providers" and the completion date is "quarter 4 2014 and ongoing".  That was at the end of last year.  The chart on page 11 of the document indicated the projected financial improvement from the review of tote operations would be &euro;608,000 in 2015, &euro;461,000 in 2016 and &euro;92,000 in 2017.  The projected income from international co-mingling, television sales and other related wagering opportunities was &euro;600,000 in 2015, to drop off to &euro;30,000 in 2017.  Will Mr. Lewins explain this?  Is it a one-off, up-front payment?  Why is so much income coming in from it?  How much of the &euro;600,000 has been received so far and what is expected to be received by the end of the year?  Why is the figure to drop off from &euro;600,000 to &euro;30,000 in two years?</p></speech>

According to the initial Indecon report, the majority of the &euro;600,000 was to come from television sales through being able to sell our product to the United Kingdom and Ireland through the betting shops, the retail estate.  There has been a significant lag, given that we did not reach the trial basis until 1 September this year.  They wanted to trial it for a number of reasons.  They wanted to establish whether we could deliver what we said we could and whether we could offer the retail industry the margins it was used to in the United Kingdom, which was the biggest market.  The major players did not want to buy the product until they saw it.  We have just concluded the 12-week trial, albeit much later than anticipated.  We had anticipated that it would be finished earlier in the year.  We are in negotiations to conclude contracts with the hope the revenue we first thought we would get in 2015 will materialise in 2016.  In effect, we are one year behind.</p><p>That is fine.  When we get these lovely reports, I get worried.  This is an Indecon report and this is the Bord na gCon response.  We were given dates.  We have one month to go in 2015 and there is this &euro;600,000.  It was mentioned earlier that much of that &euro;600,000 would come through this year but now Mr. Lewins is saying it is not happening this year.</p></speech>

I have not read it all but I read all about this income, tote operations and &euro;400,000 next year but nobody is telling me it is only 7% in reality to Bord na gCon.  There appears to be a big gap for a person who is not an insider reading that documentation.  That is all I am saying.  I refer to the document the witnesses gave us on the IGB response to recommendations made within the Indecon report.  When I go to section 9, development of Bord na gCon information technology, I see that it is been implemented and that development of co-mingling has been implemented.  One would think this was all done and dusted but the witnesses are now telling me that when we probe this, Bord na gCon is completing a trial stage.</p></speech>

The development of co-mingling has been built.  We built the platform and the IT infrastructure to allow us to co-mingle with different parts of the world.  That, in effect, has been built but the difficulty with co-mingling is that one has to depend on third parties within the overall system.  We have agreed a contract, as the chairman alluded to, with some iconic companies 12 or 13 months ago.  They had to build their infrastructure and they are not in a position bed into our system yet so they are holding us up as opposed to the other way around.</p></speech>

The last line is interesting that in order to complete its work by the end of 2016, a request has been made for funding of &euro;3 million.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach mentioned that this investigation could possibly take eight years.  Lets do the maths.  If that is the case, or even close to it, given that by 2016 an additional &euro;3 million will be involved, then one is talking about serious money if it runs into another seven years beyond that.  It is clear to me that a proper analysis, based on the estimates with regard to how long this could take, has not been conducted.

I intend to raise the issue with the officials next week as to what controls are in place once a bank sells its loan into Cerberus.  What is the attitude of the Department of Finance and the State to protecting businesses that are working with the banks but are unable to work with Cerberus because it is demanding full payment of a loan upfront, when in fact it is a distressed business?  It will close businesses.  In one case, there are 40 jobs involved.  I am expressing my deep concern about its attitude and will raise the issue next week.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Jean-Pierre Th&eacute;bault" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his invitation today to discuss the recent terror attacks in Paris.  It is a valued opportunity to engage and answers questions.</p> <p>  On Friday, 13 November in Paris and Saint-Denis, France was hit by a series of attacks orchestrated from Syria by the armed terrorist group Daesh.  The scale and level of organisation of the attacks were exceptional and it is the worst such event in France since the Second World War.  Beyond France, beyond the 17 nationalities represented among the 130 casualties and 350 wounded, one of them being an Irish citizen, the target was clearly Europe's security and fundamental values.  The attacks targeted a multicultural capital, Paris, and struck at the heart of Europe.  Daesh was targeting European security and European citizens in general.  Daesh's claim of responsibility on 14 November mentioned two European countries in particular, France and Germany.  Since then, it has clearly confirmed that all countries sharing the same values and orientations are its targets at any time.  The mass attacks perpetrated by the same group in Beirut and Tunis exemplify that this terror organisation does not intend to stop but intends to wage a global and continuous war.</p> <p>  On behalf of the French people, I wholeheartedly acknowledge the mass solidarity and support of the Irish people.  Together with the staff at the embassy and the French community in Ireland, we were overwhelmed by the huge friendship and shared sorrow expressed by the people of Ireland throughout all the country, in each county, each city, each school.</p> <p>  Attacks such as these only reinforce our conviction and determination.  As President Hollande mentioned before the French Parliament last Monday, 16 November, our absolute priority is now to further strengthen the security of our nation and of the European territory, in close co-operation with our European partners and, at the same time, to contribute actively to international peace and security and the security, in particular, of all countries and territories affected or targeted by Daesh mass terrorism, by mobilising all means necessary to uproot the terror organisation at its very source.  So doing, our action will be threefold.  First, there will be a strong military response, in accordance with international law and principles, to an unprecedented act of war.  As stated by President Hollande to the congress of both houses of the Parliament on 16 November, "the acts of war committed were decided, planned and prepared in Syria; they were organised in Belgium, committed on our soil with French complicities."  An immediate strong military response was needed to prevent, as far as possible, Daesh from keeping the initiative.  It was based on international law.  Since its start our response has been entirely based on international law and the relevant provisions of the UN Charter.  Article 51 of the UN Charter states, "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations".</p> <p>  UN Security Council Resolution 2170, unanimously adopted on 15 August 2014, already provided a legal framework to carry out strikes against Daesh.  Since 2014, Iraq has been the victim of an armed aggression on its territory from Daesh which uses the Syrian territory to carry out attacks.  Iraq asked for the help of the international community.  The UN resolution condemned in the strongest terms what it called the "gross, systematic and widespread abuse" of human rights by the Islamic State, Daesh.  It reaffirmed the need to combat, by all means and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, this international terrorism and threat to international peace and security.  More recently, UN Security Council Resolution 2249, adopted 20 November last, provided an additional legal framework.  In his speech before both houses of the French Parliament, President Hollande called for such a resolution to be adopted.  The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted this resolution.  Its very strong formulation provides us with a new legal and political framework to mobilise and unify the entire international community in the recognition of that unprecedented threat and fight against Daesh.  On this basis, France's armed forces carried out more than 300 air strikes targeting command and control posts of Daesh in Syria, effectively restraining the terror organisation in its moves and initiative possibilities.</p> <p>  A unique and co-ordinated alliance against Daesh, representing a united front of the international community against an international threat is, however, more crucial than ever.  We believe there is a need for a coalition of all those who really want to fight against Daesh.  This coalition should pursue the following objectives: avoid any ambiguity about who we are fighting - it is Daesh and the terrorist organisations listed by the UN and not, in any case, the moderate opposition; put an end to all forms of violence against civil populations anywhere in the world and, in particular, in Syria and Iraq where Daesh - a totalitarian organisation - is imposing terror and decimating the populations that have fallen under its control, with mass executions of opponents, prisoners of war, people of different faiths or orientations and women in widely broadcast, scenarised shows of madness; ensure that efforts are genuinely made to start the process needed for a political transition in Syria, according to the Geneva communiqu&eacute;.</p> <p>  We want to build on Resolution 2249, which calls on all member states to take "all necessary measures" against Daesh and determines clearly the threat in the preambular paragraphs, "reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by whomsoever committed".  From that perspective, President Hollande has initiated a round of meetings with our international partners to discuss stepping up co-operation in order to fight against Daesh.  On 23 November last, the President met the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  On 24 November, he met President Obama in Washington.  Yesterday, he met with Chancellor Merkel in Paris.  Tonight, President Hollande will meet President Putin.  These meetings are at an international level but we also need to address what is a direct threat to Europe which requires a strong, swift and closely co-ordinated answer.  First, by its mere nature and scale, the claim made by Daesh that it intentionally targeted the way of life of our countries is clearly a direct challenge to us all.</p><p>Second, we need a swift defence and security answer.  As an immediate reaction in France, a state of emergency was declared and there was an unprecedented mobilisation of our domestic security forces and armed forces, which increased the number of our troops to 10,000, all of which helped boost the security of the nation.  However, these decisions put special pressure on all of our armed forces, intelligence capabilities, the police and the gendarmerie.  France can no longer be alone in taking on such a significant proportion of the commitments that contribute to the security also of all Europeans.<br/><br/>At the Foreign Affairs-Defence Council meeting, which took place on 17 November, France has asked its partners, on the basis of Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union, for two things.  First, their bilateral support, according to their capabilities and international commitments in the fight against Daesh in Iraq or Syria.  Second, <font color="#2F2F2F">increased support for EU or UN-led peacekeeping missions in places where the threat of global terrorism makes it even more important to stabilise these countries.  </font>Consensus about recourse to that article testifies to the solidarity among all Europeans.  It is a strong and unprecedented political move commensurate with the challenges we are facing.  We express our profound gratitude to all our partners.<br/><br/>France is studying all the possible options.  We have initiated a dialogue with the EU Governments and in close co-operation with the UN, when relevant, on the kind of contribution they would be in a position to make within their constitutional framework.  The confirmation yesterday by Chancellor Merkel of a strong German first military support in Mali is among the first substantial moves announced in this framework.<br/><br/>We also need to provide an answer at the level of internal security and justice.  An extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council took place on 20 November.  The conclusions adopted accelerate significantly the implementation of the roadmap adopted during the informal European Council meeting which took place after the terrorist attacks in January.  Those conclusions, in particular, address the following: the question of an EU passenger name record, PNR, with a strong commitment; the fight against firearms traffic; the immediate implementation of systematic and co-ordinated controls at external borders; information exchanges; the financing of terrorism; and the harmonisation of criminal laws regarding terrorism.<br/><br/>We need to cut swiftly and effectively the funding sources of terrorism.  Let us remember that France strongly supported the adoption of the EU Directive No. 4 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing.  The directive has been adopted and we now need to swiftly implement same.  <br/><br/>All of this is going in the right direction but we must act even faster and deeper.  As stressed by French Minister for Finance in the Eurogroup, Michel Sapin, in a special address, we must ensure that every country, especially in the EU, sets up agencies with the appropriate resources to hunt down illegal financial flows.  We must centralise the data collected across the EU and tighten the co-operation between the relevant agencies and intelligence services in order to improve the exchange of information.  We must adapt our monitoring devices to new technologies.  As an example, 90% of financial transactions are currently operated through the SWIFT system and yet we are unable to monitor them.  For the credibility of our fight against terrorism this has to be changed.<br/><br/>We need to act collectively to stop the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters and fighting effectively the hatred propaganda, especially through social media.  Last but not least, we need a global diplomatic solution. <b></b>Neither our efforts nor those of our partners will have their full effect if the regional crises are not dealt with at a political level.  In Syria, the political transition is the only way of bringing all of the Syrians together in a single common objective to secure national unity, the co-existence between all components of the population and the fight against extremism.  In Iraq, the process of national reconciliation is stuck.  Therefore, it is a matter of urgent necessity that the Iraqi authorities adopt without further delay the measures announced by the Abadi Government in the fall of 2014<i>.  </i>In Libya, the rise of Daesh is fostered by a prolongation of the political impasse and the division of the country.  It is a matter of urgent necessity that the Libyan stakeholders sign the agreement that was concluded under the supervision of the UN and establish a government of national unity.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the forthcoming weeks and months will be crucial.  We count on the full mobilisation and solidarity of the French nation and of all European Nations sharing the same values.  Last Thursday, 19 November, the French national assembly almost unanimously adopted the extension of the state of emergency for three months.  It is a strong sign that these measures were taken with full democratic control.  Yesterday, the French Parliament also almost unanimously supported the extension of the French air strikes in Syria, as requested by our law and constitution.  We will express this solidarity tomorrow, Friday, by a national day of remembrance in honour of the victims both in France and abroad.  I will visit David Nolan, the Irish national who was severely wounded in the attack in Paris, to express to him and his family our total support and solidarity.  I wish also to express to Ireland and its people our eternal thanks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#E00200"><p>I reiterate the remarks of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to the French people, through the ambassador, during an earlier debate in the D&aacute;il.  I welcome him to this meeting and thank him for taking the time to not only attend the plenary session of Parliament but to meet with this committee at this difficult time.  It is important in the context of the support of the European Union of its member states that we develop our dialogue even at a time of such great difficulty for the ambassador's country.  I take this opportunity to again express my sympathy to not only the people of Paris but the entire French nation.</p> <p>  It is well recognised that the attack on Paris while specific to that city and the people there was not just an attack on the people of the city of Paris but an attack on France, Europe and the values and freedoms espoused in the French republic.  We must all be at one in our condemnation of what happened.  We now need to focus on how to address not only the fall-out of this attack but how we look to the future.  To this end, there is a requirement on all of us to try to find a way or a path to eliminate the potential for the radicalisation of a certain cohort of citizens of our Union who feel alienated and isolated and thus the urge to participate in terrorist activity with such deadly consequences.  This should not fall to be addressed by the authorities of any one state.  It is an issue of which we must all be mindful.  There are threats that exist, the origins of which reside outside of our borders, but we have a responsibility in so far as we can to address the threat that exists within our own borders.  Taking a negative approach to migration or speaking out against the notion of accepting refugees, as some in the United States have done, is not the answer because the threat lies within.  Perhaps at a later stage we can begin dialogue with the ambassador on what can be done to address the real threat that exists within our own pool of European citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.743" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#E00300"><p>We are meeting on a regular basis with the ambassador under tragic circumstances.  I thank him and his staff, who in terms of the many engagements they are attending on behalf of the French people, are representing them well.  I understand President Hollande was in the thick of the attack in terms of his being at a football match at the time.  What is most impressive and reassuring to us as Irish people and as Europeans, and I am sure to the French people, is President Hollande's sombre, respectful yet authoritative status as he projects to the world how France proposes to address this terrible situation.  From a diplomatic point of view, France is reacting very professionally.  I am sure that is being replicated through all of its embassies around the world.</p> <p>  When we first met I recall congratulating the ambassador on the brave steps being taken by France, on its own, to address terrorism in Africa.  We recently witnessed a repeat of this performance in Bamako, Mali.  I recall that at the time the ambassador was only recently resident here, the French took decisive action on a very important geopolitical basis.</p><p>The aim was to drive these terrorists, who tragically reappeared at Bamako in the last week, back into the north, into the desert and the regions, which made everybody safer.</p><p> Maybe this is not the occasion and maybe the Chairman will arrange a more detailed political discussion with the ambassador, but we are a young country, which is moving rapidly from a monocultural to a multicultural society.  We have mosques now, which were not there when I was a kid.  We have 50,000 Muslims and the census shows they are the fastest-growing religious group in the country.  One has to be conscious that we in Ireland can learn from France's experiences.  Could the ambassador teach us a lesson on how to prevent the ghettoisation of minorities?  Maybe it is appropriate and maybe it is not on this occasion, but the word "Molenbeek" keeps coming up, time and again.  Then there are the issues in Belgium.  Should we start learning lessons from mistakes made regarding the concentration of alienated youth in order to prevent the radicalisation of young people in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.745" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#F00200"><p>I welcome the ambassador.  The main purpose of my words is to be associated with all my colleagues in expressing our sympathy and solidarity with the ambassador, our support for him, and our abhorrence of the shocking events in the ambassador's country recently.  Paris is a very beautiful city.  It is the centre of high culture in our continent.  It has given us tremendous art, music and manifestations of culture and a beautifully free-spirited, happy, liberated city, which is also architecturally splendid.  Such a desecration of the city and its wonderful, gentle people is horrendous and it evokes great feelings of sympathy and solidarity in all of us.  That is the important thing all our colleagues want to say to the ambassador, and it is the reason I and everyone else indicated to speak.  We are horrified by the attacks on his wonderful country and its great people, with its tremendous traditions in terms of enlightenment, democracy and liberty.  It is a horror.</p> <p>  The first thing I want to say to the ambassador is that we all have to support a strong security response.  We all have to pool information and putting resources into a mutually supportive response, right across Europe.  It must also be an instant response.  Any remotely significant intelligence should be shared and there should be absolute mutual co-operation at a security level.  We would have to take a very hard look at the people who have gone to fight in Syria and who are understood to have become radicalised in that process and we would have to look at passports here, at security and at intelligence-gathering in this area.  There has to be a very strong response in that sphere.  The ambassador would be as anxious as any of us to have it on the record that we value our excellent Muslim community and it is not that we support any form of Islamophobia.  The condemnation of Islamophobia and a desire for a very severe, stern and strong response are not mutually exclusive, and we should be unequivocal about that.  The ambassador can take it that he will have absolute support from this country and from all organs of Government and State.  Apart from the fact that we are mutually dependent in this area and we have a mutual interest here, we have an objective horror of what has happened to his wonderful country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#F00300"><p>We have all extended our sympathy.  We could talk about the cultural and historical ties between France and Ireland - our revolutionary past, and our shared views on liberty, equality and fraternity - and the dreadful carnage we witnessed.  We are also conscious that prior to the attacks in Paris there were a number of other attacks - for example, in a Shia area of Beirut, where 40 people were killed.  There was also the Metrojet flight in Sinai, which was again claimed by ISIS or one of its offshoots, in which 219 Russians, four Ukrainians and one Belorussian were killed.</p> <p>  ISIS sees this as a great cultural war, a so-called clash of civilisations, and it is all about division.  It is about division and separation; it is not about unity.  As the ambassador mentioned, now is a time for unity.  They want to isolate Muslims from the rest of us.  They want to stereotype people all over the world.  They were not concerned in the attacks in Paris about whether a person had a religion and who they supported or did not support; they just wanted to kill people.  There is an onus on us.  We can talk about those dreadful scenes, but there is also an onus on us to talk about how we can come together and come up with some solutions to those problems.</p> <p>  One of the clear difficulties is that France was very much at the forefront of support for the refugee crisis.  There is a cartoon that sums it up.  On one side is the European Union with its hand up.  There is a female refugee in the middle, and there is an ISIS person on the other side with their famous knives, about to stick one in the refugee's back.  Does that depict what we are going to do in Europe?  Are we going to stigmatise all those people who are fleeing ISIS?  What do we do about this?</p> <p>  The French President, Mr. Hollande, is to meet with the Russian President, Mr. Putin, this evening.  What is France looking to do?  Is it seeking unity across the board, or to reduce ISIS's military capacity, which everyone wants to see happening?  Is it also about reducing its potential support?  The ambassador mentioned the jihadists coming from Europe and so on.  Is it also about those regimes that have been quietly supporting ISIS in the background and those that are potentially behind the formation or the ideology of ISIS?  When are we going to address that?  There was mention of multiculturalism and so on, and there are ongoing investigations into what is happening, who is behind the attacks, and so on.  So far, French and Belgian people seem to be involved.  What do we do with the societies and the areas in France those young people are coming from?  How do we approach and undermine this ideology that everyone wants to see eliminated?</p></speech>

We extend our deep, heartfelt sympathy to him, as a representative of the people of France, the President and the people of France, and the people of Paris in particular.  It is a very beautiful, peace-loving city, which has given refuge to so many Irish people for so long.  It is a place of refuge, not a place of wholesale murder and mayhem.  To the people who died, their families and the wounded, we extend our deepest sympathy.</p><p>Ultimately, we will have to solve the issue of ISIS or, as it likes to style itself, Islamic State, which reflects its idea that this state has become a reality.  What concerns me is those who are funding Islamic State.  The oil is being sold and the proceeds are being used for the murder of people in France and throughout the world, for example, the recent downing of an airliner.  Without that funding, ISIS would not be able to carry out its threats to international peace and harmony.  The region where all of this is taking place is a troubled one.  The actions of ISIS will affect migrants and refugees.  It is are somehow trying to implicate refugees and suggest that they are a threat, which is not the case.  However, that is the implication.</p><p> This is a deeply complex issue which requires a united approach throughout the world.  It is regrettable that a Russian military jet was shot down by the Turks.  This was not helpful in the context of the fact that they all seem to be working towards one aim, namely, to defeat ISIS-Islamic State.  It will be a long process.  It will not happen overnight.</p></speech>

I accept what he said, namely, that the threat is not only to France but also to Europe and the wider global community.  That is quite true.  There must be a response to a threat because there have been threats from people previously, down through history, which, when left unchallenged, continued.  It is Paris today, it will be London tomorrow and it will be Dublin some other day.  Each city throughout Europe will come under threat at some stage or another.  The ambassador referred to the necessary response in terms of security, co-operation and the exchange of information with a view to dealing with the issue.</p><p>The attacks on Paris were sinister and insidious in the manner in which they were orchestrated.  I listened to the discussion about radicalisation.  One must remember that those in Ireland who feel sufficiently radicalised to travel abroad and, for whatever reason, become involved in a fight in another country may have cultural, historical and other links but they also have choices.  They are not forced to go.  My point is if the global community allows this to continue indefinitely, then there will be a really serious confrontation of a kind unknown heretofore.  My reason for so saying is that these organisations now have considerable wealth at their disposal.  They have access to economic wealth which was not there previously and which comes from more than one source.  The aim of those to whom I refer is to terrorise.  They terrorised viewers sitting in front of their television sets.  The beheading of prisoners in front of a camera is intended to shock and terrorise viewers.  Those involved are doing it effectively and their behaviour leads to more of the same.</p><p>There is a serious danger that the European Union, the United Nations and the global community in general are not awake to what is happening.  There is a vacuum in the Middle East in general.  Unfortunately, the withdrawal from Iraq has left a vacuum, which caused the initial upsurge in this kind of violence.  It is continuing for a long period and it is spreading.  There are bound to be consequences arising from that.</p><p>&quot;<i>Libert&eacute;</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>&eacute;galit&eacute;</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>fraternit&eacute;</i>&quot; would not be the watchwords of those carrying out these acts of terrorism.  The individuals in question do not think in that way.  They are as much a threat to Islam as they are to anybody else.</p><p>There are millions of refugees fleeing the region.  They are fleeing from a variety of difficulties.  One of those difficulties relates to the kind of trouble we saw in Paris only ten days ago.  There will be more of these attacks.  It is up to the global community to respond in a meaningful way.  In saying that, I do not mean by carrying out similar atrocities.  A classic example would be what is happening in Libya.  Recent events in Libya should not have happened at all and there is every reason that the international community should set out to police what is taking place in that country.</p><p>My final point relates to the potential damage to the global economy.  The global economy can be brought to a halt by activities such as we have witnessed in recent times.  I refer to the downing of aircraft and the striking at holiday resorts and tourism businesses all over the world.  The consequences of that will be considerable and it will not be possible to repair the damage in a short period.</p></speech>

Like others, I wish to express my sympathy on a personal basis.  I also wish to express solidarity with the French people.  It is good that there was a minute's silence in the D&aacute;il to remember the victims and in sympathy with their families and the French people.  It is truly horrific that young people who were out and about for the evening, young families and people just seeking to enjoy themselves were the subject of these attacks.  Unfortunately, however, that is the way of terrorist attacks.  There will be short-term consequences to these attacks, such as heightened security, the sharing of information between countries, etc., all of which are important.  Does the ambassador fear there will be long-term consequences for France, which is home to people of many nationalities, in the context of integrating new arrivals, particularly in the urban areas where migrants traditionally settle?</p></speech>

I was in the Seanad.  Like previous speakers, I extend my personal sympathies to the French nation.</p> <p>  What hurts France hurts all of us.  What happened in the past two weeks in Paris and Brussels and the events which occurred in London some years ago represent a real challenge to the European way of life.  As other members said, there is a battle to be won for the hearts and minds of all of our young people but there is also a need to respond.  There must be a strong security response in respect of these attacks.  Europe survives by being an open, multicultural society where people feel confident in walking the streets.  That is something we have to protect and preserve.  However, we also need to recognise that we need to respond externally and not only in terms of bombing ISIS.  What we should do first is stop referring to this organisation as "ISIS".  It should also not be referred to by means of the term "Islamic State".  This group does not represent the Islamic people.  It should be identified by means of the term "Daesh", which a number of organisations have suggested.</p> <p>  We also need to respond more generally by looking more towards diplomacy and securing some reasonable outcomes in some of these world conflicts.  As another member has said, these organisations are getting money from somewhere and if we are to be serious about dealing with this crisis, there should be nowhere for them to go.  We need to take this to a new level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Jean-Pierre Th&eacute;bault" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#G00500"><p>First, I thank all the Deputies and Senators for their kind words, for their unanimous support for France and for expressing, at the same time, the feelings of the Irish people, the Irish Government and the Irish main stakeholders.  This is very much valued.  All signs coming from Ireland have a special value because of the traditional relationship between our two countries.</p> <p>  There were a lot of questions and I am not sure we can tackle them all.  I would gladly seize upon the offer of one the members to engage at another time in such a conversation also.  Unfortunately, we are not speaking about a one-time event.  We are speaking now about a situation that will last.  My Prime Minister and President have said that, unfortunately, this is the beginning of a war.  It will take time and effort, it will need imagination and it will need solidarity to tackle the issue once and for all.  That is the first remark I would make in answer to some of the questions.</p> <p>  What is at stake is not one response but the global response because if we do not act now, as many members stated, the problem will only grow.</p><p>Daesh was formed approximately two or three years ago and is already the wealthiest terror organisation in the world and by far one of the most organised.  It is also displaying an impressive willingness to extend mass terror not only in the places it was originally born but also, more and more, to new countries.  When it claims a caliphate, it is aiming at a very large territorial base, even if it is completely distorting what a caliphate means or what it meant in the past, namely, a place of civilisation.  Daesh is distorting the word in the same way it is distorting the word "Islam" for its purpose.  The aim is to establish, in the long run, a solid territorial basis, and to wage all-out war.  This is why the aim of the French response, and the international coalition we are calling for and trying to bring about, is to tackle the cause of the problem where it is.</p><p> In so doing, we are thinking not only about strikes, our own citizens or the citizens of Europe.  The first people we are thinking about are the hundreds of thousands in Syria and Iraq who can no longer lead a normal life.  We have repeatedly seen images of mass graves, mass executions, women forced into a depraved way of life, children enlisted to execute prisoners of war, and people who happened to be homosexual being burned alive.  Maybe we did not react strongly enough when we saw them for the first time.  It is mass terror.  If it recalls something, it may be the hate of the Nazi regime.  Probably, all of us today would say that had we had the opportunity and known what was going to happen back then, we would have intervened before it became too late, before it was established and was too strong to tackle.  Today, we still have the opportunity, by targeting the centre of command, training and resources, to weaken and, eventually, annihilate Daesh.  However, a military response is not the only response.  There must be a severalfold approach including the necessary measures at home and on the ground.  We must also ally with all the countries under threat.  There is a great need for a diplomatic solution.  In my speech, I tried to stress the components of this.</p><p> France is very clear on the refugee issue.  We do not resile from our commitment.  We committed to welcoming 30,000 refugees, and we will honour our pledge.  There is no doubt about it.  The question is whether the better solution is to open the borders more and welcome people who are fleeing Daesh or for those people to have the opportunity to stay in their countries - places they did not want to flee but from which they were forced - with their families and relatives.  If we want to tackle the refugee crisis, it will also be done by acting in Syria and Iraq by opposing ISIS.</p><p> A member asked whether people became jihadis because they were alienated individuals who were not given a chance.  It is a complicated question.  We are not denying that in certain cases we, and many other countries, have not paid enough attention to or acted swiftly enough to tackle the problems that were emerging and this has exacerbated the situation.  On the other hand, the people who performed the attacks in Paris were not alienated youths.  The head of the group was the son of a relatively well-off tradesperson.  He attended an elite school and received a subsidy for it.  Another had a stable job working for the local government.  He had no reason specifically to feel alienated.  He had a job at a time when many would dream of having one.  The reasons are not simple.  We cannot say people become terrorists because they are alienated.  There are no reasons to become a terrorist and perform such a mass attack, even if one has a dissenting view.  There are probably other reasons than a feeling of alienation.  It is too easy an explanation.</p><p> Members are right that we must not confuse Islam with the kind of fundamentalism that confronts us, which is an abuse of what Islam should be.  The Muslim community is taking this question in its own hands and tackling it and is willing to say this is not Islam.  This is a very important move which we are observing and encouraging in France and in many other European countries, including Ireland.  Last Friday, something very important happened in France.  Almost all the mosques in France co-ordinated to deliver the same speech, something they were never able to do before.  It was a speech of tolerance which took a very strong stance against the existence of any possible link, even in dreams, between the imams' interpretation of Islam and the way the terrorists have abused the idea of Islam.  This is an important part of the answer and it must be encouraged.  Islam must not only be welcomed but encouraged to take into its own hands, as part of the solution, the question of the abuse of Islam.  There are the official places of worship but there are also the social networks.  We know the very important role the social networks play in radicalism and fundamentalism.  We must all tackle it together at EU and national level.</p><p> The wealth of Daesh is a major issue and we urge the EU to tackle it swiftly.  The fourth directive on the subject needs implementation.  The first step will be to implement it as soon as possible.  At national level, we have taken a certain number of steps that will be enforced by decree, due to the urgency.  We are ready to engage in a very substantial conversation with all our EU partners to do even more on the issue.  I have a document detailing all the measures we are calling for at EU level to tackle the precise question of the financing of terrorism.  Unfortunately, most of it is in French, but there is a summary in English.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.755" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Jean-Pierre Th&eacute;bault" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#H00300"><p>I will gladly provide it to the Chairman.  I hope I have answered the questions on the refugee crisis and the ideology when mentioning the work we have to do with the Muslim community, the role the Muslim community could play in this and what, eventually, we could continue to do.</p> <p>  There was a question about the international alliance and coalition and whether we aim to reduce the military capacity of ISIS in particular.  ISIS has a military capacity and we need to tackle it.  President Hollande's aim in touring the countries of world leaders is to ensure there is unified front, that there is no escape for Daesh, that we will mobilise, in a co-ordinated way, our strikes on its control and command centres and, more than this, that we will target its sources of wealth.  Daesh has taken control of a certain number of oil fields and, unfortunately, there are people out there buying from Daesh and giving it money in exchange for those stolen goods.  Fundamentally, Daesh has stolen these goods from the people it has forced to flee as refugees or that it has executed.  This matter must be tackled.  Among the strikes, there will be strikes on the oil fields.  We must sever any possibility that the terrorists will continue to be funded.</p><p> There was a question about Libya.  We fully recognise that this question is not only in Syria and Iraq but is also in all the destabilised or weak countries which currently exist.  Libya has been specifically mentioned in this context.  This is one of the reasons we insist on putting attention on countries like Mali, which was saved almost at the last minute from the establishment of a Daesh-like regime.  It needs to be further strengthened and assured in the long run.  This is a major issue for the stability of Africa, which is another region that is very important not only for France but for all of Europe.  We know the extent of the terrorist threat in Africa.  In addition to Daesh, there are groups in this region that are linked to al-Qaeda and Boko Haram.  This region, which is trying to develop and is starting to do so, is under threat from this fundamentalism.  We need to help Africa to stabilise itself.</p><p> Questions were asked about jihadi returnees.  We fully recognise that this is a strong problem.  There is almost no country in the EU where this is not a problem.  We all have a problem of some kind with it.  We think it is something that we need to tackle by efficiently exchanging intelligence and looking at what we can do to prevent these people from threatening the peaceful communities to which they are returning, especially when they are actively engaged in terrorist action.  We suggest that a severe security answer is the solution at this stage.  It would send a signal to people who might see the returnees as heroes or examples.</p><p> Before I conclude, I would like to respond to some of the other questions that the Members of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il have asked me.  We deeply believe that the problem is neither internal nor external.  All aspects of this problem are linked together.  Daesh is not something outside; it is something outside which is engineering and conspiring against us inside.  The masterminds might be elsewhere, but they are constantly exchanging and going in and out.  That is one of the challenges.  We cannot solve this problem internally only.  We have to solve the problem internally and externally.  Even if the root of the problem is external, it has consequences at home.  Only solidarity among the EU partners will help us to tackle this issue effectively and swiftly.</p><p> This huge threat is probably unprecedented in its scale.  It is always understandable that there might be hesitation, but any hesitation will weaken our answer.  For that reason, I am willing to provide to the committee two elements on which I must insist.  First, we have always considered France as a country that acts only in the legal framework of the UN charter and UN security resolutions.  Second, we are very much insisting on the democratic support we need to have at home to take any measures.  I know there have been some questions about the state of emergency and what it means.  Are fundamental freedoms at stake and in danger of disappearing in France, which is a country of liberty?  I think it is reassuring for everybody to know that these extra powers are specifically and precisely limited and can only live and continue under the close scrutiny of both houses of our parliament.  From this point of view, it is also an exercise in and a moment of democracy in my country.</p><p> I will conclude by talking about the quality of the answers which will be provided by all the EU partners.  This obviously includes Ireland, which is of great importance for us politically and from a symbolic point of view.  The quality of the answers we are able to give as we fight and tackle effectively this new kind of threat will contribute to international peace and security.  I want to reiterate Deputy Crowe's point that we are not just speaking about what happened in Paris.  We are speaking also about the lives of the poor people in Tunis and Beirut, the lives of those who were on the flight that was destroyed over the Sinai Peninsula and the lives of all the other people who are still threatened by Daesh.  If we do not take action immediately, without too much hesitation, the threat will increase and the death toll will get larger.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to welcome the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan.  He is to present to the committee the European Commission's work programme for 2016.  We recall that, on taking office, President Juncker promised a European Union that would be bigger and more ambitious on big things and smaller and more modest on small things.</p> <p>  I remind the Commissioner that he is under privilege.  We read out the privilege statement earlier and I am sure he remembers it well.  Can we take it as read?  Agreed.  With that in mind, I invite the Commissioner to outline to the members the work programme for next year.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to do so and look forward to hearing members&rsquo; questions in due course.  The new Commission has been in office for one year so this is a good milestone at which to reflect on our work to date.  The Commission is committed to making bold, yet pragmatic, proposals to tackle our common challenges and emerge stronger in the spirit of European solidarity and co-operation.</p> <p>  The ten priorities outlined by President Juncker remain the right ones and we intend to deliver on them in a focused and strategic way.  Last year, President Juncker said we would do different things and do things differently.  We are following through on our pledge to concentrate on the big things, as mentioned by the Chairman.  We have set out our vision and outlined the steps required to achieve these goals.  I will provide a brief overview of a number of priority policy areas, including the progress made to date.  This will not be an exhaustive list, so I will be happy to address any further areas that are not covered.</p> <p>  First and foremost, we are maintaining the drive to create jobs, growth and investment.  The investment fund is now up and running and delivering high-quality investments to turbo-charge the European economy, including in research.  As members know, this is needed.  A &euro;70 million investment in 14 primary care centres in Ireland was among the first tranche of investments in projects under the "Juncker plan".  Ireland was among the first four member states to draw down finance from the European Investment Bank under the plan.  We have also front-loaded &euro;1 billion to speed up the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative to help up to 650,000 young people find jobs, apprenticeships, traineeships or continued education across Europe.</p> <p>  The Commission will now focus on improving the investment environment and deepening the Single Market so that it delivers better outcomes, removes barriers and creates the right environment for innovation, particularly among SMEs and start-ups.  As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, I repeat the message that the European agrifood sector is a vital driver of job creation and growth.  I know I am preaching to the converted when I tell members that the agrifood sector has arguably contributed more than any other sector to Irish economic recovery, with 61,000 new jobs created in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in 2013 alone.  With the CAP now reformed and more market oriented, the changing international context provides a wealth of opportunities for forward-thinking farmers and agribusinesses.  I would like to be in a position to say ambitious and entrepreneurial Europeans, particularly younger citizens, will be able to view the agrifood sector as an attractive career prospect.  The reformed CAP provides many incentives encouraging young and new farmers to enter the sector, while our committed pursuit of new markets will open new opportunities to be grasped.  More broadly, the Commission aims to improve the business environment by deepening the Single Market and removing internal barriers to investment and innovation, including a range of proposals to implement the digital single market strategy.</p> <p>  Here in Ireland, we are particularly aware that a thriving digital economy can expand markets and create new sources of employment.  In December, the Commission will present its vision for a more modern, European approach on copyright to take account of the digital revolution.  Further initiatives on geo-blocking, the free flow of data, the cloud and VAT for electronic commerce will follow in the course of 2016.  A good news story for EU citizens and consumers is that we foresee an end to roaming charges by 2017.  Energy policy is also front and centre in our thinking.  As members know, the European Union is a central player in the upcoming Paris climate talks.  To that end, we will deliver three important packages under the energy union.</p> <p>  We aim to deliver a circular economy package to maximise resource efficiency throughout the entire value chain.  We will set out a new blueprint to ensure economic, social and environmental sustainability, incorporating the Europe 2020 review and the UN sustainable development goals. </p> <p>  Closely linked to Internal Market reform is our commitment to building a more united, resilient and prosperous economic and monetary union.  Members discussed this in September with Jos&eacute; Leandro, director of policy strategy at the Commission's economic and financial unit.  This week, the Commission presented a European bank deposit scheme to further reduce risk and ensure a level playing field in the banking sector.  Enhanced dialogue between the Commission and the European Parliament is a key priority to improving the democratic accountability of our economic governance system.  To prepare for the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 of economic and monetary union completion, the Commission intends to launch a wide-ranging debate across EU member states.</p> <p>  The 2016 European semester will put a stronger focus on the economic and fiscal situation in the euro area as a whole, emphasising employment and social performance through the development of a European pillar of social rights.  I commend the committee on the work it has done on this important area.  I encourage it to continue with this work because such engagement is vital to success.  For the European Union and member states to succeed in meeting our jobs and growth targets we need to achieve a broad consensus on the right policy direction and generate strong support for reform efforts.</p> <p>  Earlier today, the European Commission published the so-called annual growth survey, which represents the launch of an annual cycle of economic governance.  The focus remains on pursuing policies to boost investment and structural reforms and ensuring a sound fiscal base.</p> <p>  While the economy remains our priority, as members know well, addressing the refugee crisis and managing the migratory pressure on our external borders remains a most-pressing priority.  The instability, war and poverty in our neighbouring regions mean that this issue will remain at the top of the political agenda in Europe for some years to come.  The European Agenda on Migration, which was presented in May 2015, provides a comprehensive approach to migration management based on the principles of solidarity and responsibility.  In addition, two emergency schemes to relocate 160,000 people in need of international protection from the member states most affected are already operational.  The Commission has welcomed Ireland's commitment to take 4,000 refugees.  Every day, the FRONTEX joint operations Poseidon and Triton are rescuing people shipwrecked in the Mediterranean Sea.  I pay tribute to the Irish naval forces on their tremendous service as part of the European humanitarian operations.  The EU has already mobilised &euro;4 billion in humanitarian, development, economic and stabilisation assistance for countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt.  An additional &euro;1.8 billion will be used to set up an emergency trust fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa.</p> <p>  Stronger and deeper co-operation with third countries of origin and transit is key to managing migration better, including through a concerted effort to provide support for the growing number of refugees and internally displaced persons in third countries.  I am pleased agriculture was recognised as making a contribution in this regard at the recent summit in Valetta.  The crisis has shown that, beyond these immediate steps, we need to rethink fundamentally the way we manage our common external border and our European asylum framework.  We will overhaul our common asylum system to correct the gaps and weaknesses exposed in the Dublin system and strengthen the role of the European Asylum Support Office.  Today, this means stepping up existing efforts while pressing for an action plan on return to be fully and quickly put into operation, and for agreement on the pending proposals implementing the European agenda on migration.  The Taoiseach and other European leaders will be in Brussels on Sunday to discuss issues concerning the European Union and Turkey.</p> <p>  To act effectively abroad, the European Union must live and grow as a union of democratic change at home.  On this front, the Commission will work in partnership with the European Parliament and the Council to ensure the negotiations on a new inter-institutional agreement on better regulation can conclude by the end of the year.</p><p>This is necessary to strengthen our common commitment to better regulation as a tool to achieve better results, increase transparency about how European decisions are made and equip the three institutions to work together better.</p><p> In 2016, we will introduce our proposal for an inter-institutional agreement on a mandatory transparency register for interest representatives seeking to influence policy making in the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.  We would like national parliaments to have a strong voice in European policy making, which is why more than 200 visits have been made by Commissioners since the Juncker Commission took office.</p></speech>

We will also continue to expand our citizens' dialogues, which allow Commissioners to listen directly to citizens in their own regions and reply on the issues that matter most to them.</p> <p>  I will briefly mention the ongoing debate on the forthcoming UK referendum on EU membership.  Given Ireland's economic, geographic, historical and societal ties to the UK, it is appropriate that a deepening discussion is taking place in this country on the so-called Brexit.  That debate is happening on a variety of levels, including in the Houses.  I commend the excellent report prepared by the committee.  I am sure that Mr. Jonathan Faull's intervention here yesterday was instructive and engaging.  It is right that Irish parliamentarians express their views in this debate and that their reflections are heard in London and Brussels.</p> <p>  As members are aware, EU member states and institutions have faced a series of complex and, at times, daunting challenges in recent years.  To respond to these challenges, it is essential that we make the best use of our resources.  The Commission has pledged to do things differently, and we are delivering on that pledge.  The budget must be geared to results and the mid-term review of the multi-annual financial framework will consider how to target funding for key priorities better while putting a stronger focus on achieving results.</p> <p>  All of our proposed actions are underpinned by our new better regulation agenda.  We want to ensure that, when the EU takes action, it does so in a way that delivers results and makes a positive difference in the lives of citizens.  Our work programme will review key areas of existing legislation, such as health and safety in the workplace, to ensure that they are fit for purpose and continue to deliver results.  We also propose to withdraw a number of initiatives that have become obsolete or watered down over the years or have no chance of being adopted.</p> <p>  It is imperative that we are honest about where we find ourselves today.  The legacy of the economic crisis remains deep and lasting, the scale of the refugee crisis breath-taking and the threat of disintegration and disunity in Europe deeply worrying.  The work programme is about facing up to these challenges and meeting them head on.  When it comes to jobs, growth, investment, climate change, trade and sustainability, Europe can and must provide solutions to the problems faced by our citizens.  The agenda that I have outlined is a concrete step towards making this conviction a reality.</p></speech>

I will start with two questions, the first of which is on the last issue that the Commissioner raised, namely, the potential exit of the UK.  A proposal in the work programme on deeper and fairer economic and monetary union, EMU, relates to the development of a European pillar of social rights.  Bearing in mind that this proposal seeks to address gaps in existing legislation on social rights, which is one of the areas in which the UK is interested in seeing changes, will this cause problems, what does the Commissioner envisage happening and how will that square with the UK's desires?</p> <p>  My second question is on the Commission's proposals on a deeper and fairer Internal Market.  The Commissioner mentioned the withdrawal of some obsolete legislation, for example, the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  According to the Commissioner's communiqu&eacute;, the Commission intends to withdraw this initiative and replace it with proposals for a staged approach, starting with the agreement of a mandatory tax base.  How will this impact on Ireland?  In particular, will it impact on our ability to compete for and attract foreign direct investment, FDI?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.766" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#L00500"><p>I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for addressing us.  I congratulate him and his colleagues on their successful initiatives to date.</p> <p>  I will ask a number of questions on pressing economic issues.  Is the Commission satisfied with the progress made in restoring economic activity throughout the EU?  We in Ireland are happy to have a reasonable growth rate, but it is not replicated across the EU.  To what extent is the Union addressing these issues?  Is the work programme adequate to deal with them on a priority basis?</p> <p>  My next question is on climate change, in particular the extent to which climate change measures such as carbon reduction targets can be contained within the food-producing agricultural sector without one damaging the other.  By this I mean achieving the targets while ensuring that the agrifood business is allowed to expand and progress, given the global need for food.</p> <p>  My final question is on youth unemployment or employment, which is the reverse side.  Have adequate steps to address this issue been taken and responded to positively throughout the EU, in particular as regards long-term youth unemployment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#L00600"><p>I thank the Commissioner for a comprehensive overview of the work programme, what has been done to date and where the Commission intends to go.  I would like his views on a number of issues.  Regarding migration and despite the volume of people involved, the Commission seems to suggest that 160,000 people will be dealt with through the relocation programme.  That is small compared with the number of people who have crossed the outer border in the past year.  I had an opportunity to visit Calais this summer to see the situation there.  The problem is not going away and its scale is obvious.  It will taper out over the winter but, with the expected continuation of hostilities, it is highly unlikely that it will not increase again as the weather changes.  Is the 160,000 figure a starting point?  Does the Commissioner expect the Commission to try to negotiate further?  It is clear to us that this number does not match the demand.</p> <p>  The Commissioner rightly pointed out the importance of the agrifood sector to the economy.  He referred to the necessity of retaining young people in the sector, in particular on the farming side.  He has been involved in a programme that aims to achieve better lending arrangements for young farmers who want to invest in the farming sector.  To that extent, discussions have been held with the European Central Bank, ECB.  Will the Commissioner update us on this initiative's status?</p> <p>  I do not expect the Commissioner to have a crystal ball, but will he to some extent give us the Commission's view of where the market for beef and milk lies?  Dairy farmers have suffered a significant drop in incomes this year.  Most of them take the view that dairy must be approached on a five-year cycle.  However, the elimination of the quota has encouraged new people into the sector.  Will the Commissioner provide us with some visibility of the Commission's standpoint on this issue?</p></speech>

The Commissioner mentioned roaming charges.  If they were sorted by 2017 or sooner, it would be a positive indication of the role of the Commission and the European Parliament in changing something that directly affects many people.</p> <p>  I like the idea of the changes being "big", how they will be delivered and so on.  All of that is important.  In 2016, the Commission will examine a few selected sectors more closely in light of their growth potential or because they face specific challenges.  That is akin to the Government's influence on the tourism sector, which was targeted early after the Government's formation as having growth potential.  If this approach is replicated in the Union's policies, it will be effective.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Deputy Durkan mentioned climate change, the Paris talks and the emissions trading scheme.</p><p>What role does the Commissioner envisage for forestry, particularly carbon capture and forestry?  Does he see a role for this in the talks?</p><p> We signed off on a political contribution in this committee yesterday on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  It has been widely speculated that there will be opportunities in the dairy sector but that there could be threats in the beef sector.  Does the Commissioner have any concerns about this?</p><p> The common consolidated tax base is being withdrawn.  The Commissioner has stated it will be replaced with a mandatory tax base.  What is the difference?  The 12.5% corporation tax rate has been sacrosanct in this country.  The full or maximum collection of the tax is only right and proper.</p><p> The multiannual financial framework and the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy are important in the context of direct transfers to the west, particularly for designated lands.  It is necessary to protect those payments.  Does the Commissioner have a view on the review?</p></speech>

I am unsure whether it is coincidental or whether the Commissioner is aware of it, but we held a debate in the D&aacute;il one or two hours ago which resulted in the ratification of two economic partnership agreements.  One was an agreement with the CARIFORUM states and the other was with west African states.  This leads me to a question on point 6 in the document, which argues for a reasonable and balanced free trade agreement with the United States.</p></speech>

Of course, we all have the same jumper as far as Ireland is concerned.  Mr. Hogan is the European Commissioner but he is knowledgeable on the Irish situation.</p> <p>  The whole question of transatlantic trade was raised.  The partnership agreement has major implications.  I am delighted that Mr. Hogan is the Commissioner with responsibility for farming for all 28 European countries.  I am confident that he will ensure Ireland is protected against the import of genetically modified cattle with hormones and so on.</p> <p>  The question of surveillance of farmers from the sky is important.  Approximately 8,000 farmers are being controlled by a satellite assessment of their places.  Is Ireland the only country in the European Union that operates such stringent control of farm grants?  Are we the exception to the rule?</p> <p>  My final question relates to the transposition of European directives into Irish law through statutory instruments.  We need more debate at a local level on this question.  When the Commissioner was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, many directives were not brought into Irish law.  I recall him telling me that he had to clear up some cases when he took office in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It would be better if they came through primary legislation rather than statutory instrument.  The process has caused untold difficulties, particularly with the bog situation and other issues that have arisen in the past.  Some of these issues were not debated in the Houses.</p></speech>

I was involved in training the Commissioner when he was in UCC, and Mr. Keary worked as one of my research assistants when I was at the European Parliament.  I am delighted to see both of them doing so well.</p></speech>

The programme includes an initiative on a new start for working parents.  It relates to parents who are self-employed.  Our system does not appear to assist people who are self-employed, including in the case of maternity benefit.  This needs to be examined throughout Europe.  For example, if a woman has a baby before 1 April, she is entitled to claim maternity benefit, but if it is after 1 April she has to wait until the following year to claim maternity benefit.  We want people working; we want them to set up new companies and run good businesses.  However, we put all manner of obstacles in their way, especially if they are self-employed.  This needs to be looked at from a European point of view.  A serious disadvantage is imposed on people, especially people who are self-employed.  This is something that certainly should be taken up.  It applies in cases involving farmers whose wives decide to start up a business.  They are being seriously disadvantaged in this regard.  That is one area we need to seriously consider.  We need to have a broad policy throughout Europe for people who are self-employed to ensure they can stay in the workplace and keep their businesses going while they are on maternity leave.</p></speech>

I was telling the Commissioner about a vote today in the D&aacute;il.  These economic partnership agreements are interesting.  Previously, we have had Eastern Partnership agreements with Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia.</p> <p>  There are dissenting voices in the national parliaments.  There are eurosceptics in our national Parliament.  Some people argue strongly against TTIP.  Is the Commissioner satisfied that under the new regime the argument about more openness in the negotiations is being fulfilled?  More important still is the timing.  Will the Commissioner offer his opinion on when he believes the agreement will be completed?  Does he believe the European project is doing enough to allow the citizenry to understand the nature of these trade agreements?  Is enough money and propaganda being put into the positive nature of them?  Many NGOs, ultra-leftists, Trotskyites, anarchists, communists and republicans are arguing against the role of Europe in expanding its trade links across various regions.</p> <p>  Let us consider the proposed programme from the Commission.  The committee has already debated in great depth and detail a British exit from the EU.  Can the Commissioner offer a view in the light of Mr. Cameron's letter?  We have seen it spelt out clearly - we heard the points expanded upon clearly yesterday - what Britain is trying to achieve in negotiations with the European Commission.  There is a logical position in all these programmes listed for us.  Many of them are in conflict with the case the British are now arguing.  For example, they argue a case on the basis of the euro region versus the sterling area and the other nine countries outside the euro currency.  They maintain sovereignty is important to them.  They make a case on the basis of defence and intelligence policy as well.  They argue negatively about the free movement of people within Europe.  Whatever about non-Europeans coming into Europe, they have an extraordinarily strong and possibly dangerous argument to the effect that they should be allowed to discriminate against Europeans.  It seems the argument is that economic migrants from Europe should not be allowed in, but there is a different position for those providing potential jobs and skills that are in short supply.</p> <p>  In a nutshell, can the Commissioner explain to the committee how he believes the British position now being negotiated will conflict with how the Commission proposes to overcome the difficulties on the various issues, such as the completion of banking union?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.784" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#N00100"><p>I have a number of comments to which I ask the Commissioner to respond.  He mentioned the ten political priorities and the corporate tax package.  He might expand on that in the couple of minutes he has left.  TTIP has also been mentioned.  There are concerns about workers significantly losing out, in particular as key social contracts, which to date have provided some level of protection, are now under negotiation.  The Commission talks in terms of plans to help workers displaced by TTIP or to adjust to change, as the Commission programme states.  Could the Commissioner expand on how the Commission plans to help workers adjust to change?</p> <p>    The Commission programme refers to the EU becoming a stronger global actor, but does not mention the further militarisation of the EU.  Some countries sought to create a standing European army.  What are the plans of the Commission in that regard?  Is it seeking to further develop the militarisation of Europe? </p> <p>  The last discussion we had was on the fallout from the Paris attacks.  What are the potential impact on civil liberties across Europe?  How does the Commission plan to reconcile security and privacy rights?  </p> <p>  Migration was mentioned earlier.  Southern European countries, specifically Greece and Italy, face a shocking lack of solidarity among EU member states.  How does the Commission plan to tackle this lack of solidarity?</p> <p>  My last point is a follow-up on the last discussion.  Some Schengen countries have enacted border controls.  Does the Commissioner believe Schengen is in serious trouble?  Yesterday, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, took questions and we discussed the situation in Libya.  He said 800,000 people are on the beaches in Libya and 700,000 have already travelled to Europe.  What is the situation regarding migration after the Paris attacks?  What does the Commissioner believe Ireland and Europe can do better in terms of migration?  </p></speech>

I wish him continued success in his role and thank him for coming to the meeting.  I also welcome Ms Nolan and Mr. Keary.</p> <p>  Given that the UK is our major training partner and we have many ties of kinship and a very particular and special relationship with it, the prospect of it exiting from the EU is of enormous significance to us.  In that context, it would be good to hear a clear indication from the Commissioner that the Commission will bend over backwards and do everything possible to accommodate and work with the UK into the future and ensure it remains within the EU. </p> <p>  I do not have to tell the Commissioner what an important input it has at EU level and what a central part of it it is, apart from the domestic Irish interest.  In that context, lessening bureaucracy, which seems to be one of the UK's demands, should not frighten any of us, and a strong role for a domestic parliament within a European context should not either.  There are contentious issues around migration, but they could be dealt with.  I am anxious to hear from the Commissioner that every effort will be made in that sphere.</p> <p>  My second point concerns TTIP.  I am anxious, given the electorate in my constituency and the overall interests of our country, to get a clear indication from the Commissioner that the security of food supply within Europe would remain a top priority despite TTIP and that current veterinary and food standard would be in no way compromised by TTIP.  Both issues involve vital Irish interests and there are many downstream jobs for agriculture.  I ask for assurances in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil Hogan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112600002#N00300"><p>I thank everybody for their questions.  On the Chairman's question on social rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>what was discussed yesterday with Jonathan Faull and the UK, my reply is also an answer for Deputy Byrne and others who raised the issue of the UK.  The UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, made a commitment that he would hold a referendum and is entitled to put forward what he feels are the important issues he wishes to have considered.  The European Union does not always have to agree with him and that is why a negotiation is taking place.<br/><br/>The free movement of people is a very important issue for the European Union and is one of its fundamental pillars. There will be a very intense negotiation on those matters, which, as we know, are quite dominant political issues in the UK.  The free movement of people has been a considerable help to economies like the UK, Germany, France and other countries, in terms of the skills required for economic reasons.  In the absence of having a definitive outcome of on any of the negotiations that are ongoing between the Commission and in the British Government, nobody who puts forward proposals expects to get everything for which he or she looks.  The fundamental pillars of the European Union will be protected, in terms of issues raised by the Chairman and Deputy Byrne.  <br/><br/>We recently put forward a new policy document on social rights.  Commissioner Thyssen, who, I understand, was recently in Ireland, has given strong indications about the priorities of the Commission.  The social dimension has now been put back into the narrative of the European Union, something that was absent for a number of years in terms of labour mobility, the rights of individuals in the workplace and the basic human rights of individuals as citizens of the European Union.  We will see a stronger social dimension, in addition to the economic dimension that has been fostered by the current Commission, through Commissioner Thyssen.<br/><br/>Taxation issues were raised by a number of members.  The European Commission has no proposals to force member states to change their corporate tax position.  I remind members that it requires unanimity of member states before that can be done.  I do not see any unanimity on this particular proposal in any part of the European Union at the moment, but reforms are needed in terms of the way in which we deal with the tax base, arising from recent high-profile decisions. <br/><br/>Ireland has been to the forefront in working with the OECD, through the BEPS project, to clarify and improve our tax situation at corporate level.  We foresee a staging approach in order to get to the right place, which will involve openness and transparency in regard to the tax base, but that does not mean that we will ask the Irish Government or any subsequent government to change the 12.5% corporate tax base.  This is about what does and does not count for calculable purposes for the tax rates to be applied.  The OECD has worked with all member states, including Ireland, to provide clarity on that issue, and it is making substantial progress.  This is why we are withdrawing the old proposal on corporate taxation, and not for any other reason.  We want to work on the new opportunity the OECD work has given to us.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan is correct when he says that the European economy is largely flat and needs a boost.  That is why President Juncker developed his proposals on job growth and investment as one of the main priorities prior to the establishment of the Commission.  One cannot do much without money.  President Juncker has created a vehicle of &euro;315 billion to try to put some kind of leverage in the financial system for every member state to be able to draw on for the more risky projects that would not otherwise go ahead.</p><p>In Ireland and Northern Ireland, or between Ireland and the United Kingdom, there are opportunities to consider joint projects, apart from member state projects, under the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI, which is the fund implementing the Juncker investment plan.  This is with regard to energy and major infrastructural projects on which we could work closely together, where normally we would not be on top of the list because of the scale of the projects or the risks involved.  This country should reflect on what type of projects could be put forward over the next five or six years that could draw down this fund, which is not available elsewhere.  The standard funds are available through the rural development programme or the Social Fund, but this is quite different.  The Government is considering some projects along these lines to give impetus to major projects that may not otherwise go ahead.  It is very important that we are conscious of our competitiveness and deepen the Single Market and the EU, because this is how we will have much more economic activity at the level of the 28 member states and have the necessary fiscal discipline, through the European Semester, to keep people in check and learn the lessons of the past from the many member states where things have gone wrong.</p><p> A number of people asked about the youth employment agenda.  It is very important because in various member states, such as Spain, 25% of those unemployed are young people.  This is huge in terms of social cohesion.  We have a particular targeted fund for youth unemployment, and 650,000 places will be made available in the coming years, with &euro;1 billion targeted at youth employment initiatives for training, apprenticeships and continuous education throughout the European Union, and Ireland is participating in this.</p><p> Climate change has been mentioned, particularly by Deputy Kyne in the context of agriculture.  We subscribe to the role of agriculture in job creation and I gave a figure for 2013.  I do not believe the figure of 61,000 from 2013 has abated and I would say there were more jobs created in 2014.  It shows it is hugely important to mobilise the indigenous sectors of our economy for job creation purposes, because we do not need the same level of importation of raw materials.  Agriculture and tourism have made a major contribution to our economic recovery.</p><p> It is crucial that the accounting rules integrate forestry and agriculture as part of the climate change negotiations.  All land use should be taken into account irrespective of what is grown on the particular land.  I hope this is what will emerge from the climate change talks in Paris, and we must watch carefully the bilateral negotiations that will take place between member states and the Commission on the effort-sharing decision to implement the outcome of the agricultural dimension of these talks.  If the overall European objective is to grow more and feed the larger population of the world, which will be 9 billion people by 2050 - 2 billion more than we have now - how will we do this if we do not produce more?  However, we must do it in an environmentally sustainable way and in a way that meets the horizontal climate change measures of other Directorates General, including that with responsibility for the environment.  All of these matters must be taken into account before we come to the types of outcome we all desire, allowing food to be produced sustainably and meeting our climate change objectives.  It is a difficult balance and the first half of 2016 will be an intensive period when the Government and Parliament will have discussions with European Commission.</p><p> TTIP has been mentioned by a number of people.  I am involved in the TTIP negotiations from an agricultural point of view, but the lead negotiator is the Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  We want a comprehensive agreement and not just an agreement on tariff equalisation or market access.  I think the priority for the US side will be trade liberalisation based on the reduction of tariffs.  We want to see progress made on financial services, public procurement, and the regulatory issues which have been mentioned, such as sanitary and phytosanitary issues, the environment, labour rights and standards across the board.  We want to see them protected in the chapters of the negotiations.  We depend on the parliaments of the 28 member states and the European Parliament to approve the deals, so the committee members will have a say on whether they agree or disagree with the outcome of the TTIP negotiations.  I keep telling the US negotiators that we must have a deal we can sell at home to 28 member states and the European Parliament.  It only takes one member state to say "No" and the entire deal is off.  This is not fully understood or recognised.  The member state parliaments will have a major say in the final outcome of the negotiations.  Committee members can take it that the issues of concern to them are well marked, noted and communicated.</p></speech>

The 28 member state parliaments and the European Parliament must approve it, which is a fair standard to live up to in terms of a balanced outcome to any negotiation, including TTIP.  It is something we forcibly communicate to the US side, and therefore we must meet the requirements.</p> <p>  Deputies Dooley and Byrne mentioned citizens getting more information and getting involved in the negotiations.  Recently, with regard to the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, arrangement, 150,000 people decided that they had a view.  There was some duplication and we have reduced the figure from approximately 300,000 to 150,000.  They felt they had concerns about the former proposal, and because of this Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m initiated a public consultation and changed the system, which is now much more reasonable in terms of meeting the public's concern.  It does not in any way remove the courts from the system of adjudication but it is trying to make it less bureaucratic and less expensive in the first stage.  Ultimately people will have a right to go to court, as they do with anything.  The scheme was sought to speed up settlement procedures and get quicker decisions.</p> <p>  It is very important that we keep an eye on the cumulative effect of free trade agreements because they have economic and social impacts.  In July we did a deal with Vietnam.  Everybody realises the European Union went beyond what was initially expected in terms of meeting the requirements.  A total of 60% of Vietnam's population works in agriculture, and it will get more access to the European market than it would have expected because of the poverty levels and the need to lift people out of poverty through free trade agreements.  They are an excellent vehicle for dealing with global poverty.  In this case, particularly with regard to rice, Vietnam is very satisfied with the deal and the European Union countries seem to be reasonably satisfied with the balanced outcome because we are getting free liberalisation for all of our other products going to Vietnam, which is a country of 90 million people and a growing economy, which is doing exceptionally well considering where it was 30 years ago.</p></speech>

We can say "No" if we are not satisfied with the fundamental rights we demand.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue of the European Union being a stronger global actor, later this year the Commission will present proposals for a European border and coast guard, which is effectively being put in place to strengthen Frontex, the organisation established to deal with the refugee and migration crisis.</p><p>This should, and will, occur in the context of the broader development of the European Union's capacity to be more united in relation to external action.  It must be remembered that because Ireland is in Schengen, it can choose to opt in or not while other member states in the migration area of the European Union that are experiencing enormous turmoil, societally and economically because of what is happening, cannot do so.  They are not able to cope.  One example is Sweden, which I recently visited.  There are 12,000 people per week coming through Denmark into Sweden.  One can imagine the pressure this is placing on the local authorities there in the context of the speed with which they must provide housing and social services for those people and the expenditure required in that regard.  It is a great challenge to us all.  </p><p> Migration is the number one issue politically.  When President Juncker included addressing the migration issue in his list of ten-point priorities last year people wondered why he did it.  It appears he is a very far-seeing gentleman.  Nobody could have foreseen the scale of this displacement of people.  The migration issue and other economic and social issues will be discussed at the forthcoming summit next Sunday between the European Union and Turkey.  The outcome of those discussions in terms of how it is proposed to manage the 3 million people that are displaced will be particularly important.  There are a further 1 billion people displaced in Lebanon and another 1 billion people displaced in Jordan.  As pointed out by many speakers today, these are issues that will be with us for many years to come.  We will need a great deal of patience politically on this issue.  We will also need a great deal of resources to deal with it effectively.  Schengen is under pressure from that point of view.  There will be a discussion in the future around a review of Schengen in the context of these issues.  As mentioned by Deputy Dooley, the 160,000 people about whom we are speaking today are only the tip of the iceberg in the context of what Europe has to deal with.</p><p> I will now try to address some of the other points raised.  On the point regarding young farmers, we are working with the European Investment Bank to secure more longer-term loans at reasonable rates of interest.  The situation in this country in relation to the cost to people of borrowing money is uncompetitive.  A similar situation applies across many member states.  We are working with the European Investment Bank, on which Ireland is represented, on the creation of an agricultural fund which would provide competition and options for people.  It is proposed not to create further financial bureaucracy but to utilise existing financial institutions to channel that money to the people who need it.  We are prioritising restructuring of the dairy sector post-milk quota and young people who want to get into farming and forestry.</p><p> I do not propose to engage in crystal ball gazing in relation to market developments in regard to agricultural commodities as to do so would mean us being here for a long time.  Suffice it to say that the difficulties being experienced in the dairy sector are likely to continue into 2016.  It is my job to secure new markets in this regard.  We are doing everything possible to get new markets for our dairy producers.  Having lost &euro;5.2 billion owing to the Russian ban last year, our exports in this area increased by &euro;8.6 billion this year.  We have turned the corner in relation to exports but we are not getting the same value as before.  </p><p> President Juncker wrote to President Putin this week in relation to how trade relations with Russia can be normalised again.  Obviously, there is a political dimension to that in terms of the sanctions having to be taken into account.  Nevertheless, people in Russia, as well as in the European Union, have to be fed.  The Russian people are experiencing problems because of the lack of opportunities in this area.</p></speech>

I said there was a political dimension to this issue.  I am sure people in the foreign affairs arena would be able to update the committee on it.  I am only stating the facts, namely, that President Juncker has tried in recent days, through correspondence, to open up dialogue with Russia in regard to trading opportunities.  I am sure if that were to arise there would be trade-offs in relation to economic sanctions.  There is a window of opportunity opening up because of matters in the Middle East.</p> <p>  On civil liberties, security and migration, in the context of the problems being experienced across the European Union, because of the actions of terrorists we will enjoy a little less privacy but more security in relation to the legal situation in member states.  That is not the fault of the citizens who are law abiding rather it is the fault of the people who wish to engage in this type of irresponsible action and terrorist activity.  What happened in Paris has changed everything.  In my view, it is effectively the 9-11 of the European Union.  We should remember that people in Belgium and other member states across the European Union are living in fear of what may happen in the future.  The legal situation in every member state in terms of the power of the legal authorities therein to deal with these matters is, I expect, under review.  It is a fact of life that when people take the law into their own hands and as a result of their actions 129 people are killed, changes to the legal systems and legislation to deal with that activity must be expected. </p> <p>  On the point made by Senator Colm Burke in regard to maternity benefit and the self-employed, there is no agreement in the European Union on these matters.</p></speech>

These officials are here to brief us on cross-Border opportunities to prevent youth unemployment through education and training, and to promote job creation.</p><p>I wish to acknowledge that this is the first Northern Ireland civil servants have come before this committee in a round table discussion with civil servants from the Republic on an issue that is fundamentally important throughout the island.  I thank everybody for coming here today,</p><p>At our next session, Mr. John McAllister MLA, who is an independent Unionist, will appear before the committee at his own request.  I am delighted that he has made the journey in the physical sense and in recognising this Parliament and our support and interest in Northern Ireland.  This is a very special day for the committee and that gives hope and optimism to all of us who have high aspirations for the future of this island, North and South.</p><p>Before inviting our guests to make their presentations, I advise them of the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  As public servants, I think they full understand that.  That advice should be directed more at politicians but I thank the witnesses very much.</p><p>The clerk to the committee sent the officials a copy of the recent British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly report on preventing youth unemployment through education and training, purely for information purposes.  It is not intended that this discussion will be based entirely on the report.</p><p>I will now ask Mr. Baldwin to make his opening statement.

These are important issues of shared concern North and South and, in this regard, we very much welcome our continuing engagement with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  In the first instance, the Department of Education and Skills is of the view that keeping our young people at school for as long as possible, so that they can complete their second-level education, plays a vital role in reducing youth unemployment.  In Ireland in the last quarter of 2014, the unemployment rate for people with lower secondary or less education was 18%, whereas it was 12% for those with higher secondary or further education and training, and 6% for those with higher education.  There has been a significant reduction in the proportion of early school leavers in Ireland, reducing overall from 13.1% in 2004 to the current 6.9%, which is well below the EU average of 11.3% and the EU 2020 target of below 10%.</p> <p>  Those young people who leave school early need access to good second-chance education and training.  All young people who find themselves unemployed need access to good education and training options.  Over the course of recent years, a programme of system-wide reform has been delivered in the further education and training, or FET, sector.  SOLAS, the new Further Education and Training Authority, now has responsibility for the strategic co-ordination and funding of the FET sector.  The first task for SOLAS was the development of a national five-year strategy for the sector which sets out a vision to provide world-class education and training, serving the needs of jobseekers, employers and the economy as a whole.  One of the focuses of the strategy, published in 2014, is to improve the employment outcomes for those completing FET programmes, including early school leavers and young jobseekers.  We work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Social Protection to plan programmes for unemployed people in a way that targets sectors where jobs are available.</p> <p>  Our higher education system continues to make an important contribution in this area, particularly through the Springboard programme.  Springboard Plus has so far enabled over 21,000 unemployed and previously self-employed people to upskill or reskill in areas of identified skills need.  In 2015, we will provide a further 9,000 places on 285 courses, in 42 colleges throughout the country.  Courses will be delivered in areas such as ICT, high-end manufacturing, international financial services, skills to trade internationally and entrepreneurial or business start-up skills.  The Springboard initiative has brought about a culture change within the higher education system, bringing an enhanced and productive industry focus to the design and delivery of courses.  The strong engagement from employers in the development and selection of courses has been critical to the success of the programme.</p> <p>  Employer engagement has also been a feature in developing our apprenticeship system.  Major developments in the area of apprenticeships have taken place recently, including a review of the Irish apprenticeship system and the establishment of the new Apprenticeship Council of Ireland.  Following a call by the council for proposals for new apprenticeships, a decision has been taken to approve the development of 25 new apprenticeship programmes in areas such as-----</p></speech>

Following a call by the Apprenticeship Council of Ireland for proposals for new apprenticeships, a decision has been taken by the Government to approve the development of 25 new apprenticeship programmes in areas such as ICT, transport and logistics, financial services, and tourism and hospitality.  These new programmes will offer new career options to young people in areas where there are sustainable employment opportunities.  The apprenticeship system is one aspect of education and skills development on which we have had fruitful engagement with our colleagues in the Department of Employment and Learning in the North.  Regular cross-Border meetings of Ministers and officials review issues of joint concern and the potential for mutually beneficial co-operation in higher and further education strategies and policies, legislative and institutional reform, funding, access and student mobility issues, cross-Border student flows, and research.  Through the framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, our respective Departments address such issues as educational disadvantage, and work to improve outcomes and opportunities for young people emerging from our education systems.</p> <p>  We look forward to our discussion on the issues in both jurisdictions and in the context of exploring the potential for further cross-Border initiatives that deliver added value to our work.</p></speech>

I will also talk about cross-Border collaboration on enterprise development and job creation.</p> <p>  The education and training system is critical to support enterprise, growth and innovation.  Providing young people with the education, training and skills that are relevant to the changing needs of the labour market is crucial, both to their own employability and to the development of the economy as a whole.  Within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills, as well as the Department of Social Protection, on matters relating to education and training, skills development, and other labour market issues.</p><p> We in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation work closely with our colleagues in the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection on matters relating to education and training, skills development and other labour market issues.  Our Department, in conjunction with the skills and labour market research unit of SOLAS, provides the secretariat to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which reports jointly to the Ministers for Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the existing and emerging skills needs of the economy.</p><p> The overarching role of our Department is to champion the enterprise agenda across Government and promote and implement policies that support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Department funds the activities of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and local enterprise offices, LEOs.  It co-funds InterTradeIreland with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.</p><p> The Department is responsible for co-ordinating and publishing the annual Action Plan for Jobs, which is the Government's key policy instrument to support job creation.  The action plan process has seen the delivery of more than 1,000 individual actions since the first plan was published in 2012.  The action plans reflect many of the measures that have been introduced in recent years to reform the education and training system, which Mr. Baldwin discussed, and the high level of youth unemployment.  Initiatives reflected in the action plan include the likes of the Youth Guarantee, Springboard, MOMENTUM, JobBridge and the ICT skills action plan.</p><p> In our consultations with stakeholders in preparing the Action Plan for Jobs 2016, we are once again hearing of the importance of the skills agenda to employers.  As we emerge from the recession and see the economy beginning to recover, it is clear that a key issue for employers is finding the right skills to meet their needs as they grow their businesses.  The war for talent is real, both for Irish companies and for multinational corporations based in Ireland.  The 42,000 young people who are unemployed have a key role to play in meeting the emerging skills requirements of the enterprise sector.  Economically and societally, it is important that we tap into this reservoir of talent.  Ireland's competitive advantage in international markets will increasingly be driven by the availability of world-class skills at all levels.</p><p> A key objective of the Action Plan for Jobs process when it commenced in 2012 was to support the creation of 100,000 new jobs in the economy by 2016.  This target has been exceeded, but tackling youth unemployment remains a challenge, one that is shared by many EU member states.  In spite of economic recovery across most of the EU, the youth unemployment rate still exceeds 20% in many countries.  In Ireland, the rate fell from a peak of over 30% in early 2012 to 20.7% in the third quarter of 2015.  However, this is still more than double the national average of 8.9%, so our efforts must continue in order to support young people who are unemployed.</p><p> The Action Plan for Jobs is complemented by the Government's Pathways to Work strategy, which seeks to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs being created in the economy as it recovers are taken up by people on the live register.  Pathways to Work is co-ordinated by the Department of Social Protection and focuses on actions to engage with and support the long-term unemployed and youth jobseekers on the live register.  Within the pathways strategy, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed.</p><p> Our Minister, Deputy Bruton, has placed a strong emphasis on supporting entrepreneurship, including young entrepreneurs.  A key initiative in this regard is Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur, IBYT, competition, which was introduced last year.  This initiative, which is run by the LEOs, builds from county-level competitions to regional and national finals.  The competition has a total fund of &euro;2 million and the overall national winners can receive an investment in their businesses of up to &euro;70,000.  This year, the competition attracted 1,400 applicants aged between 18 and 30 years, representing a 40% increase on last year.  Twenty-four young entrepreneurs have reached the national finals, which will take place in the coming weeks.</p><p> Building on the entrepreneurship theme, I would like to mention some important areas of North-South co-operation in supporting enterprise development.  As the committee will be aware, InterTradeIreland is one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.  It runs a range of initiatives and programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, on both sides of the Border to help companies develop their capacity and drive competitiveness.  It is co-funded by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.  Since its establishment, 25,000 SMEs have benefitted from its cross-Border information, 6,000 companies have taken part in all-island programmes, and 3,000 new jobs have been created through the agency's support.  InterTradeIreland co-operates with other enterprise development bodies in Ireland and Northern Ireland, including Enterprise Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland, and the LEOs.  It will play a role in delivering its services through the regions of Ireland under the Government's new suite of regional jobs action plans.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for supporting the growth of indigenous enterprises, has forged extensive links with various agencies and bodies in Northern Ireland.  Its work has focused on liaising with and participation in cross-Border bodies, such as the Ireland Fund, the International Fund for Ireland, the Special EU Programmes Body and local-authority-led cross-Border networks.  Enterprise Ireland works closely with Invest NI.  In November 2006, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the two agencies to enable clients of both to access each other's market services, trade missions and seminars.  Recognising the benefits of pooling resources to support companies in overseas markets, the services of Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI's overseas offices are available to client companies across the island.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI run innovation voucher programmes, which are designed to assist small firms in accessing the innovative solutions that are available in the higher education sector.  In May 2008, an all-island innovation voucher initiative was jointly launched by both bodies in Belfast.  Through this initiative, small Irish enterprises in the Republic can access a further ten knowledge providers in the North.  Similarly, small enterprises based in Northern Ireland can used their vouchers to access expertise in research institutions in the Republic.  It is a good example of cross-Border co-operation in this enterprise space.  Since 2008, companies from the Republic have completed 123 projects with Northern Ireland providers under this scheme, while Northern Ireland companies have completed 57 projects with knowledge providers in the Republic.  The agencies continually engage in close co-operation on the development of this cross-Border initiative, normally meeting twice a year.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland continues to work with Invest NI when recruiting participants on its leadership for growth programme.  Five CEOs from Northern Ireland participated in this between 2010 and 2013, and five Invest NI clients participate currently.  Three Invest NI clients are participating in the international selling programme that Enterprise Ireland runs.  Other areas of cross-Border collaboration for Enterprise Ireland include the Halo Business Angel Network, HBAN, a joint initiative with InterTradeIreland that is tasked with the development of business angel syndicates across Ireland.</p><p> Ongoing dialogue is taking place between Enterprise Ireland's public procurement department and various entities involved in Northern Ireland, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Technology Strategy Board and Invest NI.  Enterprise Ireland also works closely with InterTradeIreland on the procurement agenda.</p><p> Regarding access to EU research funding, co-operative links continue between the national support structure for Horizon 2020, which is based in Enterprise Ireland, and Invest NI and InterTradeIreland.  This aims to facilitate a more targeted co-operation in Horizon 2020 on an all-island basis.</p><p> The cross-Border 2008-14 INTERREG IVA programme is worth mentioning.  One element of this programme was designed to promote enterprise and business development.  A total of &euro;70 million was provided for the enterprise strand, with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation contributing approximately &euro;18 million.  Our co-funders from Northern Ireland were the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment or the Department of Finance and Personnel, depending on the exact nature of the individual project.</p><p>Approximately 28 projects were involved in this INTERREG strand, the two most significant of which with a physical legacy being the provision of two multimillion euro science parks in Derry and Letterkenny and the provision of two enterprise centres, one in Omagh and one in Carrick-on-Shannon.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to outline these developments and I am happy to take the committee's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.825" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Hughes" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#E00300"><p>It is a privilege to have the opportunity to attend this meeting.  We received this week a copy of the report on preventing youth unemployment through education and training.  Having shared it with the Minister for Education, Mr. John O'Dowd, MLA, we would like to give its recommendations more measured consideration over a slightly longer timeframe.  The committee will appreciate that these are relatively early observations.<br/><br/>I will begin by giving some high-level contextual background to the Department.  School education makes a major contribution to society and is a key enabler of improved life chances for our young people.  It contributes to community well-being and the success of our economy and it is a cornerstone of the Executive's programme for Government.<br/><br/>The Minister's corporate plan for education sets out a clear strategic direction that puts pupils first and is designed to ensure all young people regardless of their backgrounds can achieve their full potential.  Lead corporate goals to support this vision are, first, raising standards for all through high-quality teaching and learning and ensuring all young people enjoy and do well in their education, have their progress assessed and have their attainment recognised, including through qualifications.  The second lead corporate goal is closing the performance gap and increasing access and equality, that is to say, addressing the underachievement that exists in the education system and ensuring young people who face barriers or are at risk of social exclusion are supported to achieve their full potential.  It is also about ensuring our education service is planned effectively on an area basis to provide pupils with full access to the curriculum and the entitlement framework.<br/><br/>I will offer the following observations on specific recommendations in the report.  Recommendation No. 3 is on the provision of cognitive and job-specific skills in schools to improve the employability of young people.  One of our key vehicles for raising standards and preparing pupils for the world of work is to ensure every young person has access to a modern, relevant, broad and balanced curriculum.  The statutory curriculum places great emphasis on developing the core skills sought by employers.  It includes all the skills specifically mentioned in the report from primary school onwards: literacy, numeracy, communication, teamwork, problem solving and learning ability.  All schools are required to deliver on these skills and assess and report to parents on children's progress in them.<br/><br/>Employability <i>per se</i>is one of the strands of the learning areas, namely, learning for life and work, LLW, within the statutory curriculum.  It cuts across all learning areas and occupies discrete curriculum time.  It is intended to develop critical thinking and equip enterprising young people with a can-do attitude.<br/><br/>Recommendation No. 4 is on the provision of entrepreneurial education.  Enterprise and entrepreneurship appear in our curriculum from key stage 1 onwards as part of personal development and mutual understanding in primary school and continues within LLW at post-primary level.  The Department of Education funds Young Enterprise NI to support the delivery of this aspect of the curriculum in the form of company-based programmes, master class industry events and classroom-based programmes.  In the 2014 to 2015 period, more than 100,000 pupils accessed the programmes.<br/><br/>Recommendation No. 7 is on the improved provision of career guidance.  The Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning have a shared careers strategy.  The Careers Service works with schools to provide careers advice to young people at crucial decision points, in particular year 12 when they are 15 or 16 years old.  A recent review of the careers strategy has confirmed the strength of our approach and sets out some areas for improvement: the revision of the Careers Service website; the establishment of a regional careers advisory forum, which will bring together employer representatives, education providers, parents and other stakeholders; and the development of a central work experience portal.<br/><br/>Recommendation No. 8 is on enhanced levels of support for those who are disadvantaged, which is a key ministerial priority.  Examples of some of the actions being taken include giving every school the responsibility to address underachievement within their school communities, changes to the school funding formula to allocate additional resources to schools serving high proportions of our most disadvantaged pupils, and the extended schools programme, which allocates approximately &pound;10 million every year to schools serving disadvantaged young people.  This money allows schools to provide additional programmes and support the vital connections between schools and their communities.  Further actions include targeted, time-bound interventions such as the recent Delivering Social Change literacy and numeracy projects, which funded more than 260 additional teachers to support literacy and numeracy outcomes for children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the education works advertising programme, which promotes parental and community involvement in the education of our young people.<br/><br/>I will also refer to the work of the North-South Ministerial Council meeting in its education sector format, which has allowed Ministers to work effectively together across a range of areas of mutual interest for the benefit of pupils in both jurisdictions.  The council has a strong focus on educational underachievement and the Departments have shared their experiences in a practical way through joint events and workshops.  The Ministers, Mr. O'Dowd and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, recently agreed to commission work that would help to progress joint efforts aimed at understanding and addressing educational underachievement.  This work will involve an all-island programme of dissemination of good practice, an independent examination of the work of both Departments and recommendations on further promoting benchmarking and sharing of best practice and experience in this important area.<br/><br/>I hope this short submission provides some illustration of what the Department is doing across the areas highlighted in the report, and I look forward to the discussion and having a more detailed examination of the report over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

My Department makes a key contribution to achieving these outcomes by improving young people's skills and, in so doing, providing a route to sustained employment.  As the committee will appreciate, there are many work streams across my Department.  I hope to give members a flavour of some of the cross-Border activity that is ongoing.  For example, our employment service has well-established links with the Department of Social Protection, sharing developments in policy, programmes and service delivery and exploring opportunities for co-operation.  Both Departments play an active role in the EURES cross-Border partnership, which encourages and supports labour mobility on a cross-Border basis by providing information for workers, jobseekers and employers.  Most recently, the partnership organised a series of cross-Border job fairs and recruitment events in Cavan and Armagh as well as a cross-Border IT recruitment convention for young people in Derry and a speed networking event for employers in Louth to encourage cross-Border trade.</p> <p>  In terms of further education, my Department provides funding every year for several thousand students living in the Republic to undertake courses in Northern Ireland.  The highest concentration of these students appears to be in the Donegal area who attend the North West Regional College.  As Mr. Baldwin mentioned, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills jointly produced a report this year analysing student flows between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Work is under way to develop a leaver survey for the further education sector which will include details of the destinations of learners living in the Republic.  The report details student flows in higher and further education and provides a sound basis for future policy development in both sectors.</p> <p>  This year, organisations based in Northern Ireland secured funding of almost &euro;6 million under the ERASMUS+ programme, allowing many of our young people to study, train and gain work experience internationally.  ERASMUS+, Horizon 2020 and INTERREG V projects run by our higher education institutes and further education colleges include cross-Border mobility projects for students and staff together with the building of strategic partnerships in the Republic.  The colleges are actively seeking partnerships with the education and training boards in preparation for the 2016 ERASMUS+ calls.</p> <p>  Regarding higher education specifically, my Department continues to work with colleagues in the Department of Education to implement recommendations arising from a report on barriers to undergraduate student mobility.  The report was jointly produced by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, and the Confederation of British Industry, CBI.</p><p>Strong relationships have been developed in higher education research through the US Ireland Partnership.</p><p> The youth policy and strategy division of my Department recently published two new strategies for apprenticeships and youth training.  They set out a blueprint for the future of these systems in Northern Ireland.  A number of pilots are currently operating.  When the new systems roll out next year, there will be opportunities for the young people taking part to exchange international knowledge and participate in activities.  This will be beneficial to employers through the sharing of good practice and innovation.  The new apprenticeships are designed to allow for international portability.  We believe this is critical and we have been working closely with Mr. Baldwin and his team in this regard.</p><p> My Department is leading on the development of united youth, an integrated good relations programme for young people who are not in education, employment or training.  The programme is a key commitment in the Northern Ireland Executive strategy, Together: Building a United Community.  A total of 13 pilots are running throughout Northern Ireland at the moment delivered by a range of community and voluntary organisations.  They are testing a range of approaches to achieving our key outcomes, including good relations, personal development, citizenship and employability.  The learning from these pilots will help us to develop a service design framework for the programme after March 2016.  The key elements of the programme will be delivered on a cross-Border basis via a youth initiative with funding secured through the children and young people's standard of PEACE IV.  Under PEACE IV, a working group is being established and this will include representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the National Youth Council of Ireland.</p><p> There are many opportunities for joined-up approaches aimed at both preventing and tackling youth unemployment.  I hope I have given the committee a snapshot of some of the cross-Border initiatives in which my Department is engaged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.828" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1085" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#F00200"><p>I thank the witnesses very much for their submissions.  I am keen to ask some questions.  My first question is for Mr. Peter Baldwin.  Does he agree with the view that there is too much emphasis on academic courses?  Does he think the institutes of technology have lost sight of the original purpose of providing well-trained technicians?  Is academic education serving young people well?</p><p>My next question is for Mr. Parnell.  It relates to Pathways to Work and the Action Plan for Jobs.  What sectors of employment does he believe have been made available?  What is the best strategy in working with his counterparts in Northern Ireland to deal with the question?  Mr. Parnell highlighted significant projects involving two new enterprise centres in Omagh and Carrick-on-Shannon.  What exactly do they entail?  How did he go about the work?  Did he work with the local authority or local groups?  Have they been successful?  One of the areas is part of my constituency, so I am being a little self-indulgent.</p><p>My next question is for Dr. Hughes.  I am keen to hear more detail about the work commissioned jointly by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Education, Mr. O'Dowd, to address educational underachievement.  When is this work due to be completed?  What outcome does Dr. Hughes anticipate?  Will there be a plan of action based on the findings?  What is the level of attainment for integrated schools <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>segregated and shared education schools?</p><p>My final question is for Ms Croskery.  I was not aware that ERASMUS operated so effectively within the further education sector.  Will she go into more detail about the programmes that operate on a North-South basis in the further education area?  Is she involved in any shared degree courses with the Irish universities or further education institutes?  I see considerable potential in this area, for example, with food science or other education areas or schools.</p></speech>

We are keen to see a spectrum of education and training provision that covers a range of needs.  This extends from further education and training, which typically goes up to and includes level 6 on the qualifications framework, to research work at level 10 in the institutes of technology and the universities.</p> <p>  We have discussed nature of the institutes of technology.  Clearly, we want them to retain the mission they have had traditionally, which is a focus on the technological side of things, rather than mission drift into university education, other than the provision now in place for technological universities.  The question is better seen in the context of a full continuum whereby we have recognition of the different needs within enterprise and different skill sets within individuals.  The idea is to provide a spectrum to meet this.</p> <p>  It is true to say we are a largely third level centric society.  When people are doing the leaving certificate, the main focus is on the number of points a student gets for university.  One of the ambitions of the further education and training strategy is to strengthen further education and training provision, including apprenticeships and other models in order that people see the value of further education and training as a route to employment.</p> <p>  There is a degree of activity under the strategy but what is important ultimately is that the value parents and young people put on further education and training is sufficient to ensure a broader view of where to go after school.  This includes a greater appreciation that further education and training can lead not only to a job but a career.  That is at the back of the various elements of the further education and training strategy.</p> <p>  Rather than refer to an excessive emphasis by the institutes of technology on the academic side, there is probably an excessive emphasis on that side within society.  We want to achieve a greater recognition through engaging with employers and through a range of other actions that will increase the value of further education and training while retaining the distinct missions of each of the providers within the education and training sector.  There is an element of not allowing mission drift as well.  We do not need more universities, but we do need a spectrum that meets people's needs.  I hope that answers the Chairman's question.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Mr. Wrynn, to speak about the enterprise centres.  I will address the question on the Action Plan for Jobs and the sectors that have produced jobs.  Over the years the Action Plan for Jobs has focused on a combination of thematic objectives and specific sectors.  The thematic areas on which we have been focusing include improving the skills of the economy, improving entrepreneurship and improving energy efficiency throughout the economy.  There are also specific sectors such as agrifood, manufacturing, tourism, information and communications technology as well as areas like construction and retail.  We have focused on these areas in recent years.  One important development in terms of identifying the sectors that have strength at a local or regional level has been the launch of the new regional action plans for jobs.  Indeed, there will be an action plan for the Border region launched in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The regional plans work closely with industry and education providers in the areas in identifying the particular strengths.  For example, in the west, medical technology and life sciences are particular strengths.  In the south west, there is extensive pharma-chem strength.  The Border region is interesting.  What the Department is trying to do is grow the enterprise base and get companies to scale up.  This is relevant for companies, particularly in the Border region.  They have a unique opportunity to test their exporting potential and trade across the Border.  We are getting down into the granularity of where the jobs are when we go down to the regional level.  There is a real opportunity in this area to try to build on the employment base and keep people working and living in these regions.  My colleague, Mr. Wrynn, will cover the question on the enterprise centres.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.833" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Wrynn" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#F00700"><p>There was a question about the enterprise centres in Omagh and Carrick-on-Shannon.</p><p>The INTERREG programme was all about developing enterprise and it was felt there should be some legacies at the end of it rather than spending all the money on ongoing capacity-building.  Both Carrick-on-Shannon and Omagh could perhaps be considered peripheral in the wider region.  In this regard, a group called the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, was established.  It includes the local authorities in the cross-Border region in the west of Northern Ireland and the midlands in the Republic.  It proposed that what was needed to kick-start start-ups and small businesses in Leitrim and the relevant part of Tyrone was the building of enterprise centres that would serve as incubator units so smaller businesses starting up would have a ready-made facility that was not already in existence.  The Omagh centre was actually an extension of an existing facility that had been built using previous INTERREG funding.  It had been very successful and there was a need for more capacity.  Leitrim County Enterprise Board was very strongly involved with the one in Leitrim.  It was built in Carrick-on-Shannon to provide a base to help start-ups and smaller businesses that had nowhere to locate, and it was also to facilitate mentoring and the offering of support to those businesses.  Obviously, the capital cost of both centres was borne by our Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, with the refund coming back later from the European Union.  The tenants in the premises pay a rent.  It does not cover the capital cost but it will cover the ongoing costs of both centres.  In fact, both have been quite successful although I am sure there was some scepticism initially.  The Leitrim centre, in particular, had a very good take-up.  Many businesses are located there and the prospects are good.</p></speech>

It is nice to see a project achieving its potential.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Hughes" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#G00300"><p>The first question was on the joint work on addressing educational underachievement.  In both education systems, very similar patterns of underachievement arising from social disadvantage have been recognised and are being addressed.  Over the past couple of years, there has been a sharing of the experience of quite different models of addressing the patterns.  What has been going on in school classrooms and communities has been very similar.  We have had the benefit of having been briefed on the evaluation of the data project, in particular.  Likewise, we have had briefings with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills on programmes that have been implemented in the North.  The conclusion was very clearly that both education systems know how to address similar problems.  The overall structures may be different within the different systems but there are very similar interventions at school level.  The greatest value of working together is actually increased sharing of experience and good practice, so it is not just a question of policymakers talking to policymakers but teachers and managers in schools talking to teachers and managers in schools who are facing very similar issues.</p> <p>  The proposed way forward has been to go to tender for external support to organise a programme of teacher professional development and dissemination of good practice, including at least one event.  Although events are not always the most efficient way of getting information out, they can be very effective.  There are other dissemination models.  It was proposed that there be a report at the end on the learning from the whole process.  A particular feature has been drawing on work the two inspectorates have done on best practice in respect of literacy and numeracy.  That work was being done quite separately.  The two inspectorates worked together very closely on many issues.  They are finishing reports on good practice regarding literacy and numeracy.  It was felt that if we are to purchase an engagement process pertaining to educational underachievement, the work on literacy and numeracy would fit in perfectly with that.  It was suggested that the two strands be put together and that the programme be purchased.  This is progressing.  We expect the invitations to tender to be issued in the next month or two.</p></speech>

As I said, Colleges Northern Ireland is the umbrella body for the six further education colleges in Northern Ireland.  It has been working on taking forward Erasmus+, Horizon 2020 and INTERREG projects.  It has developed a series of strategic partnerships, including with the institutes of technology in Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Dundalk, to put in joint bids to boost skills and employability, including in terms of training and youth work.  South West College proceeded with a &pound;3 million bid under INTERREG IVA.  It worked in partnership with the institutes of technology in Sligo and Cavan, and Dumfries and Galloway College.  Through that, CREST is focused on research and development facilities for small enterprises.  It was a very successful bid.  Colleges Northern Ireland, through Dr. Alan Blair, is currently collaborating with its counterparts to put forward a series of bids this year for Erasmus+.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about shared degrees.  I have no details to hand on shared degrees.  We can provide the information at a later date. </p> <p>  With regard to the Northern Ireland policy for higher education, Graduating to Success, the importance of cross-Border co-operation is highlighted clearly, along with undergraduate mobility between institutes in Northern Ireland and the Republic, from economic, cultural and social perspectives.  We are committed to working on an all-Ireland basis to remove the barriers, be they real or perceived, to encourage student mobility and support higher education institutes in collaborating on both teaching and learning on a cross-Border basis.  We have been working with the Department of Education and Skills very closely on the implementation of the recommendations of the IBEC&ndash;CBI report, to which I referred.  It considers barriers to undergraduate student mobility.  We will continue to examine this.</p></speech>

I certainly agree with the point Mr. Baldwin made on the Department's view that keeping young people at school for as long as possible is vital in reducing youth unemployment.  There was a feeling many years ago, perhaps when I was teaching, which is a long time ago, that there were pupils of a certain age who might be inclined to take up apprenticeships after the intermediate certificate examinations.  Is it possible that apprenticeship courses could start a little earlier, as in after the junior certificate examinations?  Could support be given to those interested in such apprenticeships so they might continue in education?</p> <p>  At an earlier meeting on education, Deputy Brendan Smith, who apologises for being unable to attend today, raised cross-Border co-operation between schools, particularly schools that are very close to the Border.  Has anything happened on that?  I am referring to very basic provisions such as school transport, the type of curriculum and model of school that would be involved in this catchment area.</p> <p>  In my county, County Galway, there is almost a battle for land between schools and industry.  I am wondering whether our visitors could enlighten us on this.  I could give an example from Galway where a motorway has opened up great possibilities for using extra land.  State lands have been cut in two and there are opportunities for more development.  At public meetings held by people who want to promote a school, one is almost asked whether one is for jobs or for a school.  Of course, the answer is probably that one needs both.</p><p>I find it hard to believe that sometimes there are objections from industry to a school, but that is actually happening in Galway.  I do not know why people do not just sit around the table and say: "We'll have the factory here and we'll have the school there."  We are fortunate in County Galway that Apple is coming to the town of Athenry.  Because it is felt that more industry will follow, the provision of a school will be difficult.  One can talk about co-location, and I am all for that, but it is proving to be a real problem unless people sit down to talk.  I do not know whether the same situation exists in other parts of the country.  </p><p> I have the honour of chairing Leaders' Questions at noon, so I will have to go before this meeting is over.  I want to thank the witness, however, for a very interesting presentation.</p></speech>

Youth unemployment is higher in disadvantaged areas and communities that suffered greatly in the conflict and the lead-up to the Good Friday Agreement.  I would like to explore what joint work has been done for areas with high unemployment rates, including Derry, Strabane and my own constituency of west Belfast.  North Belfast is another area with high unemployment and high youth unemployment rates.  Are specific works going on in those areas?  In my own constituency, for example, educational attainment has increased, which is a good sign.  That is because disadvantaged areas were specifically targeted with resources.  Unfortunately, I cannot say that for the Department for Employment and Learning because I do not see exactly what different approaches are being taken.  It would be good to try to explore that matter.  It is not a criticism, just a question. </p> <p>  I attended an event recently in Belfast City Hall for the Belfast Works project.  It is a first-class project which is supported by the Northern Ireland Department for Employment and Learning.  Within six months of its initiation 339 jobs have been created, which is a welcome sign.  The big problem moving into next year is that funding for Local Employment Intermediary Service, LEMIS, projects is reliant on matched funding, which is a serious issue for many of the organisations that work on that scheme.  I would like to get some thoughts from Ms Croskery on some of those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.844" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#H00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses here this morning.  To follow up on what Mr. Maskey said, how often do representatives of the different structures meet?  It is a pity that the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, had to leave because he would have had a better insight on co-operation at ministerial level.  How flexible are the systems for meeting counterparts?  If something is working in one area, North or South, I presume those involved will exchange information, but how flexible is the system in trying to change or adapt to this?</p> <p>  Apprenticeships were mentioned, but during the recession the construction industry collapsed, and everyone said there was a need to move away from the standard apprenticeships that had served us well over the years.  Mr. Baldwin said there were 25 new apprenticeship systems, but do they represent 25 new programmes?  Models were cited, including the German apprenticeship system.  The advantage is that if a young person wants to be an apprentice electrician and it does not suit them, they can adapt within the system itself.  It is much more difficult to do so within the Irish system.  That is why I am trying to find out about the level of flexibility in the system.  It took us years to change over from this system.  At the time, young apprentices said that getting practical experience was a huge problem.  Some of us suggested bringing them into local authorities to obtain practical skills there, but how adaptable is that system?</p> <p>  The fall in youth unemployment was referred to, as well as young people staying at school and entering higher education.  As we know, there is a price for families whose children stay on at school.  Figures are given comparing the European model with what is happening in Ireland, where more people are staying on at school.  We have also been given figures for the number of young unemployed people.  In Ireland, the safety valve has always been emigration; this would not be the same in other European countries.  </p> <p>  When members of this committee visited Belfast we examined various disadvantaged areas.  Dr. Peter Shirlow provided figures for young people from a Protestant background who were doing well at school but then left the North.  Figures were cited on the positive changes that are happening in disadvantaged areas, but is that still the pattern for young people from a Protestant, loyalist or Unionist background?  Are they still leaving for Scotland or England?  What is being done to try to keep such young people in employment in Northern Ireland?</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the one-size-fits-all system of second-chance education.  If one talks to people involved in second-chance education, particularly those in training, they say the system is not very flexible.  I recently spoke to a teacher in my own constituency in Tallaght.  He said that funding is available for second-chance education targeting those who have dropped out of school, including a one-to-one teacher-pupil ratio.  The big problem, however, is to try to draw down such funding.  Are there similar systems in the North, besides the usual school structures, to keep young people in education?  Is there anything we can learn from their system?  </p> <p>  It is all about sharing experience.  I am aware of the strides that have been made in education in Scotland, so is there a tie-in between the North and other systems in Britain?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.845" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1156" speakername="Mary White" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#H00500"><p>I thank all the witnesses for attending the committee today.  It is fabulous to see both sides of the island coming together to talk sense and see what we can do.  The figure I have for youth unemployment for October 2015 is 19.7%.  Having started a business in the late 1980s, I saw the dramatic change that it makes in people's lives when they get a job.  Their self-confidence and demeanour improve.</p><p>It is not just about getting money, it is about meeting other people, socialising and having a break for coffee.  It is somewhere they can go every day.  We have 37,000 young people unemployed.  It is not just a number.  For each person in that group it is a very traumatic life to be living.  Where I live in Dundrum, I come across people who may or may not have done their leaving certificate and who are floating around.  They do not know what to do with themselves and they have not found what they want to do.  It is very wearisome.  How the hell does one get them to get into some course or something and to keep going?  If they remain outside the system and become disadvantaged, that is where trouble starts.</p><p> Will Mr. Baldwin bring us up to date on the apprenticeships and what has happened in this regard?  These young people I am talking about would be very interested in them.  One young person wants to be in forestry, but how does he get into it?  I would love to hear about the apprenticeships and it is tremendous we are starting it.</p><p> I have said numerous times at the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that we have to keep our eye on the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  I asked a LEO to help somebody last week and I thought I was getting across that we need personal support, but all the person got was a letter and a website number.  I was shocked because I saw a great opportunity to help a person develop their business.  I would have thought an official would go and meet the person.  It takes energy to do that, but I was very disappointed that they were told just to look up the website.  Could Mr. Parnell respond to that?</p><p> I would like to ask Ms Croskery whether it is still the case that there is no recognition for the GCSE and so on in this jurisdiction.  What has happened in this regard?  We had some reference to that in this committee and the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Are we now recognising the third level qualifications in the North?  She said that 13 pilot programmes are currently running across Northern Ireland.  Unemployment is such a serious issue for any human being that I would think pilot programmes would be made into full-blown programmes as soon as possible.  I am very passionate about jobs and employment, having had the hands-on experience I have had.  I still come across people who do not have jobs and who have nowhere to go every day.  They stay in bed and there is no inclination to get up.  People become bitter and dissatisfied and that can lead to other, more serious issues in society.  They may not have liked school and may have left early.  Perhaps they could not stick secondary school.</p><p> It is a great occasion today.  I am delighted to be here.  I wish all the witnesses the best and thank them very much.</p></speech>

I am continually perplexed as to why west Belfast has never broken out of the cycle of unemployment.  I just do not understand it.  What the hell is holding it back?  I know there is a cultural problem there and I understand that, but why is the system in the North not trying passionately to help the people there?  I am not asking Ms Croskery to solve the world's problems, but I would like some help on that.  It is the most disadvantaged area in the UK.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.849" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maskey" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#J00400"><p>On that point, I can inform the Senator that west Belfast no longer has the highest unemployment rate, even in the North of Ireland.  We have managed to reduce it by a number of percentage points over recent years.  Foyle in Derry now has the highest unemployment rate.  That is for many different reasons, but the Senator is right and we want to see an increased level of apprenticeships.  That is what today is about.</p> <p>  I want to speak about some of the social clauses that, for example, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure proposed in regard to stadia.  It is to be hoped Casement Park will be built in west Belfast.  That is out for consultation now and we will be starting it in the very near future.  Will they be working closely with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure with regard to trying to get apprenticeships in?  The new social clauses within those contracts for the stadia are some of the hardest and most costed measures from which we will get the most benefit.  That is earmarked for apprenticeships.  It is also specified that if the contractor does not fulfil his or her obligations, he or she can be taken to court and that will probably be the first time.  What collaboration is there between the two departments to reduce unemployment even further in those areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.850" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1085" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#J00500"><p>Adding to that, this committee probably believes that apprentices should be given enhanced status.  There is a saying for people within the trade that they have been dumbed down over the years for some reason.  Do the witnesses agree that SOLAS or the institutes of technology are the best places to deliver these courses?  Mr. Parnell rightly said that sometimes we are looking in smaller and regional areas for the big factory to come in.  I have found that by addressing the industries that are there, many of them are now taking on extra staff.  It is sometimes going unnoticed.  We all want the factory that employs 100 people, whereas the existing industry that employs 60 or 70 people or that takes on 30 or 40 may not be highlighted.  The members have posed many questions, so I am looking forward to some answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Baldwin" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#J00600"><p>I thank the Chairman.  First, on Deputy Kitt's question regarding young people moving into apprenticeships after the junior certificate, we still have the objective that young people would complete their leaving certificate.  The apprenticeship review group endorsed that as a legitimate objective and agreed that the time to go into an apprenticeship should be after the leaving certificate.  There are issues around the curriculum at both junior and senior cycle which might better address the different skill sets of individuals in terms of preparation for apprenticeship, but we would still have the overall objective that people would complete it.  People can, however, still go into apprenticeships and education and training boards, ETBs, do have the potential to offer, for example, pre-apprenticeship courses or apprenticeship sampling courses.</p> <p>  In respect of co-operation between schools, which was raised by Deputy Brendan Smith, there are difficulties around different curricula and so on, and in terms of school transport, there are issues around different starting times and so on.  The most fruitful area for co-operation is probably professional collaboration, because ultimately what happens in the classroom dictates the quality of the outcomes for children and work is being done on a North-South basis in terms of professional collaboration around issues of disadvantage.</p> <p>  On planning for schools, we now have quite a sophisticated planning apparatus in our planning and building unit in Tullamore.  There is a GIS system that looks at all the demographic data throughout the country.  There is also a working arrangement with county managers in terms of future planning, so that should assist, but I do not doubt that conflicts arise locally on occasion.  It is hoped this apparatus will minimise the occurrence of such conflicts.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe rightly identified the problems we had before with apprenticeships being demand-led.  This meant that in the aftermath of the construction boom, we ended up with many apprentices who had to be assisted in seeing out their apprenticeships.  In fairness to F&Aacute;S, while there were many well-documented issues with it, it did put a huge range of measures in place to facilitate apprentices seeing out their apprenticeship and qualifying.</p><p>We are very conscious of it as we go forward into the new apprenticeships.  With a demand-led scheme, there is no way of smoothing it out.  With the new apprentices, we will be starting with approved numbers rather than taking a demand-led approach.  It must be employer-led, given that an apprenticeship is a contract of employment and an employer must step up to the plate.</p><p> The areas are accountancy, butchery, technical, travel, telecommunications, network engineering, information technology, financial services, hospitality, manufacturing and engineering.  New apprenticeships have been identified in the first 25.  There was a call for proposals and a group of 25 were identified as those that would be amenable to quicker development than the others which needed more development.  The 25 are in a range of different areas and the idea is that funding will be given to them to develop.  There is an amount of work to be done to develop the curricula and the on-the-job part, and money will be given to develop it.  It is hoped that recruitment in those will occur in 2016.  They are different areas and will begin with specified numbers.</p><p> One of the key issues around the new apprenticeships is sustainability.  We have hammered at this from the beginning.  If we are to persuade the young people of Ireland, and their mothers and fathers, that our new apprenticeships are a valid way to go, it must be a sustainable career.  The commitment by the employers and industry sectors will be crucial.  This is one of the key elements.  We hope the initial ones would be sustainable within the numbers that are approved.</p><p> Mr. Maskey asked about dealing with educational attainment and high unemployment.  In terms of the North-South issue, the co-operation around disadvantage might best facilitate attention to disadvantage on both sides of the Border.  Senator White raised the issue of youth unemployment.  During the recession there was not a family in Ireland that was not touched by unemployment and the effect long-term absence from education, training or employment can have on a young person.  The first point of contact for young people is the Department of Social Protection's Intreo service.  The Youth Guarantee promotes engagement with young people who have been out of the workforce, particularly those with a low probability of exit from unemployment.  Where we work with them, there is a protocol between the education and training boards, ETBs, and the Intreo service to facilitate referral of all unemployed people, particularly the long-term or young unemployed, to appropriate education and training provision.</p></speech>

These are young people who are somewhat disadvantaged, the people who hated school.  When they attend Intreo, they fall out with the contact person.</p></speech>

Mr. Maskey raised youth unemployment, particularly in areas of very high unemployment in Northern Ireland, and I will outline a range of measures we are taking.  Mr. Maskey will be aware of our strategy for people not in education, employment or training, NEET, launched in May 2012, which is a cross-departmental strategy to deal with the NEET situation.  Reading the report of the committee, one can clearly see the percentages of NEET in Northern Ireland, 14.1%, and in Border regions, 18.3%.  It is a very common issue across our island.  The strategy has three tiers: preventing young people from missing opportunities for education and training; helping people in the 16 to 18 age group, especially those facing barriers; and assisting the unemployed young people.  From this year, we have been funding the NEET strategy through the European Social Fund.</p> <p>  Mr. Maskey mentioned the Local Employment Intermediary Service, LEMIS.  LEMIS is continuing.  We published a very detailed evaluation of our NEET strategy and will come forward with a refresh following this evaluation.  A part of my challenge, we are looking at how we join up the employability piece with united youth, examining the two funding streams, PEACE IV and the European Social Fund, particularly moving towards the next call in 2017 and 2018, so we give a holistic approach to our NEET young people in Northern Ireland, using PEACE IV for the citizenship and good relations aspect on a cross-Border basis.  We are seeking to work in partnership with the Border regions.  We have been working very closely with the Youth Council of Ireland to see how we might go forward with it.</p> <p>  We have had our careers review in Northern Ireland.  We are working in partnership with the Northern Ireland Minister for Education, Mr. John O'Dowd, MLA, and have guaranteed all our young people in Northern Ireland impartial guidance in their final year of school.  Some 95% of young people have taken up the offer.  We have a Youth Guarantee through our training for success programme, which guarantees every young person in Northern Ireland aged 16 to 17 an opportunity of a training place.  I have 13 united youth pilots across Northern Ireland, including in areas of high NEET youth unemployment.  We are very excited.  Initial feedback has shown that innovative approaches from voluntary and community sectors are coming forward using a range of measures to engage young people who have had a very bad experience in the education sector, using, for example, shared support in a number of very innovative ways, examining our shared identity and employability needs.  The young people are able to avail of their benefits, which is exciting.  We are paying a stipend with it.  It is an innovative approach.</p> <p>  We had a target of 365 young people.  The pilot was launched at the end of August and approximately 290 young people have been recruited to united youth so far.  My department has just finished a root-and-branch review of apprenticeship and youth training in Northern Ireland and we are coming forward with a new system of learning at level 2.  The review of youth training at level 2, which will replace a range of interventions we had, will provide a professional and technical system of learning for our young people who do not have five GCSEs including maths and English.  It reflects the dual aims of the system.  It will provide young people with a solid foundation of skills, experience and qualifications that are recognised and valued by employers relevant to today's labour market.  The broad-based skills will include work-based learning either through an employed or non-employed, virtual route.</p><p>As I have said, it will be focused on all young people in Northern Ireland between the ages of 16 and 24 who do not hold five GCSEs, including maths and English.  We are very excited about this concept.  The new professional and technical system of learning that is being built will be equal to the academic route and will be recognised by the academic route.  The advisory forum we have set up in partnership with employers and trade unions will ensure employers are central to this process.  It will help to inform the curriculum to ensure we get it right.  This new system will allow for progression into an apprenticeship or into sustained employment.  We have had a radical root-and-branch reform of our apprenticeships.  A brand new system will be in place from September 2016.  We see this as a parallel route of equal value that will allow young people to go through level 3 apprenticeships or sub-degree apprenticeships through higher-level apprenticeships.  It will allow them to move into new jobs and roles throughout their careers.  It will allow them to progress all the way to level 8, which is PhD level, with their qualifications recognised as part of the system.</p><p> This is the most radical thing that the current Minister or any Minister in Northern Ireland has ever been involved in and we are very excited about it.  We are working with our partners in the Northern Ireland Department of Education.  We are aware that issues can arise when young people make choices at the age of 14.  If we have a good, robust, distinctive, professional and technical qualifications route, young people will be able to choose an alternative pathway that will offer value in terms of seamless progression right through to higher education, with work-based learning being built around that.  The Northern Ireland Minister for Employment and Learning, Dr. Stephen Farry, launched a skills barometer in Northern Ireland a fortnight ago.  This initiative, which is being taken forward by the University of Ulster's centre of economic policy, is setting out for our Department and for Northern Ireland what the skills demands of the Northern Ireland economy are going to be from now until 2025.  It will be refreshed on a constant basis.  We are now able to look at how we can better match demand with supply with regard to particular pockets of unemployment in Northern Ireland.</p><p> We make sure the funding we invest is targeted where it is needed.  We provide generous funding levels in areas where we know there will be jobs that will be able to command the commensurate salary of a technically well-skilled young person.  We are working hard on that.  We have invested significantly in west Belfast.  We built a brand new further education campus, known as e3, there.  It has been one of the most successful investments we have made in terms of really turning around education and skills training in Northern Ireland.  Investment has been made in cutting-edge equipment there.  I have to say that people are travelling across Belfast and from further afield to west Belfast to avail of the specialist training offered at the campus.  For example, training in the specialist area of composites is provided there.</p><p> I can respond to Mr. Maskey's question by firmly saying that we are working with the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.  We have had discussions about piloting new level 3 apprenticeships this year through the change fund in Northern Ireland.  Our Minister was able to secure &euro;7.5 million.  We are piloting between 350 and 400 higher-level apprenticeships at sub-degree level.  This is quite a new approach for Northern Ireland.  Those apprenticeships will allow seamless progression into higher education, university degrees and even as far as PhD level.  We are working with the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to see how we might do that through all the social clauses and contracts.  I hope I have given a good broad view of what we are doing.</p><p> Senator White asked specifically about the 13 pilot programmes.  We are totally committed to moving forward with the united youth programme.  We are using PEACE IV funding for the youth initiative aspect of that programme.  This allows our neighbours in the Border areas to avail of that funding.  We work in partnership.  As I have said, the activities of the first working group that will be given this money will kick off around the first week of December.  I will chair that group, which is looking forward to developing an innovative programme using the information from the pilot programmes.  It is no longer a case of one size fits all.  We will use all the different learning to ascertain what works.  No single pilot programme can best be taken in isolation.  We will pick the bits that work best and focus on them.  I have to say that the pilot programmes have been particularly useful in areas where there are many young people who are not in education, employment or training and where there are high levels of deprivation as well.  We are doing all we can there.</p></speech>

She asked how young people find their way into certain sectors, such as forestry.  It is clear that career guidance has a big part to play in this regard, as has the industry itself.  There is a high level of churn in certain sectors, such as hospitality and retail, as people move around.  Such sectors can encounter difficulties in recruiting people for certain positions.  One of the recurring themes I am seeing through the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs is that industry can play a role in promoting certain sectors and in making it clear that there is a progression path in those sectors.  It needs to be emphasised that people who enter the retail sector, for example, at the lowest level can rise to management level and earn handsome salaries.  There is a clear role for career guidance teachers and industry itself.  Perhaps we will see this developing over the coming months, for example, through the regional action plans for jobs and the regional skills forums, which are organised by the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned the local enterprise offices.  I understand what she is saying about the level of service.  The local enterprise offices are in their second year of operation and have gone through a process of change.  The level of resources available to individual offices has varied because of the constraints on the number of staff that could be employed.  Having said that, the objective of the Department working with the local authorities is to ensure there is a standardised quality of service.  It was my understanding that the local enterprise offices would be able to provide named contacts in other areas.  There would be a named contact to deal with a revenue issue, for example.  I assure the Senator that the Department is very conscious of the issue of standardised quality across the system.  We have been working on that issue since the initial establishment and bedding down of the local enterprise offices.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe asked about the level of engagement between the North and the South.  My colleague, Mr. Wrynn, might say a few words about the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's involvement and collaboration with its counterparts in the North of Ireland.</p></speech>

First, we work with them on the management of InterTrade Ireland.  We co-fund that body and we agree its programmes and wider strategies.  There is constant engagement on that front.  We have regular meetings in Belfast or Dublin with our counterpart officials.  Second, we both fund the enterprise strand of INTERREG.  There is a similar level of co-operation in that regard.  Representatives of both Departments sit on various committees that are run by the EU managing authority.  Representatives of other Departments in the North and the South sit on that group as well.  At a more senior level, the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation meets his counterpart - the permanent secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment - a couple of times a year to discuss issues of mutual interest and to share experiences.  At a political level, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, meets his counterpart - the new Northern Ireland Minister in this area is Jonathan Bell - as part of the trade and business strand of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Their next meeting will take place in Armagh next week.  Overall, there is a pretty comprehensive level of engagement.</p></speech>

The questions on how to keep young people in education have been answered from the perspective of the end of compulsory education, as it were.  From the perspective of schools, however, there are a number of strategies we would adopt that have the impact of maintaining what one might call traction with compulsory education.  The critical one is the degree of freedom schools have to devise a school curriculum that suits their particular intake.  The statutory curriculum is quite minimal in content, so the school curriculum can be developed quite flexibly around that.  We maintain an open market in qualifications.  There is an enormous array of qualifications that schools can work towards, particularly at post-primary level.</p> <p>  The one requirement we place on post-primary schools, which has a particular impact in this area, is that all young people have an entitlement to access to, or an offer of, a minimum number of courses both at key stage 4, which is years 11 and 12, and at the post-16 stage, which is years 13 and 14.  At key stage 4, which is now in place in full for the first time in this academic year, all young people are entitled to an offer from their school of 24 courses, and 27 courses at post-16 stage.  Those courses do not have to be delivered by the school, but they must be offered.  That is done in collaboration with other schools and with FE.  That idea of breadth and range means that there must be something that suits.  If it means that a young person continues to go to school to do whatever it is that they are really keen on, they will also continue with their English, mathematics and so forth.</p></speech>

That breadth of opportunity is a very important part of it.</p> <p>  The relationship between the Department of Education and Skills and the Northern Ireland Department of Education is very similar to what has just been described.  Obviously, there is political engagement and regular engagement at a high level.  There is also simply picking up the telephone to say: "We are up to this.  Can you let us know what are you doing in that area?".  That type of engagement and dialogue happens regularly.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point about west Belfast.  The levels of educational attainment in west Belfast are increasing very impressively.  There are a number of factors in that regard which we recognise, one of which is the degree of community buy-in to the importance of education.  It is not schools alone doing it; there is a great deal of community buy-in.  In west Belfast there has been a piloted approach to co-operation between schools.  All post-primary schools belong to clusters and there are 30 area learning communities.  Some of them are very effective, some are a little looser, some adopt many roles and some of them keep themselves quite focused.  In west Belfast an effort has been made to expand the degree to which the schools are working together, so there are groups of not just principals and vice-principals but also of heads of departments.  The special educational needs co-ordinators meet, as do the curriculum devisers.  They are also now extending into the primary schools and nursery schools.</p> <p>  That has been ongoing and that work has made a real impact.  There is a cohesion to educational delivery and real buy-in.  I am not saying west Belfast is unique in that, but this programme is unique.  We hope it will not be unique for much longer.  We will see where it goes.  If one day the issue of unemployment is transformed, I expect it will be because the attitude towards education has taken so many steps forward.</p></speech>

I appreciate seeing the committee in action and listening to some of the evidence presented in the previous session.</p> <p>  I will make some brief remarks on the thought processes that went into developing the Bill.  The Good Friday Agreement, the implementation of which is the focus of the committee, was about addressing historical divisions in Northern Ireland.  The Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Bill is, in no small measure, about how we continue to address the divisions in Northern Ireland by moving from a system of governance to good government that is delivering for people.  In the past three years, we had the Haass talks, the first Stormont House Agreement and, more recently, a second Stormont House Agreement.  There is widespread recognition, and not only among politicians, that we have lurched from crisis to crisis for almost 18 years. </p> <p>  At the next election, some of those who will vote will have been born after the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  How have our institutions evolved or changed to ensure we can deliver good government?  The rationale for the Bill was to address the question of how to deliver on good governance and reform of the way in which the Executive operates.  I am pleased that significant differences have emerged between the provisions made in the Stormont House Agreement of last year and the recent Stormont House Agreement, known as A Fresh Start.  These differences are related in no small measure to the Bill and the agenda it sought to push in areas such as speaking rights and recognition of the Opposition.  While the agreement does not go as far as I would like it to go, the Bill certainly pushed parties and the Governments in the direction of thinking about the issue. </p> <p>  In forming the Executive, I would like a programme for government with broad budget headlines to be agreed before Ministers take office.  I would allow up to four weeks for this to be achieved.  There is broad agreement in the document, A Fresh Start, agreed at Stormont House that this must happen and that the programme for government must be set out in a way that is much more outcome-based.  There has been broad acceptance among all political parties on that issue. </p> <p>  The Bill also seeks to introduce collective responsibility, an issue with which people down here are familiar.  It is in the Irish Constitution that the Government will act as one unit.  The Bill proposes to rename the Offices of the First and Deputy First Ministers.  I believe there is a major debate to be had on whether the current position entrenches to some degree the tribal nature of our politics, as we all know the two offices are completely equal.</p> <p>  The Bill also seeks to introduce a hybrid system which adheres to the d'Hondt system in that once a party reaches a certain threshold, it will have the right, under the d'Hondt calculation, to be in government, while setting a lower threshold which would allow a party to negotiate its way into government, albeit without having an absolute right to do so.  Nevertheless, parties would have an absolute right to be included in the political process.  This proposal adheres to the key strands of the Good Friday Agreement and reflects its principles on inclusivity.  If a party achieves a higher level of electoral support, it would have an absolute right to be in government, whereas a party with a slightly lower level of electoral support would have an absolute right to be in the political process and could act as an effective opposition.  </p> <p>  On the reform of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Bill proposes to enhance speaking rights for the opposition - for example, by setting aside Opposition days for debates.  It would create roles of leader and deputy leader.  The Bill passed Second Stage on 12 October and is currently going through Committee Stage.  I accept that the language used - "leader" and "deputy leader" of the Opposition - reflects the traditional parliamentary system much more than the consociational model.  I will probably seek, through discussion with other parties, to change the language to have party leaders or the leader of the largest non-Executive party.  </p> <p>  The Bill would also ensure that the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee would come from a non-government party - that is, an opposition party.  It also proposes the creation of a budget committee.  One of the issues with which many legislators grapple is how to give adequate scrutiny to the budget process.  Most of us probably find that we struggle to do the budgetary process much justice.  A report produced some years ago by the Committee for Finance and Personnel accepted that this was the case and set out a number of options, but no changes were implemented.  This will be important if we move towards acquiring greater tax-varying powers or if greater fiscal devolution to the Northern Ireland Assembly takes place.  In that regard, corporation tax is the issue alluded to in the first Stormont House Agreement and A Fresh Start.</p> <p>  The Bill also proposes to introduce the possibility of creating technical groups.  I understand seven of 166 Members of the D&aacute;il, or 4% of the D&aacute;il's membership, are required to register for a technical group.  I have proposed a threshold of 5% for the Assembly.  We have used a 5% threshold which would allow qualifying parties to be in opposition.  My slight criticism of the proposals on opposition in A Fresh Start is that they only really allow a party which qualifies for but then opts out of government to form an opposition.</p> <p>  The reduction to nine in the number of Departments provided for in A Fresh Start is welcome.  It will, however, make it more difficult for some of the smaller parties to secure a ministerial post under the d'Hondt mechanism because fewer ministerial posts are available.</p><p>In the 2011 Assembly election, for example, the Alliance Party would not have qualified under the d'Hondt calculation.  It is important that if it or other parties - whether the Ulster Unionists or the SDLP - ever fell out of the process, they would still be recognised.  It is important to use the 5% or six members provision to allow that.</p><p> Some of the issues that have been problematic for us over the years have also been written into the Bill.  I now feel it is time to move away from community designation.  I accept that will be controversial for some parties but we certainly need a debate.  Judging from the responses from the committee, from academics and across the board it has stoked an awful lot of debate.  It begs the question of what we were using community designation for.  Is it simply copper-fastening our communal divide?  </p><p> I want to replace the petitions of concern mechanism with a minority protection mechanism requiring 30 signatures from three different parties.  A Fresh Start has addressed the petitions of concern problem with a protocol but that is not strong enough.  We need some protection mechanism but we also need it to be used when one garners wider support.  As regards the move from the cross-community designation vote to a weighted majority vote, I propose 60% but that could be varied or set at the start of each mandate.</p><p> The Bill would run and stick with d'Hondt but would seek to run d'Hondt as one piece through the executive committee chairs.  This means if one opted out of the executive one could pick a committee chair and the Opposition parties would end up with a larger selection of committee chairs.  Members who have followed the Bill will notice that----- </p></speech>

We can do much of what is in the Bill in the Northern Ireland Assembly but we need the Secretary of State to change the 1998 Act for parts of it.  She indicated, in a letter to me of almost a year ago, that if broad cross-party support is achieved in the Assembly, she would be happy to make those changes.  From the start, the Bill was about making parties move to a point where they had to vote "Yes" or "No" and to decide what they can and cannot accept to make sure something happens.  The Assembly has a tremendous track record of producing reports and looking at things but of not actually getting to the point of doing anything.</p> <p>  It also changes the way we elect the Speaker.  The Ceann Comhairle, elected by Members of the D&aacute;il, is automatically returned to the next D&aacute;il.  The current Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly is not seeking re-election but, if he were, he would have to go back and get selected by his own party and face the electorate again.  In the House of Commons, the Speaker is re-elected but traditionally does not face any electoral challenge.  It also causes a difficulty when the Speaker cannot write to Ministers or question Ministers in the same way that Deputies, MPs or MLAs can.  I propose that we elect the Speaker by secret ballot in a weighted majority vote.  The Houses of Commons use a secret ballot, which is an idea I like because the speakership should not be a gift of the Executive arm of Government but of the backbenchers and members of the legislature.  The Speaker is out of the party and of constituency politics and we would like to replace him or her, filling the seat with a Member from the party from which he or she was elected.</p> <p>  I will run through the various clauses in the Bill.  It starts with the purpose of the Act and addresses how the Opposition is formed, the timing of the Opposition and when people can opt in.  People make a decision at the start of the mandate as to whether they are going into Government or into Opposition.  Following some of the committee scrutiny, we will look at whether we can create space if some Members do not want to be identified as being in Opposition.  On the question of the dissolution of the Opposition, if there is no executive to hold to account there can be no Opposition.  We are looking at amendments concerning the Leader of the Opposition and are considering changing the language to a more consociational form, such as in Scotland and Wales where they have a leader of the largest non-executive party, or in the D&aacute;il where there are simply Leaders' Questions.  Topical questions and Question Time will be split, allowing an unballoted question from the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and a similar provision has been built into the fresh start agreement, which I welcome.</p> <p>  Speaking rights would be slightly amended so that when Government and Opposition are established we will increase Opposition speaking rights by 20% at the expense of Government time, meaning no more Assembly time would be needed.  The Opposition would also have the right to chair the public accounts committee and to be on the business committee and we would use the financial review panel to look at the money allocated to Opposition parties and salaries for office holders in the Opposition.</p> <p>  There are clauses around how the Assembly and Executive reform motion is tabled and there is a provision on the right to form a technical group, which is a very important development for independents and small parties as it would give them some voice and the right to be represented on the business committee.  It is important because at present, as an Independent Unionist, I have no way of tabling a motion whereas a technical group would be entitled to do so, though not particularly often.  Members will be very familiar with that concept and its technical group might be the largest Opposition group in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with 20 or 21 Members, almost equal to the official number.  The technical group would not, however, have precedence over a political party so Fianna F&aacute;il, the largest party in Opposition in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, would remain so even if the technical group was bigger.</p> <p>  Renaming the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister is also suggested and the various parts of the motion are set out.  These include: the removal of community designation; changes to petitions of concerns; the way the speaker is elected given the reference to our current speaker's letter in response to the Bill; the question of adding deputy speakers elected by secret ballot with a weighted majority; collective Cabinet responsibility; the threshold for nomination of Ministers; agreeing a programme for Government up to four weeks before running d'Hondt; and enabling the budget to be passed by a simple majority.</p> <p>  There is much I welcome in fresh start and the Bill has moved the debate forward but this goes significantly further in how we can continue to address our historic divisions and deliver good, effective governance on the very issues on which the Chairman questioned officials when I was in the Gallery.</p></speech>

I suspect some of the issues have been resolved with the so-called fresh start for the Stormont House Agreement, but before I ask a few questions I invite Mr. Maskey to speak.</p></speech>

I refer to some of the figures and how Mr. McCallister came up with some of the percentages.  The Bill refers to the introduction of a threshold.  It stipulates that political parties must gain 16.6%, which is 18 out of 108 MLAs.  How was that figure arrived at?  In the fresh start document it is proposed to reduce the number of MLAs to five, rather than six, per constituency.  What does that mean for the Bill?</p> <p>  I am glad the Bill has reached Second Stage.  There will be time to work through it and take evidence.  I chaired the Public Accounts Committee for about five years and we scrutinised all Departments, including those with which my party colleagues were involved.  Not once did we get any criticism about taking a fair and equitable approach with regard to the public accounts and scrutiny of all Departments.  Over the years the Public Accounts Committee has allowed political parties to work together and leave their political baggage at the door of the committee room.  That is a good thing because of the circumstances of our past.  There was a certain level of mistrust, but the Public Accounts Committee has allowed trust to build up over the years.  I ask Mr. McCallister for his thoughts on my comments.</p></speech>

He and several of his colleagues spoke during the debate on it.</p> <p>  I have a couple of points on percentages.  The reason I referred to percentages was to future proof the Bill for the reduction in the size of the Assembly.  A figure of 16.6% reduces the number in the Assembly from 18 in a 108-member Assembly to 15 in a 90-member Assembly.  As I said, my commitment to D'Hondt has been rock solid.  However, we are not yet at that place.  The figures were developed to build a sort of hybrid between a very pure consociational Government, with everyone in government and actually delivering good governance.  From talks with the First and Deputy First Ministers, I found very often their biggest problem tended to be the smaller parties in the Executive.  The approach taken in the fresh start involves the two main parties in government driving the fresh start.  Some people say that is a bad thing, but I think it is a good thing because it involves people stepping up and saying they have to lead the process.</p> <p>  At times it is easier to deliver things like collective responsibility when there are fewer parties in government.  There are currently four parties in government; there were five until the very end of August.  My fear is that we will have a five-party coalition next May.  Such a government could continue to keep going for a while under the new mandate but very quickly we will get back to a situation whereby parties are trying to jockey for position and we will be back to the days of dysfunctionality.</p> <p>  The figure of 18 concerns what in our view is the reasonable size one needs to achieve the D'Hondt right to be in government.  Below that it is questionable.  One could still negotiate one's way into government but one would have to sign up to a programme for Government and collective Cabinet responsibility.  That was the reason I came up with the figure of 18 and I wanted to write it as a percentage into the Bill in order that we could future proof a move to a 90-member Assembly.</p> <p>  Mr. Maskey referred to the Public Accounts Committee.  He was very thorough in his role as chairman of that committee.  The advice from many legislators around the world and the World Bank on the role of public accounts committees tends to be that somebody who is not a member of a government party should chair such committees.  If such a committee is examining any regulation or regulatory framework, it is probably better to have a chairperson at whom nothing can be thrown and who does not have some sort of vested interest.  That is why it is much better to separate the chairman from government departments or Ministers.</p> <p>  As a result of our consociational government, Mr. Maskey would have had three ministerial colleagues, but every other department involved a different party.  The committee is not as badly tied by that.  If we moved to a system whereby the two main parties in government and the Alliance Party were involved in justice, it would become more problematic for a member of the government parties to then chair the Public Accounts Committee.  Best practice would point to us going down this road.</p></speech>

He is to be congratulated.  How does he think the Assembly will react to them in its debates on them?</p> <p>  He referred to moving away from party designation and petitions of concern as a means of reducing the tribal nature of politics in Northern Ireland and focusing more on policy issues.  There is some concern that this could be used over time to erode the principles of power sharing as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  What are his views on that?</p></speech>

It is key that we start to move to policy issues.  There is a complete deficit in policy development.  I sometimes envy parties in Dublin which are now putting together manifestoes for an election which will take place, it is to be presumed, in early spring.  Whatever happens after that, the parties will come together and negotiate a programme for Government.  At that point, there will probably be more genuine power sharing than we have in the North.<br/><br/>I am committed to power sharing, but I want to see genuine power sharing.  I fear what we have currently is shared-out power.  Dr. Eoin O'Malley gave evidence to the Assembly and Executive Review Committee.  His comments were very strong:</p><blockquote>Northern Irish ministers and departments operate almost as dictators within their own portfolio, not subject to the requirement to have cross-community support in areas that don't require primary legislation.  That seems at odds to the purpose of institutional structures set up in the Belfast Agreement.</blockquote> <p>I am not sure I would go so far as to use the term &quot;dictator&quot;, but unless primary legislation is needed, when a Minister in a Department can do things by regulation, there is very little control over such a Minister, unless approval needs to be sought through the Executive, at which point executive members can stop the Minister.  Mr Maskey's colleague, the Minister, Mr. John O'Dowd MLA, admitted when he brought a Bill through the Assembly that one pretty much lost control of it in the Assembly because one may not have the numbers to get all that one wants or be able to block things that one does not want.  This model is a much better way of delivering real genuine power sharing rather than shared-out power.</p><p>We have had too many divisions based on having some for this community and some for that community, and not enough based on genuinely delivering on the issues we heard about earlier with regard to educational underachievement, whether with regard to the Protestant or Catholic working class, and getting into real policy development.  There are not enough consequences for the failure to deliver on any of this or to reform the system.  In health, transforming care is the flagship policy, but is it a DUP flagship policy or the Northern Ireland Executive flagship policy?  When any difficult decisions must be made, everybody runs for the hills.  It is the same with education, employment and learning.  This leads to the dysfunctionality of the Government and the very fact Ministers can sue each other.  I am rock solid on power sharing, but I want to see genuine power-sharing.  It is within the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, for which I voted in 1998.  I want to see inclusivity in practice, but inclusivity can also include being in the political process.</p></speech>

Mr. McCallister's legislation would not give us choice because if a certain threshold is not reached people will not be allowed in.  Given our past histories and from where we have all come, it is about building up trust so that one community does not damn the other.  This is very important.  We must learn from the past and make sure it never happens again.  Is choice not a good thing with regard to A Fresh Start?</p></speech>

The difference is whether we want to have two or three parties in government or five.  Speaking to various ministers about this, there are problems with having five parties in government.  By right, I want the larger parties to have a right to be in government.  They also have a responsibility to act and look as though they are in government.  With regard to the choice in A Fresh Start, there is only a choice if a party qualifies for the Executive, and the problem I have as a legislator and voter is this means we can have an opposition only if one or two parties decide we can.  There is not the same choice.  There is a saying down here that the worst day in government is still probably better than the best day in opposition.</p></speech>

It is probably more the case if one is a Minister than if one is a backbencher.  If everybody is in government, as is the case with the Good Friday Agreement, I want them included in the political process.  D'Hondt gives the parties the right to be in government and we would need a seismic shift away from this.  I want an opposition to be recognised not just if a party qualifies to be in the Executive and then chooses to be in opposition.  This will get tighter with the reduction of Departments.  If the SDLP was reduced to five seats and the Alliance went up by two, the SDLP would not be in the d'Hondt process and this would make a fundamental difference.  It would have nowhere to go in opposition.  My Bill's provision on qualifying parties would give it the choice of going into it and would give them more rights.</p></speech>

This is something that has been called for in our Parliament.  What are the down sides to this?  Are there any down sides?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.901" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCallister" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015112600002#S00700"><p>I do not see any down sides because the provisions for weighted majority and secret ballot mean nobody could game the election.  The Chairman has been in a political party for a reasonable number of years, and he knows that trying to tell all of his colleagues they need to vote for something in a secret ballot is very difficult to organise or arrange.  I feel strongly the speakership should be a gift of the Members of the Assembly and not of the Executive arm of government or the result of a deal between the two main parties in the Executive arm of government.  Having a speaker who is truly independent would change the dynamic of building a parliamentary culture.</p> <p>  We have been fortunate that in my time we have had two good speakers in Mr. William Hay and Mr. Mitchel McLaughlin, and there has been no question about impartiality.  In his letter, the current speaker, Mr. Mitchel McLaughlin, speaks about the difficulties of being a constituency Member and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Speaker cannot get involved in constituency planning issues.  As one newspaper I read put it, under the House of Commons model if Buckinghamshire was being tarmaced the Speaker could not do much about it as a constituency MP.  This becomes a problem because 70,000 electors in Buckinghamshire are disenfranchised.</p> <p>  What I like about the system here is that the constituency is reduced by a seat.  Taking our previous two speakers, Mr. Willie Hay was the only Unionist representative in the Foyle constituency and Mr. Mitchel McLaughlin is the only Nationalist representative in South Antrim.  I like the idea of lifting them out of the constituency and letting the parties in those two cases, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, replace them.  It would not upset the constituency balance.  I suggest this is a more mature democracy and is at the point that it can do so.  We are not at that point.  This is why I would lift the Speaker entirely out of constituency politics.  A secret ballot provides the protection that the election cannot be gamed because Members will have to vote on merit as to who they think are the best people.  The weighted majority means it would be very difficult, and I would say impossible, for one party to dominate or game the election.</p></speech>

Tomorrow the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association will meet.  It, along with the Ceann Comhairle, has made significant inroads in bringing a certain trust and cross-party respect.  I am delighted this certainly has been a major progression and I want to put this on the record.</p> <p>  We have spoken about A Fresh Start and it has many aspects which are also in Mr. McCallister's Bill.  What are the next steps for the Bill?</p></speech>

The Bill has left committee and it must come out of Committee Stage in late January.  I hope to meet representatives of most of the parties on Monday.  I will be with the committee again on Tuesday.  There is stuff I know now I will not get and I will change it.  We have been working with the drafter in the Bills office to get amendments.  The committee process has been excellent in that we have engaged academics from North and South, political parties and a range of civic society commenting on the Bill and how we get that difference.  It is about sticking with a consociational type of government and language.  I accept that I will probably have to make amendments to make sure we stay within that.  It certainly puts it on the agenda.  I want to keep that conversation going.</p><p> I am getting a picture now of where most of the parties are on it.  Traditionally, nationalism as a whole has been the most nervous about any changes that the Bill would bring.  That is why I am keen to meet Mr. Colum Eastwood and, I hope, Mr. Raymond McCartney, on Monday to go through and see what bits we need to examine and change.  We need to see if language can be altered and what we can do to reassure people.  For some parties, the big debate is probably about having legislation and just changing standing orders.  My answer is that legislation gives security that just changing standing orders does not.  Some criticism would be that the executive has too much control over the legislature and that is the debate to be had.  Some are pushing for this to be done through standing orders but legislation is important.  It is crucial to have those standing orders based in legislation.  The other advantage of legislation is that it lets parties know what they are signing up to, what was agreed and what is in the Bill.  This is what came out the other end.  The other advantage is that in tabling a Bill, at some point people must put up their hands, saying "Yes" or "No" for it.</p><p> In promising to bring standing orders or change something, we are never quite sure when that is going to happen.  Effectively, we have debated and talked about the need for an Opposition right from when the Assembly was founded in 1998.  We have always found a reason to say the question is for another day.  The Bill forces people to act.  As with all legislation, and even if I brought it as a Government Minister, I will not get everything I want in the Bill.  It is a question of what we can do or agree to improve scrutiny in government and improve the delivery of that government.  That is all for the good.  We are plagued with voter apathy and falling voter turnout because they see the Assembly and Executive as dysfunctional and not having delivered anything.  That is a major danger for people who support the Good Friday Agreement and all that has been achieved in the past 20 years.</p></speech>

One of the bigger criticisms I laid out in the Second Stage debate was of the arrangements between 1921 and 1972, where there was no real opposition that could provide choice and change, with today's opposition being tomorrow's government.  We did not have that.  It was all focused on creating a single-party state.  Even as an independent Unionist, the electoral system was changed in 1929.  That was not about excluding nationalism but it was as much about the worry of independent Unionists with the move from proportional representation to the first past the post system.  The d'Hondt mechanism gives a guarantee in the government if a body reaches a certain size.  There would have to be a seismic shift in voter intention.</p> <p>  We are absolutely committed to genuine power sharing but it must be about how departments work together and co-ordinate, with the government acting as one unit.

Some are nervous about any changes that look like we are moving back to that or any changes at all.  To be fair to the parties and with the engagement we had during Committee Stage, it has been very straight and honest, as people are looking very genuinely at the implications of the Bill.  They are hearing from academics, with some people being very supportive of changes.  Others are less so.  That is the value of the process of going through a Committee Stage.  From that perspective, the Bill has stimulated much talk about what an opposition would look like and what a collective government might look like.  For too long, the word "opposition" was bandied about but nobody had put flesh on the bones of what it would look like or how this would fit in with the consociational style of government.  There is the question of marrying those two, as we are more used to a Westminster model.  It would be better to look at the example here, Wales or Scotland.  The electoral system here is the same as ours.  There will never be a stand-off with two big parties because proportional representation and the single transferable vote does not give that.  If the UK election had seen the use of proportional representation, there would have been approximately 80 UK Independence Party MPs, 50 Liberal Democrats and a coalition government all the time.  I forget but I think 1977 was the last time we saw a majority here.  It was quite a while ago.</p></speech>

They know that the smaller parties do not have to deliver any of this.  They are the parties with the votes.  Even in a cross-community vote like a budget that we have now, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have the numbers to do that.  That is why I want to move to weighted majority.  That could change if unionism fractures somewhat.  The DUP only needs to lose something like five seats to the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, for example, and suddenly the UUP could lock any cross-community votes and we could end up not having a budget.  That changes the dynamic, as would not being able to get all their pieces of government business done.</p><p>One is always trying to find a balance between a government having the right to get its business through and a protection mechanism that says: "Wait, the government must think again about this".  For example, in Westminster the House of Lords voted down tax credits, and the government thought again and changed its mind on it.  That is the balance we are trying to strike, between sticking strictly with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement and the genuine power sharing, trust and consensus that we want to build with allowing opposition or non-government parties to start to co-operate and develop a policy agenda that they can take to the electorate, so they can look at times like an alternative government.  That is a great way of putting pressure on a government.</p><p> For too long in Northern Ireland there have been no political consequences for the failure to deliver on educational under-achievement, health, housing or infrastructure.  Even in the recent political crisis nobody was particularly bothered if there was an election, because they knew most of the same people would be back doing the same things.  Therefore, there are no political consequences.  The Republic, however, could not have got through the last eight or nine years without a sense of collective Cabinet government or the Government acting as, and looking like, one unit, with some very difficult decisions to be made.</p></speech>

It is a very powerful brief.  Paul Maskey MP said that it works fine.  Is there a balance in between the two or any compromise in that regard?  I am not saying either one of them works in one way or the other, but when parties are in opposition it is very powerful to have the chair of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It certainly holds the Government to account.</p></speech>

It is the biggest distributor of the budget, so one cannot belong to that party.  It must be somebody from another party.  However, one can belong to a party where one's colleague has any other Department.</p> <p>  I was chair for four or five years and it was good.  It allowed one to get seriously involved in the local politics with regard to scrutiny of the other Departments.  Also, I had to get it into my head that I had to leave any political baggage I had at the door, regardless of whether it was a party colleague who held the ministerial post.  My ten colleagues on that committee would have made sure I did that.  I believe we did it well.</p></speech>

We currently have a Sinn F&eacute;in chair of the finance committee and a Minister for Finance and Personnel from the DUP.  The Minister for Health is from the DUP and the committee chair is from Sinn F&eacute;in, while the chair of the education committee is from the DUP and the Minister is from Sinn F&eacute;in.</p> <p>  The difference when Paul Maskey was chair is that effectively everyone was in government.  Certainly, for most of that time there were four or five parties in government.  That meant the parties in the Assembly or in a committee were probably represented in the executive arm of the government.  There are 11 members in a committee and a five party coalition meant most of the committee was represented in the Executive.  After the 2011 election to the Assembly, 104 of the 108 members were in parties that were linked to the government, so there were very few people in that situation.  What the Bill would seek to do is have a limited, smaller number of parties in government, for example, DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance Party.  That gives a broader pool and one would want to have that additional scrutiny.</p> <p>  The Chairman commented on taking the Government to task.  In Dublin, Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff that has been a key role, so people can really put a spotlight on what governments are doing.  It is seen as a very crucial role.  There has been probably not universal support but quite strong support from other parties and academics around that, because they see it more as the norm.  There are also the recommendations from the World Bank regarding the best traditions.</p> <p>  Our current situation and Paul's term can be different from if one starts to build other parties in opposition and, indeed, technical groups.  That would be one of the committees where they should, and rightly so, shine a light on the activities of the government.  It is seen as a key scrutiny role that an opposition must provide.</p></speech>

They should be switched off or put in airplane mode as they interfere with the broadcasting of the proceedings.  Our meeting is a very important one on the area of advocacy.  As members know, we have been raising this issue at the committee for some time.  I welcome our witnesses who will give us their insight on advocacy, which is not just about handling patients' complaints or providing information or advice but is about support to patients and users of the health service, their rights and entitlements and how to make their wishes known.  Our meeting coincides with the announcement by the Minister on 12 November of the setting up of a national patient safety office, which includes a patient advocacy service.  The purpose of this meeting is to hear from some of the most respected national stakeholders and their views on what the office will mean for the health service.  Mr. Tony O'Brien hoped to attend at 9.30 a.m. but, unfortunately, he had commitments that he could not change and he will join us in a separate session at 11.30 a.m.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Mervyn Taylor of Support and Advocacy Service for Older People, Sage; Ms Louise Loughlin, regional manager of the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities; Ms Eileen Fitzgerald, senior manager, regional services of the Citizens Information Board; Mr. Peter Tyndall, Ombudsman and Information Commissioner; Mr. Paddy Connolly, CEO of Inclusion Ireland, who is accompanied by Mr. Cormac Cahill, communications and information officer; and Ms Angela Black, CEO of the Citizens Information Board.  They are all very welcome and I thank them for being here.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I acknowledge the presence of the chair of our national advisory committee, Patricia Rickard-Clarke, and of the co-ordinator of our legal and financial team, Mary Condell.  Sage has its origins in the Leas Cross scandal of 2005.  It is ten years ago in May since that dreadful scandal broke in an RTE story.  We have had a number of other events since then, such as &Aacute;ras Attracta, the events in Portlaoise hospital, the investigation of home help abuses in 2011 and other abuses which were highlighted in 2014.  We have had reports from HIQA and the Ombudsman's office, both of which have recommended the development of advocacy services in hospitals.</p> <p>  The redevelopment of a support and advocacy service for older people in the last year has coincided with commitments by the HSE to develop a national volunteer advocacy programme as part of a wider response to the &Aacute;ras Attracta scandal, a recent commitment by the Minister for Health, to which the Chairman referred, to develop a national patient advocacy service and a recommendation by the Ombudsman for the development of independent advocacy services, involving volunteers, in hospitals.  There are a number of other organisations, some of which are represented here today, notably the Citizens Information Board and Inclusion Ireland.  Together there is a very rich picture of what exists and what is promised to emerge but we now need to take stock and find direction and a framework for development.  In some ways, we are dealing with the law of the 46A bus; one waits a long time for one bus and then three come along.  We are at the stage of three buses coming along.  The question is whether we can get on any of them and if they are going in the right direction.</p> <p>  Fundamentally, advocacy is about voice.  It is about the right of a person to have support in expressing their wishes and preferences or to have another person act independently of service providers, family members and systems interests to advocate on their behalf.  That is widely recognised in the developed world.  Independent advocacy must be distinguished from the work of staff responsible for complaints and from the day-to-day work of professionals and health and social care providers who can advocate on behalf of an individual up to a certain point but beyond that, a conflict of interest can arise.</p> <p>  I will focus on the framework for development, which we have set out in great detail in our opening submission, in short points in this statement.  The framework must address some key issues.  The first of those is the fragmented and sometimes reactive nature of developments to date and the need for collaboration and co-ordination.  There is a need for standards, training, support, recording and monitoring of activities and assessment of outcomes.  The latter area is of particular importance.  There is a need for a clearly stated rationale for the development of support and advocacy services as part of the wider pattern of response to the health and social care needs of citizens.  I stress that advocacy on its own is not a solution.  It is part of a wider approach.  There is a need for an assessment of the likely resources required to provide effective independent advocacy in the health and social care sector.  I say that in particular in the context of the emerging capacity legislation, which in many ways will bring us forward but it will be very challenging for many people.</p> <p>  We have made some specific suggestions.  The first is that there should be a process of stakeholder and public consultation to inform the development of future legislation which would guide the development and provision of advocacy services.  Things that are really important, which will be stressed by other colleagues during the meeting, include the right of an advocate to have access to people, premises, information and meetings.  They exist and are supposedly allowed for in the HIQA regulation, for example, in nursing homes, but they are not in many cases allowed by the care provider.</p> <p>  Services funded from public sources should have, as a clear requirement of that funding, an obligation to provide and promote access to independent advocacy for the benefit of service users.  Services funded from public sources should be clear on the requirement to provide and promote access to independent advocacy for the benefit of service users.  Those who receive funds should be required to engage in formal structures of co-ordination and collaboration.  A process of collaboration and co-ordination could be started by the formation of a liaison group for relevant support and advocacy services in the context of the formation by the HSE of the new inter-sectoral committee for safeguarding vulnerable adults.  That is currently at the formation stage.  There needs to be an assessment of the desirability of the separate development of support and advocacy services for people with disabilities and for older people.  A small piece of independent research should be commissioned to assess the likely resource implications of developing support and advocacy services to an adequate level of provision.  We need to address the resource issue.  There is a need to develop a public sector volunteering policy and guidelines to ensure that people who wish to make a contribution can do so but, equally, to reassure those who are professionals in their area that there is no attempt to impinge on their role.  If we wish to add value by involving citizens in advocacy, we must be clear and have a public sector volunteering policy and guidelines.</p> <p>  As the Minister alluded to earlier in the month, we seek the extension of the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to include administrative and organisational aspects of clinical care and the simplification and further development of existing complaints system.</p><p>We are particularly conscious of the fact that a decision support service will be established under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill.  That agency will have considerable potential to act as a catalyst for developing standards and promoting good practice.  As part of its brief, it will play a role in developing codes of practice.  Therefore, we need to factor in a new entity which is emerging but is not yet there.  I hope that it will be in the legislation by the end of the year.  </p><p> We need some clarification on the role of the recently announced national patient advocacy service because a service was announced last year by the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  It will now be established by the national patient safety office and the talk is that it will be about information and signposting.  It may be a very useful development but it could also be another layer that might make things more complicated.</p><p> People should be able to advocate for themselves in advance.  Therefore, we need a major public campaign to promote the advantages of advance planning for future life events involving advance health care directives, an enduring power of attorney and the Think Ahead resource which enables people to record key information, wishes and preferences in the event of an emergency, serious illness or death.  Financial incentives of different forms, such as tax credits or free legal aid, should be developed to support the initiative.  In effect, the State would promote pre-planned self-advocacy for when people are no longer able to speak for themselves.</p><p> We believe that the development of an oversight and accountability mechanism, chaired by the Ombudsman, would link the work of independent providers of support and advocacy with the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  There is a need for providers to be accountable to the publicly elected representatives of Ireland and, in turn, they should have an opportunity to hear what the issues are for the independent support and advocacy sector.</p></speech>

They are very much lower than they are in comparable jurisdictions.  We all know that health complaints are one way of driving improvement in the health service.  If one does not know what is going wrong, then one cannot know how to put it right and, therefore, we undertook our first own initiative investigation into health complaints earlier this year.  In doing so, we tried to establish why people were not prepared to bring their complaints forward.  We did not believe that it was because the quality of health care in Ireland was so much better than elsewhere and that people did not have things to complain about.  We felt it was much more likely that there were structural reasons for people not complaining.  We found a number of reasons.  I will mention a couple of them but more have been documented in the statement I have provided to the committee.  One of the reasons people were afraid to complain was that they were concerned about the impact a complaint might have on themselves, as patients, or, more usually, on their family members.  They felt, particularly for people in vulnerable long-term care situations, that they would put them at risk by complaining.</p> <p>  The second reason that people often advance is that the complaints system is so complex and arduous to pursue a complaint to its conclusion that people simply lose the will to continue with a complaint even when they start.  When one finds situations, as we did, where it is almost impossible to find on the website where one might lodge a complaint, and where it is not obvious on the hospital's premises where one might go to complain, then one starts to wonder why it is that we are not taking complaints more seriously.  One might ask what has this got to do with advocacy.  In my previous life, I was used to working in a context where hospital patients had access to independent professional advocacy.  That meant there was somebody to stand beside patients when it came to making a complaint and very often, he or she could focus a complaint.  Sometimes the advocate nipped complaints in the bud because he or she raised the issue of concern on the spot with health professionals and the matter was dealt with there and then.  On other occasions, he or she was able to provide explanations to individuals which meant that the patient did not have cause to complain.  When a patient did want to complain, an advocate was able to help him or her articulate a complaint in such a way and helped him or her pursue it through what was often a labyrinthine process until a reasonable outcome was reached.</p> <p>  One must ask why is there such a labyrinthine process.  The answer is that at the moment, the HSE's Your Service, Your Say guidelines are very high level and it is not spelled out in detail how a person can make a complaint.  That means there is a different process in place in virtually every health setting in Ireland.</p> <p>  We have put forward quite a large number of recommendations but I will focus on a couple of them.  One of my recommendations is the introduction of an advocacy service that would be available to patients in all health care settings.  Given the difficulties people face when trying to lodge a complaint and the fears that they have about complaining-----</p></speech>

One of my recommendations is that an advocacy service should be put in place.  We are pleased that such a service has been announced.  What we have in mind is something that is accessible to patients and is not a national advocacy service.  We want something that individual patients can access.  Within the general hospitals, we want such a service it to have a relatively high profile so that it is easy for a person to see where to go.  We are anxious to see what is delivered in the context of the commitment to provide an advocacy service.</p> <p>  In terms of our report, our recommendations were agreed by the HSE.  We had very good co-operation from the HSE once we identified what the issues were.  We are also working with the HSE as it produces action plans to implement the report.  We have made it very clear, in this instance, that we will reassess in 18 months' time to see what has happened on the ground because sometimes recommendations can get lost in a welter of recommendations.  Although there is a commitment to implement them, a central commitment to implement them does not always lead to changes in practice for individual patients throughout Ireland.  We will go back to make sure the changes happen not just at a national level and on paper.  We will send people to see what is happening on the ground to make sure the change has been put in place, as agreed.</p> <p>  I refer to a simplified health complaints system.  The system, as it currently stands, has two stages - one of which is sometimes observed and one is not.  The issue of whether there is a review stage before complaints come to my office is an important one.  If complaints are looked at locally and there is a delay and if they are then looked at by the HSE centrally and there is a delay, by the time they reach my office,  the detail in the complaint has been lost in the minds of many of the people engaged in it.  For the person who is making the complaint, the issue is most important and he or she is very clear in their mind about what happened.  The staff who may have been involved in the complaint - doctors and nurses - may well have long forgotten the particular incident.  Therefore, it is very difficult for us to understand what may or may not have happened at the time.</p> <p>  We want to see a streamlined complaints system introduced and to see the same system used across the health service.  In order to move this forward, when we took on jurisdiction for private nursing homes, we introduced a simplified streamlined model complaints policy which we rolled out to the proprietors at that time.  We held workshops and seminars across Ireland for the proprietors of private nursing homes and we issued them with a standard complaints policy that we expect them to use.  The advantage of that is that we will see whether they have complied with best practice when dealing with complaints.  In addition, everyone will see that the same standards are applied across the sector rather than have the huge variety of standards that exist at the moment.  We have removed the second stage because we think people should attempt to resolve a matter informally at the point the incident happens and have one investigation.  If the issue is a serious one, then there should be an investigation by an independent person or persons.  Some of the complaints will be about food or whatever, so one does not need an independent person.  For more serious complaints, it is best that one engages an independent person to investigate.</p><p>We say investigate once and investigate well and if the issue cannot be resolved at that point, the complaints should come to the Office of the Ombudsman and not to another third party.  It is a simple, streamlined, effective complaints service, which applies across the health sector.  We have taken the first steps to putting that in place.</p><p> One of the complexities people face when complaining is that they can only complain about part of their care to the HSE and to my office.  Technically the issues around clinical judgment often are only part of a complaint.  Let us say that somebody is complaining about the care of their loved one - they may have issues around care and compassion, or issues around whether a treatment regime that was put in place was followed but they may also have issues around diagnosis.  Currently some of the clinical judgment issues cannot be dealt with within the existing complaints system.  That is clearly wrong.  If a person is unhappy about the care, it should be possible to make one complaint to one body.  Because of a recent Supreme Court judgment, the person must complain to the professional body of the individuals concerned which has to apply a very high threshold before it can look at complaints.  There is a large number of complaints that nobody can look at.  Clearly that must be fixed.  I was delighted when the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar indicated that he intends fixing that.  I hope that can be done.  I do not think it will be a speedy process, but at least we seem to have embarked on the correct path at this point.  </p><p> I hope that has been helpful.  There is more in the statement, but I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.947" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Fitzgerald" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the joint committee today.  .I will speak from the experience of the Citizens Information Board on the establishment of an independent advocacy service for people with disabilities and I hope our experience will inform this discussion.<br/><br/>There are approximately 400,000 people with disabilities in Ireland and from time to time some people need access to an advocacy service, but most do not, or would not if services were offered and delivered differently.  While advocacy services are undoubtedly required, it is important not to lose sight of the requirement that public services be designed and delivered in an accessible manner which facilitates people in using those services and minimises the need to seek help from others to understand and use the services.<br/><br/>The current experience for many people with disabilities living in the community or residential services is one of marginalisation in terms of health, housing, employment and social participation.<br/><br/>There are still more than 3,000 people living in congregated settings.  Research has demonstrated that the quality of life for people in residential settings is often compromised and there may be restrictions on their rights and choice; decision making is often taken away from the individual.  Many people with disabilities have limited support from family and community and need to access an advocate who is independent of all service providers to ensure they are included in decisions about their lives.<br/><br/>During the past four years the National Advocacy Service, NAS, for people with disabilities has worked intensively with more than 2,000 people, supporting them to have their voices heard.  In addition, NAS has engaged with significantly more people by phone, linking them to other services if their service need was other than advocacy or if their inquiry did not correspond with the access criteria to NAS.  NAS targets its service offer to people with disabilities who are isolated from their community and services, have communication difficulties, are inappropriately accommodated, live in residential services, attend day services and have limited or no natural supports.<br/><br/>In 2014, more than 35% of people supported by NAS had an intellectual disability, 20% had a physical disability and nearly 20% had mental health issues.  Issues addressed include moving out of institutional care, inappropriate accommodation, income support and access to personal finances, and quality of life issues, which would be a significant part of the work.<br/><br/>The Citizens Information Board, CIB, has incrementally developed mainstream advocacy provision in Citizen Information Services to enable people to access their rights and entitlements.  Under the National Disability Strategy 2005,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>the Citizens Information Board was designated as the organisation to provide advocacy for people with disabilities, with the terms of the proposed personal advocacy service, PAS, set out in the Citizen Information Act 2007.  In anticipation of these responsibilities, CIB undertook and published research on international models of advocacy intervention. <br/><br/>We set up 46 pilot advocacy projects for people with disabilities in collaboration with a range of community based organisations around the country.  In 2008, when the implementation of personal advocacy service, PAS, was placed on hold and the sections of the Act were not implemented, we started to look at the various stages of development of the national advocacy service, which has been restructured a number of times and is now one national organisation, the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, NAS. <br/><br/>In terms of its remit, the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, NAS, provides an independent, confidential and free, representative advocacy service that works exclusively for the person using the service and adheres to standards as set out in NAS code of practice.  It is staffed by 28 advocates, eight senior advocates and managed by four regional managers and a national manager, supported by five administrative staff.  There are 45 staff.  Given the remit and resources of NAS, it is inevitable that it reaches only a small number of people who could benefit from the support of a representative advocate.  Representative advocacy is a relatively new service in Ireland, and drawing on experience over the past decade, CIB and NAS have developed standards, policies and procedures in line with international best practice, to ensure that the representative advocacy service we provide operates to high standards.<br/><br/>Independence is absolutely central to the work of the National Advocacy Service, NAS, in that the advocate will not share information with third parties unless directed by the person.  Of particular importance is that the NAS advocates are not influenced or compromised in carrying out their independent, representative advocacy role by any other party.  This ensures robust advocacy practice and places the will and preference of the person at the centre of the situation.<br/><br/>Issues to be addressed can be about any aspect of the person&rsquo;s life, and may be directed by the person, or where the person&rsquo;s will and preference cannot be ascertained, the advocate approaches the matter using the four internationally recognised methods, namely, witness observer, person centeredness, rights based approach and ordinary life principles.  In that context an experienced advocate can and does represent the will and preference of people who communicate differently and who cannot articulate their wishes.  This requires time and skill, support and supervision, as this is complex work and the advocate must earn the respect of both the person they are representing and the service provider.<br/><br/>NAS has experienced a wide range of expectations and misunderstandings as to what representative advocacy is and should be.  This is a very important issue in the context of the new service being set up.  Representative Advocacy is a means of empowering people by supporting them to assert their views and claim their entitlements and where necessary representing and negotiating on their behalf.  It is not about making decisions for someone, mediation, counselling, care and support work or consultation.<br/><br/>I welcome the developments the Ombudsman is talking about.  NAS assists people in making a complaints.  NAS tries very hard to work to seek an early resolution prior to people having to go into the complaints procedure because of the complexities of the complaints process.  NAS also supports people to make complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman and we try to support people right through that process.<br/><br/>A key issue for the National Advocacy Service is the need for statutory powers.  That is very important to consider in the context of all advocacy work.  NAS frequently experiences issues with service providers when seeking information and meaningful engagement with the advocacy process.  There continues to be misunderstanding about what advocacy is.  The services may engage with advocates but this can be experienced as tokenistic.  This is hugely time consuming for advocates and can take time away from working with other people who need the service.<br/><br/>Although NAS continues to engage in extensive relationship building with services, the lack of statutory powers means that issues can arise in the following areas: Access to services &ndash; where providers do not facilitate NAS&rsquo;s presence <i>in situ</i>; access to information &ndash; where an individual cannot give written consent, NAS may not be able to obtain access to documents; decision making &ndash; as services slowly begin a cultural shift away from &quot;best interests&quot; to the will and preference of people, many decisions are still being made on behalf of individuals without reference to the person, their will and preference and-or their advocate; and, there is obfuscation through delays, that is, delays in replying to the National Advocacy Service, delays in replying to correspondence and delays in giving access to key decision makers.</p><p>The NAS has welcomed the incorporation of advocacy into HSE and service provider service level agreements, but it is essential that there is training and capacity building for service provider staff about advocacy and that this is included as part of staff training and development.  On some occasions when an advocate presents, the front-line staff and local manager are unaware of the inclusion of advocacy in service agreements and do not understand why an advocate has been requested or what their role is.  Sometimes they think advocates are inspectors and therefore can be circumspect about the advocate's involvement.  Senior professionals and management can be equally so.  The NAS provides information sessions on advocacy and training for staff, but it does not have the resources to deliver all of this.  A joined-up approach to training and awareness-raising is required.  All services should be obliged to train their staff on working with advocates.  This will assist in breaking down barriers so people with disabilities, and others, can be recognised as equal citizens and their voices can be heard.  Currently, the CIB is in discussion with the Department of Social Protection to seek statutory powers for the NAS to overcome these barriers.</p><p> With regard to the recommendations the CIB and the NAS wish to make, one relates to statutory powers to ensure a right of access and information and for meaningful engagement with the NAS and other advocacy service providers.  In terms of an over-arching framework for advocacy, I share the views of my colleagues that there are many different forms of advocacy and many different providers in Ireland, all playing valuable roles.  However, there is a need for the establishment of a framework of advocacy which would identify the different advocacy models and different advocacy providers; provide a co-ordinated approach across services and linkages; establish accessible information on advocacy, including a dedicated website; establish national standards and quality assurance in advocacy and mechanisms to ensure these standards are met; and, provide a co-ordinated approach to advocacy services that would cover people with disabilities, those who need support with decision-making and patients within the health services who need help in establishing their rights.  There is a need for training and capacity building around the range of service providers involved in both health and social care with regard to person centeredness and advocacy to enable a cultural shift.  Advocacy should be incorporated into service level agreements and other contractual and policy documents.  There must be a continuation and strengthening of advocacy in HIQA standards and a review of those.  These standards should be used as an assessment tool by regulators and inspectorates.</p><p> To conclude, measuring the impact of advocacy provision is an important piece of work and requires more attention.  In the CIB, we have seen how effective the NAS independent advocacy can be.  Changes in the quality of life for one person in a residential setting can influence change for many others in that service.  However, advocacy is not the panacea to resolve service gaps.  It gives voice, highlights need and highlights gaps and inadequacies.  It means that those who cannot shout the loudest have somebody to speak up for them.  We are all entitled to be heard but the responsibility to provide the relevant service to the proper standards lies with the service provider.  As service providers improve the quality of the service they deliver, over time the requirement for advocacy services should lessen.</p><p> The NAS looks forward to continuing to support people with disabilities and to working with a range of service providers, including our colleagues here, to ensure the upholding of the individual's will and preference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.949" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Connolly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make an input.  As I address the committee, children with a disability are being restrained and secluded in schools, children have been waiting years for essential speech and language therapy and persons with a disability are living in residential settings which in many cases provide little in terms of a good quality of life and are often neglectful, demeaning and sometimes brutal, where physical and sexual assault are most likely significantly under-reported.  The number of adverse events recorded by Irish hospitals and health care facilities in 2011 included 10,000 incidents of violence, harassment, aggression or abuse of patients.  Over 4,300 of these incidents involved a physical assault on patients, including persons with disabilities.<br/><br/>It is the experience of Inclusion Ireland, based on over five decades of work, that persons with an intellectual disability require advocacy support in a broad range of areas throughout their life cycle.  I am particularly conscious that the language of &quot;patient&quot; and &quot;patient safety&quot; is not in most cases appropriate to persons with a disability who need advocacy support to express their will and preference.  It is a different argument, although the patient safety argument dominates this sphere.  There are issues in education and employment, obtaining or changing other public services, when they are victims of crime because they are invisible in the criminal justice system, in family law where they are represented disproportionately in child care proceedings and when making health care decisions because consent is rarely obtained. <br/><br/>The issue of congregated settings has come to the forefront of popular and political debate.  This is, however, an issue that stretches beyond one institution in one location.  I was in an institution last Saturday and a family member told me that in the 60 years her son has been in the centre he has never left the complex.  Another family member told me that in the 52 years her son has been in the complex they have never been called together as a group of families to discuss their issues.  The neglect and abuse in these institutions is not acceptable and many of the community group homes that people are being moved into offer little more in quality of life.<br/><br/>The HIQA has shown this over a long period of time.  Recent coverage has shown that only 7% of the centres inspected by the HIQA managed to comply fully with the HIQA process.  Inspectors found that there was a high level of restrictive practice and restraint, that centres did not safeguard people's civil and legal rights and there was a lack of adequate safeguards and external scrutiny to ensure residents&rsquo; rights were vindicated.  This is all covered in the HIQA reports.<br/><br/>I am conscious of the time so I am summarising the document I provided to the committee.  The Ombudsman correctly referred to the issue of people suffering in silence.  We are told all the time by family members that they are afraid to complain or to raise their heads because they are concerned that if they complain it will affect the service they will get.  In many instances, and this has been said to us many times, the services have instructed families that if they make a complaint they can go elsewhere.  That is a common theme that arises for families - if they are not happy with a service, they should find a service elsewhere.  Of course, there is no other service to be found.<br/><br/>To cut to the chase, the landscape of advocacy services for persons in receipt of health and personal social services is characterised by a lack of co-ordination, consistency or oversight.  A range of advocacy services are currently being funded, including Inclusion Ireland, Sage - the Support and Advocacy Service for Older People, Patient Focus, Empowering People in Care or EPIC advocacy for children and young people in care, and others.  Despite the investment in advocacy services in the voluntary sector certain things remain the same.  There is currently no co-ordinating or oversight body for advocacy, there is no central funding stream as funding is only provided on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, no public body has responsibility for developing standards or codes of practice and there are no national standards or codes of practice for organisations providing advocacy services.<br/><br/>Obviously, advocacy services operate alongside other public bodies, including the Office of the Ombudsman, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Citizens Information Board.  Again, there is a lack of co-ordination and connection between these bodies and voluntary advocacy services.  An important new development will be the decision support service which is provided for in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill and will operate under the aegis of the Courts Service.  The decision support service will have a role in providing information and guidance, the development of codes of practice and powers of investigation in respect of decision-making arrangements under the legislation.  There is a need for this body, as it develops, and advocacy in a broader sense to be co-ordinated.<br/><br/>Inclusion Ireland believes there is a need for a broad spectrum of advocacy supports, as was first recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in 1996.  Building on the recommendations of the commission&rsquo;s report, the Goodbody report in 2003 recommended a programme of support for organisations providing advocacy services, an independent advocacy service with statutory powers and a community visitors&rsquo; programme for persons in long-term residential care.  However, none of these recommendations has been implemented.  Funding for community and voluntary organisations providing advocacy services and supports has been cut.  The relevant section of the Citizens Information Act that would afford legislative powers to an independent advocacy service has not been commenced, and this is important because this is an action that could be taken immediately.  The community visitors&rsquo; programme for persons in long-term residential care has not been introduced.<br/><br/>I will not repeat what has been said, but there is a lack of co-ordination.  The National Advocacy Service is grossly under-resourced.  There are 35 advocates nationwide while there are 3,500 people in congregated settings and a further 4,000 in community group homes.  Even getting to that group of people is absolutely impossible for the NAS.<br/><br/>Finally, Ms Ita Mangan, chairperson of the Citizens Information Board, in her presentation to the social protection committee in June 2015, called for &quot;a co-ordinated approach to advocacy services across a number of areas but particularly in the context of the implementation of the assisted decision-making legislation...&quot;.</p><p>Inclusion Ireland suggests an immediate action which could be taken is the introduction of a personal advocacy service, as provided for in the Citizens Information Act 2007.  Inclusion Ireland is proposing the establishment of a national advocacy authority.  This new body would have responsibility for co-ordinating and overseeing the provision of all advocacy services for persons in receipt of public services.  It would work alongside existing bodies such as the Office of the Ombudsman, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Inclusion Ireland recommends that such an authority be responsible for setting standards and developing codes of practice and that one of its first tasks be to develop a national strategy for advocacy.  We also recommend the introduction of a national signposting service, as mentioned, to guide people on how to make complaints and access advocacy services.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Billy Kelleher for allowing me to lead off.  </p><p>I thank each of the groupings that has come before us.  I thank them for their detailed presentations on what I emphasise is a hugely important area.  I have always regarded my role in public life as one of representation and advocacy.  In that context, I empathise greatly with what has been shared by each of the delegates.  I thank Ms Fitzgerald, in particular.  I am not seeking to make a distinction between one group and the rest, but on the basis of my experience in my community the role played by the Citizens Information Board merits particular recognition.</p><p>I wish to ask Mr. Taylor about a point made at the end of page 2 of the presentation made by SAGE.  I ask him to elaborate on the point that advocacy services funded from public sources &quot;should be required to engage in formal structures of co-ordination and collaboration&quot;.  How all-encompassing would this be?  How does he envisage such a requirement being worked out?  I concur absolutely with the emphasis placed on the point that advocacy services funded from public sources should be &quot;required&quot; to act in this way.  That is critical.  Of what would the component parts of the &quot;formal structures of co-ordination and collaboration&quot; be comprised?  How wide would the net be cast?</p><p>A point made a little further on in Mr. Taylor's statement is almost like a natural addendum.  He refers to the need for &quot;an assessment of the desirability&quot; of whether advocacy services should be all-encompassing.  Should the same services advocate on behalf of people with disabilities, people in the later years of their lives and those represented by Inclusion Ireland?  Does he believe we are looking at separate advocacy services or a single all-encompassing service?  When he asks for &quot;an assessment&quot;, does this suggest there is uncertainty from the point of view of SAGE about how progress should be made in this regard?  Perhaps he might give us a little indication in that regard.</p><p>I would also like Mr. Taylor to elaborate on something interesting he said.  I would welcome ongoing engagement between his organisation and the committee.  He seemed to allude to such engagement in his concluding remarks when he referred to &quot;the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children&quot;.  I am neither challenging him nor teasing the matter out further.  I want to know a little more about the vision he is presenting in the points he has shared with us.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Tyndall and wish him every success in his role and responsibilities.  I think this is the first opportunity an Oireachtas committee has had to meet him in his new role.  I found one aspect of his presentation very interesting.  Last June I marked 30 years as an elected representative.  Mr. Tyndall has said he has examined how public hospitals handle complaints.  Having spent many of my 30 years in politics as a health spokesperson, I feel I could write a little book about that subject and it might not be complimentary.  There used to be a common position in this regard which Ms Fitzgerald reflected to some extent.  Mr. Connolly certainly did so.</p><p>I would like to make a link between something interesting that was said by Mr. Tyndall and Mr. Connolly's statement that &quot;despite the investment in advocacy services in the voluntary sector certain things remain the same&quot;.  Mr. Connolly was alluding to the fact that &quot;there is currently no co-ordinating or oversight body for advocacy, there is no central funding stream as funding is only provided on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, no public body has responsibility for developing standards or codes of practice and there are no national standards or codes of practice&quot;.  As I was listening to him, I thought of something that could be added to the list.  It is reflective of what has been said by others.  There is no statutory obligation on hospital or other care setting management to accept the input of advocates, including elected representatives and the organisations represented here.</p></speech>

I would like to know whether each of the delegates agrees that there is a need for this form of advocacy.  We cannot work on the sole basis of the goodwill that may be present.  There should be a statutory obligation on people in positions of responsibility across hospital, health care and other care settings to be respectful of and open to the essential roles played by advocates.  As a national spokesperson on health, I was absolutely astonished in the recent past to receive a communication from a hospital site telling me that in future representations - for example, when I might make an intervention - I would need the written consent of the patient and photographic identification of the individual concerned.  In many of the cases in which I am asked to intervene, I am in Leinster House and the patient is not in a position to provide written consent.  I refer to persons who might be in difficulty in accessing a transfer or whatever the case might be.  It is bizarre, outrageous and totally unworkable to expect me to secure photographic identification in order that my representations can be considered.  While this is an indication of the difficulties and obstacles that can be encountered, I must acknowledge that in most cases my experience has been good.  People are generally respectful and co-operative, but there are instances of what I regard as extreme obstructionism.</p></speech>

Having listened to the points made by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in about the presentations, I want to focus on the issue of patient confidentiality.  </p> <p>  The protection of information is obviously very necessary, particularly when one is dealing with medically sensitive files, etc.  Like Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I sometimes find that it is used as a guise to obstruct public representatives making representations on behalf of citizens.  While we do not parade around the country looking for problems, they come to us, for example, via family members or concerned neighbours.  The idea that I cannot act on such representations in any way has to be revisited very quickly.  This attitude is becoming more prevalent in the health sector and across many other areas of public administration.</p><p>It is simply to close down representation and accountability and to sideline advocacy by a public representative.  This is regrettable and in some areas people are becoming more obstructive in this regard.  As I stated, it still is limited within the system but is becoming more prevalent.  I perceive it almost to be getting to the point where representations of public representatives are no longer being entertained unless they have written consent signed by somebody who witnessed it, etc., which I do not consider to be good.  To be clear, I would be much happier were I not obliged to make any representation, as it would make my life a lot easier.  Clearly, however, there is a fundamental role for a public representative and it should be considered by all advocacy groups as being complementary to advocacy, as opposed to being in the way of professional advocacy.  Equally, the system should be cognisant that public representatives are aware of what is happening.  This trend is limited but is growing.</p><p> The hint in all the presentations is the term "public service".  It is a service to the public and therefore efforts should be made to provide as good a service as is possible with the resources made available to it by the executive or by the health service provider itself.  There is an obligation on people who work in public service to provide it.  This is merely an observation but they often are in a monopoly in that there is only one hospital in one's area and one cannot walk down the road to go to another hospital.  Similarly, there may be only one school, one bus service and so on and consequently, they often operate as a monopoly.  One could then argue that because of this less notice is taken of a customer's complaint; it is just a natural instinct.  I am in favour of retention of the public services as they are by and large in respect of health care for example, but there is an underlying view that if people complain, they cannot go anywhere else and consequently, one simply listens to them but does not act.  The opposite should be the case and there should be a full embracing of complaints.  It should be part and parcel of any modern system, as it is the cheapest form of research one ever will be obliged to do to find out what one's service is or is not doing.  Most private companies or companies that deal with the public on a continual basis in a private capacity embrace complaint.  They actively seek to find complaints because it is the best form of research into how they can improve their services and often it is free because people will make that complaint.  It will be necessary to change this mindset and as I stated, this goes back to the original idea of public service.</p><p> To be clear, these are observations, rather than casting aspersions widely on people who work in the public service.  However, and this may be because of underresourcing, understaffing or simply pressure on people trying to deliver a service, I find there is some harshness in the system in respect of palliative and end-of-life care that perhaps should be revisited.  In particular, this is because people are highly vulnerable at that time when a loved one is at the end of life.  I acknowledge we have some wonderful facilities, some wonderful hospices and so on, but for people who are not in those good facilities but are in hospitals, for example, it can be a harsh environment for families.  I believe much work must be done in this regard.  The staff are so busy in trying to maintain life and in trying to keep people healthy and are working with people under huge pressure that it is questionable whether enough support is being put in place.  The system is a little harsh in the area of end-of-life and palliative care.</p><p> Overall, a big difficulty is that there should be a single citizens' point for many things.  Members have discussed this for a long time.  We have the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children and some other ombudsmen, as well as advocacy groups and citizens' information services.  I am sometimes concerned that an individual does not know where to go or how to start a complaint.  I will stick with the health services for the moment and the first thing we should have is open disclosure.  Open disclosure would help the entire system in making people feel confident they can complain, either in administrative areas or in clinical areas.  Again, the system will try to resist this because once one starts admitting open disclosure, one also starts to admit liabilities and that clearly is an issue that also must be addressed.  If a system is expected to be open, it cannot be allowed to be perceived as being easy in respect of liability.  These are observations.</p><p> Finally, I had written down a point I wished to raise.  It goes back to what I was going to say on the issue of fear and people being afraid to make a complaint.  I will tell the witnesses why this is.  They are not only afraid for themselves but often are afraid for the staff as well, that is, the people who actually provided the service.  This may be because the complaint involved one person only or because people simply do not wish to create difficulty.  For most Irish people, we are a live-and-let-live type of nation, we all know one another and are fairly interconnected in smaller communities in particular.  However, I find there is fear both for people themselves and often for the staff as well.  One must be conscious that people will go to the ends of the earth to avoid making a comment.  While the system does not encourage it, equally as a nation we are not great.  It goes back to the old example of restaurants whereby people will spend all day bad-mouthing a restaurant but will never tell the chef it was a bad meal.  One must be conscious of this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.962" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and that issue probably motivates me in this regard because the issues of end-of-life care and independent advocacy are my entry point into this issue and are why I wished to be present today.  During the end-of-life hearings, members discussed these issues and I came up with three Cs about consent, choice and control.  One issue I do not believe has arisen today is that while one talks about independent advocacy, individuals often do not know what choices they have and are rarely given that list of choices.  It is felt that, somehow telepathically, they will know for what they must ask or what they need.  There must be greater exploration of how this can be ensured.  There has been good work, such as that raised by Mr. Mervyn Taylor in respect of the Think Ahead resource and advance planning, part of which is to help people to equip themselves with knowledge regarding the language, because it is very different.  However, there must be discussion on ensuring the individual is aware of what he or she can ask for, rather than thinking after the event that perhaps he or she should have asked for it.</p> <p>  In addition, as a children's rights advocate, I often talk about the best interests of the child and the need always to act in the child's best interests.  However, in this area, one must discuss best interests versus preference and sometimes, preference must win.  This is what must be and an issue that must be discussed is how does one ensure this is balanced in order that one does not always act in the medical best interests of an individual if so doing actually neglects the strong preference the individual may have.  At the heart of this issue is the question of how to ensure a proactive, timely and appropriate response before even getting to a complaints mechanism.  It is a question of how to ensure, within each setting, that the response is there.</p> <p>  The issue of statutory powers has arisen and I believe Mr. Paddy Connolly mentioned the personal advocacy service.  That was established under the Citizens Information Act 2007 butt has not been commenced.  A question I have, in particular for the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, is whether it is prevented from accessing people or from acting on their behalf because of the lack of statutory powers for advocacy.  This is an issue for the Joint Committee on Health and Children and I would ask the question of all the representatives present because they all have raised the issue of statutory powers.  Do the witnesses believe this has prevented them from acting on behalf of people?  I believe it has but that belief is based on anecdotal evidence acquired from sitting in a nursing home and looking at the situation around me, where I have seen many individuals who have no visitors and for whom nobody comes in to act on their behalf.  If somebody does come in, it is only for a friendly chat and is not an advocacy service.  How can we ensure that such an advocacy service is in place?</p> <p>  As for particular questions, how does the Citizens Information Board know the advocates from the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities are reaching the people with disabilities who require advocacy the most?  How can we ensure those people who are in the community are being reached?  As we are trying to move away from congregated settings in some cases, how can we ensure these services really are reaching everybody?</p><p>The HIQA standards require advocates to be available for those living in community houses.  However, the inspection reports very often look only at whether an advocacy service was well advertised.  How do we know, beyond being well advertised, that a service is really engaging with people and that individuals have access to it?  Deputy Kelleher has raised the issue of where to go.  I would add to this by asking whether, when they go there, people's expectations will be achieved.  We have these great posters saying "Come and talk to us," but if the organisations and the advocacy service do not have any statutory powers, is it fair on the individual?  Should we be beefing it up?</p><p> Does the National Advocacy Service report its findings to the HSE?  Perhaps we could prevent further cases if some of the lessons learned achieved at local, regional and national levels were reported on.  That would be a big issue for me.</p><p> Another important issue is holding people accountable for their actions or inaction.  In issues of child protection, I often say I would only hold people accountable for doing nothing.  When people take action, if they can account for the action they are taking I will give them that.  We do not always know how things are going to pan out.  We need to ensure that the HSE and individual facilities can be held accountable, that there is transparency and that they will respond in a timely manner to all types of complaints and representations.  I would be particularly concerned about lower-level complaints, concerns or representations that an individual may have.</p><p> The role of the family is extremely important in advocating for those who cannot speak up.  On the other hand, I would suggest a little caution based on anecdotal evidence.  I have witnessed family members who do not regularly visit but will come in and feel they need to create a bit of a storm, maybe to assuage their own guilt.  We have to have that balance, and that is where regular visiting and understanding the individual are important.  I would go back to the issue of consent, choice and control for the individual.  It is his or her life and, as much as possible, anything we do should be focused on that individual, whether he or she is in a nursing home, a hospital, a congregated setting or his or her own home.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of enduring power of attorney, which I have raised previously.  I do not think we have done enough in setting out its advantages.  As a practising solicitor, I find I am being asked to complete enduring power of attorney forms when there is a question mark as to whether the person is competent to even sign it.  It is a huge problem.  The doctors have to sign off on it and there is hesitation, as people are coming to us too late.  We need to do a big sales effort on the issue to communicate the advantages of allocating enduring power of attorney when people are in full health and not when their health is failing.</p> <p>  On the way our health services deal with issues, I know of an example in which the management of a patient went wrong, doctors accepted that it had gone wrong, an internal inquiry was set up and everyone was happy with that, and then the internal reviewers decided that there should be an external reviewer to keep everyone happy and make sure it was independent and everything else.  Seven months later, someone in administration has decided they are not happy with the external reviewer who was appointed.  The family has been looking for answers for seven or eight months and the inquiry is not even happening.  That is the kind of thing that is so frustrating.  Now everyone is convinced that people within the hospital are trying to hide something, which is not the case.  The people within the hospital want answers just as everyone else does.  Nevertheless, that impression has been created because of the delays in dealing with the issue.  These matters need to be prioritised.  If there is a review to be done, it should be done as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p> <p>  In respect of local authorities in particular, I wish to raise the failure to ensure that there is one person in charge of a file.  I have two complaints on this issue, one with the Ombudsman and one with the Ombudsman for Children.  For children with disabilities, I know of cases in which work needed to be done on local authority houses, yet seven or eight years later no work has been done.  It causes great frustration that there is no one person taking charge of the issue within the local authority.  I would say that the offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children are having the same problem.  I do not understand why people cannot take responsibility.  I recently spent an hour on the phone on one problem, going from one department to another - four departments altogether - only to be referred back to the first one.  No one person in any of them was responsible for the file, yet the issue has been ongoing for seven years.  Surely we can do something about that.  If we had a proper procedure within the authorities, we would not have half the complaints we do.  Mr. Tyndall might outline his own frustration with that issue.  I am sure he is having the same problem pinning down who is in charge.  We need a radical change.  At European level - in the health section of the European Commission, for example - there are perhaps 80 different departments, but there is a named responsible person under each of them.  In local authorities and a whole lot of State agencies here, we cannot get that.  We could remove an awful lot of the delays and provide information and answers.</p></speech>

In advocacy, before we get to that point, there is a need for conflict resolution and mediation processes.  This is something at which the HSE and services are really poor.  It is often a piece of information that is just not being given.  Families get suspicious because they are not getting the information and are waiting weeks.  It builds up and up and the conflict becomes entrenched.  As the Ombudsman has stated, years down the road the complaint is still running and people have forgotten what it was actually about.  The conflict has become the energy in the room.  This whole area of conflict mediation and dispute resolution processes could be developed.</p> <p>  In response to Senator van Turnhout, this is where Inclusion Ireland is talking about a broad spectrum of advocacy.  An advocate's role is often to build the capacity of a person to understand his or her choices and help him or her take control.  It is not just about representing somebody or resolving a conflict.  It is also about supporting people who may have been institutionalised or dependent on services for a long time, or whose families may be very articulate and dominant, and helping them to understand that they have some choices and control.  Broad-spectrum advocacy addresses that issue.  Sometimes the advocate's role is to build a person's capacity.  It is a patient and slow job, but that is where different types of advocacy come into play.</p> <p>  The role of advocacy is one of a number of requirements in the context of intellectual disability in largely residential settings.</p><p>It is one of a series of checks and balances.  We have HIQA inspections, but HIQA does not guarantee a good quality of life.  That is where advocacy rows in.  We have complaints procedures.  There should be a series of checks and balances that will reduce the likelihood of abuse.  Advocacy is one of a number of checks and balances, but it is not going to work alone.</p><p> Reference was made to HIQA and advocacy.  A number of HIQA reports have referred to a poster on the wall advertising advocacy.  That is wholly inadequate in terms of accessibility or as a way for people to understand the process.  Some of these people have been dependent on institutions for a long time.  That idea does not represent access to an advocate.  Moreover, HIQA does not look into a broad spectrum of advocacy.  When we refer to a broad spectrum of advocacy, we are talking about representative advocacy and representing a person's interests as well as self-advocacy, whereby we support persons with a disability in expressing their will and preference.  That is a capacity-building role.  We are also talking about citizen advocacy and the type of work that Sage does.  When we talk about the need for a national advocacy strategy, we are referring to a broad spectrum of advocacy.</p></speech>

This issue has been brought to my attention by other Deputies.  It links to the issue about statutory representation and a statutory role for advocacy.  A clear statutory position should be introduced.  This is something my office has called for several times.  Whether they are elected representatives acting as advocates or advocates coming through the advocacy organisations, those involved need to have a statutory capacity to act on behalf of the people they are representing.  I strongly support that.<br/><br/>I am keen to pick up on the issue of finding a way through the maze.  It is linked to Senator Burke's question.  We discovered that more than 800 people were responsible for compliance within the HSE.  How anyone is expected to find the right person is a mystery to me.  We are working to try to get a reduction in the numbers so that a smaller number of people can be properly trained with the skills to deal with this work.  We have also taken on the lead role in <i>healthcomplaints.ie</i>.  We intend to move that from being a website that informs people about where they can go to an online service through which people can complain about any aspect of the health service in such a way that the complaint is sent to the person who is supposed to deal with it.  It will take some time to do that, but I believe this will mark a step forward.  It is not all that is necessary, but it will certainly mark an improvement.<br/><br/>I am keen to pick up the points about end-of-life care.  My office has published a report called A Good Death.  I will make copies available to the committee.  It sets out many of the issues raised at this committee that the HSE has made a commitment to address.  The reality is that we are some considerable way from that.  It is something we will continue to pursue.</p></speech>

She referred to statutory powers and the personal advocacy service.  There is no doubt advocates are being prevented from accessing services.  Statutory powers would make a significant difference.  However, it goes beyond that.  Statutory powers can get people in and give people access.  However, without the necessary training and understanding and without working with the service providers, we will not make progress.  Many are working remarkably well with the advocacy services.  I am keen to acknowledge that.  This is about a person-centred approach.  When an advocate comes to a facility, the staff need to be aware that she is coming to work with them to support the person in question.  That involves a cultural change and a behavioural shift.  This change really will not materialise unless it comes from the bottom up and the top down.  The relevant training must be available.  We need statutory powers, but we also need the added value of people understanding what advocacy is.</p> <p>  I am going to hand over to my colleague Ms Loughlin in a moment.  She will discuss how the national advocacy service for people with disabilities, NAS, accesses and gets out to the services as well as how it gets to those most in need.</p> <p>  Reference was made to HIQA, the level of advocacy available to those in community houses and what happens when people go in.  Again, Ms Loughlin might elaborate on that.  We have been working with HIQA and we will continue to ensure that when representatives of HIQA go in, they know what to look for in terms of what a good advocacy service is.  As Mr. Connolly has said, it is not a question of having a leaflet in a file or a note that an advocate has been to a given place.  HIQA needs to be able to specify the outcome, what has changed or what has been achieved.  Even for HIQA inspectors, this requires engagement with advocacy and with advocates to understand what they can expect.  That will greatly enhance their work as well as supporting the advocacy service.</p> <p>  The national advocacy service findings constantly try to pick up, review and reflect what is happening for NAS.  We have a national advisory group made up of key players in the HSE, Sage, Inclusion Ireland and a number of other players.  We can raise issues and feed back on issues under that group.  We have a social policy remit within the Citizens' Information Board whereby we examine submissions and make reports.  It is still a work in progress.  Again, the more collaboration there is between the services, ourselves and the HSE, the easier it will be for us.  Perhaps Ms Loughlin will explain a little about how we reach into the community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.972" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Loughlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#K00600"><p>I would be glad to elaborate on some of those points.  Senator van Turnhout commented on how this is really about consent, choice and control.  In a nutshell, that is what the NAS model of advocacy seeks to uphold.  As Mr. Connolly has said, all advocacy should also be about self-empowerment and capacity building for the individual.  One of our functions is to ensure individuals have the information they need to make an informed decision.</p> <p>  Specific questions included how we know we are getting to the people we are supposed to target.  That is very much a challenge; there is no doubt about it.  NAS has a remit for all disability types and all settings.  We have a particular remit with regard to the most vulnerable and isolated.  Primarily, this tends to result in a focus on intellectual disability in congregated settings and group homes, but not exclusively.  We map out where those people may be based on our knowledge base.  Then we undertake a process of engagement with service providers and families to raise awareness about the existence of the advocacy service.  Throughout the country the NAS does ongoing promotional work to raise the level of awareness.  Furthermore, we reach out to community groups such as community mental health teams, primary care teams and general practitioners to try to raise awareness around advocacy.  There may be people living in the community who are hard to reach because they are not connected to services, yet they may be in great need of an advocate.  This remains a challenge, one we continually review with a view to building on.</p> <p>  Mr. Connolly referred to leaflets on file and HIQA inspections.  Our experience echoes the comment about a poster on a wall or a leaflet on people's files.  We have experience of what happens in anticipation of a HIQA inspection or after a HIQA inspection.  Often, when this arises, a large number of inquiries or referrals come to our service from the service provider.  In such cases we aim to meet the service providers to increase their understanding around advocacy in order that they embroider it into their practice.  That is what we are seeking to do.  It is very challenging work.  We are a small service with a sizable remit, so it is a struggle to manage all of that, but that is our aim.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of approaching development and co-ordination.  My answer is that we need a step approach.  I do not advocate that a particular organisation with a particular budget be given responsibility for all advocacy.  We are at a stage at which we need a step approach.  An inter-sector committee is being developed by the HSE to safeguard vulnerable adults.  This is bringing together issues to do with people with intellectual disability and the work of elder abuse officers.  There is a great opportunity here and I imagine independent advocacy and support groups will have some impact on the group.</p><p>There is an opportunity to get people around the table and working to develop a common agenda.</p><p> We also have the decision support service which is not yet in law.  We do not know how that will be formed but we have said it should be an independent agency in its own right rather than being under the Courts Service.  As part of its remit, it will have the authority to develop codes of practice or to ask others to develop codes of practice.  That is another piece of the jigsaw which could examine common standards on issues of advocacy.  We ourselves have made a contribution in this regard recently.</p><p> The national patient advocacy service is being proposed but we are very close to a general election and do not know whether that will materialise.  I remember that this was announced last year in a different context.  As regards grappling with patient safety and advocacy, those issues do not necessarily always sail in the same boat.  It was an opportunity but we need to hear what is intended.</p><p> The other aspect of not rushing it but getting there nevertheless is that there is a need to prepare service providers.  That is because there are some service providers for whom the phrase "human rights" is something to do with Ban Ki-moon and the UN but very little to do with them and their day-to-day work.  They just cannot make the link between human rights and the fact that somebody cannot leave their nursing home, so there is a need to prepare the ground.  There is also a need to prepare the public ground.  Advocacy is not about people simply appointing themselves as advocates, appearing on the Joe Duffy radio show and giving out about something.  Legislation is required, as are practitioner skills.</p><p> Some of the issues that have been referred to are quite complex.  I will touch briefly on Deputy Kelleher's point about public service monopolies and the difficulty of having only one provider.  One of the things we have put in our detailed submission - I am particularly conscious of Portlaoise and other places - is the need for some form of public interest representative role sitting in on relevant sections of senior management meetings.  We no longer have this multidisciplinary approach but we have a multi-perspective one.  Somebody is required who can ask hard questions in the public interest, who has access to complaints information on issues from advocates, and who can bring that to the table.  We do need to develop a culture of reflection and challenge within that type of monopoly provider.</p><p> Senator van Turnhout raised the issue of legislation on access to clients and such legislation will be important.  One of the greatest difficulties we have concerns wards of court as well as the difficulty in accessing clients.  We can only wish the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill well, its speedy emergence and the departure of the whole wards of court system, which has been a terrible blight on our existence.</p><p> To come back to the issue of seeking statutory powers, we support that.  It should be simple but statutory powers will only bring us so far.  The practitioner skills of advocates will also be very important.  I am referring to good street-fighting skills as opposed to theoretical and abstract knowledge.</p><p> My last point concerns Senator Colm Burke who referred to the enduring power of attorney.  SAGE has made a submission to the Department of Justice and Equality to develop this area.  I refer to the second-last bullet point in my opening statement, which is the development of a major public campaign to promote the advantages of advanced planning and to give it some financial incentive.  If we can incentivise people to plan in advance, we could reduce costs in the system later on.  This is because the amount of time that health care practitioners and social care providers often spend in dealing with divided families and complex issues is an enormous cost to the State.  If we could encourage early engagement in advanced planning of all forms, including advanced health care directives and the enduring power of attorney, we would be doing the State a great service.</p></speech>

I would like to see a statutorily based national advocacy service which is independent, publicly funded and accountable.  That is the big picture but I am not sure where the various organisations see a starting point.  Is that what they would see as the overall big picture?</p> <p>  My second question arises from that.  Mr. Tyndall has described this area as a maze and we would all agree with him.  What would the advocacy service that should be available look like in practice?  For instance, how can the procedure for making complaints be simplified and is there a time limit for, or stages to, this procedure?  Should there be or is there a local support person in each community care area to advocate on behalf of individuals?  My main question is what this advocacy service will look like on the ground and how it will interchange with individuals, especially those who have a problem and want advocacy services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.976" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#L00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for the information in their presentations.  I wish to raise one or two issues.  One concerns advocacy for mentally ill patients, which is a difficult area.  As regards the ethos or practice of many sections of the psychiatric service - I am not painting the whole service with the same brush because there are good communicators - many psychiatrists will refuse even to discuss aftercare with carers, including families.  We get this information all the time and it is a historical thing, not something that has developed recently.</p> <p>  In addition, the psychiatric profession sometimes seems to discuss issues almost as if the patient was not present.  They may even assume the patient is not in a position to understand or be involved in his or her treatment.  We are coming from a time when that was the practice in society concerning the mentally ill.  What is the experience of the witnesses in this regard?</p> <p>  I understand that the Irish Advocacy Network does work in the area of mental illness, but it is not represented here.  It specifically does peer advocacy.  Where somebody has experienced difficulties with treatment from the mental health services, if trained properly in advocacy, such a person would be very suitable and informed.  He or she would have a feel for people's expediences in mental health services and who may not have received the respect of being communicating with.</p> <p>  As regards communication with patients who are mentally ill, the more severe the mental illness, the less discussion that takes place with the patients themselves.  There is almost an assumption that such a person is not cognitively able to engage about his or her illness, while that is not the case at all.</p><p>It is probably a historical societal practice going back decades, but it is still there.  How do we move away from that?</p><p> On the issue of communicating with carers, where a family receives a person home from a psychiatric inpatient unit - I will deal with inpatients because outpatients have an issue as well - and the family is not informed of the aftercare, what to expect or what even the treatment might be, that is very stressful for the patient and the family and does not assist the full recovery.  We are moving into recovery rather than containment because recovery is real in the mental illness area.  The witnesses might cover those two areas.</p></speech>

I do not want to go over everything that others have raised but I would like to touch on the point Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Kelleher mentioned about public representatives encountering difficulties in making representations on behalf of constituents.  It is often perceived that we are interfering rather than being there to help.  The point was well made.</p> <p>  On the back of that, Ms Fitzgerald stated, "the front-line staff and local manager are unaware of the inclusion of advocacy in service agreements and do not understand why an advocate has been requested or what their role is ... and therefore can be circumspect about the advocate&rsquo;s involvement".  That is an important point.  Sometimes it is important that somebody in charge acts on behalf of people or interacts with people.  It is something that Senator Colm Burke mentioned, even with regard to the different services, such as housing and grants.  One is trying to trawl through the various Departments to find the person who knows about the issue and it can be difficult.</p> <p>  I agree with everything Mr. Tyndall stated in his presentation.  A matter about which I could talk to him is where there is difficulty in making complaints or in knowing how to make them.  There is also the issue of making a complaint where one is concerned it may affect the care of a loved one.  That is often reflected to us.</p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall referred to Wales in his presentation and mentioned independent professional advocacy.  Is there a difference when compared with advocacy here?  When he mentions professional, what is the professional background of the advocates?  Are they professionally trained?  Mr. Tyndall might comment on that.  If one needs an advocate, how does one access the service or how does one navigate that?  How will it be funded?  Will there be a funding stream guaranteed?</p> <p>  Mr. Taylor mentioned in his presentation the comparison with the 46A bus where one waits a long time and then a few come at once.  What does the new advocacy service mean for the continuation of the SAGE advocacy service for older people?</p> <p>  How do we measure the quality of an advocate?  We now have a diverse culture in the country.  There are language barriers and people from other countries.  In this regard, how do we match the advocates to the needs of the person?</p> <p>  It was mentioned that there are only 35 advocates nationally.  How does one access the 35 advocates?  Where are they based?  Are there waiting lists?  How long does it take to access advocacy?</p> <p>  Another issue that has come up in the context of the private nursing homes and the fear of making complaints is that the confidential recipient does not apply to private nursing homes.  I had an issue whereby somebody was administered incorrect medication and that was reported, but the person in the private nursing home was afraid to take that complaint further because they were afraid they would be moved out of the nursing home.  How does one overcome that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.979" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#M00300"><p>I apologise for not being here for the earlier presentation.  I will also try to be brief.</p><p>We clearly need better advocacy services.  I am very supportive of it.  I am a supporter of transparency and openness in all areas of the public service, from Government down to doctors and hospitals.  There should be an automatic right of access to all records which does not have to go through any kind of freedom of information process.  Everything should be available to patients.  I operate an open records policy for any of my patients who wish to see any aspect of my records.  It is the correct thing to do.</p><p>I would not want anything I am saying to be misconstrued as being a lack of enthusiasm for an advocacy service.  I quote &quot;Titanic&quot; so often that James Cameron may well ask his lawyers to send a letter to me.  As <i>RMS Titanic</i>was slipping between the waves and the 700 passengers there were in excess of the number of lifeboat places were drowning and freezing to death, what they did not need as a priority was an advocacy service.  What they needed was somebody to have provided enough lifeboats on the ship in the first place.  In a perfect health system, if we ever were to achieve that philosophical nirvana of health perfection, there would be no complaints and there would be no need for advocacy or a complaints service, but we always will have complaints and as a result, we should have this service.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact the advocacy service must also advocate for reform of the service.  It should not be seen as retail exclusively.  It should also be wholesale.  It needs to look at the service.</p><p>The episode of obstetrical problems in the midlands over the past year or two, of which we are all aware and I do not want to personalise this to a particular tragedy, provided some of the impetus for a renewed focus on the need for advocacy services and reform, but what has to be remembered is that the staffing structure in that unit was bizarre.  There is no other country in the OECD or the western world that would have allowed a system to develop that would have been staffed by such a tiny number of consultant obstetricians.  There is no other system in the world that would look like the Irish system which has a tiny number.  With the possible exception of the NHS which is the second worst, the health service has a tiny number of specialists per head of population compared with any system in the OECD.  If one also looks at the incredible disproportionate reliance on good, diligent locum doctors, many of whom were trained abroad and brought their services here, because of the nature of their employment and because of the rapid rotation of locums because we do not have enough consultant positions to provide the critical mass to cover maternity leave, illness leave or holidays, we often have colossal deficiencies in the system which are also plugged by the honest efforts of inappropriately responsible junior doctors.  These are the problems.  We will need a good advocacy service because it will be really busy.</p><p>By all means, one should keep it up but one should not lose sight of the big picture.  There is a group about whom the complaints need to be made - Deputy Varadkar, Deputy Reilly, Ms Mary Coughlan, Ms Mary Harney, Deputy Martin, Mr. Brian Cowen, Deputy Howlin, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, Mr. Barry Desmond and others right to the beginning of the State - because these are the ones who occupied the position of Minister for Health and who, despite repeated warnings, were aware of the extraordinary nature of the public health system, in particular, the public hospital system.</p><p>I was elected to the Seanad four years ago with a little idealism and perhaps the tail end of middle-aged youth, thinking we could do something for reform of the health system.  We had a new Government which promised reform and which has now welshed and has told us we are not going to have it.  For the record, I am despondent.  I do not believe the health system is going to get fixed in my lifetime but the witnesses should by all means try to continue to be a powerful force for advocacy, reform and change in it.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegates, particularly the representatives of the Support and Advocacy Service for Older People, SAGE, whom I met in Croke Park in October.  It is nice to see them again.</p> <p>  I read some of the documents submitted to the joint committee last night.  The document, Think Ahead, while relatively short and compact, is one of the best I have read in a long time.  It encourages people to make a written statement on what should be done with the family home and so forth after they have passed away.  I give copies of the document to visitors to my constituency office.  Not only is it a good read but it also includes a form which people can fill in stating what should happen before and after they pass away.  Many families find themselves in turmoil when family members die or become very ill because a loved one has failed to appreciate the value of committing to paper his or her wishes in the event of his or her death.  This should not only be done by older persons.  Some time ago I met a young girl who has, unfortunately, since passed away.  We spoke about her wishes after her death and I explained the document, Think Ahead, to her.  I also provided her with a copy, although I do not know if she managed to read it.</p> <p>  As a public representative, I frequently meet people who are distraught because wills have not been made by family members before their death.  Housing causes particular problems in this regard.  Families should sit down together and discuss in advance what should happen with property if someone passes away because problems in this regard can cause families to fall out for generations.  Dealing with this issue is part of my role as a public representative.  It is often a sad time because people can feel inadequate and lost in the system.  For this reason, I support the Think Ahead initiative which should be supported.  For example, copies of the document should be made available in every library, hospital, nursing home, day care centre, primary care centre, college and school.  We must all make plans for when we are no longer here. </p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland provided statistics for the numbers of adverse events recorded by Irish hospitals and health care facilities in 2011.  We learned that there were 10,000 incidences of violence, harassment, aggression or abuse of patients in that year, of which more than 4,300 involved physical assaults on patients, including persons with disabilities.  We all saw the shocking television programme showing residents of a nursing home being abused, including being beaten.  The individuals in question were abused and made to feel unworthy.  Are the data from 2011 the most recent available?  Has the position improved or worsened since?  I refer, in particular, to nursing homes.  </p> <p>  I visit relatives and neighbours in a number of nursing homes.  The care I see is top-notch, although things may be different behind closed doors.  People are also being abused in families, with older people, in particular, sometimes being neglected in the family home.  How do we reach into private homes, as opposed to nursing homes and so forth, and advocate for those being abused at home?  This issue has been neglected to a certain extent.  If it were not for home help services and carers who visit older people daily, some of them would be left in desperate conditions, with serious implications for their physical and mental health.  I compliment those who work in these areas.  Perhaps the delegates from Inclusion Ireland will respond to my question on the figures for 2011.</p></speech>

To respond to Deputy Seamus Healy's question on having one large, independent statutory advocacy agency, I am a former public servant, having worked in what is now the Citizens Information Board, an organisation that I admire and which I will continue to strongly support.  However, statutory agencies are not the only show in town.  We need to strike a balance on this issue.  We certainly need co-ordination - that is the message we all want to convey in our different ways - but the question for the committee is how do we get there.</p> <p>  Deputy Seamus Healy asked what advocacy looked like on the ground.  That is an important question.  It looks like whatever the person wants it to look like.  It is not advocacy in terms of everybody jumping up and down in advocating for a cause.  It is very often, as I described earlier, a matter of the street-fighting skills of a person who wants to leave a regional hospital to return to live in a house with a clay floor with his or her mangy dogs and smoke 40 Woodbine cigarettes every day because that is what he or she has been accustomed to for many years.  Every professional and some of the remaining members of the family may decide that that is not in his or her best interests, even if he or she wants to be at home.  It concerns where the matter is determined by the person rather than on the basis of what the system and everybody else believes is in the person's best interests because sometime the best interests of others coincide with their own interests as opposed to those of the older person.</p></speech>

The National Advocacy Service believes it is terribly short of staff, but we have probably half the number of staff it has, yet we still reach people.  Recently, we were in Clonmel speaking to hospital staff who wanted to advocate and learn advocacy skills.  The question is not so much one of signposting but whether a sufficient number of people will be available at local level.  It is very often an issue of working out individual stories, wishes and preferences, sometimes against the wishes of the family and the system.</p> <p>  Deputy Dan Neville raised an issue about mental health.  I fully appreciate that mental health services are often the Cinderella service.  However, we should be careful not to make mental health a discrete issue because disability, older age and mental health services very often come together.</p> <p>  Issues of clinical governance also arise.  If some of the issues raised by the Deputy concern the behaviour of psychiatrists and the attitudes they take, the questions that must be asked - not only in this area but also in others - are what clinical governance system applies, who is supervising the work being done and how does one reach the people in question and make a complaint on the basis that the behaviour is neither responsible nor good enough.  </p> <p>  Issues arise about peer advocacy in mental health services.  While this approach has been extremely successful for a number of people, there are concerns about how far it can be developed.  These concerns must be noted.  </p> <p>  On Deputy Sandra McLellan's questions, I have touched on the issue of staff numbers.  The fear of making complaints in nursing homes is very real and not limited to them.  One of the good things about Irish society is that it is small and people know each other, as Deputy Billy Kelleher noted.  This is also a downside, however, in that people are genuinely afraid to make complaints.</p><p>It will take a number of years to build a culture where people do not always see a complaint as a personal affront and will look on it as an opportunity to learn how to build a quality service.  This is important.  A complaint must not always be seen as a personal attack but as a contribution towards the development of a service.</p><p> In regard to the point made by Senator Crown, I agree there are limits to advocacy.  As outlined in our submission, we believe there must be a rationale stated, as there is a grave danger that advocacy will be seen as a last straw that is clutched at by a bureaucrat who is running out of other excuses.  The fact is that advocacy has a role to play, but there are other avenues.   There is provision in legislation for complaints, the ombudsman, better services, the decision support service and a range of other options.  </p><p> Deputy Byrne, who kindly stood in for the Chairman at our conference on 16 October, spoke about Think Ahead.  I agree, but we must not just see Think Ahead as a resource but think about the public campaign that is needed to get the public to think ahead.  With Think Ahead as a resource, with enduring powers of attorney and with the advance health care directives, people should be advocating for themselves now for a period in the future when somebody else will have to advocate for them and will need to know what they want.  This type of approach is as important as legislation or any of the other issues we have mentioned.</p><p> The final issue concerns how to get into private homes.  It is correct that the greatest abuses happen in the home rather than in congregated settings, although these are the ones that are best known.  Home help services can help in this regard, provided they are aware of the advocacy services available.  They can tip off the services and can link up with other services.  Day care centres and any places where people are in touch with services can also be a touch point for linking up with advocacy services.  I agree, getting awareness of our services into private homes is one of the most difficult areas, but it is an area we must apply our minds to.</p></speech>

The Citizens Information Board is a statutory service and the National Advocacy Service is an independent, publicly funded and accountable service under that board.  However, I agree with Mr. Taylor that the service is not and cannot be the only show in town.  There must be a range of other models of advocacy.  Over the past ten years, since we started in 2005 with 46 small pilot projects, through to the service being managed under five citizens information services and now to one national service, one of the most important lessons we have learned - this relates to the question of how we measure the quality of advocacy - is that unless we have good management and support structures in place, it is difficult to measure the quality of advocacy.  The National Advocacy Service is keenly aware of this with its model as its advocates must deal with complex cases for people in vulnerable situations.  In terms of peer advocacy and other advocacy models, the question is how far can a model be developed and how far can it go.  A statutory national service with paid employees who are dealing with the most complex cases needs these structures and supports and it is important to remember that.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague to deal with some of the questions regarding practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.997" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Loughlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#O00400"><p>Deputy Neville raised two issues concerning psychiatric services, namely communication and assumptions made about people's capacity to understand decisions being made.  Some of these issues cut across all services in regard to people with disabilities, but there are particular issues in the case of mental health.  Our advocacy service is engaged with acute care settings for people with mental health issues and seeks to address some of those by seeking to build up the person's capacity and communication with people such as their consultant psychiatrist.  A cultural shift is required in terms of the issues the Deputy identified.  There is no doubt but that improvement is required in that area.  This improvement needs to come from more than just an advocacy service.  As Senator Crown said, it is broader than that.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill should make a difference to the experience of people in these services regarding assumptions around their capacity, because it starts from the premise that everybody has the capacity to make decisions.  This will apply across the board and will, hopefully, make some difference.</p> <p>  In regard to the question raised by Deputy McLellan regarding accessing our service, there are a number of pathways to doing that.  We offer a telephone service that allows people speak directly to a member of our staff.  This contact can be made by family members, through self-referrals or service providers.  We also engage in significant promotional work which often leads to a number of referrals.  Therefore, there is an extensive programme of engagement.  There are waiting lists in some parts of the country.  As mentioned already, this is a highly challenging area and there is huge demand for our service.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked how we match the needs of the advocate to the person.  This relates to the skill and training of the advocates and their ability to negotiate.  As well as dealing with changes in the Irish environment, advocates must be able to manage work across the different areas of disability.  This is about the skill and ability of the advocate.  In some situations, people might have particular skills or knowledge and we would try to match these to the individual.  We try to represent this in our own staffing also and the modern make-up of Ireland is already included in that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.998" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#O00500"><p>On the issue of what the independent advocacy service would be like, linking that to some of the issues around the service in Wales, I echo the comments about the need to have well trained, professional advocates as part of any service.  It is not for me to determine how an advocacy service across Ireland would work, as there are people better placed than I to do that.  However, access to such a service is important  In that context, I believe advocates should be located prominently at each of our general hospitals.  They should be easily found and their phone numbers should be well advertised on posters so that issues can be taken up on the spot.  The concern would be that this happens rather than a concern about who provides the advocacy.</p> <p>  In Wales, advocates come from a variety of backgrounds but it was the quality of training, induction and the national standards that applied that were significant in raising the quality of the service.  Those advocates were significant initiators of complaints to my office there.  The volume of complaints that came through involving an advocate made up a significant proportion of the work.  This shows that people who might not put their case forward, do so when they have help.  I also had experience of seeing peer advocacy operating well within the mental health context and I used some of those advocates to train staff in my office in the past because I found their perspective, from the service user point of view, was very good at helping staff to think about how they approached people with mental health problems who wanted to make a complaint.</p> <p>  I want to deal now with the issue of nursing homes and of people being afraid to complain because they will be identified.  My office has the power to investigate complaints on the basis of its own initiative, rather than on the basis of identifying a complainant.  A member of staff of a health facility cannot make a complaint to my office.  The system is designed for patients, carers, their advocates and so on.  However, if a member of staff brings matters to my attention, we can choose to investigate those without a complaint.  Therefore, there are possibilities in that regard and my staff has been alerted to the fact that if issues of that nature arise, we should consider making an own-initiative investigation.</p> <p>  Ombudsman investigations are about what has happened and are not about blaming an individual for getting something wrong.  They are about investigating whether what happened was right and, if not, what needs to be done to ensure it does not happen again and about making things right for the individual.  It is possible within an investigation to identify where things went wrong, without having to place a public spotlight on an individual.</p><p>This can be very damaging because people become very defensive, and it is not necessarily the best way of seeking improvements.  It is sometimes better to work with services to achieve an improvement rather than name and shame, which can have the opposite effect to that intended.  Ombudsmen also look at recurring patterns.  If we see several cases along a similar line or that kind of systemic issue, this is picked up as a potential role for advocacy services, and I would certainly endorse that.  If one has a broad picture as a result of running a national service, for instance, one will see patterns and will be able to contribute to improving services generally and not just in the particular setting.  I hope that answers some of the issues that were raised.</p></speech>

I am not experienced in the hospital sector.  The NDA has stated that three quarters of the &euro;1.4 billion it currently spends in the disability sector does not underpin the current policy model.  In other words, we have segregated and institutionalised people over a long period in residential settings.  Once people are taken out of their communities and segregated in that way, they are exposed to risk, abuse and a lack of choice and control over their lives.  That reform programme has not been energised in recent years.  We are talking about giving people control over their own funding in order that they can buy their services.  I respect what SAGE is saying in that this should not be an authority announced overnight and we have to move towards this.  I appreciate that and it has to be carefully considered.  However, one of my issues with a step-change process in the delivery of advocacy is that we have large organisations that receive hundreds of millions of euro in Government funding.  Over a long period they have not reformed.  They have their heads in the sand and they have no desire to reform.  Unless we put advocacy services and checks and balances into these organisations and compel change, they will not change over a long period.  That is the question of reform.<br/><br/>In terms of Deputy Byrne's question on &Aacute;ras Attracta, whether things have improved and what figures we are using, they were the 2012 figures reported in the <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I do not have more up-to-date figures, but the Ombudsman has spoken about how complaints in Ireland are under-reported compared with other jurisdictions.  We can safely say, therefore, that the numbers we are using are probably understated.  In terms of &Aacute;ras Attracta, if the CEO of the HSE is coming in later, it is important to say that very significant measures have been taken in terms of the centre itself and a number of other centres.  Several measures have been put in place in a number of centres since the &Aacute;ras Attracta scandal.  Can we say with any confidence that it is not happening in any other centres?  I am afraid we cannot because we do not have the checks and balances, advocacy and systems reform to say those abuses are not continuing today.<br/><br/>On Deputy Healy's question about what advocacy services look like on the ground, for us advocacy goes beyond the current conversation around hospitals and residential disability services.  I will give one example.  We have the case of a young girl whom we will call Sophie.  She is in a school in the east and has been restrained, face down on the ground, more than 400 times in the last 12 months by three teachers.  It is a case we are dealing with at the moment.  She has challenging behaviour.  We have very significant abuses outside the models we are talking about here, in terms of hospitals and so on, and we have no advocacy for parents.<br/><br/>To answer Deputy McLellan's question about how one gets an advocate, by and large, one does not.  We have very under-developed advocacy supports in residential services and in the community, so families find it very difficult to access a service.  That is where organisations like us and others come in.  We cannot deal with the level of demand on our services to do advocacy work.<br/><br/>I have two last points.  One relates to the confidential recipient.  She should be accessible to others.  We are the organisation that called for the appointment of a confidential recipient, so while we welcome the call, our difficulty is that if it is about a person picking up the phone to her, she will phone someone else on their behalf.  It is not a systems change.  It is an important intervention, but it is not a systems change.  It functions if a person is fortunate enough to get to a manager or if the confidential recipient gets to a manager for them.  It is a personal, one-on-one service and we cannot address the broad array of complaints and concerns that are in the system with those types of personal changes.  We need an office and an infrastructure.<br/><br/>I worked in the area of migration for more than ten years.  In terms of advocacy and the diverse nature of Ireland's society now, the issue is about cultural competence.  Advocates have to be trained up in cultural competence.  We cannot provide an advocate with every language for every community, so we need to build the cultural competence of advocacy services.</p></speech>

The requirement for effective advocacy crosses all of our health services, including acute hospitals, the care of older persons, services for people with disabilities and mental health services.  Self-advocacy is the ideal form of advocacy, particularly for people who are able to communicate their wishes and preferences.  The ultimate goal of any advocacy model should be to empower people and give them the confidence, where possible, to advocate for themselves.</p> <p>  In many cases, advocates are front-line workers or trained volunteers and professionals.  While I would like it to be otherwise, sometimes people feel powerless in navigating the health care system or in understanding the care options open to them.  Often, when they access services, they are very vulnerable or very ill.  It is in these situations that friends, relatives or those who have had similar experiences can and often do advocate on their behalf.  While some people are fortunate to have powerful advocates among their family and friends, it is also important there are advocacy arrangements in place which are independent of any aspect of the service or any of the statutory agencies involved in providing care.</p> <p>  The HSE invests in several organisations and groups which, either directly or indirectly, provide health information, advocacy, support with complaints handling and more practical support.  Examples of these agencies are SAGE and Patient Focus.  We have also established a national patient forum, made up of advocacy groups and patients.  This forum has already inputted into the medical card review and that relating to ambulance services.  It is available to all our service divisions to support the planning, design and delivery of services.</p> <p>  In 2014, the HSE, together with Atlantic Philanthropies, agreed to fund a national support and advocacy service for older people known as SAGE.  This service is managed by Third Age, a national voluntary organisation from which the committee heard earlier this morning.</p><p>SAGE is building a team of people capable of tackling the most complex support and advocacy challenges presented by older people, and to date it has dealt with 652 cases.  The service has also mobilised 138 volunteers who serve as facilitators for residents' groups in nursing homes and support for vulnerable older people in hospital emergency departments.</p><p> Within our disability services are a significant number of community and voluntary organisations, most of which are funded by the HSE, which provide some form of advocacy.  The extent of this provision has not yet been systematically documented, and the HSE has established a project to map this.  This process will include consultation with people with disabilities who live in residential settings.  The HSE is also working with Inclusion Ireland to establish service user and family councils or forums in a number of intellectual disability service settings.  In addition, work is under way with the disability sector to establish a national volunteer advocacy programme based on the SAGE model for older persons.  Progress will be made on the development of this programme in 2016.</p><p> The committee is aware that in December 2014 the HSE appointed its confidential recipient, Leigh Gath, following revelations of abuse at &Aacute;ras Attracta in Mayo.  The confidential recipient provides a place where individuals with concerns about the abuse of vulnerable adults in residential settings can come to have their concerns listened to and investigated.  She also acts as an important advocate for the complainant, navigating the system and ensuring the concerns raised are dealt with appropriately.</p><p> The HSE also acknowledges the important work of the National Advocacy Service, supported by the Citizens' Information Board, which provides an independent advocacy service for people with disabilities.  While the service has a team of full-time advocates, there is still a large cohort of people with significant disabilities who have either no access or very limited access to a case advocate.  The HSE would welcome further enhancement of this service and for it to be put on a statutory footing through the commencement of Part 2 of the Citizens Information Act 2007.</p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s acute hospitals division recently developed a plan for greater patient partnership across the hospital system.  Hospital groups are putting in place patient advisory councils and some groups have appointed patient advice and liaison co-ordinators.  These will be extended to all groups.  This work will be supported by a national patients' council.</p><p> A key indicator in any assessment of the quality of our health service is the way it reacts to the concerns raised by its clients, patients and service users.  Complaints are an important way for the management of services to be accountable to the public, as well as providing valuable information about the performance of the organisation and the conduct of people that work within and for it.  It was in this context that in May 2015 the Office of the Ombudsman published a report on its investigation into how public hospitals in Ireland handle complaints about their services.  In particular, the Ombudsman looked at how well public hospitals listen to feedback and complaints and whether they are learning from these complaints to improve the services they provide.  The HSE has now established a national complaints management office, which will provide leadership in how we respond to and learn from feedback right across our system.  In an associated initiative, the HSE will, together with HIQA and the Department of Health, introduce patient experience surveys across our acute hospital system from 2016.  We will support the Department of Health in the establishment of the patient safety office and the development of its work.</p><p> I should also mention the introduction of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill.  The provisions of the Bill will apply to all health and social care settings, and the HSE has established a project team to ensure implementation of the provisions of the Bill once enacted.  This will include implementation of the codes of practice for those acting as advocates on behalf of patients and service users.  The HSE strategy supports the simplification of legislation governing the complaints process and the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to include complaints related to clinical areas.</p><p> I believe strongly that every patient or user of our services is entitled to be heard on the decisions that affect their lives.  Effective advocacy must therefore be supported at all levels of the health service, and the HSE is committed to continuing its work in this important area.  There is, however, a very real requirement for advocacy services that are truly independent of and, therefore, not at risk of undue influence from those services.  The HSE therefore welcomes the recent announcement by the Minister for Health of the establishment of an independent national patient advocacy service in 2016.  We will endeavour to answer any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

This morning we heard from advocacy groups who outlined their views and concerns on what is required to be done to ensure we have proper accountability in how complaints are followed through in our health services.  There are certain cohorts with specific vulnerabilities and areas of disability, where people may be in a congregated setting without family supports.  We have seen major problems manifest themselves, such as in &Aacute;ras Attracta.</p> <p>  The HSE has a monopoly in what it offers to the public, who have no choice but to use this service, be it the local hospital or services for elderly people or people with disabilities.  There is an obligation on the HSE to ensure complaints are followed up.  One could argue that to improve one's service one should embrace complaints, and most companies dealing with the public in the private sector make the complaints procedure very easy because it is probably the best form of research they can garner on their product or service.  The same should be the case with the HSE.  It should be very easy for people to make a complaint.  This is something we really need to embrace.  While we have moved towards the establishment of advocacy services and patient safety services, we need to accept that it should be easy for an individual to complain and for it to be followed up in a meaningful way to get to the bottom of the complaint one way or the other.  The measure of success is that we would not need those advocacy services if the system was working and functioning properly.</p> <p>  This morning, an issue was raised about public representatives following up on behalf of a constituent or somebody who approaches them with a complaint.  Often people contact us because they are not happy with a service or they have experienced a delay in a service, difficulty accessing a service or an issue with regard to the treatment or support they were given or not given.  By and large, the HSE is very forthcoming in dealing with public representatives' queries.  However, I am beginning to detect a slow but incremental creep of the use of patient confidentiality and the protection of patients' details, and it is becoming more difficult for public representatives to make representations on behalf of people who approach us.  We are asked for specific details of the person on whose behalf we are making the complaint, but very often it is a third party, such as a family member, who comes to us.  Is the HSE using client confidentiality, patient confidentiality and data protection concerns as a means to slow down or obstruct the process?  I am not saying this is specific to the HSE, but I am beginning to detect this as an issue across the public service in general.  I appreciate that there is an obligation with regard to data protection and client confidentiality, but sometimes we are requested to furnish details we simply cannot get.  Earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in gave photographic evidence of an example of this.  We should be conscious of ensuring that when people come to us we can pursue the complaint.  If a person or family member comes to me and makes a serious complaint I have two ways of looking at it.  I can either do nothing or do something.  If I do nothing and at some stage down the road something is shown to have happened, then I did not act in the way I should have.  We should not put barriers in this specific area.  I accept that public representatives make numerous representations to the HSE but, particularly with regard to complaints, we do not put pen to paper lightly because very often there are implications.</p><p> With regard to services, there is no doubt there is an element of fear in a person making a complaint, as it is the only service available.  Even if the service is not good or the supports being given are not great, they are the only supports that can be accessed.  If people make a complaint, they may feel there may be a vindictiveness in the organisation at some stage that could jeopardise treatment in future.  It is a genuine concern I have heard people raise on numerous occasions.  They come to us to make a complaint but when we look to pursue it, they say they may have to return to the service next month or next year and they do not want to cause any difficulty for themselves or their families.</p><p> Let us be honest in that another area where people can have concerns is that they do not want to get people in trouble.  They want a concern to be aired but we are quite a close-knit community, we know each other and we are interdependent.  Although one person may cause difficulties, people in general do not want to cause problems for staff providing a service.  People very often appreciate the staff providing a service may be under pressure because of resourcing issues.  It is a delicate balance of holding people to account while, at the same time, of ensuring that when people have a complaint, they can bring it to the attention of authorities without jeopardising an individual's career or bringing about a disciplinary process over and above what they may have expected.  They just want the concern dealt with.  This is a tricky balance as there is an element of accountability and obligation as well.</p><p> With regard to the comments on independence, the national patient advocacy service, recently announced by the Minister for Health, is meant to be independent.  Very often, many of these organisations depend on funding directly from the organisation to which they advocate for a patient.  Have we not finally accepted that we need complete independence, including resourcing and finances, in such cases?  Let us be honest in that somebody makes a decision about how much an organisation gets.  If it does not get enough, the organisation cannot do its job correctly.  How independent can a body be if it is fundamentally dependent on getting resources from an organisation it must hold to account?</p></speech>

We have had some really good presentations this morning, outlining many problems and offering a number of solutions.  We had a very lengthy discussion that ran on past noon.  I will mention a few issues that arose.  Deputy Kelleher mentioned how we, as public representatives, try to act on behalf of vulnerable people.  Relatives might contact us as a last resort and, on occasion, it can be quite difficult for us to navigate the health system.  Another point was made this morning regarding one of the services run by Ms Eileen Fitzgerald that sometimes front-line staff working in hospital services and local managers are unaware of the inclusion of advocacy in service agreements and the role we might play.  Sometimes we might make representations and receive no reply because the staff do not recognise what we are trying to do and that we are looking to help.  It is an issue.  </p> <p>  A point made about the issue of complaints by the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, was that people find it hard to navigate the complaints system or do not know how to make a complaint in hospitals.  People are often nervous of making such complaints because of the potential knock-on effect on care for a person.  As Deputy Kelleher noted, as everybody knows everybody else, people might be afraid of getting a person working in the care system into trouble.</p> <p>  We must address this issue and make it easier for people.  In the course of the study by the Ombudsman, it emerged that 800 different people deal with complaints in the HSE.  That is the reason I welcome, on the back of the study, that the HSE has established a national complaints management office and I hope it will be easier for all of us to access it.  I also hope it will be fully aware of advocacy and be happy to deal with the public representatives.</p> <p>  How will advocacy be funded and will funding be guaranteed?  What will the training and professional background be of advocates?  This morning I asked about how we can measure the quality of advocates.  Another issue I raised concerned migrants and the diversity in our country.  How do we match advocates to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.1009" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#S00300"><p>We all understand that the complaints area for the health service is particularly difficult.  Individuals feel it can be a maze and lead to a significant ordeal if they undertake a complaint.  In very many cases, either patients or relatives have a fear of raising issues.  For example, they may fear a difficulty for themselves or relatives as patients.  There is little support, if any, for assisting a person who wishes to make a complaint.  It is a complex process and it tends to take a significant amount of time.  It can be an ordeal.</p> <p>  Access to advocacy services in such a context is very important.  Will the HSE make infrastructure available at hospital or community care level to assist people in this area?  People are often unaware of where to start or where to get information about this area.  The provision of some sort of infrastructure at local HSE level is vital.  Does the HSE intend to provide an office at the local level where people can be advised of their rights or procedures and steps they might wish to take?  Perhaps an advocate could be available to help them in that regard?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien raised the question of funding of advocates and groups a number of times.  I certainly have the very strong view that advocates and groups should be publicly funded but not through the HSE.  I have not had a good experience of this process in the past, although it is not a large number of incidents.</p><p>In one case in which I have been very strongly involved I had a very bad experience with respect to the funding of groups that claim to advocate on behalf of patients.  I strongly call for public funding in this area other than from the HSE.  </p><p> On the issue of complaints with respect to the HSE, there is a need, and space, for mediation by HSE personnel at local level.  When an incident or complaint arises initially, there appears to be little or no consultation, information or mediation at an early stage.  If it there was and if there was more openness at an early stage, a significant number of complaints and concerns could probably be addressed at that stage and people would be satisfied that the complaint would be taken on board and a similar complaint would not arise in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.1011" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015112600002#T00300"><p>I thank Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Lynch for their attendance and contributions.  I would like to deal first with the area of data protection.  This issue arose earlier and, for the information of the HSE, the then Ombudsman made it quite clear that in respect of any representations made by a public representative, there was an implication that the constituent had given permission by way of contacting the public representative.  At earlier stages in the operation of the HSE, letters were sought from everybody we would represent giving permission, but the Ombudsman, in writing and at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, made it quite clear that a representation made to a public representative indicated that there was implied permission for full disclosure of any information.  There is a letter to that effect from the previous Ombudsman.</p> <p>  The issue of a culture of complaints has been dealt with, but the word "complaint" may be the wrong one in this context, as it conveys the message that the complainant is a bit of a nuisance and that he or she is trying to find something about which to complain.  However, that is way it is and that is the word that is used.  "Concern" might be a better word if we could change the approach to this.  A culture of complaints implies that a complainant is one of those people who always complains about everything, although, in fact, people are very slow to complain within the health services because of the delicacy of what is involved.  It is only in extreme cases that complaints are made.  As was mentioned, there is a fear of retribution.  How many of us have found that a person, on calling to see us to make a complaint, has suddenly pulled back from doing so when we say that we will deal with it?  They say they do not want to proceed and that they will leave it.  It is very frustrating for a public representative who knows that there is something wrong, because the first thing one will be asked on making a complaint is the case concerned and the name of the person involved, which is fair enough.  We do not want people walking in off the road saying that they want to make a complaint if they have an issue, although I am not saying that is wrong.  That is very frustrating for us and I do not know how we can get over it, but we should be conscious that people are very reluctant to complain.  That also inhibits the HSE from being informed of difficulties on the ground.  In the previous discussion I dealt with the issue of mental health, the mental health services and the culture of secrecy around communicating with the patient.  In one case involving an inpatient, the medics almost spoke over the patient suffering from a mental health difficulty, as if they were not cognisant of or did not understand what was happening.</p> <p>  Another issue I raised earlier was that of communication with carers in the context of aftercare for people who are discharged from a mental heath inpatient facility.  I refer to instances in which a psychiatrist says that a matter concerning a patient is confidential and they cannot discuss it.  They will not even ask the patient for permission to discuss it; they just close down.  This does not relate to all psychiatrists; if I were to put a figure on it I would say it is applies to around 60% of them, because we have some very good psychiatrists, and I know many of them.  It is very difficult and frightening for many people who are not engaged in the mental health services or with the illness that is mental illness.  It is because of a tradition going back 20 years before my mother became a psychiatric nurse, when mental health facilities were known as lunatic asylums.  We are coming from that era and that attitude.  We know about the stigma attached to mental illness and we also know what HSE is doing through the See Change campaign.  I will not go into that discussion, but there is that issue.  There is an issue around communication with carers in terms of aftercare and how they are informed.  </p> <p>  The Irish Advocacy Network, which is a peer advocacy group for mental health services, has not appeared before the committee.  If the representatives have any comment to make on their experience of that network, I would welcome hearing it.</p> <p>  With respect to the appointment of Leigh Gath, I must declare an interest because I know her very well.  Anyone who wants to study a person who had a serious disability but overcame it very well should read her biography.  Hers was an inspired appointment.  She is dealing with residential facilities.  Do the representatives have any plans in the future to build up that service outside of the residential area?  That would be a channel through which we could have the nucleus of a broader advocacy area, which, while semi-independent-----</p></speech>

I do not know how many more such organisations there are from which we have not heard.  I would like to ask about the diversity of the organisations.  There is obviously a similarity among them due to the fact that they are engaged in the same work, but now there are many such organisations, and while I would not say there is duplication of the work, there could be a move towards that.  That applies to other areas as well and not only to advocacy.  In the matter in which I have an interest, that of suicide prevention, there are more than 200 organisations around the country, which is also a concern.  It needs to be examined in a way that is supportive of them and that allows them to be assisted.  Have the representatives any comment to make on the diversity of the organisations in the advocacy area?  Four or five organisations contacted us about today's discussion, but how many similar organisations are there?  I know of the Irish Advocacy Network but I do not know much about it other than that it advocates for mental health services.</p></speech>

On the issue of reviewing incidents in which something goes wrong in a hospital, I mentioned earlier today a case in which it was decided within the hospital that there should be a review and two people were to do the review, but it was then decided that there should be an external review, and an external reviewer was appointed.</p><p>Someone in administration up along the line has now overruled the appointment of the external reviewer.  This has been done without any logical explanation in real terms.  Eight or nine months after the incident occurred, no information has been given to the people concerned.  This type of delay is going to lead to litigation.  It is happening within the HSE, particularly in maternity services.  Some bigger units are dealing with such volumes that there seems to be a delay on each occasion.  Those who are trying to do the review are reluctant to talk to the parents or provide information to them.  It does not seem that this is being dealt with sufficiently quickly.  I wonder if something can be done to make sure this is dealt with in a timely manner.  Can people be assured that these cases will be concluded within a particular time period?  It does not matter whether the period in question is two months or three months, as long as there is a deadline.</p><p> I would like to mention a second issue, about which I have previously spoken.</p></speech>

I refer to delays in the holding of inquests.  I know it is outside the control of the HSE.  In fairness, the vast majority of coroners are extremely efficient and good.  In some parts of the country, there are substantial delays in the holding of inquests by coroners.  It is not because of a lack of information from the HSE.  There is no statutory requirement on coroners to hold inquests within a certain timeframe.  I suggest that such a requirement needs to be put in place in the interests of everyone working in the HSE, especially staff members who are at the coalface dealing with the relatives of people who have died.  It is something that should be examined.  If there is a need to change the relevant legislation, that should be set out.  I will leave it at that.  I thank Mr. O'Brien for the time and effort he is devoting to dealing with this area.  I know he has brought about many changes which are for everyone's benefit.  I think we need to do a few more things to bring the service up to what we require.</p></speech>

I would like to respond jointly to the points made by Deputies Kelleher and Neville.  In any commercial enterprise, a complaint would be regarded as a gift from a customer and considerable investment would be made to reap the benefits of it.  I agree absolutely that complaints should be perceived in that way.  I also agree that this is not how they are universally perceived at present.  We are on the same page there.  Equally, I agree that we have a system which is capable of too quickly turning a request or a concern into a complaint, thereby putting it into a highly formalised process set down by legislation.  This is equally unhelpful.  I will use a particular example to illustrate this.  It was put to me recently when I was visiting a service.  A service user who was visiting an outpatient service had a particular need to sit down, but there was a shortage of seats.  Her physical circumstances meant that she needed a seat.  When she approached the desk to express her requirement for a seat, rather than someone getting her a chair it was suggested that she might be given a complaint form.  Hopefully that is an extreme example, but it speaks to what I am saying about simple requests or concerns being too quickly turned into complaints and channelled down from there.  It is important that as we address this issue at large, we do not institutionalise the process of dealing with feedback, concerns or requests.  Complaints should become complaints when it is appropriate that they are dealt with as complaints, rather than because that is the easiest way to deal with any representation in the broadest sense of the word from an individual using a service.<br/><br/>Deputy Kelleher is right when he says that the HSE is a monopoly provider in the sense that it is the provider of last resort.  I agree that this creates a sense of dependence on the part of those who use the HSE's services, particularly when there are areas in which demand for services exceeds current supply, as we all know.  This results in waiting lists, which, in turn, results in a sense that there are discretionary decisions to be made.  Regardless of whether this concern is actually founded or likely to be the case, it is not unreasonable that an individual would be concerned that discretionary decisions might not go his or her way in the future if he or she is perceived to be a complainant.  That is one reason it is critically important that there is access to advocates, in the sense of the word as we are using it today.<br/><br/>The current formal complaints process is, in effect, laid down by the Health Act 2004.  It is, by definition, extraordinarily complex.  It provides for a necessity to go off in all sorts of different directions, depending on what the complaint is about.  In the past fortnight, the Minister announced his intention to make the necessary legislative change to simplify that process.  That will be followed through on with the simplification of the ability go on to the second tier - the Ombudsman - regardless of what the complaint is about.  This will bring an end to the approach which means, in effect, that the standard complaints procedure cannot deal with a matter that is in any way clinical.  Such cases had to be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, and whatever we did or did not do was not then subsequently appealable to the Ombudsman.  If we make a single doorway or pathway for complaints, it will inevitably make the whole process much easier.  We strongly welcomed and indeed advocated for the simplification that was announced recently.  A single portal for complaints, <i>healthcomplaints.ie</i>, will be given additional investment under the supervision of the Ombudsman to make it a more realistic pathway to get in.<br/><br/>That 800 different complaints persons were identified in the Ombudsman's report is to some extent a legacy issue.  As we create more fully the hospital groups and the community health organisations, it is intended that there will be a single identified co-ordinator for all complaints in each of those health delivery entities, just as there will be in the ambulance service and one or two other specialist national services.  Mr. Lynch will say a little more about this approach, which will bring absolute standardisation across the system but not in a way that makes it harder to navigate.  It is designed to make it easier.<br/><br/>To be honest, I had not been aware of the perceived changes that have increased the barriers to public representatives raising complaints.  Now that I am aware of this factor, I will seek to do something about it.  Questions can come back at times if it is not clear that the representation is being made on behalf of the person who is the service user.  As someone who deals with many representations, I know it is not always entirely clear from the information provided who the individual is or what the service is.  Sometimes there will be a requirement to come back looking for more information.  There should be no objections in principle to making progress with concerns raised by public representatives.  If such objections exist, I ask public representatives to let my office know and we will seek to ensure they are unblocked.<br/><br/>With regard to funding, we agree that advocacy services should be funded in a way that is independent of the service provider.  In other words, they should be funded independently of the HSE and entities funded by it.  At present, we fund many advocacy services for the simple reason that if we were not doing so, it is probable that nobody would be doing it and that would be worse.  Under the initiative announced by the Minister two weeks ago, this will be brought under the national patient safety office.  That office will be part of the Department of Health, which is not a service provider.  Obviously, the Minister is directly accountable to the Oireachtas in a way that we are not.  Advocacy services will be publicly funded through the mechanism in question.  It is likely that some of the funding we currently provide will be lifted out of our budget.  It will go back into the Department's budget so that no one loses out as a result.  We will do some work on this in the period of preparation.  We fund advocacy of all sorts of clients.  Not all of it is the type of advocacy we are talking about here.  Many of the thousands of entities we fund are engaged in different types of advocacy.  We would not that to be disrupted.</p><p> We are fully committed to the implementation of the recommendations on complaints contained in the Ombudsman's report.  Mr. Tyndall was kind enough to invite me to speak at the launch of that report and we committed ourselves very firmly to it.  Mr. Lynch, our national director for quality assurance and verification, is leading out on that.</p><p> I will seek to get information from Senator Colm Burke on the individual review he mentioned in order that we might address the matter.  We are changing the way we resource reviews because with the traditional methods, there will inevitably be delays because a small number of people are being asked to do a great many external reviews.  We have established a new process and Mr. Lynch will speak about it.</p><p> The coronial process of inquests is, of course, fully independent and quasi-judicial.  We fully respect the independence of coroners but agree, as a general principle, that it is desirable that inquests should be held and brought to conclusion as soon as is practically possible following the event that is being inquired into so that the lessons learned and the recommendations can be obtained by the service providers.  I am very conscious that the period leading up to or waiting for an inquest is a particularly stressful period for the surviving relatives in those situations.  It is, therefore, generally desirable that it should be brought forward.</p><p> I do not know the overall level of funding that will be provided for advocacy under the national patient safety office as those decisions have yet to be made.  I think we can be assured, however, that it will be a greater sum than the current sum in aggregate.</p></speech>

In most cases, issues around reviews arise for two reasons.  The two things required from a review are, first, to establish if there are any underlying safety issues in a particular service which might impact on other people and, second, to give answers to the individuals concerned who may have been impacted upon or, as in some instances, harmed as a result of an incident.  We have a process in place with a 120-day target.  We are measuring that.  We will be producing a report shortly which, for the first time, will begin to give us more data in what is happening across the system.  This will be the first time we will ever have that level of detail.  We are signalling to people that in the midst of a process, where timeliness is important, there can be issues of delay that we are trying to overcome .  However, that is no excuse for a failure to communicate and involve people in the process the whole way through.  That is an area of focus.  Second, in terms of reviews - this will apply to the disability services initially - we are establishing a national independent review panel that will be modelled on the panel that is in place in Tusla.  That panel, which will deal with incidents of a very serious nature, will be recruited through the Public Appointments Service and will be completely independent and report to the risk committee of the HSE.  The planning for it is already in place and we hope it will be established in 2016.  It is a significant area of focus for the HSE at present.</p></speech>
