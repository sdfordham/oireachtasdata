    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00400"><p>Last week, Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, appeared before the committee.  The Chairman raised the issue of the Fennelly commission and words were used to the effect that there should not be a blank cheque involved in that commission of investigation.  I raised the issue of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and the uncertainty with regard to how long it will take to finalise that commission of investigation, the comments of the High Court judge who is conducting it and the warning he has given that this could be a waste of taxpayers' money.  I raised this matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  If legislation is needed with regard to that commission of investigation, a financial analysis must be conducted and made public before any decision is taken to move on in that regard.  There was agreement on the sense in that in the committee last week, given what you and others articulated, especially when the judge in question has effectively put the Government on notice that, in his opinion, it is uncertain at present as to how long this will take and he wonders whether it is a good use of public money and value for money for the taxpayer.</p> <p>  The committee should consider formally asking that before any new commission of investigation, or even an extension of an existing commission of investigation, is decided upon, an analysis would be conducted as to how much it would cost, including the projection over a number of years, and that it would be made public.  That is a reasonable request considering that the Mahon, Moriarty and beef tribunals collectively cost the taxpayer approximately &euro;250 million.  The point of establishing these commissions of investigation was that they would not be tribunals.  They would be shorter and would not amount to a blank cheque for lawyers, frankly, which is what I have seen with some of the tribunals in this country.  The point was that there would be a time limit, so it would not be open-ended.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a role to play in asking the Government to consider that - at the very least and before it takes any decisions on these commissions of investigation - the length of time involved must be certain and that a spending cap might be necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00500"><p>I support what Deputy Deasy said.  When the commission of inquiry legislation was going through the Houses in 2004 and 2005, that was very much the intent behind it.  The legislation was seen as creating a viable alternative to the tribunals, which were perceived as being open-ended and costing the taxpayer an arm and a leg.  The purpose of the commissions of investigation was to be specific.  It was to focus the structure and the operation of the inquiry so it would be done with the maximum result but with minimum cost to the State.  The legislation put in place a dual structure in respect of the legal system on the one hand and non-engagement with the legal system on the other hand.  That combination of approaches would have to be achieved correctly to ensure that a vast quantity of money was not being spent, particularly by the engagement of major legal teams.  This particular case highlights that.  With regard to the Fennelly report and the IBRC, it would be worthwhile if we could find a mechanism to review the situation in terms of cost to the taxpayer in the context of the Committee of Public Accounts seeing how we could deal with it here to get some guidance and direction on the expenditure of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00600"><p>I agree with the thrust of those comments.  Obviously, the cost of any inquiry is a matter of concern and anything that amounts to a blank cheque book for legal firms or lawyers must be avoided.  However, it is important that the committee makes it clear that the issues under consideration must be fully investigated because potentially serious questions in respect taxpayers' money arise from the serious matters the judge was asked to investigate.  There should not be an impression that issues surrounding potential costs of the commission were being used in any way or for any purpose to block a full and thorough investigation.  However, it is a good idea to make inquiries and ensure that legal costs, caps, <i>per diem</i>rates and so forth are in full view and under the surveillance of this committee.  It is a fair to ask that.  Nevertheless, it is an absolute imperative that each of the deals under consideration, most notably that involving Siteserv, is fully investigated.  We should not be, nor should we be perceived to be, throwing up a further road block in achieving a full investigation of those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00700"><p>It must be said that it is most regrettable that the inquiries referendum was voted down.  Of course, it was the legal people, through their careful intervention, who largely brought that about.  It is worth making that point at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#B00800"><p>We had this discussion last week with regard to the Fennelly commission and IBRC.  To allay any fears, Deputy McDonald, it has nothing to do with the issue being investigated, getting to the bottom of it and dealing with it in an effective way.  However, the history of tribunals and other investigations is that once they are established by the House, they appear to get out the gap and costs are never a question.  When that happens, as history has shown, we cannot intervene.  We are told that we cannot interfere with the direction of the tribunal.  The purpose of the conversation last week, and again today, is that some restraint be put on the costs, legal fees and structure of the proposed investigation or tribunal before it sets off, so that we at least have an idea of the cost implications versus the outcomes we are trying to achieve.  We have not learned from the history of this, and there appears to be a reluctance and inability to address it.</p> <p>  Last week, we asked Mr. Watt for the figures in respect of the Fennelly commission and the IBRC.  The figures were not available that day but we were told that they could be made available to us immediately.</p><p>I understand that we still have not got those figures and that is unhelpful.  The committee is right to follow the proposition outlined by Deputy Deasy in the context of protecting the taxpayers' money because it is a more sensible, prudent and constructive approach to the work of any ongoing tribunal or investigation.  We should take this issue up next week with the Department of Finance but in the meantime we should write to the Departments concerned about this issue, make our views known and seek a response.  Hopefully we will get an input into overseeing or examining the cost of the proposals that are being put before the Oireachtas.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#C00200"><p>We should ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to structure that and to come back to the committee.  In the context of the IBRC case, the High Court judge was effectively telling the Government that this needs to be structured better, with definite timeframes and that it needs to be clear because as of now, it is not.  A High Court judge is dealing with this but it could end up being a complete waste of taxpayers' money if it is not structured differently.  We are not getting into the substantive issue of whether there should be an investigation.  I agree with the Chairman on that point.  I am conscious that there may be information that I am not aware of and that when the Government made that decision, it may have had information to which I am not privy.  I am not going to second guess that decision but we should ask for that structure to be imparted to this committee, based on what the High Court judge has said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#C00300"><p>I entirely agree with that and the points are very well made.  However, it is important that we, as a committee, put on the record that a decision has been taken that the matters at hand need to be investigated and that they speak to the issue of taxpayers' money, at least potentially.  I am not jumping to conclusions in terms of the possible outcome but it is important that we say that, along with saying that we need to see the structure.  Of course, there has to be some sanity in respect of the cost of this to the public purse.  The Chairman is absolutely correct in that regard.</p></speech>

We will ask the Department of Expenditure and Reform to give us the figures we have requested before the end of business today, given that those figures are apparently quite easy to get.  Let us have those figures; we were promised them last week.</p></speech>

We want as much complete information as we can get.  That is what we were promised last week but we should have it today.

On the question of sanity raised by Deputy McDonald and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, it might be no harm if someone was tasked with the job of costing more serious policy matters that will be put before the electorate over the coming months.  It would make perfect sense for some State agency or organisation to be put in charge and to outline the costs of the bigger proposals being put forward by every political party and none so that someone has a handle on what people are getting involved in.</p></speech>

Somebody should be charged with providing a broad analysis of particular projects that may be put before the people in the context of a general election.  That happens in other jurisdictions.  We need at least an indicative guideline on the costs that might be involved and it would be no harm to make that available to every political party and to the Members of these Houses, who want to establish costs in a real way.  I am not referring specifically to this Government but to Governments in general when I say that far too often it is only after a general election that costs get counted properly but they should be counted as we go along, in an independent way.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance has point-blank refused to do that.  We have tabled various parliamentary questions on it and my party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath has published legislation which would enable the IFAC to carry out that role.  All the Department of Finance is willing to do at the moment is to cost an individual proposal but it will not cost a package of proposals because the proposals in a package can interact with one another.  The Department will only cost individual items.  The Minister for Finance has refused to allow his Department to cost any package of proposals.  That is why the Chairman's suggestion is worthwhile because the public is entitled to know these things before the election.</p></speech>

I raise this because it is a serious issue, regardless of who is in power.  It is also vital to develop the whole concept of public accountability through the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.  The issue will have to be pursued.  The situation will change but the change is not happening quickly enough and is not keeping up with the changing dynamic in the economy and the country.  Again, we will raise the matter with the Department of Finance next week.</p> <p>  Under matters arising from the minutes, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, submitted information on the development of the hospital on the Mater site.  The clerk will prepare a short report on the issues involved which will be circulated next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Under correspondence, item 3A is correspondence from the Accounting Officers, while item No. 3A(1) is correspondence dated 20 November 2015 received from Mr. Noel Waters, acting Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality regarding clarification of an issue following our meeting of 5 November 2015.  This is to be noted and published.  We also have correspondence dated 20 November from Mr. Barry Ryan at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding NAMA properties refused by local authorities which is also to be noted and published.</p></speech>

In terms of the explanation given that the properties were unsuitable, there is a suggestion that not only were they unsuitable, but that they were unavailable.  We need some further clarification because NAMA told us a number of weeks ago that 6,500 units of accommodation were made available to the 31 local authorities but approximately two thirds of them were rejected by the local authorities.  Those properties were made available over a period of time but eventually NAMA had no choice but to put them up for sale to the private sector, where they were snapped up.</p><p>They have all been sold except for 300 units.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis and it is incredible to think that over 4,000 units of accommodation should not have been suitable for whatever reason, yet the private sector had no problem at all purchasing them for housing purposes.  We need further clarification as to why the local authorities did not take them and whether the full information was provided to us by NAMA on the suitability and availability of the properties in question.  I ask that we seek further information on those 4,000 plus units.</p></speech>

It is a good idea to get as much information on this matter as we can.  We should look to the Department to furnish us with that.  Of course, sizeable as those figures are, they are a drop in the ocean in respect of the housing crisis.</p></speech>

No. 3B(1) is correspondence dated 10 November 2015 from Mr. Patrick Coughlan of Mullingar, County Westmeath, re Castlemartyr resort, to be noted and published.  We have had previous correspondence from Mr. Coughlan on NAMA actions in Castlemartyr.  It now appears that information on local property tax payment by Mr. Coughlan was also available to third parties and to NAMA.</p> <p>  NAMA will not deal with us on individual cases but these issues have been raised directly with the committee by Mr. Coughlan in respect of this particular property.  I believe NAMA should respond to us and deal with the issues that have been raised in so far as it can.  I see nothing wrong with that.  It has been brought to our attention.  The various documents down through the last few months have been published, noted and sent on to NAMA.  We have not received a detailed response to any of it.  There are serious issues raised.  We are not lobbying or advocating on behalf of this group or individual.  We simply want to know what the position is.  I do not see anything wrong with that, given that the former and-or current property owner at Castlemartyr has made his side of the story known to us.  If necessary, we can ask NAMA to come before us and explain it.  I believe we are entitled to a comprehensive response to the issues raised.  I ask that we send the latest round of correspondence to NAMA and ask whether it wants to reply by letter or come before us on a particular day to give the explanations for all the concerns that have been raised here in public session.</p> <p>  I should point out that this is an issue for the Revenue Commissioners as well, so we can write to them.  It is the same request: to please give us the information in correspondence or, if they feel more comfortable, to come before the PAC to explain the matter and be questioned on it.  We can set that day before Christmas, it is not a problem.</p> <p>  No. 3B(2) is correspondence dated 17 November 2015, received from Mr. &Eacute;amonn Casey of Debt and Development Coalition Ireland.  It has made recommendations for the PAC based on a report by the coalition.  I do not know what coalition that is.</p></speech>

The issue is something we should not duck.  They are not asking for a full meeting but rather to meet with just a couple of us initially to make a case.  They are talking about something which is delicate but which concerns billions being lost to the Exchequer, which is a very big issue.</p></speech>

It is something the Minister for Finance intimated yesterday with regard to what is coming from Europe, specifically as it pertains to Apple.  It was not just an intimation; he was effectively saying that a lot of the criticisms of Ireland's corporate tax structure and the Apple issue were politically motivated.  We should be careful with regard to this group.  We should find out its make-up before we bring its members into the public accounts committee.  I tend to agree with the Minister for Finance.  There are a lot of countries within the European bloc that have for a long time been critical of our tax and corporate tax structures.  They are competing with us.  I just think we should be careful with regard to this particular group.</p></speech>

The documentation states that the production of the policy document was undertaken with the assistance of the European Union.  One presumes this group has been around for quite some time and has access to funding through one of the funding streams.  I agree that we should meet and see where an investigation, examination or discussion might go.  I do not think there is a question mark around the bona fides of the group itself.  As Deputy Ross said, the issues are very substantive and serious in respect of the Exchequer and the taxation regime.  There should certainly be a meeting with a view to a session here if that is what we decide.</p></speech>

We could note and publish this and forward it to the HSE for further response to questions that Mr. Haire has asked.  There is a significant amount of money involved.  The Comptroller and Auditor General may also want to examine the costs arising from the interchangeability of medicines.  We will acknowledge this to Mr. Haire and pursue the matter as outlined.</p> <p>  Correspondence dated 18 November 2015 was received from Ms Julie Gibbons re payment of water rates.  This is to be noted and published and sent to the Department for comment.  Maybe the local government audit service should examine the matter.  We will ask for its response.</p> <p>  Correspondence was received from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald re funding to the children and youth working group in Stoneybatter.  This is to be noted and published and forwarded to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for a breakdown of the financial provision allocated to this group.</p></speech>

This has been an ongoing issue for youth workers and providers in the Stoneybatter area.  The nub of it is that there is an anomaly of about &euro;76,000, conservatively, in respect of the spend.</p><p>The City of Dublin Youth Service Board, CDYSB, has given one figure and the Department has given another.  Similar services across the State are under considerable pressure, therefore, these people want clarification and a final figure on what is being spent.  Their worry is that the Department is issuing figures that inflate the spend in the Stoneybatter area and they are concerned that this be clarified, or if it is the case that money ought to be going into the Stoneybatter area but, by dint by some of some administrative error, is going elsewhere, they want that clarified also.</p></speech>

One report states the costings are &euro;100,000 and another one states they are &euro;65,000.  We should get the internal costs of this report and the breakdown of those, and who managed and produced the report.  Also, there is mention of the due diligence report that was prepared by Deloitte and O'Flynn Exhams.  We should get a breakdown of the costs of that.  Is it possible to get a copy of the minutes of the audit committees of these, or is that a request too far?  I am thinking, for example, of the audit committee of CIT.  We are going to examine it in regard to its audit.  Perhaps the minutes of the audit committee meetings might be of help to members.  With respect to the other document, we need to establish the costs of it.  How do they reach a point within the college where they produce the document for &euro;65,000 or &euro;100,000 and then somebody decides to redact it?  What is that process?  Can we ask for clarification on that?  Who decides to redact and who decides what to redact?</p> <p>  Another issue was raised in correspondence about the cleaning staff in CIT.  It came in by way of anonymous correspondence.  We should forward that for clarification in regard to their contracts and employment; the issue of sick pay and so on was raised.  Let us have the  clarification before the meeting rather than ask for this again at the meeting and not getting full clarification then.</p> <p>  Is there any other issue in regard to the work programme?  The work programme is agreed.  There is no other business.  We have agreed our agenda for next week, which is Vote 7: Office of the Minister for Finance, Chapter 1: Exchequer Financial Outturn, Chapter 2: Government Debt, Chapter 3: Cost of Bank Stabilisation, and the Finance Accounts for 2014.</p></speech>

It operates racing activities through 11 subsidiary companies, and licenses greyhound racing at other, privately-owned tracks.</p> <p>  Bord na gCon received Oireachtas grants totalling &euro;10.8 million in 2014.  Income arising from other sources includes proceeds from the operation of totaliser betting, gate receipts at tracks, bookmaker fees, and contributions from dog owners and sponsors towards racing prize money.  Its expenditure includes amounts paid out in respect of totaliser betting wins, racing prize money and Bord na gCon&rsquo;s administration and running costs.</p> <p>  The downturn in the economy has had a significant impact on Bord na gCon&rsquo;s operations, and on its bottom line.  The board incurred a loss of &euro;1 million in 2014 and has recorded losses in four out of the last five years.   As a result, the accumulated surplus of &euro;5.1 million carried in at the beginning of 2010 has been wiped out, and Bord na gCon had an accumulated deficit of &euro;0.4 million at the end of 2014.</p> <p>  I have previously reported on the acquisition of land and development of the racetrack and corporate headquarters at Greenpark in Limerick, which was completed in October 2010.  Related to that development, and investment in other tracks, Bord na gCon has been carrying a high level of borrowing.  The 2014 financial statements disclose bank borrowings at year end of &euro;22.7 million, which is little changed year on year.  </p> <p>  The 2014 financial statements were certified on 31 August 2015 and received an unqualified opinion.  However, the audit report drew attention to the deficit, and to note 25, in which the board outlines the basis on which it considers that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.</p><p>Disposal of surplus property is a key element in Bord na gCon&rsquo;s plans to improve its financial position and the level of State funding was anticipated to increase substantially in 2015.  In addition, the audit report draws attention to non-compliance with public procurement rules, which has been referred to in Bord na gCon&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control.  I should point out the incidence of non-competitive procurement has declined and we will continue to keep that matter under review.</p></speech>

Since we last met this committee, much of the focus of the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, has been on the implementation of the Indecon report.  The progress on that project has been detailed in the briefing document submitted last week.  Indecon critiqued serious structural issues within the industry and raised questions about the validity of strategic decisions taken at the beginning of the recession.  These conclusions were further elaborated in the review by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the Limerick project in particular.  It is important to state that Indecon also felt strongly that if the appropriate actions were taken, as laid out in its review, the industry then would have a viable future.<br/><br/>Realising that future will be challenging.  The enormous impact of the recession on discretionary consumer spending is obvious.  Members of the committee, more than most, are aware of the effects of reductions in income on behaviour and on the spending choices people have been obliged to make.  The notion that the greyhound industry could sail unaffected through those waters simply is not tenable.  The recession has both caused attendances to plummet and led to many trainers and owners exiting the industry.  The period also saw very significant reductions in the Horse and Greyhound Fund, which ran at more than 30% at one point.  The capacity of the IGB even to sustain levels of incentive and prize money simply did not exist, partly because of the business hit but also because of the drain on our resources to pay down significant legacy debt.  That is the reality and there is no sugar-coating it.<br/><br/>We should not discount how the cumulative consequences of deep cost-cutting within the organisation has affected investment in our facilities and the marketing of our product.  The board in 2014 took significant actions to step up commercial performance through a new strategy and more appropriate levels of funding.  These will not make an immediate impact as there will be a time lag, but the benefits of the new strategy are beginning to show clearly for 2015.  Stadium branding and all marketing materials have been developed and updated.  The Tote brand has been updated to fit with the design of the stadium branding.  There is a strong digital marketing dimension to all our commercial work.  All stadia now have their own web presence, which is linked to <i>www.gogreyhoundracing.ie</i>.  The IGB has taken over all the food and beverage operations within its stadia.  These operations are now fully integrated in terms of planning and consistency of business objectives.  Food and beverage is now a key driver of future attendance and income growth.  The profits generated through the new food and beverage arrangements will be retained within the industry.  Significant progress has been made on another major issue, namely, the pension deficit, the details of which are to go for member consultation early in the new year.  There also has been much work done on the development of new income streams, based largely on significant investment in technological infrastructure, which was hopelessly outdated in terms of market requirements.  There are some positives in terms of outturns for the year and the general economic canvass on which this industry operates.  A lot has been happening at board level, the benefits of which may not be immediately apparent but which will have significant impact in the medium and long term.</p></speech>

At our presentation 12 months ago, I stated that if this industry was to survive and prosper, it would require tough decisions, ongoing assessment of the business model, the development of new income streams and an openness to new approaches right across the sector.  During the past year, the Irish Greyhound Board has not shied away from any hard decision, including the decision to sell the Harold's Cross site, the calibration of racing and the development and introduction of key performance indicators, KPIs, for all tracks.  Commercially, the Irish Greyhound Board has introduced a new digital and marketing strategy.  As already mentioned, we have taken over our food and beverage operations and entered into commercially important drinks pouring rights arrangements.  We have established appropriate technology platforms to generate new income streams and have signed contracts with some of the most iconic global wagering names.  Increased marketing spend has enabled investment in marketing to the tour operator and incentive markets.  We have increased our presence at a number of United Kingdom and European trade fairs and all this activity should yield dividends, based on the booking cycles of these companies, from next year onwards.</p> <p>  Despite these measures, the results for 2014 reinforce the fact that improvement following years of underinvestment in the commercial infrastructure of the Irish Greyhound Board will take time to deliver.  All the initiatives are important and overdue and will position the Irish Greyhound Board to maximise opportunities arising from improvements in the macroeconomy.  Critical actions must be taken to regenerate the industry, key among these being the need to increase of the number of owners, breeders and trainers involved in the sport.  This group must be increased and renewed as otherwise, the industry will continue to contract.  We are working with all stakeholders to develop ways to incentivise ownership and in that respect, the additional allocation in the budget is most welcome.  We have concluded a full consultation with industry stakeholders and the challenge is to ensure the maximum return on investment.  The additional &euro;1.2 million announced in the budget for the Horse and Greyhound Fund is going to prize money and additional industry supports at grassroots level.</p> <p>  At last year&rsquo;s meeting, the issue of regulation and integrity was brought up.  Regulation always has been a fraught area for all sports governing bodies and for greyhound industries worldwide.  It must be stated that only a very small number of those involved in the greyhound industry are non-compliant.  This being the case, the board has championed and introduced the use of new statutory instruments to strengthen our regulatory control.  Those who breach the regulations now know they will be faced with publication of adverse findings from test results of their greyhounds, which, in turn, will be banned from racing.  This is a major step forward and is but one to be followed.  The Irish Greyhound Board supports mandatory penalties for a range of offences but this will require amending primary legislation.  I realise I am not saying anything new in stating the past few years have been very difficult for all those involved in the greyhound industry.  There is a serious attempt to put the industry on a sound footing within the resources available to us and to create an industry model that is fit for purpose and is sustainable.</p></speech>

I wish to take up one comment made by Ms Larkin in her opening statement on which she might provide members with a little information.  I believe I heard two years ago the news the Irish Greyhound Board was signing contracts "with some of the most iconic global wagering names" to increase revenue.  How much revenue will that source produce in 2015?</p></speech>

We have new markets in America, which are co-mingling our betting into the Irish Tote market.  In addition, there are markets operating in Europe, together with a trial at present with major bookmakers through the use of television product.  To set that out first, we have three different avenues for income streams.  In May 2015, we commenced live betting from America with five different companies and on current predictions, this will achieve an estimated turnover to the end of 2015 of &euro;600,000.</p></speech>

Obviously, the retention for the IGB is somewhat less.  In addition to that, we have just completed a successful trial involving television product into Irish and UK bookmaker shops.  Negotiations on a long-term contract in this regard have also commenced.  I hope these negotiations will conclude before the end of this year.  Again, this is a real ongoing contract in the industry.</p> <p>  The third area I mentioned was that of co-mingling from bookmakers in the UK and wider Europe.  Those development works are ongoing and are part of an international technological upgrade with our various bookmaking partners.  That work is scheduled to go live in 2016.  The contracts are signed but live betting has not yet started.  There is considerable international investment from both our partners and their third parties in building the infrastructure necessary to facilitate that co-mingling.</p></speech>

The legal advice, of which I am in receipt, is that the settlements are confidential and, as such, I cannot disclose the nature of the settlements themselves.

That would be a small element of it.  I am sure the settlement and compensation, which might have been paid, is where the main money lies.  I am sure the costs the IGB incurred to date were approved for in the 2014 accounts.  Did it involve a payment by the IGB to settle the three cases?</p></speech>

There was a time some years ago when the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution was 20% or 30% of the board&rsquo;s income.  It is now heading towards 50%.  The IGB is not a commercial organisation and could not exist without a taxpayer subvention of &euro;14 million next year.  We will take it that it is taxpayers&rsquo; money that is being paid out in these cases.</p> <p>  Whatever confidential agreement the IGB has entered into, it will not overcome the need to record this and have it disclosed so that the readers of the 2015 accounts will know. The Committee of Public Accounts will not tolerate a large six-figure sum being buried in the accounts without it being disclosed.  While on the one hand the board might have a legal agreement on confidentiality, the board members have a separate legal and fiduciary duty when signing off on the accounts next year to ensure they are in compliance with the law.  The legal agreement is one issue, while the fiduciary duty as a director is another.  The board members will not be able to get away from including major settlement figures in the accounts.  The reason I am raising this is because it is referred to in the 2014 accounts.  This is germane to the accounts in front of us today.  The issue involved predates 2014.  It has been rumbling along for five years and relates to a race in 2010.  Do the witnesses get the point I am making?</p></speech>

I do not want the Chairman or Deputy to think that we are holding back information.  We are not and we fully understand that in our accounts for 2015, which will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, there will have to be disclosure.  To add to what the CEO said, an agreement in principle is drawn up, for example, on when the payment is made.  That has not happened yet and we got further legal advice yesterday to hold off on commenting on the case until everything is done and dusted.  As chairman of the board, I am quite prepared to confirm here today that when everything is done and dusted we will certainly make the Department and Comptroller and Auditor General aware of the full case.  At that stage, I will have no problem making the details available to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

There was a loss in 2014 of &euro;1 million, and a smaller amount in 2013.  The figure is in the hundreds of thousands.  Mr. Meaney has said that Bord na gCon received legal advice but it is difficult for the Committee of Public Accounts - this is taxpayers' money.   It was August 2015 when the 2014 accounts were signed.  We will not wait until August 2016 to hear this information.  Arising from today's meeting, we will ask for it as soon as it is concluded and that a briefing be sent to us.</p> <p>  Mr. Meaney mentioned the Department.

Bord na gCon has been very successful in negotiating an improvement in its income for 2016.  It had &euro;13.6 million for 2015, from the taxpayer, and that will increase to &euro;14.8 million in 2016.  That is an increase of &euro;1.2 million.  Will the settlement of that outstanding legal case take a large proportion of that &euro;1.2 million?</p></speech>

Our bank overdraft - in the most difficult of times - has not increased in the last four years.  I do not expect it to increase.  The industry has been starved of cash.  I am quite prepared to say that at the moment the greyhound industry is dependent on support from the State.  There is no doubt about that.

The industry has been starved of cash.  Added to that was the worst depression any of us has witnessed so we did not have money to invest in marketing and promotion.  We did not even have money to invest in an executive.  In 2011, when I came on board, we had a CEO but no CFO or executive.  The business was cash starved and in that context, the CEO was mistress, mother and wife.  Now we have an executive in place and have extra funding.  There has been a pick-up in the economy and there is a very different outlook.  That is not to ignore the fact that we have to pay a settlement and the court costs.  We have legal reports that back up the decision.  Most of us are not legal people so we employed the best legal support we could to advise the board on the best way to deal with this.  In 2010, when this happened, none of the current board or executive was in place.  That is not the dead man's excuse; it is the reality.</p></speech>

The dog was got at in some way and the board must accept that because it would not be paying otherwise.  It must accept that some substance was given to the dog to make sure he came in last.

However, before any moneys are advanced to the Irish Greyhound Board, there is an annual submission to the Department as to what we intend to use those funds for and how we used and disbursed the previous year's funds.</p> <p>  In addition to that, the Department has sought updates from us on how we were to manage the original strategy statement of the Irish Greyhound Board, which was then updated and effectively replaced by the Indecon report last year.  In advance of getting any moneys, those documents had to be provided to the Department.  The Department then requires the greyhound board to submit six-monthly accounts together with six-monthly reports as to our progress.  Those reports must be signed off by the chairman of the board.  On top of that, the Department meets us twice a year to review on a one-to-one or face-to-face basis the commitments made at the start of the year in advance of the moneys being forwarded to us and, obviously, any ongoing issues throughout the year, together with how we are achieving budget targets, as we would have submitted to the Department.</p> <p>  As the chairman, Mr. Meaney, mentioned to the Deputy, in addition to that, the Government arrangements extend such that we are also required to report on an interim basis any unscheduled matters that arise during the course of the year if they are material, either to the financial business or to our regulatory business.  That is what is there in place of a formal service level agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#J00700"><p>I want to ask the officials from the Department about this because I am disturbed to hear the taxpayer will be handing out &euro;14.8 million for the coming year without a formal service level agreement, letters, plans and whatever.  The Chairman will be issuing a recommendation that a formal service level agreement be in place.  I am shocked to hear one does not exist.</p> <p>  I cannot understand how an Accounting Officer in the Department has not learned lessons.  I will not go back to what happened in Punchestown years ago, with money handed out without proper agreements.  There were reports done at length.  Here we are with the same Department handing out &euro;14 million a year for the next number of years and no service level agreement.  The Committee of Public Accounts will not stand over that and will be saying it is not acceptable.  It is not acceptable in any Department to hand out that amount of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  I will ask two or three questions on this.  In relation to the discussion on the subvention - it is called the horse and greyhound fund but I will call it taxpayers' money in case people think it is coming from somewhere else - of &euro;14.8 million the Department is handing out next year and the &euro;13.6 million it handed over this year, would the Department be aware approximately of the settlement that has been referred to in the High Court?  That had to come into its reckoning in some way as needing to be met from the funding.</p> <p>  I had a quick look at the amount of taxpayers' money going into the sector ten years ago.  It is in one of the charts we got.  In 2006, the State was putting in &euro;14 million.  I know the funding dropped down to &euro;11 million, &euro;10 million and whatever.  Total income on those occasions was approximately &euro;50 million, including the taxpayers' amount.  Therefore, the taxpayer was subventing the industry to the tune of approximately 28% of its income.  The chairman, Mr. Meaney, states the income has gone down and there has been an cumulative drop but the amount of the board's income coming from the taxpayer is increasing as a percentage of its income each year.  In 2014, the accounts show total turnover from racing activities as &euro;25 million and the taxpayer put in &euro;11 million.  That was a significant proportional increase in the Department's costs.  Next year, the Department proposes to give &euro;14.8 million.  Mr. Gleeson should be able to tell us whether the Department has a ballpark figure of what is a right amount for the taxpayer to be putting into the industry as a percentage of its total income?  As I said, it seems to be increasing.</p> <p>  In view of that, I would look at the governance of this.  The organisation, as Mr. Nealon recommended, could not exist without taxpayers' money.  We accept that is the case.  There is not a representative of the Department on the board.  Given that such a large proportion of the expenditure and income involved in Bord na gCon is taxpayers' money, the structure needs to change so that there is somebody there monitoring this and representing the Accounting Officer in the Department.  Essentially, the Department is handing it over to an independent company.  Not finding any fault with it, I am merely saying to protect the taxpayers' interest, the Minister should have a representative there to watch that.</p> <p>  Has Mr. Gleeson any observations on what was taken into account in how the Department arrived at the &euro;14.8 million figure?  Approximately, how many are employed in the greyhound sector because there has to be some connection between how much the taxpayer is putting into a sector and how many people are benefiting?  The following is a simplistic and probably unfair figure but the only one I can get from looking at the figures today is that there are 110 full-time staff in the organisation, although the organisation hires extra staff for catering for race meetings.  I do not even like to say it but that amounts to approximately &euro;124,000 per annum for those employed in the organisation but the staff in the organisation is only a fraction of the number in the industry.  Can Mr. Gleeson tell me the basis on which the Department arrived at this &euro;14 million, how many people in the industry is the Department supporting with this grant and how much per person in the sector is the taxpayer subventing it?</p></speech>

In the context of the settlement, it is not true to say that we knew what the settlement was, even in ballpark terms, when the Estimate was agreed.  That is not the case.  Obviously, we have had a report on it and there is a ballpark figure there now which we assume will have to be accrued in the 2015 accounts in the normal way.</p> <p>  Second, in terms of the overall financial position of the industry, clearly we have a concern.  We know the chairman, the board and the chief executive have a concern about the financial status of the industry.  When one looks at the subvention that has been given in the past, the grant to the board went from &euro;15.2 million in 2008 to &euro;10.8 million in 2014 and that came at a time when attendances were falling, when tote income collapsed and when all the impacts of the economic downturn came as well.  The board found itself in a very difficult position.</p> <p>  There has always been support for this sector from the State and successive Governments have felt it was worthwhile.  Our figures, in terms of employment, are approximately 10,000 people in employment and-----</p></speech>

I am sure that is the widest possible definition but it is 10,000 people.  Our figures show &euro;0.5 billion of turnover in the rural economy.  That is the figure we have.  That is the basis for justifying any State intervention in the sector.  The chairman has already said, and it is true to say, that if the sector did not need State support, it would not be given it.  That is a given.</p><p>Against the background of concerns about income dropping and other concerns, the Minister commissioned Indecon to produce a report on the sector.  It was published in 2013.  There was a range of recommendations in it, including on governance, regulation and the financing of the industry.  There was recognition that something had to change in terms of financing the industry.  It was a long report.  There were three main pillars to the recommendations on improving finances.  One was that the board would have to dispose of assets because it was burdened with a significant debt that was eating up resources that might otherwise have been put into the sector.  To an extent, this is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy because, in order to develop the sector, one needs to be putting money into prize money, stadiums and developing new products.  However, if one's sources of funding, from the State or commercial revenue, dry up, it has a negative impact on that.</p><p> The first part of the Indecon report suggested something really had to be done about bringing down the debt.  The only realistic way of making a really significant impact on that was the sale of assets.  There were a few proposals in the report.  They were not necessarily prescriptive but there were suggestions as to what assets might be sold.  The second recommendation concerned the development of new streams of income and new products.  The chairman and chief executive will know more about that than I do.  They have already described progress in that regard.  The third point was that there was a significant number of non-performing stadiums.  It was recommended that something be done to calibrate the cost of those stadiums to the income deriving from them.  That probably meant reducing the number of races and making sure the expenditure in non-performing racecourses did not exceed the income derived from them.  Those are the three strands of that income piece.</p><p> The chief executive has described the kind of governance arrangement within the Department.  Obviously, the board and chairman have their own responsibilities, and we have responsibilities also.</p><p> Reference was made to the presence of a departmental person on the board.  That is an arguable point.  It is not in the legislation.  We will be drafting a Bill.  We have begun to draft the heads of a Bill to respond to some elements of the Indecon report.  The Bill will deal with some aspects of governance and deal with regulation.  It might introduce mandatory penalties for offences such as doping.  The board composition is a policy decision and I cannot elaborate on it.  However, if the committee has a view on the composition of the board, we would all have to take it into account in the context of redrafting the legislation.</p></speech>

We do have corporate governance structures that are quite formalised.  We meet twice per year on the performance.  The board submits a strategic plan to us, which we examine.  Recently, we have developed a letter of shareholder expectation.  We have done it for another State agency as a preliminary draft.  Our intention is to draft a similar document for all our State agencies, including Bord na gCon.  I accept it might be better if the agreement had been in place long ago but, in any event, we have embarked on that kind of road with another agency.  Our intention is to use that vehicle across all the agencies.  That will fulfil the requirements the Vice Chairman is talking about.</p></speech>

It is good to put that figure on the record.  That is how I translate the &euro;14.8 million.  It is divided among 10,000 people, with approximately &euro;1,500 going to everybody who has a dog and who goes to the races.  The taxpayer is essentially giving money to everybody involved.  Mr. Phil Meaney might state whether this is a fair analysis.  He can understand the global picture.</p></speech>

A point I would like to add is that most of the jobs are in rural areas.  If they were to go, they would not be easily replaced at the moment.  The economists tell us that every 1,000 people who move from employment to being dependent on State subsidies cost approximately &euro;20 million.  The economist Jim Power came up with that figure in 2011.  The number in the industry may have contracted a little since 2011.  However, even if 7,000 or 8,000 were to go on the dole as a result of State funding not being in place and the greyhound industry going out of existence, it would have a disastrous effect.</p></speech>

There was a chart in the Indecon report on the profitability of the tracks.  It refers to them all and claims there was a loss of &euro;4.296 million in the track income.  I acknowledge there is other income.  I am referring to recommendation No. 8, on the calibration of the number of race meetings in poorly performing stadiums.  Are the delegates saying they have implemented all the key recommendations?  One is currently subject to the levy process.</p> <p>  With regard to recommendation No. 8, on the preparation of key performance indicators for track performance and the review of the racing programme, the delegates have said it has been implemented.  Are they in a position to forward us a copy of the key performance indicators in respect of which they have said the recommendation has been implemented?  That probably threw up what I would call a break-even figure for attendance at a race meeting.  Is it 300 or 400?  I realise it depends on the location but there must be some tracks where the figures speak for themselves.  Do the delegates believe we have the right number of tracks?  I am from Laois and there is no track in my area so I am probably not the most informed.  The delegates have probably worked that out.</p> <p>  Could I have a brief outline on the work on recommendation No. 8?  The delegates might send us some of the documentation that has been prepared consequent to the implementation of that recommendation.  It can be sent to us subsequent to the meeting.</p></speech>

First, as the Acting Chairman pointed out, we have calibrated the number of races.  We have reduced the number of least profitable races at tracks to the effect that we have taken out 89 races from the tracks in the year to date.  Obviously, there are prize money savings in respect of those events.  In addition, because of the way we have targeted and picked the races, we have managed to maintain a performance as close as possible to last year's full performance.  With the additional digital market, we have managed to maintain the level of commerciality.  While we have taken out 8%-----</p></speech>

There was an historical tradition of that happening.  Nobody likes reducing the number of race meetings but, at the same time, there is a level of co-operation among industry stakeholders to improve and better the industry performance.  That is the answer to the first part of the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question related to key performance indicators.  The key performance indicators have been built to analyse the profitability of the tracks, the subvention we are paying per meeting and per spectator, the level of sponsorship generated at track level, and the amount of Tote and commercial profits being made.  Those key performance indicators have been running for 12 months now.</p><p>The analysis arising from them has been very useful in identifying different aspects of performance and what is good and bad on the various tracks.  Different issues arise in respect of the ten IGB tracks and seven privately-run tracks and it gives us an opportunity to investigate them.</p><p> My priority for the next 12 months will be to see how much we can lift the KPIs.  By targeting specific areas of weakness we hope to bolster the entire industry.  Obviously, this is taxpayers' money and there is no guarantee that funding to tracks will continue in the long term.  My priority is to address the weaknesses.  On pulling the tracks up, every time one takes a track out there are repercussions for local industry and, while it might solve commercial issues, it might also severely undermine the dog population in an area.  It is better to see if we can solve the non-performance of tracks and other issues.  A key challenge, given that we are dependent on tracks, is the fact that the tracks are only open for some 16 hours per week.  </p><p> We will go back to the Indecon recommendations and look at what else we can do in terms of alternative sources of income to support what happens on the tracks.  We have completed a joint horse jumping event with Horse Sport Ireland under the Jumping in the City initiative, which was launched in Limerick and also takes in Cork and Shelbourne Park and was very successful.  We are exploring other such options to help bring a completely different audience into greyhound stadia because it is a State resource which is available in key urban locations and which we should be utilising.</p></speech>

My family raised greyhounds when I was growing up so I have a gr&aacute; for it.  I felt a little bit annoyed listening to the opening statements of Ms Larkin and Mr. Meaney.  Those who run the racetracks, who train and own dogs, work very hard to keep the industry going, to keep it competitive and preserve it as a form of entertainment for others but the opening statements we heard today were a little vague and there was nothing in them.  As the Vice Chairman said, some &euro;14.8 million of taxpayers' money has been allocated but Ms Larkin said a key thing to regenerate the industry was to increase the number of dog owners, breeders and trainers.  She said the extra money that had been allocated would go into prize money and additional industry support at grassroots levels and that there would be a serious attempt to put the industry on a sound footing within the resources available.  She also said she would strive to create an industry model which was fit for purpose and sustainable.  She said she was looking at exploring other options but that is all very hazy and fluffy and there is nothing concrete in it.  Can Ms Larkin give me some examples of what she means by "additional industry supports at grassroots levels"?</p> <p>  Mr. Meaney said a lot was happening at board level, the benefits of which may not be immediately apparent but which will have a significant impact in the medium and long term.  What does that mean?  They are just words and there is nothing concrete in that statement.

During 2015 the Irish Greyhound Board conducted an extensive consultation at grassroots level.  We started with our own front-facing staff, the people referenced by the Deputy in her opening remarks, and we asked them how we could bolster the industry.  We extended the discussion to the directors of all tracks and this culminated in the circulation of a document for public consultation.  The document posed a number of options as to how we might grow ownership and invest in the industry.  It discussed bolstering syndication, the leasing of greyhounds to new and upcoming syndicates and targeting prize money.  It put out a number of options to industry stakeholders but the the money available to the Irish Greyhound Board was quite limited at the time, it being mid-2015.  Nevertheless, we received a number of comments from stakeholders.  The comments differed widely, as one might expect.  Some felt we should support syndication while others felt that doing so should not be at the expense of the owner, who supports the industry on an ongoing basis, and that one group should not get preferential treatment over another.  Others felt the current funding arrangements could be broadened and made more equitable.  That is just a flavour of the comments we received.</p> <p>  The announcement in the budget of an additional &euro;1.2 million is a significant game changer for us in terms of what we can do.  In the past 12 months the Irish Greyhound Board ran over 16,000 races, which will give members an idea of the population involved in dog racing.  Of that 16,000, half of the dogs were in the mid-grades - between A2 and A6 - and one of the considerations for us is whether to target one such group with additional funding or whether to provide an increase in funding across the board.  Another alternative would be to replace earlier cuts to prize money.  We are working through these three very different concepts and there are other possibilities, such as paying run money to placed dogs to directly subvent the costs associated with bringing a dog to racing.  There are possibilities around racing clubs and around various breeding incentive schemes.  There are myriad options and we have prepared initial costings on all of them.  Our intention is for the entire board to consult, in the middle of December, with the various industry representatives who have engaged in the process in the past months, either by written submission personal representation.  The objective will be to increase pools and attendance because if we can increase ownership those owners will also attend stadia, which will have a knock-on effect on the Tote and our food and beverage offerings.  We have &euro;1.2 million and we need to spend it wisely to ensure that, with the industry input, we get the best return for our money.</p><p>I was conscious of keeping my opening statement brief but this is the thinking behind my remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-26a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil Meaney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015112600002#M00200"><p>Like Ms Larkin, I was conscious of keeping my statement as short as possible.  We live in the industry every day, and I can see how what we said could seem to be vague, but we did not mean to be vague in any shape or form.  A number of major issues have been dealt with in 2015.  The two main High Court cases predated the executive and the present board members.  A huge amount of time over recent years has gone on dealing with them and getting them behind us.  I accept what Deputy Fleming said.  While there is a cost, I am delighted they have been dealt with.</p> <p>  The deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme has used up a lot of time.  We are at the consultative stage and having it dealt with is very important to me.  The executive, with the support of the board, has put in place a deal with our bankers which is very important for any organisation.  Disposal of core or non-core assets is a big issue and we accept Indecon's recommendation.  During 2015, we have disposed of the old head offices of the IGB on Henry Street in Limerick.  This, along with other income we generated, will allow us pay down debt to the bank in 2015 for the first year since I got involved.</p> <p>  As I alluded to earlier, most of the executive, including the CEO, only came on board in 2014.  All board members, with the exception of one, are new and none of the executive was in place when I came on board in 2011.  The point I am making is that we now have a good executive with new blood on the board.  We have a bit of cash we did not have before.  This is a platform to kick on, which we did not have over the past four years in which I have been involved in the industry.</p></speech>

It has declined at varying rates each year since then.  We have changed completely the commercial strategy and the commercial operations with regard to how we approach this.  When I first started in mid-2013, commercial operations as they were and the commercial strategy were not fit for purpose.  We had a homogenous approach to the market in that we sold the product and racing on the back of the Irish Greyhound Board brand.  What we have done since, following research, is have a local market-based strategy to promote the stadia in each of their local markets, within a drive time of 45 to 50 minutes, assuming this is the maximum distance anybody will drive for a night out with regard to cost and time.  We have also launched <i>www.gogreyhoundracing.ie</i>and put in place a consumer facing racing brand rather than the IGB brand.  We separated IGB as a corporate entity and put in place a consumer infrastructure.<br/><br/>We have completely changed our digital infrastructure and we have upskilled our digital expertise.  All of our activities are dovetailed between advertising, digital activity, social media and social platforms.  We are trying to expose the industry and sport to the widest possible audience because the biggest opportunities with regard to getting leisure and racing consumers back to the tracks are with people aged between 18 and 35 years.  In the year to date, the average attendance per meeting in the IGB tracks increased by between 6% and 8%.</p><p>The position with Christmas bookings, in terms of the sales cycle this year compared to the sales cycle for the same period last year, is that we are up 18%.  Our digital strategy is part of the overall strategy.  It is about acquisition of customers and retention.  The next phase, having put in place that infrastructure, is to put in place loyalty technology and loyalty marketing.</p><p> Let us consider the journey we have come from.  We had a situation where we had a database of 100,000 customers.  It was non-compliant, in multiple formats and was effectively unusable.  The marketing department and our outside digital people have now worked through that.  We now have a functioning database of over 60,000 people.  To that database we have sent over 400,000 promotional e-mails so far this year.  That part of the journey involved putting in place the jigsaw to get to the point where we can actually put in place loyalty marketing, which is a speciality in its own right.  A tender document has gone out.  There is a two-piece approach.  The first is to ensure we have the correct strategic direction for it.  The last thing we want to do is pick a model or infrastructure that does not work, does not deliver or does not give us a return on investment.  We are taking a two-phase approach.  The first phase is to establish the strategic direction and the second relates to how that implementation is going to work in terms of technology and from a marketing point of view in light of the technology that is in the tracks.</p><p> We have come quite a way in terms of our marketing strategy, commercial operations, processes and strategies.  We are getting to the point where we have the most up-to-date contemporary tools in place to promote the leisure and racing markets.  We are also using food and beverage promotions as tools to drive attendance.</p></speech>

I am conscious of my time.  My last question relates to procurement.  We keep coming back to the &euro;14.8 million of taxpayers' money.  It is our job to ensure it is wisely spent.  A procurement officer was appointed.  According to our briefing, a procurement officer was appointed in 2013.  My briefing suggests the value of contracts identified by the audit has not been compliant in 2014.  Indeed, it has increased significantly compared to the total number of contracts identified in 2013.  If we now have a procurement officer in place, why has there been no improvement?  Correct me if I am wrong on this aspect.</p></speech>

There may be a little confusion.  The value of the sample looked at in 2013 was smaller.  Proportionately, there was more non-compliance relative to that sample than there was in 2014.

It related to defined benefit pension services.  The chief executive has advised a figure of &euro;388,000.  That item was &euro;149,000 on its own.  The Chairman referred to the advancement made on the defined benefit proposal to address the deficit.  We took a decision at the time to maintain that service provider, which provided information in respect of staff levels and years of service, etc.  Now that the process has reached a conclusion, one part of the defined benefit service has been procured and is going through a deliberative process as we speak.  The second part will be going through procurement post member communication, which will be early in the new year and tender documents are ready to go.  We are simply waiting on member communication to sign off.  From that point of view, the largest portion of the outstanding procurement would be dealt with at that stage.  Our procurement officer has stringent controls.  He approves all invoices.  One of his checks is whether invoices are procurement compliant.  From that point of view he is on top of everything that happens.  It is a commercial, fluid organisation and we endeavour as much as possible to try to get value for money.</p></speech>

However, most of us are out racing on a regular basis and we meet people.</p><p>In the difficult times when people did not have disposable income, having the couple of dogs was no longer possible.  They just did not have the income to support them.  I also think we were forced to cut prize money for a number of reasons.  That is what we are working on.  Again we are meeting all stakeholders in the early part of December with a view to seeing exactly where we should spend the money to get those people back and to get new people through syndication, ownership and encouraging young people to go into training.  It is very hard to pin down and say the reason people left the industry was X, Y or Z.  There are myriad reasons people left the industry, the same as maybe left horseracing.  There is a broad spectrum of reasons.</p></speech>

Over the course of the recession the number of owners has halved effectively.  That then has a knock-on effect in terms of the economic performance of the tracks because they are the people who come more frequently.  Earlier the CEO alluded to the fact that she has had a consultative document in terms of how the organisation is going to increase the number of owners.  Through that there will be the direct engagement on strategy to people in terms of increasing ownership and also then endeavouring to bring those who have moved out of the industry back into it.</p> <p>  I suppose in terms of those who have moved out, one has those who may have an older age profile.  One also has people who have been affected by the recession and who have emigrated.  So it is quite a mix of people who will have left.  As part of that process there would be direct engagement in terms of how one expands the base of owners which in turn pump-primes the supply chain.  It would help the trainers, help the breeding because one has more owners, more demand for dogs.  That is a critical part of it which is being worked on at the moment.</p></speech>

Bookmakers are not getting any younger.  If one looks at the bookmakers at the track, they would probably be there for ten, 20 or 30 years.  Trying to get new guys in is very difficult and it is also part of the split - I call it upstairs-downstairs.  The downstairs is the traditional greyhound man - the owners and trainers.  They really are with the bookmakers.  Upstairs are those with corporate groups or on a night out etc.  They bet with the Tote.  They are there for a good night out and they are going to bet with the Tote.</p> <p>  In essence there are two tracks that are working very well in terms of 50:50 with the Tote.  Shelbourne Park would be stronger from the bookmaker point of view.  Kilkenny would be very strong with bookmakers as opposed to the Tote.</p> <p>  Attracting new bookmakers in is very difficult, but one of the things we have seen is the new television trial we are doing at the moment with Turf TV.  We are using bookmakers in the UK, and betting shops in the UK and Ireland.  The bookmakers at those tracks which are offering very competitive odds, which is in line with the UK and Ireland, are seeing an upturn in turnover from the on-course traditional bookmaker.  It would be very difficult to get traditional bookmakers and I do not see any growth in that area.  As I said, the age profile of a traditional bookmaker must be late 50s or early 60s, similar to the UK.  The UK has the same problem.  One has 2.7 bookmakers per BAGS, Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service, and they are struggling to get bookmakers.  One needs three bookmakers at the track to form an SP for the UK.  I do not know how one resolves that bit of it.  One of the ways of resolving it, I suppose, is getting more people into tracks.  Take Galway, Johnny Morris would have been a good bookmaker at Galway track.  More people come downstairs.  One gets that type of bookmaker back.</p></speech>

As with many other industries, now is the first time the board has had an opportunity to be strategic and to look where we are going.  Things are not going to improve overnight.  If the Chairman decides to bring us back in here next year, it is not going to be all bells and whistles from where I am sitting.  There is going to be a gradual improvement over the next five years by getting people back into the industry.  I am old enough to have seen this before where the greyhound industry takes a dip and then it comes back up again.  There is no doubt we have taken a dip, a hammering, but slowly it is going to build back up.</p> <p>  Do I see the industry being able to survive without State support in five years?  Honestly, no.  I would not at this stage be able to state the number of people involved for the kind of industry it is.  For example, it has not been mentioned today that a huge number of clubs and organisations up and down the country through the medium of greyhound racing raise a huge amount of money annually.  It is very hard to put a figure on that, but I would say it could be anything between &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million.</p> <p>  For example, Kerry county board's main fundraising in the year is a big night at the dogs in Tralee.  In Kilkenny, where I live, there is an organisation, BEAM, for people who need support.  It is their biggest fundraiser.  Even though it is a very small track, annually they raise &euro;35,000 and they have done that for the past 20 years.  To look at the greyhound industry purely in the context of the taxpayer putting in &euro;14.5 million or &euro;14.9 million is unfair.  One needs to look at it in the context of the employment it gives, of the social side of it for community and for older people, and also for the amount of money it allows people to raise for very worthy causes.  It may be not always very worthy; I think sometimes political parties might even use it.  However, in general it is for very worthy needs.</p></speech>

Many of the issues have been dealt with pretty thoroughly, but it is still a very bleak picture that a debt of &euro;21 million was incurred in respect of the Limerick Greyhound Stadium project and that there were net borrowing levels of between &euro;10 million and &euro;11 million from 2006 to 2008, which are now double that sum.  Revenue has reduced from &euro;63.5 million in 2006 to &euro;28.2 million in 2013, a fall of 56%.

I can say that one of the cases relates to a property transaction that dated back to 1996 which came to light in the very recent past.  The other is a personnel matter that I would prefer not to deal with here.  The legal fees over recent years, which is all I can comment on, have been dominated by the three High Court cases settled a few weeks ago.  The legal fees are very much orientated towards those three cases.  The resolution of those cases will significantly reduce what we have been paying in legal fees over recent years.</p></speech>

The most recent statutory instruments that we concluded were instruments to allow us to publish adverse analytical findings once an animal has tested positive.  Heretofore, we could not publish the fact that we had got an adverse finding from the laboratory until the entire disciplinary matter had concluded.  With effect, from 1 October, the board is now in the position to be able to publish that at the same time as it notifies the owner or trainer of the adverse finding.  This brings much greater transparency into our regulation.  On top of that, the statutory instrument is constructed in such a way as to ensure that the dog that has had an adverse finding is suspended from racing until such time as that dog returns a clear test again.  That is a very significant advancement in terms of racing greyhounds and ensuring a level playing pitch for all racing greyhounds.</p></speech>

How come Bord na gCon has not dealt with this huge hiatus or gap that exists?  Athletes expect to be tested during their training session.  I imagine that the same should apply to animals that will contest races.  The public will bet on them and there will be prize money.  If there is no testing during the period in which the animal trains then there is no off-track testing, effectively.  That means that we just do not know what type of animal is coming into the kennels for racing.  When does Bord na gCon expect to deal with the matter?</p></speech>

It has been outlined already that the board is in the process of putting it up for sale.  What is the justification for the sale?  It is the second stadium in Dublin and is more a local than a national stadium.  It is a stadium where a night out at the dogs takes place on a regular basis.  On my side of the city it is treated as virtually a northside stadium.  I cannot understand, considering that the stadium is profitable, why Bord na gCon should sell it to defray debts incurred in Limerick.  This is Dublin and that is Limerick.  Surely a reasonable analysis of the situation would not require the elimination of a second stadium in Dublin which is profitable, local and availed of by the ordinary punter.  I know the financial problems that Bord na gCon faces but selling a profitable stadium is not the answer to a financial problem.</p></speech>

It does not make sense to have two management teams and two sets of grounds staff.  In terms of the people in Harold's Cross and the people of Dublin, whether they are northside or southside, the greyhound enthusiasts have to be looked after.  I would very much be one of the people who would suggest that when we rationalise by bringing the whole business together in Shelbourne Park, the people that go to Harold's Cross are looked after.  It is very hard to justify the two tracks.  Traditionally, and let me make this point, Harold's Cross was the Dublin man's track and maybe Shelbourne Park was the Croke Park of greyhound racing.  The greyhound population in Dublin is much smaller than it was.  They have to be looked after and they should be looked after but it can all be done in the context of one super stadium.</p></speech>

In that regard, earlier this year, as part of the Dublin City Development Plan, we made a submission to the Dublin City Council for a change in zoning of the Harold's Cross lands.  That submission was considered by the executive and members of Dublin City Council in October.  While there was support from the executive, the public representatives sought further information in terms of the proposals.  Indeed, some other public representatives were of the view that the lands should remain on a leisure basis.  From our perspective, we are now in the process of preparing a further and additional information to submit both to the Dublin City Council and, indeed, to all the local representatives outlining how we see this site might be used alternatively were it to get the zoning.</p></speech>

We could still dispose of the land with its current zoning and current valuation.  In the event that we do that, as the Deputy rightly pointed out at the start, there remains a significant amount of debt to be addressed.  In those circumstances, the IGB would be forced to look at other assets that it holds.  That would become a very difficult decision because the sale of any assets in our ownership and control, outside of Dublin, will impact on the local greyhound industry and will have a detrimental effect on the greyhound pool in that area.  The priority for the present is to continue to engage with Dublin City Council, local representatives and local Deputies.</p></speech>

Whether accepted or rejected, one way or another, the matter is likely to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I presume Bord na gCon would pursue the issue.  However, if the submission is refused, the land will have very little value in the long term, unless it is rezoned or planning permission is granted for its development.  In that case, it would make a very small contribution to reducing the organisation's debts in that area.  Bord na gCon is facing plan B in that respect.  Would it withdraw Harold's Cross stadium from sale if planning permission is not granted?  Has the organisation thought that far ahead?</p></speech>

Ms Larkin referred to there not being enough interest in Dublin.  There is not enough interest anywhere.  Attendance figures have been in decline at every single stadium.  This is an<i>ex-post facto</i>justification for the sale of Harold's Cross stadium.  It may well be the case that Bord na gCon will get little or nothing for the stadium, leaving the organisation with its debt of almost &euro;21 million.

I never lobbied for the position.  I make that quite clear and put it on the record.  That is part of the reason I am disappointed the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine did not take me in.  I am prepared to stand by my record prior to coming into Bord na gCon.</p></speech>

I am saying that it is a great pity that a prominent member of Fine Gael was interviewed by a Fine Gael Minister and given the job without any vetting procedure whatsoever.  The Government-dominated Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine does not want to interview Mr. Meaney.  He is sitting here not subject to the procedures to which other members of the board, which we have gone through, were subjected.</p></speech>

Before the Minister or both Ministers decided that all board appointments to the Irish Greyhound Board should be through PAS, I recommended that.  I am wholeheartedly in favour - and I can only talk about Bord na gCon - of the process being through PAS.  While the Deputy points out that I am a member of a certain political party, my answer to that is that I would rather see anyone being something than being nothing.  I have not brought politics to the greyhound board and politics did not enter it when the five people were being appointed recently.  We want the best people we can get on the board.  That is my position.  What colour they are is something somebody else has to deal with.</p></speech>

Does he not think it had anything to do with his appointment?</p></speech>

Deputy Ross might ask the people who appointed me.  Financially and in every other way, my appointment to Bord na gCon has been a limiting factor to me.  Deputy Ross seems to be of the opinion that this was a big scalp for somebody.  It was not for me.  The past four years in Bord na gCon have been very difficult.  I came into a situation where there was no executive.  I had come from an organisation that was very well organised and was working in a very functional way.  There was no executive in place.  To get things done through a public company is not like a private company.  We had to put a strategy in place.  What I am trying to say is that it took a while to put an executive in place.  All board members have been changed since I came in except one.</p></speech>

I do not know where Deputy Ross is coming from.  I did not lobby for the job.  I have taken it on.  I put approximately 30 hours a week into it and I have tried to make an industry that was struggling in a difficult time work along with what I regard as a very good board.

I am saying it is a political appointment.  I am saying that the fact Mr. Meaney is such a prominent member of Fine Gael was a material factor in it.  I am saying that Mr. Meaney has not gone through the normal vetting process that everybody else has to go through and that it is an unacceptable procedure.  I am not saying Mr. Meaney is incompetent, I am just saying the procedures are utterly incompetent and wrong and that he is a political appointee and a member of the political party in power.  That is what happens regularly.  Mr. Meaney is just one of many but he is one and he is in a very strong position as a result.  It is a pity that happened.  That is what I am saying.</p></speech>

We came here today to talk about Bord na gCon, the 2014 accounts, the setting up of a new executive and where we stand.  It is of no significance what is my political persuasion.  The Deputy has my permission to ask any board member or executive member whether I have ever brought politics into the IGB.  While I may have had a joke with the Chairman earlier about political parties raising finances at greyhound stadia, I presume he realises that was with tongue in cheek.  I do not bring politics to the greyhound board and when I say I do not allow anybody else to do it, that is not quite accurate.  Nobody brings politics.  Our remit is to try to turn this industry around.  It is not about who put us there or how we got there.  I will say it again in conclusion: I was willing - at every stage and I still am - to go through any process that I am asked to.</p></speech>

I have told the Deputy that, on average, I spend approximately 30 hours a week in the industry.  Obviously, not all of that is spent at board meetings.  We meet sponsors.  I will refer to the point raised about ETS.  At the time, we found it difficult to secure a sponsor for the Irish Derby.  The largest offer was approximately &euro;50,000.  As a board, we decided to go with ETS on the understanding it would pay &euro;50,000 before the race commenced.  It was as good as any other offer.  Luckily enough, we found a good sponsor after that, who is in it for the long haul.</p></speech>

Taking key positions in State bodies such as his is regarded by many, in particular by me, as being a reward for showing loyalty to a party in power.  The fact that he did not go through the procedure, despite the fact that he had made applications, is a reflection more on the party than him, his membership thereof or his behaviour therein.  It should have asked him to appear for vetting and approval.  I am ready to admit that I am not qualified to question what he has done in IGB, but I am unhappy about the method through which he was appointed.  His membership of and loyalty and service to Fine Gael were material factors in that regard.</p></speech>

It is probably true that, had Fianna F&aacute;il in its old construction been in power, Mr. Meaney would not have been appointed, but that is a reflection more on Fianna F&aacute;il than on anyone else.  What it did in appointments left much to be desired.  Let me be clear on that point.  During its long period in government it set in train the practice of awarding or rewarding its own, which is not the way to construct a board or appoint someone to a position such the one Mr. Meaney occupies.</p> <p>  I also say with some regret that, despite the announcement made by the Government that it would depart from this practice, it has not done so to any great extent.  The day people are appointed because of their willingness to serve and commit to a board on the basis of their abilities must be reached soon.  That is the ideal.  Civil servants in Departments observing the dynamic or tension there should be between Ministers and the Civil Service should have this as their value.  We should be reaching beyond the political system and the norm in appointing people.  Unfortunately, we have not distanced ourselves from the culture of appointing insiders.  We need only consider some of the committees in the Houses and who is advising them to know that, generally, it is the usual suspects.</p> <p>  I will say something about Mr. Meaney's case, not because he is from Carlow-Kilkenny but because I knew him as a businessman previously.  He has a track record, not only in terms of his membership of Fine Gael but of running a successful business.  He is an individual with integrity.  I have no doubt that he is attempting to make a contribution to the organisation in question that is in the best interests of transparency, accountability and so on, which is welcome.  The only thing that would have held me back from appointing him was the fact that he was from Carlow-Kilkenny and I might have been accused of supporting one of my own.  I might have been willing to appoint him because of his credentials.  Deputy Shane Ross's point is about an individual's credentials.  Unfortunately, that process for selecting various State appointees was not in place when Mr. Meaney was appointed, although it is now.  That is regrettable, as Mr. Meaney displayed in his correspondence to the committee in question that he would have liked to have appeared before it for no other reason than to explain his qualifications.  This committee spent four and a half hours one day discussing the issues of office accommodation and toilet rolls.  I was happy to appear before it at that meeting and account for myself.  It might be no harm if other Chairmen or Ministers did likewise.  Deputy Shane Ross gave his opinion and I am giving mine.  I respect the job being done.  As he stated, this is not personal.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a number of questions about IGB.  Its revenue decreased from &euro;63 million in 2006 to &euro;28 million in 2013.

We are going to leverage efficiencies from broadband as well.  That will help us.  IT in 2013 would not have been fit for purpose as it was five to eight years old.  We have to replace it.  We have a choice point as to whether we spend capital to replace all the servers or go with a hosted, managed service.  After a tender process, the latter was awarded to Eircom.  Again, although it hits the profit and loss account as opposed to being a capital expenditure, it was the right decision.  It gives us a great deal of security.  One hears about hacking and we have third parties to manage all of that for us.  It has more flexibility and we are able to expand as and when we can and everything is now in the cloud.  I hope to leverage savings from this going forward as the market catches up and competitiveness increases.</p></speech>

How can you enter into a confidentiality agreement when you know you cannot have confidentiality?  You are breaking the law and telling them lies, because in 12 months' time it will be in the public domain.  Not you, but whoever gets involved in it.  Something has to change around that in terms of the State and its approach to all of this.  It happens with different Departments and agencies and it is not acceptable.  It has to change.  Perhaps it is a recommendation the committee might consider in due course.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  Second, can Mr. Meaney not tell us, in terms of the three cases, at the end of all of this, without breaching confidentiality on any one case, how much it sets you back and how you deal with it?

If one looks at the Indecon report it reads like something that should be done in business anyway and there is nothing in it if you had a company that acknowledged how business should be done, how one would want to do it and was open and transparent and so on.  The Indecon report sets that out.  What was it within Bord na gCon that did not allow the organisation to comply with best practice with the result that we are at this hearing before this committee?  Why did sensible people in the industry not understand, even before they went to Indecon, that something had to be done?</p></speech>

I believe the most important thing to come out of the Indecon report is that every stakeholder, whether it was the Minister, the Department officials or the board at the time, all had their own interpretation.  We all knew something had to be done and most of us knew exactly what had to be done.  Since Indecon put it in a report we are now all working in the one direction.  That is very important.</p></speech>

It has been a layered consultation with the various stakeholders.  The announcement in the budget of the extra &euro;1.2 million necessitates further consultation and further exchange based on the findings from earlier in the year.</p> <p>  With regard to the additional costs associated with microchipping and the requirements for vaccinations, Bord na gCon organised a number of clinics in 2014 and 2015 to facilitate dog owners who wished to have their greyhounds vaccinated and microchipped and ready for export.  Those sessions were arranged to minimise costs for owners and breeders.  There is recognition that the extra legislative requirements are putting costs onto the industry as a whole, not just on breeders.</p></speech>

A road map is in place in the Indecon report.  As the Chairman said, they are the normal business arrangements that should be in place.  However, the report has galvanised the industry.  We are satisfied that Bord na gCon is implementing it.  In order to move itself away from this very difficult financial position, something must be done about reducing the debt.  There are various strands to the work, of which the sale of assets is a very significant strand.  We cannot see a mechanism to reduce the debt through the normal business processes without significant asset sales.</p></speech>

No matter what one does, there are a small number of people who will always find difficulty.  I will give an example of a contentious issue which arose when I became involved in the board and which proved to me what we were dealing with.  The board was faced with a decision on whether we should race on Good Friday and decided to do so.  I was born in the 1950s and would find it difficult to say whether we should have raced.  However, I always believe in going with the combined wisdom.  We raced at four of our major venues on Good Friday.  We received letters of congratulations saying it was right to give people the opportunity, while on the other side, a small number of people preached hell fire.  No matter what we do, we will please some people and displease others.  Such is the industry we are in and we must try to work with the majority.</p></speech>

The response Bord na gCon published on 10 October 2014 detailed the action point "Developing co-mingling contracts and income streams" and stated, "William Hill and other similar agreements secured, contracts ongoing".  Another action point is "Conclude negotiations with TV providers" and the completion date is "quarter 4 2014 and ongoing".  That was at the end of last year.  The chart on page 11 of the document indicated the projected financial improvement from the review of tote operations would be &euro;608,000 in 2015, &euro;461,000 in 2016 and &euro;92,000 in 2017.  The projected income from international co-mingling, television sales and other related wagering opportunities was &euro;600,000 in 2015, to drop off to &euro;30,000 in 2017.  Will Mr. Lewins explain this?  Is it a one-off, up-front payment?  Why is so much income coming in from it?  How much of the &euro;600,000 has been received so far and what is expected to be received by the end of the year?  Why is the figure to drop off from &euro;600,000 to &euro;30,000 in two years?</p></speech>

According to the initial Indecon report, the majority of the &euro;600,000 was to come from television sales through being able to sell our product to the United Kingdom and Ireland through the betting shops, the retail estate.  There has been a significant lag, given that we did not reach the trial basis until 1 September this year.  They wanted to trial it for a number of reasons.  They wanted to establish whether we could deliver what we said we could and whether we could offer the retail industry the margins it was used to in the United Kingdom, which was the biggest market.  The major players did not want to buy the product until they saw it.  We have just concluded the 12-week trial, albeit much later than anticipated.  We had anticipated that it would be finished earlier in the year.  We are in negotiations to conclude contracts with the hope the revenue we first thought we would get in 2015 will materialise in 2016.  In effect, we are one year behind.</p><p>That is fine.  When we get these lovely reports, I get worried.  This is an Indecon report and this is the Bord na gCon response.  We were given dates.  We have one month to go in 2015 and there is this &euro;600,000.  It was mentioned earlier that much of that &euro;600,000 would come through this year but now Mr. Lewins is saying it is not happening this year.</p></speech>

I have not read it all but I read all about this income, tote operations and &euro;400,000 next year but nobody is telling me it is only 7% in reality to Bord na gCon.  There appears to be a big gap for a person who is not an insider reading that documentation.  That is all I am saying.  I refer to the document the witnesses gave us on the IGB response to recommendations made within the Indecon report.  When I go to section 9, development of Bord na gCon information technology, I see that it is been implemented and that development of co-mingling has been implemented.  One would think this was all done and dusted but the witnesses are now telling me that when we probe this, Bord na gCon is completing a trial stage.</p></speech>

The development of co-mingling has been built.  We built the platform and the IT infrastructure to allow us to co-mingle with different parts of the world.  That, in effect, has been built but the difficulty with co-mingling is that one has to depend on third parties within the overall system.  We have agreed a contract, as the chairman alluded to, with some iconic companies 12 or 13 months ago.  They had to build their infrastructure and they are not in a position bed into our system yet so they are holding us up as opposed to the other way around.</p></speech>

We got a response last night on these recommendations stating that the vast majority have been implemented.  When we tease it out, it appears we are a long way from it being fully operational.  As a committee, we have to be more judicious in accepting the word "implemented".  When I saw the word "implemented", I thought it was up and running but the witnesses are saying they have a bit to go yet.</p></speech>

The last line is interesting that in order to complete its work by the end of 2016, a request has been made for funding of &euro;3 million.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach mentioned that this investigation could possibly take eight years.  Lets do the maths.  If that is the case, or even close to it, given that by 2016 an additional &euro;3 million will be involved, then one is talking about serious money if it runs into another seven years beyond that.  It is clear to me that a proper analysis, based on the estimates with regard to how long this could take, has not been conducted.  To be honest, the answer we received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform indicates that.</p></speech>

Serious issues have arisen in relation to the sale of loans to Cerberus and how it is treating the customer at the other end, causing serious difficulties to local economies and businesses and, in particular, a business in Kilkenny.  I intend to raise the issue with the officials next week as to what controls are in place once a bank sells its loan into Cerberus.  What is the attitude of the Department of Finance and the State to protecting businesses that are working with the banks but are unable to work with Cerberus because it is demanding full payment of a loan upfront, when in fact it is a distressed business?  It will close businesses.  In one case, there are 40 jobs involved.  I am expressing my deep concern about its attitude and will raise the issue next week.</p></speech>
