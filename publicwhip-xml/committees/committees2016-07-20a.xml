    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016072000002#B00200"><p>I propose that, at the conclusion of the meeting, the select committee briefly discuss in private session possible dates for meetings in September.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I remind members to switch off mobile telephones.  The purpose of the meeting is to engage with the chairperson designate of An Post, Mr. Dermot Divilly, to discuss the approach Mr. Divilly proposes to take if and when he is appointed to the role and his views on the challenges facing the organisation.  Members invariably have a strong interest in An Post, in particular its network of post offices nationwide.  We are aware that Mr. Bobby Kerr led a team which completed a report on the future of the post office network late last year.  In addition, the former Joint Committee on Transport and Communications produced a report on the future of the network in 2013.</p><p>Members will be aware of the Government decision of May 2011 which introduced new arrangements for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  Reference to this arrangement is also made in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State boards of November 2014.  The 2016 programme for Government suggests that nominees to chairs of State boards be required to have their nominations ratified by the relevant Oireachtas committee prior to appointment.  The select committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson designate of An Post to hear his views and trusts that this meeting will provide greater transparency to the process of appointments to State boards and bodies. </p><p>On behalf of the select committee, I welcome Mr. Dermot Divilly.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continues to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise Mr. Divilly that any submission or opening statement he makes to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>As members have received a copy of Mr. Divilly's opening statement via e-mail, he may wish to provide a brief outline of his statement, although I will leave the decision to Mr. Divilly.</p></speech>

I was honoured to have been asked some time ago by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Alex White, to become chairperson designate of An Post.  An Post is a company with a fine heritage and a strong and trusted brand.  A recent RepTrak survey found that An Post is yet again the public sector company with the best reputation in Ireland.</p> <p>  I will give the select committee some background information on my career to date and, in particular, my specific experience relevant to this position.  I was born and raised in the west where I attended secondary school.  I attended University College Dublin where I graduated with a first class honours degree in agricultural science.  I immediately completed a masters in business administration in Trinity College Dublin and was one of the first agricultural graduates to secure an MBA.  That was a long time ago.</p> <p>  I joined the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, after graduating for two years and, thereafter, went into private industry as marketing and sales director of Gateaux, which in those days was a large exporter of cakes to Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and other such shops.  In my late 20s I was appointed chief executive officer of Thorn Domestic Appliances and served as CEO of a number of other companies, including Toyota and Coal Distributors, over the following decade.</p> <p>  In 1993, I completed a management buy-out of Allegro limited which was Ireland&rsquo;s largest distributor of grocery products at the time.  The arrival of Tesco in the late 1990s and its central distribution model, which sought to bypass distributors, had a serious impact on Allegro but I successfully managed the transition for shareholders and the company continues to trade successfully. </p> <p>  For the past 15 years, I have been operating as a private equity investor in a wide range of private companies in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I have done this on a hands-on basis, in other words, I have not only put in money but have been an executive chairman of the companies in question.  I have gained considerable experience in doing this and the investments have been reasonably successful.</p> <p>  In addition to my investments, since 1993 I have been a non-executive director of SIAC limited, a private family company, and was vice chairman of the company, which was one of the largest construction companies in Ireland.  SIAC built many of the roads traversing the country, including the motorway from Dublin to Galway.  I also served as a non-executive director of Hibernian plc, which was subsequently bought by Aviva Ireland.  I was appointed chairman of the company's insurance business and I resolved its pension issue very satisfactorily.  I have broad experience of boards, corporate governance, shareholders and pensions across diverse industries, from finance to logistics.  These roles brought with them the need for an in-depth knowledge of industrial relations, marketing, financial management and strategic planning.  I hope to be able to bring this general, specific and diverse experience to An Post.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, An Post posted reasonably good results at the end of April last.  Despite many challenges, the company recorded a turnover of &euro;826 million and made an operating profit of &euro;5.2 million, which was &euro;2.6 million higher than the previous year.  This is a credit to the thousands of An Post employees, who number in excess of 9,860.</p> <p>  While the traditional mail business remains the largest revenue segment for An Post, it now represents 59% of total revenue, down from 69% in 2008.  In response to the new normal of declining mail volumes, which declined by 34% between 2008 and 2015 and are projected to continue, the company has strengthened its position in other businesses both in Ireland and the UK.  It also continues to develop opportunities presented by emerging trends in e-commerce.  An Post is a significant player in financial services, gift cards, subscription management and fulfilment, and insurance.  These businesses continue to increase their contribution to the profit line.</p> <p>  Growth in online sales will increase demand for domestic and international deliveries, creating further opportunities for the postal industry in general and An Post in particular.  The company will have to respond quickly to changing market needs if it is to convert these opportunities into reality.  To date, it has been successful in doing so. </p> <p>  While the An Post group is profitable, the current model whereby profitable retail and other group businesses subsidise loss-making businesses is becoming increasingly unsustainable and needs to be addressed urgently while the company is financially healthy.</p><p> The key issue here relates to the cost of providing the universal service obligation.  The universal service obligation entails the provision of a five-day, next-day delivery of mail to every premises in the country.  This, in itself, is loss-making, albeit that the company has been successful in reducing these losses through modest price increases and significant cost savings in the mails business.  The company is now coming to the end of large-scale change within this aspect of its operations.  This has implications for the provision of this service, given that, if the same five-day delivery service configuration is to be maintained, an alternative funding model is needed.  This will involve the company continuing to reduce its cost base and pricing will have to increase to the average European level of 80 cent in the immediate term.  In the medium term, the service specification - in other words, the delivery profile - will have to be reviewed if further major cost reductions are to be achieved.</p><p> The post office retail network continues to perform satisfactorily despite the unique challenges it faces.  Government business makes up 74% of total post office revenue and is responsible for significant customer footfall within the network.  The importance of this element of our business was highlighted in the Government-sponsored report chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr.  The report recognises the issues facing the network.  It highlights some opportunities and makes a number of recommendations, which the company will consider and implement in its planning cycle.  Notwithstanding this, our retail network has a unique reach within our diffuse population.  Retail shopping patterns are changing and the move to a cashless society is continuing.  All in all, if we, as a country, wish to maintain a post office network which matches the needs of modern-day commuters and customers, given its historical, community and social value, a radical rethink of the funding and business model is required.  In my view, there needs to be deep engagement with all stakeholders, including the Government, in order to optimise commercial business opportunities as the company further transforms itself and restores an acceptable level of sustainable profitability, especially in the traditional core mail business.</p><p> In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that despite major cost reductions of close to &euro;100 million in annualised savings, service quality improvements up to a standard of 98% and revenue increases due to innovation in product and service delivery, the mail business model needs to be addressed to enable it to maintain a level of profitability suitable for normal variations in revenue due to market movements.  This should happen sooner rather than later; we should not proceed on the same basis that currently exists.</p><p> Ensuring that An Post is in a sustainable financial position will be the primary objective of my tenure as chairman of An Post.  It will involve a combination of price adjustments and ongoing cost reduction, as well as further development of our portfolio of subsidiaries.  I have outlined a number of big challenges facing An Post and I look forward to dealing with these and other strategic issues facing the company.  In doing so, I look forward to working with the board, the chief executive, the management and the staff as they continue to deal with these difficult market challenges.  I expect An Post to continue to adapt its structures and resources to face this challenging business reality.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak and I welcome any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016072000002#D00200"><p>I thank Mr. Divilly for his statement.  As he is aware, there is a lot of concern about the rural post office network.  Will he expand on the Kerr report and outline what services he would see the post office network using?  How best could this committee support Mr. Divilly in his role with regard to the future of the post office network?  Mr. Divilly made reference to the five-day, next-day delivery service and the concerns regarding the profitability and sustainability of that service.  What rate per letter does he think needs to be charged in order to make that service profitable?  If it is not feasible to increase the charge, are there other measures that could be considered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Divilly" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016072000002#D00300"><p>I regard the financial position as the key because everything else flows from that.  Mail has declined by 34% and is declining by about 5% per annum.  For every 1% decline, that is &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million in turnover, so it is quite significant.  We have to adapt the company to that new low level, which is largely outside our control.  With e-business and other changes, people are not writing letters like they used to.  Our big customers are the utility companies and the banks and they are driving everybody online.  Therefore, it is not just a once-off challenge; it is a rolling situation and every year, the turnover will decline.</p><p>I see it as a very big challenge that requires a transformation of the company, and that is where I see the viability.</p><p> I understand rural Ireland very well and I grew up in rural Ireland.  There is no immediate wish whatsoever on my part or the part of the existing management to reduce the number of post offices.  Six post offices closed last year and in all cases it was because they could not get an alternative.  I know the common view - I had it myself - that there was a drive to close post offices.  That is not a major factor in the financial stability of the business; it is much more a question of the deliveries.  We are a very large employer, by any standard, given we are up near 10,000 staff, and we have the cost of that on a declining turnover.</p><p> There is not one silver bullet, in my opinion, and I am quite experienced at this because I have done it and am quite confident I can do it with the help of the management.  It is a question of adapting one's costs.  It is like the time of austerity, when we all had to adapt.  We have to adapt our costs and we have to get some further increase in price to the European average, which I mentioned.  There are very few things in Ireland which are below the European average but the letter delivery system, through a large rural network, is one of the few.  In addition, we have to sell more through our post offices.</p><p> To give the committee an idea of the position, 26% of post offices account for 60% to 70% of the turnover, so it is very biased towards the bigger post offices.  The bigger post offices have a greater capability to sell insurance.  We are now one of the bigger operators in currency, which is quite an achievement as this was traditionally dominated by the banks.  We sell gift cards and have subsidiaries in that area.  We sell a lot of products, but there are only so many of those we can sell, and they are often sold only in the larger outlets because the smaller outlets cannot do that.  Therefore, the larger outlets are probably subsidising the smaller outlets.</p><p> We are absolutely committed to implementing what was recommended in the report by Mr. Bobby Kerr.  There is a steering committee in place at present and we will implement that report.  It is absolutely in line with our thinking that we must drive more turnover, reduce our costs and get more revenue for our product.  Those are the three things we-----</p></speech>

If I would say anything, we have probably been slow on that.  Some 1.1 million people visit the post office every week, which is a colossal amount of footfall and is vital for us.  There is nothing new in all of this and other countries have done the same.  New Zealand made this transformation in the 1990s and it is a country much like ours.  A book was published, which I gave to the new Minister, which shows the issues are the same; for example, it has a large countryside and few cities.  Britain has had to adapt in other ways.</p> <p>  The current account is absolutely central.  The Department of Social Protection has written to people telling them it wants them to transfer their money into a bank account, which would be into one of the pillar banks.  We must get the current accounts open and we need to get on with that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Divilly" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016072000002#E00500"><p>The main problem is that people probably do not want to pay the charges for opening an account.  It is a question of who is going to pay for that.  Although I am not involved in the detail, there are discussions with the Department of Social Protection to get some kind of a satisfactory solution.  That is probably the main issue, but it is well under way.  A trial of this will run in quarter 4, which is October, November and December.  It will be a simple account in the beginning.  The account holder will have a debit card on which he or she can withdraw money anywhere in the world and make debit transfers.  This is the majority of banking done by most people.  We are not trying to be complicated.  Hopefully, in the future, we will be able to give loans and so on.  This is critical, in my view, because it is transactional, and that is what we are good at.  We are not high street traders.  We are good at this and there is trust there.</p> <p>  I have not spoken much about the brand, and perhaps I should have.  It struck me how respected the brand is and how liked it is.  The people have a good feeling about it.  For example, I feel we can do a lot more on insurance, and I have a background in that.  I believe people would buy insurance from An Post.  Perhaps we would have to sell it a different way, but there is no question that people would feel An Post will continue in business, whereas there has been some fallout in other areas.</p><p>There are a lot of opportunities.  It is a three-pronged approach entailing cost, driving new business and making sure the mail business is tight and efficient.</p></speech>

It is one of the things in the Kerr report that is noted as a major plank of trying to build a sustainable network.  Also, in terms of the changes to the company overall, Mr. Divilly mentioned that we cannot proceed on the same basis.  What further changes does he see in terms of An Post and its subsidiaries?</p></speech>

One has to be absolutely realistic regarding the USO.  At present, even if one wished to change it, that is not on the cards.  There has been a great deal of discussion on rural-proofing and all of that, but even apart from that I understand exactly the point.  The only person some people may see in the day is the postman.  That is very important.  The only issue I have about that is who pays for it.  The cost of the USO last year was &euro;35 million.  That is not a lot, out of &euro;1 billion.  Maybe I should not be saying that.  An Post has never got any subsidy towards it yet it has kept its head above water in providing the service.</p> <p>  Regarding my point on deeper engagement, that has commenced.  I have already started talking to the Department and all the various people.  It is a question of who pays for it.  My job will be to have An Post financially sound and in a good position to pay its own way.  That hole will get bigger if I do not do something about it.  However, it will be constructive engagement.  It will not be through the media but will entail dialogue with the relevant people.  There is a good understanding of the issues.  People want the five-day week and I will work with them on that to find a solution.</p> <p>  The current account is very important but today anything in financial services is incredibly slow because of regulation.  I am not faulting regulation, because I was there through the thick of it - I am approved by the Central Bank and so on - but it takes time, unfortunately.  I come from a sector where we want to get everything done tomorrow and we can find that frustrating, but we will get that current account.  We are well on the way to it.  We are running it in a trial section now in the autumn.  Hopefully next year that will be active.  Everybody who visits the post office should have an account.  That will make a big difference.</p><p>If we do not do that, then people who traditionally go to the post office, who tend to be older, will not have a reason to visit us as we cannot sell them something.  It is vital that is done.  We have to think outside the box.  We have the biggest retail network in the country.  There has to be value in that.</p><p> I am not in here moaning about the challenge.  The challenges are real, but every industry is going through challenges and we have to adapt.  If there are over 1,100 retail outlets throughout the country, we have to make them work.  That is the way I would approach that.</p><p> Deputy Stanley's other question related to changes to the company.  I used to run the coal business in Ireland and one Minister, Mary Harney, wiped us out.  She did the right thing, but it was not very pleasant at the time.  I would never allow that to happen again.  I would be prepared for that.  My motto is that we prepare for the future and adapt.  The future is fairly predictable - it is going to decline.  Everything tells us that.</p><p> Then there is another side of the business that has great potential, that is, the parcels.  We all know that retailing is going online.  Maybe 10% of the total business is going online.  One can see it.  It is a very competitive business, as distinct from the letters business.  That is key, as far as I am concerned.  We have to maintain a bigger share of that market.  That is critical because it is our natural heartland and it not anybody else's.  I want us to own a large portion of that.  It is a critical business.  There are many competitors in the business now, but we have to adapt.  We have to give a service that is very competitive pricewise, but people also expect if they order today that the item will be delivered tomorrow at a particular time.</p><p> There is a lot going on.  Most companies in Ireland, whether private, public or banks, face big challenges.  They have to get on with it and if they do not, they die.  I do not know if that answers all Deputy Stanley's questions.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions about the post office network and operations and Mr. Divilly's plans.</p> <p>  On his own position, Mr. Divilly's CV is very impressive.  In his statement he mentioned various positions he had held.  I think he was an investor but also an executive chairperson or director in a number of companies at different stages.  How many boards is he currently serving on?</p></speech>

I think Mr. Divilly may have alluded to it in the last answer.  Drone technology is now being used in the US for deliveries.  Amazon, in particular, is experimenting, at any rate, with drones.  Colleagues in my office tell me one can now order a parcel - I have not done it yet and did not know one could - from Amazon and have it shipped to a Parcel Motel facility in Northern Ireland, which then initiates a second run delivered to collection points in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>Apparently, many people are doing this now as a way to avoid postage-----</p></speech>

If one has an address in the UK, there is a device to have the parcel delivered in Ireland.  That seems to be working effectively.  We do Amazon's deliveries in Ireland.  Technology is coming down the road, however, which will have a big effect on us.  This is also good because we can be involved in all those deliveries.  E-commerce is a big thing.</p></speech>

It is one thing in a town in which there are many different houses side by side; it is in rural areas that one has to engage the postal service.  It strikes me - again, I have noticed this acutely as a politician - that the cost of postage and stamps has soared in recent years.  However, there may be opportunity in that as well because there are direct marketing opportunities.  I think Post Plus and other services-----</p></speech>

They will have to do so because that is where the big volumes are.  It surprised me to learn that private postage only accounts for 10% of overall postage volume.  The big volume is from the banks and utility companies.  Last year, Eircom carried out a big direct mail.  We have teams of people engaged in that.  That is the future.</p></speech>

Much of it goes back to comments already made about the importance of retention of the rural post office network and the types of services that can be obtained through the post office, moving into banking services and even what I think is called white labelling, certain other services, as a single point of contact.  What are Mr. Divilly's views on the Irish Postmasters Union six-point plan?</p></speech>

I am absolutely convinced, as I said, of the three-pronged approach.  We must move products through it.  Financial services is the big key.  The three or four big pillar banks are withdrawing from towns around rural areas and the Government cannot influence that.  We must work with those banks to step into their shoes in parts.  We are already there.  For example, we work very closely with AIB.  At AIB branches, cheques can be lodged or cashed and so on.  We need to take that to a more added-value level.  The post offices are by and large transactional.  We need to get up that chain a little.  There is no reason we cannot provide micro-loans and similar services in the future.  We have good services but we need to move more quickly.</p></speech>

Families worked not only in the core postal business, but also in the shops and outlets.  Those postmasters have a very valuable commodity, namely, public trust and recognition in the State.  However, as much as he says the environment is challenging, I can think of no other company whose core business is guaranteed to decline by 5% per annum.  We must start preparing for real cliff drops because some of the banks are now competing with new Internet banking mechanisms, which do not perform any postal functions, and will start taking a huge amount of customers and business.  At some point very soon - within a timeframe of five to ten years - we cannot expect that 90% of letters will come, as Mr. Divilly says, from utilities and banks if we are to lose one or two of those customers-----</p></speech>

Too much of the parcel delivery business has escaped us already, but we still need to provide it.  When I say financial services, I talk pretty loosely.  The currency has been a great success.  We do all the NTMA business and the savings business and we take in all their money and so on.  However, there is no silver bullet.  We are going up two steps and probably coming down three at a time sometimes.</p></speech>

An Post's core business is in the network and delivery system, not necessarily in the retail outlets.  I cannot remember how many of the retail outlets An Post manages.  It is a very small number.</p></speech>

Again, the statistics show that roughly 66% of our business is accounted for by 25% of the companies involved, that is, the top 300 companies.  By definition, they are also the people most able to do that.  They have the facilities, the people and the scale to do it.</p></speech>

It is in the retail outlets.  In a sense, the retail outlets carry on much of the financial transaction business referred to by Mr. Divilly.  Similarly, does he envisage that the retail outlets will have a significant role in the parcel business?  Are they part of the distribution system - in that new parcel system - or are they an ancillary part of that expansion of parcel delivery services?</p></speech>

In the city regions there are dedicated people delivering parcels but in rural Ireland there is a big plus.  If one considers Dingle, for instance, there may be one parcel to be delivered there.  For any of our competitors, that is a very expensive drive.  However, we have a presence in that area so we can do very well there.  It is very competitive in the city, but we have to provide services there too.</p></speech>

It has reopened within a Spar, I think.  I had a particular interest in this because I know the area very well and was trying to see how we could make it work in a village such as Ballingeary, a small village in west Cork.  I think the future must be in that post office, retail shop, financial services centre and parcel delivery centre.  Particularly in rural Ireland, it is about using the existing distribution network to service all those needs and possibly many others.  For example, if there is that network involving someone driving from Macroom to Ballingeary - I am keeping it very local - could that be part of a rural transport system?  If there is a van going down a road, why would we not consider it as being part of a rural transport system?  If we start thinking that in five or ten years all new vehicles will have a dual capability of carrying passengers as well as parcels, it starts making-----</p></speech>

Deputy Eamon Ryan is absolutely right that one must be absolutely open-minded to everything because there is no one thing that will solve this for us and, as he says, there will be cliffs.

The distribution system is part of a very complex range of services.  The village post office is the centre that provides a range of Government services, financial services, the Internet, parcel and other services, and also shipping stuff in and out in order that small businesses in the community have a good access point to the rest of the world.  Small businesses can trade on the Internet and we are not just buying in everything from Manchester.  In that world I imagine the one difficulty is deciding a role for the big central sorting office, particularly for letter post.</p></speech>

They are very automated and read addresses.  A lot of progress has been made.  As many as 4,500 of our 9,000 staff work on the delivery side in small local sorting offices.  That is where the big thing is and it is very much dominated by fulfilling the universal service obligation, USO.  There has been quite significant restructuring of sorting, and I think it has been done well.</p></speech>

I congratulate Deputy Jim Daly on his appointment as Chairman.  I know the deep-rooted dedication he has for children's issues, particularly around the areas of education and out-of-home care.  I wish him well in this new role and look forward to working with him and the entire committee over the next several years to advance children&rsquo;s rights.</p> <p>  Soon after I became Ombudsman for Children in 2015, I decided to delay the development of a strategic plan to allow me to rebuild the staffing levels of the office which had been hit by several vacancies.  With the positive support of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, I am glad to report that I have now returned the office to a sufficient level of staffing and I am confident of being able to set out and build toward a new three-year plan.  I am honoured to be able to speak for the first time about it in the committee most directly connected to the work of my office.  I am grateful for the committee&rsquo;s time today.</p> <p>  In 2014, our office handled 1,600 complaints from the public on issues where complainants believed the State had not provided adequately for children.  The top three areas of complaints were education, issues around the Child and Family Agency and health.  The figures for 2015, which will be published shortly in our annual report, show the number of complaints to the office continues to grow.  We also offered workshops and education on children&rsquo;s rights to 850 children and young people, as well as 130 postgraduates from six institutions studying and working in areas such as social work, child care, social care, teaching and child protection.  Last year, the office, as per its statutory obligations, provided advice to the Government on several Bills and policies.</p> <p>  On 14 January 2015, I spoke at the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to outline our report on the progress of children&rsquo;s rights in Ireland between 2006 and 2015 and to facilitate the committee&rsquo;s examination of the State&rsquo;s performance in children&rsquo;s rights.  I am glad to say many of the recommendations we made to the committee were included in its concluding observations to the Government, which were issued last February.  I was also pleased to present to three joint Oireachtas committees last year, namely, those relating to education and social protection, public services oversight and petitions and health and children.  This was significant in highlighting the transparency and accountability of the office, which we are eager to continue.</p> <p>  To develop the strategic plan, I enlisted a consultant to interview several people, both in Ireland and abroad, who were aware of our office and had varying connections with the children of Ireland and the issues which affect them.  I also invited anyone who wished to contribute to write to us with a 500-word contribution and the consultant received those submissions directly to a separate e-mail address.  We received a number of extremely useful and enlightening responses on foot of that invitation.  I am especially delighted that several teenagers took the time to write to us with their thoughts on what we should focus on over the next three years.</p> <p>  With a remit that covers all 1.2 million children in Ireland and their interactions with all public bodies from birth to 18 years of age, our biggest problem was narrowing down our focus to a small number of areas.  This took time and energy, and was achieved by carrying out a number of internal workshops facilitated by the consultant.  We carefully considered all the feedback we received before deciding that three objectives would be the optimum number on which to focus.  Accordingly, we could realistically aim to achieve something without losing our capacity to continue working on all the other issues which naturally come to the office.</p> <p>  In the submitted paper, we have set out our vision and values which act as our guidance.  We spent a couple of months discussing and debating various wordings before settling on these.  I am extremely proud of them because they not only offer a clear sense of the way we want to work and behave, but do so in a simple manner which can be easily understood by all.  It was a key criterion for me that this strategy should be written at a level that children and young people can understand.  That is what we have presented to the committee today.</p><p>There is no so-called adult version.  It is our goal that everything we write or produce can be clearly understood by children and young people, and thereafter, by adults too.</p><p> The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office&rsquo;s vision is that we want an Ireland where all children and young people are actively heard and respected to ensure they experience safe, fulfilling and happy everyday lives.  We will use our independence and powers to the fullest extent to bring this about.  If this vision should be the only message I convey today, then I will consider this presentation a success.  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office now has a clear message and target for the next three years, one which both challenges and encourages me.  If I can live in a country where every child experiences a safe, fulfilled and happy life every day, then I cannot tell the committee how proud I will be.  However, we all know such a target will require the efforts of all committee members, and indeed, the whole D&aacute;il.  It will also require the support of the greater public service and all the citizens of Ireland to bring it about.  It is not impossible, however, and that is what is encouraging.</p><p> We have set out three objectives for the lifetime of this plan.  The first will increase awareness of children and young people&rsquo;s rights, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the role of the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.  This sets us on a course whereby children and adults grow in their understanding of what children&rsquo;s rights are and how they can be achieved in everyday life.  I hope to explore every avenue of possibility for enhancing the awareness of children&rsquo;s rights and of this office, so that people know what their children are entitled to and who to come to if those rights are not fully achieved.</p><p> The second objective revolves around working to build capacity among public organisations whose work impacts on children and young people to develop and implement a child rights-based approach to their practice.  This objective is to help public organisations to become more child conscious, as well as to integrate child-friendly policies across all areas of their organisations.  This would mean the specific needs of children would be considered when it comes to education, health, housing and more.  We have already initiated work to generate some tools to enhance child-friendly administration and will be engaging with several Departments to move that project on in the near future.</p><p> The third objective relates to influencing positive change for and with children and young people in Ireland.  It will require us to work across the three elements of our Act, namely, our power to advise the Government around legislation and policy, the onus on us to highlight issues which are important to children themselves and our power to take complaints on behalf of children whose voices are not always heard.  Across the time span of this plan, my office will continue to use those powers for all children but most especially for those with mental health issues and those who are homeless or disabled.  I will also place a focus on ensuring child protection is at its best and that children who experience the trauma of abuse, in whatever form that might take, can feel safe to report it.  They can also be assured that it will be dealt with immediately and they will get the required level of support when they require it.</p><p> What I have found in my position as Ombudsman for Children is that the biggest struggles for children and parents are often not the biggest issues. For example, getting into a local school should not be difficult in a well-run, stable democracy that values children&rsquo;s rights.  Gaining support to avoid declaring one's family homeless should not be difficult in a fair and recovering economy.  A safe and secure refuge should not be a fantasy for children and parents who flee domestic violence.  Being asked to provide financial and social support, as well as a well-designed transition plan to help an 18 year old live an independent life after years in the care of the State, should not come as a shock to Tusla or the State.  It should be easy to deliver.  Getting access to a high-quality counsellor in a school setting when one feels down or needs someone to confide in should not be a total fantasy for teenagers in a country that sells itself as having one of the best-educated populations in the English-speaking world.</p><p> For parents of a child born into this world with a severe disability, physical or intellectual, having to fight for assistance with every aspect of that child&rsquo;s care and at every new developmental stage, should not become the norm in a country which cherishes all children equally.  When one has fostered two severely disabled children, getting financial support to purchase a specially adapted car should be easy, not a never-ending battle, especially when this country is crying out for families to foster children and give them the love, care and support they crave.</p><p> It is the small everyday things that matter to our children and that bring about happiness.  I will use all my powers to bring equality to all children who seek it.  I will conclude by quoting Archbishop Tutu of South Africa who said, "Do your little bit of good where you are; it is those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world."</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#D00100"><p>I have no problem starting.  I thank the ombudsman for the presentation this morning.  Given that he was representing and speaking on behalf of 1.2 million people, he did very well to condense it down like that.  How he summed it up at the end encompassed it all.  As he said, it is the small little bits that one forgets that really take away the hardship for the parents and the families.  My ideal is that I always hope that I have happy, healthy, educated kids.  The Ombudsman has covered one, two and three there in his presentation.  It is staggering that 47% of complaints relate to education while 25% relate to the family agency.  The third problem, 11%, relates to health.  At the end of the presentation, one really sees the issue of access to schools.  As a rural Deputy, the biggest access problem for parents that I see is school transport.  That is a huge issue for parents living in rural areas.</p> <p>  In general, the ombudsman has stepped matters out very well and, as my party's spokesperson on children and youth affairs, I hope we can work together to bring some of this forward and support the work of the office.  My colleagues and I have been harping on about post-care support mechanisms for children who have been in care for a long number of years.  It is amazing how much money is invested in them while they are in care yet suddenly when they turn 18, there are no support mechanisms in place.  After that, we are into a bigger raft of issues, be it from housing, drugs or whatever else.  I would love the ombudsman to expand on that going forward.  If we could get that piece right, it could sort out an awful lot of other problems into the future.  On access to high quality counsellors and mental health in our schools, what is the ombudsman's vision when he meets with the Department of Education and Skills?  What will he be saying to the Department and what will he encourage it to do?  As Deputies, we experience the detrimental effect a lack of guidance counsellors has had in schools.  There are pockets throughout the country which really need that support and I would love to hear what the ombudsman has to say in that regard.  The parents of children with disabilities face a huge issues and I would love to hear what the ombudsman is going to say to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.</p> <p>  Children in direct provision are not mentioned.  I attended recently the "Inclusive Centenaries" conference in NUIG which was the most amazing conference I have attended in a long time.  We listened to children in direct provision speak.  Connacht was playing in the Heineken cup final and they could only watch on their phones.  They could not have friends over because they are in direct provision and in the hotel room.  Things are no different for children in homelessness, but these are children who are well able and articulate and they have never had a home.  They have only ever had a bedroom and had it to share with their brothers, sisters and families.  Direct provision is a huge issue for those children and their voices need to be heard.  They do not feel that they are heard which concerns me.  Last Monday, I met with a group from YAP Ireland, which is an absolutely brilliant organisation.  It interviewed myself and Joe Canning because he is the ambassador for UNICEF.  They do not feel that they have a mechanism for their voices to be heard and they do not feel that their voices count.  They feel they need to be able to articulate their views in either a questionnaire or some other form every now and again.  For example, if a social worker is not engaged, they are afraid to speak up and to open that line of communication.  When they do, things have nearly gone too far.  They would like some way to provide feedback and to let their voices be heard, be it on a questionnaire or otherwise.  It could be the simplest things, but we need to empower kids as to how to communicate and support them in that whole element of communication.  If that could be done through the ombudsman with guidance for the rest of us on how to communicate that back, it would be valuable work.</p> <p>  I appreciate the time the ombudsman has taken here this morning.  There was a great deal in the presentation.  We will enjoy working with him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#E00100"><p>I thank Dr. Muldoon in general for the work he does as well as for his presentation and for making it so user friendly.  It was a main aim that it should be so.  On the fact that the highest number of complaints the ombudsman dealt with were in the education area, could he elaborate on what those were?  He mentioned admissions to schools and counselling, but I wonder if a lot of complaints related to access to services for children with learning difficulties also.  What kind of complaints were made in relation to the family agency?  I do not know whether the ombudsman has read the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which was published recently.  If so, does he consider that it addresses some of the issues around getting into schools, albeit it does not address the religious issue?</p> <p>  I share Deputy Anne Rabbitte's concern about children in direct provision.  I have also visited a family who were all in one room with the children doing their homework sitting on the bed.  There was no space.  There were recommendations on direct provision, which is an area where children's welfare issues need to be addressed.  There is also an issue around children who are in hotels and hostels because their families are homeless.  I welcome some of the measures that were announced yesterday with regard to transportation and ensuring that those children have access to school completion programmes as well as to school, preschool and cr&egrave;ches themselves.  The measures are designed to remove barriers, but there is still a lot of concern around those children.</p> <p>  I want to go through the ombudsman's three objectives and ask a few questions around those.  In the beginning of the ombudsman's report, he refers to the report of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from February 2016.  There are some issues to be addressed in that regard.  As such, what is the ombudsman's role in ensuring that those issues are addressed by the various agencies and Departments?  In that context, many of the actions set out have to do with public organisations.  In his first action, the ombudsman talks about strengthening understanding among public organisations of the importance of respecting and promoting children's rights.  In the second, he refers to supporting capacity building among relevant public organisations.  A lot of the actions relate to public organisations, including being able to issue apologies, which would make things easier where complaints need to be resolved.  Can the ombudsman comment on whether he is getting a positive response from public organisations and whether it is difficult to implement his objectives with them?</p> <p>  The very last point on the page of the report setting out the objectives refers to child protection services.  Clearly, there has been concern for a long time about adequate numbers of social workers and so on.  While there has been some progress in that regard, the ombudsman might comment on the issue.  Added to that is the question of whether the systems in place to ensure that the voices of children are heard in the context of legal services and the courts are working, in particular in family law cases.  Can their voices be heard adequately in those kinds of situations?  Finally, are there any specific measures in relation to social and digital media of which we should be made aware?</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il as an cur l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och freisin go bhfuil an c&aacute;ip&eacute;is ar f&aacute;il sa d&aacute; theanga chomh maith.  It is great to see the document produced bilingually.  I am very pleased to see it.  I am grateful for the passionate and detailed presentation and for the succinct and to-the-point strategy, which is welcome.</p><p>I will ask some general questions on the strategy and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, and I will then go through the objectives.</p><p> It was very welcome that Dr. Muldoon said: "Being asked to provide financial and social support and a well-designed transition plan to help an 18 year old live an independent life, after years in the care of the State, should not come as a shock to Tusla or the State and should be easy to deliver on."  Both previous Deputies touched on the point.  It is a very important point and the State has been deficient in it over many years.  I would be interested to know if Dr. Muldoon believes the State is making adequate progress in its preparation for the end of 2017, when there will be a statutory obligation to provide after-care plans.  The question is not only whether there is an after-care plan, but whether the plan is satisfactory.</p><p> Dr. Muldoon touched on staffing levels and said 1.2 million children is a lot of people to represent.  From what he said previously, I take it there has been some improvement.  Is it adequate to carry out the work he does?  There is some detail on the number of complaints received.  How many of the complaints are received from children directly?</p><p> Regarding the first objective, I am very interested in the idea of children's rights to impact assessments.  How much work has been done on it?  How does Dr. Muldoon see it progressing?  On the production of research on thematic issues, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan touched on digital media and protection of and support for young people in their engagement with the online world.  It is very important and should be considered a priority.  Are there other issues that are anticipated to be priorities?</p><p> On the second objective, it is very welcome that there is a desire for an improvement in complaint handling.  Although Tusla allegedly provides a 24-7 resource, it is not necessarily a 24-7 service.  Some of it involves getting in contact with the Garda after hours, which is inappropriate.  This applies to the most serious complaints, and it is very important regarding good practice and handling complaints.</p><p> The third objective is probably the most ambitious.  Some of the issues, particularly regarding 3.2, relate to homelessness and the conditions of children who are in emergency accommodation.  Both Deputies touched on it.  This relates to children experiencing mental health issues and direct provision.  Does the Ombudsman for Children have any direct influence over the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, and has Dr. Muldoon had any difficulties accessing direct provision centres where it has been required or considered appropriate?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#F00300"><p>I will take that on board.  We have had complaints about school transport and we are very much aware of the difficulties.  We have a focus on it to try to find the best way for us to intervene.  While it has an impact on rural children, it also impacts on children with special needs going to the right school.  We are very much aware of such scenarios and it is a very difficult area in which to make a difference, given that it has such a long-term impact.  I will ask Ms Nuala Ward to let Deputy Anne Rabbitte know how many school transport complaints we have received and how we have dealt with them.  It comes across our desk on a regular basis and I will raise it with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  I have requested a meeting with him and it will be on the agenda.</p> <p>  Regarding after care, there are certain things we know from the beginning of a child's life.</p><p>If a child has a severe physical or intellectual disability, the State will have to intervene throughout his or her lifetime.  This can be planned, prepared and budgeted for.  After care is like this.  A child who has been in care for two or three years and who is approaching his or her 18th birthday will need support when he or she leaves care.  However, there seems to be a reluctance to co-operate and make these things happen.  A child moving from the child service to the adult service can cross areas such as mental health, children in care and disability.  The adult services seem to be slow to take on board that the child is ready to move.  It is all about the adults.</p><p> We need to move to a child's best interests forum, with the child's best interests being the focus for public servants so it is very clear, when a child is about to graduate into the adult world, that the funding, resources and plans need to be in place.  The statutory obligation to make a plan should be followed by the statutory resources.  It should be automatic.  It is common sense.  No child should receive a plan and then be told it may not be followed up.  It would be totally contrary to the best interests of the child.  It is something we can fix.  It must be considered.</p><p> There is a very clear answer to many of the problems.  We know children are in care and we know what happens when we do not support them when they leave.  They end up in mental health services, in homeless situations, occupying beds in psychiatric hospitals and involved in crime.  Some also manage alone.  There are positive stories.  However, we know they could manage much better if support were put in place.  It is clear.  We can see it coming, we can work towards it and we can fix it.  In stressful economic times, there were restraints.  However, as we plan for the future, and to have a more balanced economy, we can plan for such issues.</p><p> Similarly, when economic stress occurred, our children lost a major valuable resource in high-quality counsellors, and we need to put them back in place.  My background is in psychology and I have worked in the mental health area for a long time.  Since I started, I have worked closely with the Irish Primary Principals Network, the National Association of Deputy Principals and Principals, and the Teaching Council to work on a well-being culture in schools.  We aim to create an atmosphere in which children and teachers from primary through to post-primary have the ability to speak about their emotional lives and feel supported when they feel under stress.  We are trying to promote this so the generations to come will not find things as difficult and, while they will not necessarily need a counsellor, will know the safety net is there.  We will have created the language that allows them to say they have a problem and know the right thing to do is to tell somebody they trust and fix it.  This is opposed to the older generation - I put my hands up here - who were told to stay quiet and not to let anybody see they had a weakness.</p><p> We are trying to change the culture.  Counsellors are a valuable part of it.  In Northern Ireland, every school has an independent counsellor available to it close to the school but off site, which avoids the possible stigma people can associate with an in-school counsellor.  It would be a positive step forward if we could make such things happen.  We also need to make our mental health services available when a person comes forward, and we will.</p><p> I am very much aware that I have narrowed down to three focal points.  Within disability, I am engaging with the various sectors to try to finalise the best actions I can take over the next two to three years.  I am not the expert.  The area is so broad that I am engaging with all.  I am having a meeting later with various sectors and NGOs on the disability service and I will highlight exactly what I need to do and listen to them, see what they feel is needed, what legislation is involved, what actions are best suited and where awareness needs to be raised.  I am happy to link with them and decide my strategy from there.  It will allow me to bring it to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, when I meet him.</p><p> Many areas relate to severe disability.  I gave the example of the adaptation of a car or housing.  When a child is severely disabled, we know we will have to do these things.</p><p>It makes sense to plan for it in the budget.  However, it always seems to be totally out of the blue.  "Why are you asking for that?" is the question asked.  The parents, particularly in foster care situations, should be given extra support, as opposed to less support.</p><p> All members have mentioned children in direct provision.  That is very strong on our agenda.  From the very first interview I did, direct provision was one of the things I was very much highlighting.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, agreed in principle to allow us to take on the remit of direct provision.  We are currently in negotiations to finalise the legal situation to make that happen.  Ms Ward and I have visited direct provision centres.  We know exactly the difficulties faced by the children in there.  For almost 17 years children on our island have not had access to our office, which is a severe point of discrimination.  We hope that will end very soon.  The plan is for it to end in the next couple of moths, once we finalise the legislative mechanism to make that happen.  That will allow us then to contribute positively to what RIA can do and to guide the centres.  We will not be involved in any of the final decisions on asylum-seekers.  We will stay away from that.  However, the administration of the services and the rights of the children while they are in direct provision will be a strong piece of work, from our point of view.</p><p> I ask Dr. Karen McAuley to speak about children afraid to speak up.  Within the objectives we have many plans to work with children as part of the region.  To answer one of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's questions, we have reached the staffing complement that we had.  We have had the same complement for about ten years.  I have now applied for the estimates for an ambitious increase in staffing to follow through on this objective.  I believe we need more staff because much of the work we want to do is outreach.  We want to get out of the office, get down to the country, meet children and hear their voices in a much more active way, whereas at the moment our intake is through children coming to our office, which obviously limits the long-distance situation.</p></speech>

It is very helpful that Deputies have raised the issue of children and young people in direct provision.  We understand that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs recently undertook a piece of work to hear the views of children and young people in direct provision.  We have not seen the outcome of that yet.  It will be important to see that and to see whether there is a way in which, in our work, we can build on or complement that work in the future so that we do not duplicate what somebody else has already done.  I would be very interested to find out more about what Deputy Rabbitte hears from young people in direct provision regarding mechanisms.  One of the points that struck me in what she said is that they are looking for a mechanism that will enable them to regularly raise concerns that they may have on an ongoing basis, as opposed to a once-off initiative.  Perhaps after this meeting we could speak a little more about that.  That would be very helpful.</p></speech>

The top five categories of education complaints we receive are: handling of allegations of inappropriate professional conduct; handling of bullying; complaints handling decisions and policy; expulsion, suspension and enrolment; and issues of educational policy, schemes or curriculums.  As members may know, this year we published an overview report on the State Examinations Commission.  We felt that was a very useful way of trying to highlight some of the challenges for children and young people with disabilities, specifically learning disabilities, in getting adequate support when they are doing their leaving certificate.  Our education complaints are therefore broad, so we are considering the whole education sector as well as individual schools.  One of the key strengths is that we have that mechanism to consider the whole gambit of children's education.  For example, school transport, being able to get to school, is an integral part of this.</p> <p>  Regarding family support, care and protection, complaints mainly concern the Child and Family Agency.  We totally accept what has been raised regarding child protection and welfare services, which is why we have included them as one of our key objectives.  The top five subcategories in this regard concern child protection concerns; alternative care, that is, care placements, foster care and so on; family support, which is hugely important for prevention and therefore a very key area for us; social work services; and child care preschool and early child care education.</p><p>Those are the top five categories to consider for what we call family support, care and protection.</p></speech>

We made a recommendation that the Equal Status Act be adjusted to take away the barrier in religious schools.  We are also disappointed to see a 25% derogation for past pupils.  We also made a recommendation on this, that there should be no derogation for past pupils.  We feel that is discriminatory to children who move into an area, particularly Traveller children, whose parents are likely to have no background in second-level school and may not even be in the right area, but also people returning to their area.  These are the two points I can make immediately and to which we already referred, but I expect to consider the Bill in more detail in the near future.</p> <p>  In the action plan published yesterday, Rebuilding Ireland, there are many very positive things from our point of view.  We met with the Department with responsibility for housing last week and we are pleased to see some of our recommendations, particularly the use of the children and young people's services committees to engage in the area of housing to make sure that children are properly facilitated.  I am pleased to see that there is a section on children.  It is crucial that we see them as an important part of what we are about because homelessness has affected them so strongly now.  I met with a very brave young seven-and-a-half-year-old girl who came into my office after having written a letter saying that she was looking for a new home, having been homeless for four and a half years.  She is a fabulous young girl who has moved, I think, 11 times, trying to stay safe.  She is very clear that she would thrive under a safe, secure, stable house.</p> <p>  The area of domestic violence is one that has made a special contribution to the crisis we have at the moment.  There are not enough refuges, which leaves children and parents having to declare themselves homeless.  That is a very difficult scenario for them because they are not only trying to find a place to live, but are also trying to find a place to live that is safe and perhaps away from an abusive partner.  We are very aware of that and it needs to be considered as well.</p> <p>  The action plan allows for the inclusion of safe guidance and boundary codes for emergency accommodation, and we have had complaints in that regard as well.  This is where children and parents have been in houses and accommodation that were not designed for families, which is something that the Department with responsibility for housing is now very clear about, that it needs to generate two-bedroom and three-bedroom emergency accommodation so that there is a facility there for families when they need to use it.  I hope we will get to the stage where we will use them less and less but they need to be there because the old stock was designed for the single man or woman or couples so it did not need to be suitable to the same degree for families.  We need privacy, safety and security dealt with in that context.  We need the play areas and the ability to get to school so, again, the school transport option is very positive.</p> <p>  However, I am very clear that the main issue is that those affected can move away from bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels as an option.  It will take time to get there but we need to know that in years to come emergency accommodation will involve proper, solid accommodation, as opposed to a temporary bed and breakfast unit, the reservation for which can be moved because of, say, the holding of a concert the following day.  That is totally inappropriate.  It is therefore a very positive commitment from our point of view.  I am sure I am only touching on some of the matters in the action plan, but that is what I have to say from our initial look at it.  Deputy O'Sullivan also referred to the UNCRC recommendations within our objectives.  I will refer her to Karen for a response to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karen McAuley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#J00300"><p>As the Deputy knows, the UN committee's recommendations, published earlier this year, are very wide-ranging.  Viewed in broad terms, they cover a number of different matters.  First, in the area of legislation, they seek the full integration of children's rights and the principles and provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child into Irish law.  That is about initiating legislation, amending existing legislation and addressing gaps and deficits in legislation at present.  Regarding our role in this, as we have done on many occasions in the past, we will continue to provide advice and developments in legislation affecting children.  The core focus of that advice, as the Deputy knows, is on providing a children's rights perspective on the prospective implications of legislation for children.  That advice is forthcoming, and we welcome invitations from the committee and others to provide it, as needed.</p><p>We will also, in accordance with our remit under the Act, monitor legislation and developments in terms of implementation and review the operation of legislation relating to children.  The focus is to see whether commitments in legislation are met, what impact they have on children and whether they give effect to children's rights.  That is in accordance with our existing remit and it comes in under our strategy.</p><p> The committee spoke about another area in broad terms which is the importance of continuing to raise awareness of children's rights and the implications for those and what the practice of respecting, protecting and fulfilling children's rights entails for all concerned.  As the members know from what Dr. Muldoon has said, a core part of our strategy relates to promoting or increasing awareness of children's rights and the process of rights realisation among members of the public, including children and young people, but also very importantly among public organisations and bodies.  The committee also spoke about the importance of capacity building.  There is an appreciation that if we are to respect, protect and fulfil children's rights, we need to understand what that means in terms of practice, policy, procedure and day-to-day work with and on behalf of children.  As well as the reasons our second objective under the strategy is very squarely focused on capacity building, we know from our complaints and investigations work over the years and our children's rights analysis of that work there are ongoing deficits in the awareness of children's rights including in terms of making best interest determinations when making decisions which will impact on children.  There are inconsistencies with regard to seeking and hearing the views of children and all of that boils down to deficits in knowledge and understanding.  We want to play our part in terms of trying to address that so that people are equipped with the knowledge and skills to be able to apply a children's rights based approach to their own work and decision making.  In line with our role as an ombudsman's office which focuses primarily on public bodies, we will be focusing on the public sector and relevant areas there in that respect.</p><p> Another area for the committee related to delivering commitments.  The committee was very appreciative of the legislative innovation which has taken place in recent years, including the constitutional amendment through Article 42A and also of the policy frameworks and strategies which Ireland has put in place in respect of children.  However, it was also very strong in calling for implementation and the need for human resources, financial resources and technical assistance to be given to those who have responsibility for implementing legislation and giving effect to policy frameworks.  Perhaps primarily, we will be highlighting through our complaints investigation work where there are deficits in that regard and how they might be addressed.  Very often, issues are identified through individual cases.  Finally, the committee through its recommendations has identified a strong need to focus on vulnerable groups of children and young people, many of whom the members have referenced in their questions today and who we have referenced in our responses and through the ombudsman's presentation.  Our intention is to focus some of our work on some of those most vulnerable groups in the coming years.</p></speech>

As the Ombudsman for Children was saying, we have identified three groups but it is not to the absolute exclusion of others.  It is important to emphasise that we are conscious that there are many groups of children who, for different reasons, will face barriers to the realisation of their rights and who are in very difficult circumstances.  Focusing on these three particular groups is not going to be to the exclusion of others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#K00400"><p>To take Deputy O'Sullivan up on that, she also asked about public organisations.  I have engaged with both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills to assist us with the second phase of our work on extending capacity around child-friendly administration in public services.  What we have done in our first phase has been to talk to parents and children about how they find public services and what flaws and strengths they have seen.  We now want to talk to public servants in the Departments and have received consent to that.  We are about to move that on.  From our point of view, it will be a very positive statement if we have a commitment from the Departments to work with us on moving child-friendly administration and children's rights and best interests forward in their work.  We will be moving that on as soon as possible as part of our strategic plan.  Once we have chatted with the public servants, there will be a third phase where we ask them how best we can help them to roll this out through the Departments.</p><p>We will ask if what will help them would be a questionnaire or a set of questions to ask every time a child is involved.  We often look at a complaint about a decision and see that the child was never even considered in the process.  It makes sense that if one follows the child, one will make a totally different decision.  It might be a matter of a set of questions we put up on best interests.</p><p> That brings me on to the family law courts where there is a set of eight conditions one looks at regarding what is in the best interests of a child.  We might work with the Departments as to how we would do that.  It is hard to say what it is going to look like at the end because we want to engage with them and make sure it works for them, but we are pleased that we have had a very good start from their initial agreement to work with us on it.  That is very positive.</p><p> The apology legislation is something we have been hoping to bring forward over the last couple of years.  We have decided to commit to it now through the objectives.  It ties in very clearly with the statement of the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, last year on open disclosure.  The idea here is that we find a way, as is done in Canada and a number of other countries, to apologise to the individual involved as public servants without the threat of that being used against one in court.  It is about finding the right way to do that.  From our point of view, we have so many parents where such an approach would cut it off at the pass.  An apology by its very nature acknowledges the harm or the hurt.  Those concerned do not necessarily need to go to court to get that.  The old-fashioned idea of deny and defend has to go.  It applies across many issues and it involves leadership and may require somebody taking it on.  I was pleased to see it on the agenda last year.  I do not know if it is still in play within the Department of Health but it is something we will be working on to get the best measure for it in the future.</p><p> We are starting to look at child protection and children in court and are now 12 months down the line from the point where the constitutional amendment took force.  I think it was April last year.  We are starting to look to see whether children's voices are being heard properly within court and whether it is working the way it should.  The question is whether resources are in place and how this is being done within the courts system.  It is something I have on my radar to look at.  I will hold back on saying whether it is working at this stage.  I need to look into it a little more.  It is certainly a matter we will not let slip.  It is a very important step and if we get it right, we can roll it out into other public service areas.  If we can find a way to hear children's voices properly in court and realise their best interests, it will make it easier to do that in other areas.</p><p> Both Deputies who spoke referred to digital media.  Dr. McAuley might deal with that.</p></speech>

This is an area where we are looking to the future over the next two to three years.  We are still working out our plans in regard to it.  As a first step, we are seeking to commission research on the challenges and opportunities associated with mobilising social and digital media to strengthen or advance the scope for children and young people to express their views and to have those taken into account, in particular by public decision makers and public policy makers.  Social and digital media are an integral part of children's and young people's lives.  A lot of the structures that are there for children and young people to express their views are representative structures and mechanisms.  Social and digital media potentially offer an opportunity to complement that and, in doing so, provide for a more inclusive approach where children and young people can, in an agile way, contribute individually.  We want to undertake research to understand more fully, given our appreciation that there are challenges, what are the opportunities.  We want to look at both sides of that and perhaps identify examples of good practice in other jurisdictions where this has been tried and, ideally, evaluated.  That is the first step.</p> <p>  The other area at which we are looking is where we can appropriately and effectively contribute to digital citizenship among children and young people.  That covers the broad range of children's rights, from protection rights through to their participation rights.  It is an area that many different actors are working on nationally and internationally.  Again, it is about taking the time to scope out what is the most appropriate intervention we can make in that respect.</p></speech>

As a predominately positive world, we need to find the best way to promote it and we have engaged with the Law Reform Commission on its plans for legislation to ensure children are protected in the digital world.  It is something which we will evolve as we scope it out properly in order that we can make the best possible contribution in that area.</p> <p>   I hope we have covered the issues of aftercare and staffing levels.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire also asked a question on the number of complaints from children.  I will ask Ms Ward to respond. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nuala Ward" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#M00200"><p>The most recently published figures, which are from 2014, are expressed in percentages, as they always are in annual reports.  We receive direct contact from children in 2% of cases.  We would like to increase this figure because we find it incredibly useful to hear directly from children.  When we ask the children who contact us what would be the fix for their problem, we find that they want to be assured that other children will not have the experience they had.  We hear a very powerful voice when we hear directly from children about their experience of public services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#M00300"><p>It is an obligation on our part in any case to consider hearing the voice of the child in every complaint we have.  Even though approximately 75% of all complaints come from parents, we will always consider whether it is appropriate to ask the child.  If the child is aged under two or three years, it probably would not be appropriate to do so but after that age, we will probably link in with the parents and ask whether it would be appropriate to speak to the child.  We have consistently done this with many teenagers and even younger children.  Where it is appropriate, we will speak to the child and obtain his or her point of view on a matter.</p> <p>  A figure of between 2% and 4% is the norm internationally.  We are the complainant of last resort so in theory one is asking a great deal of a child to come forward.  We may be the fourth instance to be contacted for making a complaint.  The children who contact us tend to be articulate and well-informed young people who are in care.  Their colleagues will have told them that this is the approach to take or EPIC - Empowering People in Care - who are the key workers who support people in care will have told them this is how to do it.  They tend to be aged 15, 16 or 17 years and they telephone us directly.  Thinking of my own children, I would be delighted if they had the strength to come forward, having made two complaints previously, and make a further complaint to the Ombudsman for Children.  It is a big ask, however.  As I stated, the percentage of the contacts we receive that are made by children is not far from the norm internationally. </p> <p>  The Deputy referred to child rights impact assessments and digital media.  I will return to that issue. </p> <p>  I was also asked about Tusla's 24-7 resource.  While the service Tusla is offering is inadequate, it is a start and I will engage with the agency and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure a real service is available for people who have reached a certain stage.  As the Deputy stated, what is often needed is access to a garda who can telephone a social worker who will then try to work something out.  This is not exactly what a child needs on a Saturday night when his or her mental health is poor, he or she is feeling low, his or her parents are fighting or he or she needs somewhere safe and secure to go.  This issue has been on the cards for ten years and we can predict that we will need it.  We will not need very large numbers of staff but it is an issue we need to work on and we will certainly push it forward. </p> <p>  I hope my answers on direct provision were satisfactory.  Dr. McAuley will address the issue of child rights impacts. </p></speech>

As I indicated and Deputies will be aware in any case, we will continue to provide advice in terms of developments in legislation and public policy that offer a child rights analysis.  This is a core part of the work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  One of the issues we are examining is whether we can act appropriately and effectively, that is to say, in a way that is useful to other people in terms of their understanding of children's rights and the capacity to apply child rights-based approaches, and integrate a child rights analysis or impact assessment into some of our publications.  For example, in the context of complaints and investigations, the office is looking at administrative decision making and in that respect we are guided by the Act.</p> <p>  We are commenting on administrative processes both in the context of investigating and subsequently writing up reports and statements arising from the investigation of complaints.  We are seeking to establish how we can provide more of a children's rights analysis of the issues in a way that also respects our role as a complaints handling body and an ombudsman's office in terms of the nature of the issues we investigate.  As the Deputy knows, these are administrative practices and the issue is whether they may have had an adverse effect on a child.  We are seeking to establish how we can complement this style of analysis with a children's rights analysis.  This is one of the areas we will address in the next couple of months.</p></speech>

Given that we are asking Departments to try to think in this way, we are putting ourselves on the front line by asking how the office can manage this and ensure we walk the walk as well as talk the talk.  To the best of my knowledge, we have covered most of the angles.  Has any of the issues raised by Deputies not been covered?</p></speech>

Dr. Muldoon and I have discussed in previous conversations the Ombudsman for Children's role and remit in the education sector.  I will leave that issue for another time because the Committee on Education and Skills will probably have hearings on education at some point.</p> <p>  Could legislators assist the Ombudsman for Children by extending the powers or remit of the office in legislation?  I am particularly interested in protocols.  How does Dr. Muldoon find dealing with State agencies such as Tusla?  Is this difficult?  Are the State agencies helpful and co-operative?  Does the office have a good understanding with these agencies or is the relationship characterised by challenges? </p> <p>  I am interested in Dr. Muldoon's thoughts on whether people should stay in State care until the age of 21 years.  Is that a practical solution or would it give rise to constitutional issues?  What are the facts surrounding this issue and what is Dr. Muldoon's opinion on it? </p> <p>  Has the outcome of the referendum on children's rights resulted in any tangible and marked improvements?  While I appreciate the legislation contingent on the referendum result was passed only recently, I am interested in finding out if there have been any tangible improvements for children.</p> <p>  Has the Ombudsman for Children done research on the number of children in the care of the State with a care plan?  Are figures available on the number of children with a care plan or how many have had a social worker assigned to them?  Has the office done much research on this area and does it have information in this regard?</p></speech>

One must also try to work with appropriate persons, for example, special needs assistants because what is acceptable in one setting may not be acceptable in an educational setting.  It is fantastic that a child with a disability is able to access a school but if he or she uses a wheelchair, he or she will need toilet assistance, for example, the use of a hoist.  The duty of care and child protection guidelines indicate that two people are required for this purpose.  However, there is a shortage of special needs assistants.  Does the Ombudsman for Children have an input in directing the Department of Education and Skills towards best practice?  This is an issue for parents and teachers and, most important, involves the rights of the child in question.  However, when children are young parents will be grateful to have a special needs assistant or a certain number of resource hours allocated to their child.  As a result, we are not going far enough in certain cases.</p></speech>

The issue is related to the housing strategy.  I know of one family of two adults, three teenagers and two younger children who live in a small, old two-bedroom flat.  There are probably numerous similar cases.  The lack of social housing is having a major impact because children do not have space and must often share rooms that are much too small.  Delays in extending local authority houses feed into the problem, although many of those affected are living in rented accommodation or with parents in local authority accommodation.  This is a significant issue that is not widely discussed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016072000002#N00400"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, we are consistently looking at our Act as regards where we might need a greater remit.  Obviously, the issue on which we have focused for the past year or two is direct provision.  We have been pushing very hard on this point and it is an issue we are trying to finalise.  I will get the legislation unit, which is approaching its full staffing complement, to examine the issue the Deputy raises.</p> <p>  We have a very positive interaction with Departments and public bodies, which are clear that we have a role and that they understand it.</p><p>We must say we have had difficulty at times with the speed of response by the various agencies.  Tusla is an example.  On the complaint-handling side, we have told both the Minister and Tusla that we will be highlighting this more regularly.  We will possibly be producing a quarterly publication that will highlight the various elements of the work we do on an ongoing basis.  Not every case is investigated and we do not get to publish everything so we might determine how we can highlight areas of work that we do on a more regular basis so it is known that we are working on the various elements, be they in respect of child and family services, education, housing or homelessness.  One of the points I will highlight is the length of delays between responses.  Up to now, such delays have made us look as if we have been slow.  If a parent is seeking a quick resolution at the end of a long series of complaints, it is not appropriate that we should be delayed because of the inaction of other organisations.  Generally, the organisations are very much aware of our remit and very much work with us, but some of them do have difficulty in responding quickly enough.</p><p> With regard to children staying in the care of the State until they reach 21 years, the arrangement in question is certainly one that has worked in other areas.  I cannot say we have examined it specifically ourselves but, from my point of view, the crucial point concerns how one transitions out of the care of the State.  Irrespective of the age at which one does so, the key is to get proper support when needed after the transition.  If we end up moving to an age of 21 and still end up with the same faults we now have, we will not be getting anywhere.  The key is to involve the child in the transition plan and to ensure it is produced in sufficient time, is appropriate and is fully resourced.  I cannot say I have looked at the research properly in regard to the age of 21 but I do know the key is to ensure the State supports the child properly in the transition.  I can revert to the committee with regard to research in such areas.</p><p> On the children referendum, it is quite early, as was said.  The very notion of including a reference to the best interest of the child in the Constitution is very important to us.  It means we can start to acknowledge the concept.  It is something we need to push into all other areas, as far as I am concerned.  I will be engaging with the Courts Service to ascertain what sorts of numbers have gone through but I know a number of judges have felt comfortable hearing the voices of children.  That, by its very nature, is a positive step forward.  There may be more we need to do in that regard.  We may need to upskill judges, and the courts probably need to be redesigned in certain ways to allow children&rsquo;s voices to be heard more.  We have to find out how best we can listen to children and allow families to engage.  We must also allow children the right not to speak if they do not want to do so; that is their right also.  However, the key is to ask them.</p><p> I will follow up by obtaining the numbers heard in court and the information on how the system is working.  However, the real principle is in place.  That is crucial and we need to make it work.  If it works in the court system, it can work elsewhere.  We need to show that, within the public service, we can hear the voice of the children and follow through on our obligations accordingly.</p><p> On the question on children in care with care plans, does Ms Ward have an understanding of it?</p></speech>

I am aware it has been an issue in the Child and Family Agency in recent years.  It publishes the figures regularly.</p> <p>  Needless to say, when a child is taken into care, it is very important that he or she has a dedicated social worker as his or her advocate, voice and protector.  It is a key issue for us.  Good early-care planning results in good after-care planning.  It is very important that children in care not be part of an homogenous group.  There are particularly vulnerable children in already-vulnerable situations, and there are children with disability in care.  Therefore, there has to be a child-centred, individualised approach to care planning.  This is an issue we have dealt with regularly.</p></speech>

The research highlighted seven issues we examined over the past ten years and that arose consistently.  I refer to issues such as poor record-keeping, the duplication of records, poor supervision of social workers, the lack of access to appropriate residential centres in a geographical area, and moving children out of their areas.  These issues arise consistently but we still see them featuring as we look back.  We are examining the recommendations we made and are wondering whether they have been fully implemented yet.  We are going to examine this again in the very near future.  We will be discussing that with Tusla.  We are very much aware of this.  I hope that covers the Chairman's elements.</p><p> Deputy Rabbitte referred to children with a disability.  We are very proud that we published recently the results of an investigation into the case of a young girl in Meath with a disability who could not gain access to preschool or the early school education service.  This was one of the drivers that allowed for the new systems now coming into place.  One of the new aims is to recognise that the child has the right to education and has to be supported in this regard.  Until the case in question, there was haphazard availability of special needs assistants.  It was sometimes a matter for the HSE and sometimes a matter for another organisation.  Different HSE areas would not do what I describe.  We are delighted we now see a much more secure system in place for that sort of service.</p><p> On the example the Deputy gave, we should be able to answer the question of how the best interests of a child should be resourced.  If a child needs two assistants, we need to examine whether it is required and possible and also the stages at which it can be achieved.  It is a question of focusing on the individual increasingly.  That is what we are getting to.</p><p> I have always said the system works for 80% to 85% of all people.  We need to figure out in respect of the 15% who have slightly different issues, problems, concerns and idiosyncrasies how to the support the public services to do the right thing for them.  That is what we are about.  We are not trying to beat the public services; we are trying to support them in doing what is in the best interest of the child.  The last thing we want is for somebody in a service to do the right thing only to be hammered because his or her boss says he or she has gone outside the box.  We need to create a service that allows the child to be at the centre and allows this to be the rationale for making a decision.  If in response to our asking an organisation how it accounted for the best interest of the child as part of our investigation of a complaint, that organisation states it did not provide a service to a child on having considered six criteria, it is in a much better space than it otherwise would be.</p></speech>

It requires flexibility and supporting somebody who will take a different decision.  We need to create that ethos in the system.  We need to support people from the highest level to do that.  It involves an element of risk for everybody concerned.  I hope we will get there.  We are starting to move in that direction.  Including a reference to the best interests of the child in the Constitution is a huge start in this regard.  It supports us in some way.  Within education, that is the most obvious place for that to work.  We see it all the time in schools.  It is great to see adjustments being made and flexible approaches.  Many schools are fantastic in this regard.  Others are not because they are a little less flexible.  It is the same with the decisions in all public services.  Obviously, the majority of children are in education.  There are 900,000 in the education system.  That is where the highlights are.  That is our response.</p></speech>

We all deal with cases &ndash; for example, in respect of social welfare and health and across Departments &ndash; in which the individual at the front line dealing with the family wants to do something and knows what should be done but is afraid somebody further up the line will say it cannot be done.  If we could have the appropriate culture across all Departments, it would be useful.</p></speech>

We need to figure out how those concerned are doing at present, how they can be supported, what is best in that regard and what is practical in an effort to make it a joint venture so we can get some sort of traction on it.</p> <p>  With regard to overcrowding, we are very much aware of the invisible homeless.  There is no doubt but that there is a sense that many families are couch surfing and trying to survive from day to day by living off the friendship and goodwill of family members.  This has probably remained hidden.  I hope the action plan will allow for the freeing up of new beds and new social housing builds.  That is the key to it.</p><p>One of the things I am really delighted about is the move to mixed housing estates, so that we can create a new community style housing area where the children can grow up in an estate, whether their parents bought a house or are local authority tenants.  When people live in the same space together, one is creating a strong message for children and families that society needs to operate as all one together.  That is one of the positive things that can come through that system.  We need to create the conditions for integration as opposed to previously when we would build an estate of social housing.  Integration is key.  Where integration does not happen, there is more scope for difficulties.  </p><p> I hope the increase in house building will allow overcrowding to diminish.  It will never cease completely but I hope we will build a new system.   </p></speech>

I ask members to co-operate with that request.</p> <p>  I am delighted to welcome everybody to the all-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare which is holding its first public stakeholder consultation meeting this morning.  This committee was establish by a motion of the D&aacute;il on 1 June in order to agree to an all-party ten year plan for the future of the health service; to identify a pathway towards a universal single tier health service and to achieve consensus on a new health care model based on need.  The committee will report to the D&aacute;il based on its examination of expert research, analysis of stakeholder submissions and evidence heard during its public hearings.</p> <p>  To date the committee has held four briefing sessions on a number of topics, including a factual overview of the role of the Department of Health and the organisational structures of the HSE, an overview of existing and ongoing research of relevance to the committee's terms of reference and a workshop session by Dr. Eddie Molloy on strategy design.</p> <p>  Last week the committee officially launched its public consultation exercise.  There are more details about the public submission process on the committee's Oireachtas website.  The closing date is 26 August and I would strongly encourage any interested stakeholders, patient groups, health care organisations, researchers and members of the public to make a submission to the committee using our web page.</p> <p>  I welcome representatives of the Health Reform Alliance to our meeting this morning.</p><p>The Health Reform Alliance is an umbrella group representing organisations that support patients and clients of health and social services.  We are joined by Ms<b></b>Cliona Loughnane, policy and research manager of the Irish Heart Foundation, Dr. Marita O'Brien, policy officer of Age Action and Mr. Paul Gordon, policy officer of the Irish Cancer Society.<br/><br/>I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>Ms Loughnane will lead off with an opening statement and Dr. O'Brien and Mr. Gordon will contribute to the questions and answers session with members.</p></speech>

We wish the committee the best of luck in the challenging task ahead, but we believe the potential exists for a really rewarding and fruitful exercise.  Let us go back in time to July 1948, when a leaflet emblazoned with the title &lsquo;The New National Health Service&rsquo; was dropped into letter boxes across the U.K..  It stated:</p><blockquote><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Your new National Health Service begins on the 5</font></i><i><sup><font color="#2F2F2F">th</font></sup></i><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> July.  It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care.  Everyone - rich or poor, man, woman or child - can use it or any part of it.  There are no charges, except for a few special items.  There are no insurance qualifications.  But it is not &lsquo;charity&rsquo;.  You are all paying for it, mainly as taxpayers and it will relieve your money worries in times of illness.</font></i></blockquote> <p>The Health Reform Alliance see this committee as the crucial next step in the development of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system as a universal system by 2026.  We all dream of a similar leaflet drop or e-mail being sent to every member of the public in Ireland ten years from now.<br/><br/>This committee - with a remit to support the Oireachtas adopting a ten year plan for health care - has an important task.  The committee will be watched closely and supported by people who use the health and social care system.<br/><br/>Let me introduce our alliance, summarise the problems we see, and focus on three solutions which we hope the committee could use as they progress with the work.<br/><br/>Lone voices representing particular patient groups, as all of our organisations do, are often sidelined in the debate about health reform.  Reflecting this, the Health Reform Alliance, HRA, was established as a small group of organisations in 2014 with shared concerns about the health service.  The current members of the HRA are the Adelaide Health Foundation, Age Action, the Asthma Society of Ireland, Irish Cancer Society, Irish Heart Foundation and Samaritans.  We shared a common belief that reform was needed to create a more equitable system.  Our main purpose was to develop consensus on the values we believe should underpin reform and to advocate for the policies, systems and services that could best deliver on those principles.<br/><br/>We launched our charter of five principles in January 2016.  A copy of the charter has been circulated to all members.  We held a consultation event in May which led to more than 30 organisations seeking to join the alliance.  We are growing our membership at present.  We hope to be a force for change in the system. <br/><br/>The alliance believes that the main problem, which has been identified in the remit of the committee, is that the Irish health system unlike most health systems across Europe, has not developed as a system offering universal access to health care.  Our system is regrettably unique.  It is a tax based system that fails to provide universal access and which has significant user charges for certain elements of the service.</p><p>Without wishing to rehash common complaints about the system that one hears on the airwaves regularly, it is important to discuss why our organisations felt compelled to come together on the issue of health reform.  As patient organisations, our organisations hear from people facing difficulties accessing the care they need.  We support people who cannot access a hospital bed or a homecare worker; who are subject to different eligibility criteria depending on their location; who are &lsquo;too late&rsquo; to access nursing home care subject to a yearly budget cap; and families who are forced to navigate the very difficult situation between hospital and community care.  We are acutely aware of how the confusing mix of public and private health care creates problems for people who are treated differently whether they have insurance or a medical card.  Conversely, in the social care system, people without a medical card seeking respite, can be refused because they are so-called private patients.  Clearly, the system is not suited to meeting the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup>century.  Yet, at the same time we recognise that good care still happens.  People will talk about a nurse who took additional time to comfort them, or a GP who showed real skill and compassion in dealing with their case.  These too are real experiences of the health service.  Yet, unfortunately they are diminishing in comparison to tales of consultant appointment waiting times, people waiting for a potentially life-changing diagnosis, spiralling health insurance costs and emergency department overcrowding.  That is a summary of the problems.<br/><br/><b></b>The committee is here to talk about solutions.  We propose three solutions which could be effected through the committee&rsquo;s approach to developing a ten year plan.  These would help to achieve our charter principles creating a system which treats everyone equally, taking account of specific needs; provides clear entitlements; integrates care; and is underpinned by a universal, publicly funded system. <br/><br/>We urge the committee to focus on the outcome to be achieved - that is the healthcare system to be delivered by 2026.  To date, much time has been taken up with funding models, comparing one country against another.  Much less time has been given to what should be the primary concern, namely what we expect the healthcare system to deliver.  It seems to put the cart before the horse to talk about how to pay for a system before we decide what we are paying for.  The role of this committee is to plan for &lsquo;a universal single tier service&rsquo;.  By achieving this goal people will be liberated from the two tier system.  The first step must be a clear definition of what universality means in the Irish system.  A universal system would require a commitment by all to pay into the system so that we can receive equal care for equal need.  While we will not be able to provide all forms of care to all people, whatever care is available should be available equitably and without discrimination.  Such a system &ndash; organised through the funding model that is decided  &ndash; must share the burden of illness collectively, where healthy people subsidise the sick and high income earners subsidise low earners. <br/><br/>Delivering a universal system within a decade is certainly a challenge for legislators and policy makers.  We believe sustained commitment and backing of this vision over that period will require a clearly communicable vision which energises supporters.  There are so many supporter across the country who want the ten year plan to succeed.  This clearly communicable vision can make it difficult for vested interests, who may not wish to see a strong public health system and make it difficult for them to subvert or derail the plan.<br/><br/>Second, we propose the committee would design a vision for a health and social care system.  The experiences of the people we represent indicate the deep interconnection between health and social care.  Need for medical care or personal care cannot be clearly divided in the lived experience of being unwell, yet policy up to now has dealt with health and social care needs differently.  While health need is to some extent dealt with in the public system, social care is primarily viewed as an individual responsibility subject to heavy means-testing.  This reflects a poor law view of social care as &lsquo;charity&rsquo; for the destitute.  The lack of designated funding for social care forces many families to place a loved one in residential care prematurely, when home help, day-care or respite care could have helped to keep their loved one at home.  Consequently, vital social care services are increasingly available only to those with the highest needs and lowest incomes, rather than as a universal service supporting the whole population to be well. <br/><br/>Third, we believe the ten year plan should focus on the public system and should pragmatically deal with the system as it currently exists - primarily a tax funded system.</p><p>Taxes paid for 77% of health expenditure in 2013 and yet, in our primarily tax-funded health system, people with private health insurance have quicker access to health care than their fellow taxpayers without insurance.  Policy debates often emphasise the lack of private health insurance as the problem within our system.  This appears to overlook the fact that the vast majority of spending on health care comes from taxation with insurance covering less than 10% of health costs.  Furthermore, it is likely the reason many people hold health insurance is they do not believe they will receive adequate health care without it and so we urge the committee to focus its attention on the tax-funded public system.</p><p> The alliance believes that discussing, arguing if necessary and then reaching consensus on a vision for 2026 is the most important task this committee can achieve, after which will start the hard work of implementing and achieving that vision. The alliance, however, urges members to take heart because as Aneurin Bevan, the architect of the NHS in Britain, stated: "The NHS will last as long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it."</p></speech>

Briefly, while everyone present probably is in agreement about how we should strive to achieve a universal health care model in the years ahead, the difficult parts will be the stepping stones to get there.  It probably is fairly easy to reach broad consensus on the vision but the difficulty will be in trying to implement it in terms of policy, legislative underpinning and funding over the next number of years.  In that context, Ms Loughnane referred to taxation being the main funding base for the public health system and then referred to how private health insurance only accounts for 10% of it.  In that context, how does she envisage moving over time to a publicly-funded taxation-based model with universality at its core?  Moreover, if one extrapolates on all the current intertwinings of the private health insurance and health care providers, even down to consultants' contracts and so on, how does she perceive its unwinding over time, essentially to push private health care completely out of the public system?</p></speech>

I have two broad but brief questions.  Does the alliance envisage a role for private health care in some shape or form in a new model?  As some people may choose that as their preference, does Ms Loughnane perceive that to be something we should include in our strategy?  Second, does Ms Loughnane believe the HSE structure as it stands at present is capable of delivering what she set out in her presentation?</p></speech>

One main point she raised was the need to focus on the outcome, as opposed to the funding model, and she stated that focusing on funding is putting the cart before the horse.  Committee members fear and wish to avoid producing another report that sits on a shelf because they have not taken cognisance of how the model will be funded.  While it is important to lay out a vision as to where we are going over the next ten years, from my perspective we must be cognisant of how we will fund that vision at different points along that ten-year period and beyond.  Ms Loughnane made reference to Aneurin Bevan, the Labour Party Minister in the United Kingdom, and when one considers the public system in which universal health care is available, is there evidence within that universal system of a move away from private health care?  On the point that public care expenditure accounted for 77% of health spending in 2013, does private insurance account for the majority of the remaining expenditure on health care?</p></speech>

The figure of 77% for taxation funding of the health service comes from the recent ESRI report on universal health insurance, UHI.  It is based on 2013 figures and states that 9% comes from private health insurance.  That is the reason I indicated that less than 10% comes from private health insurance.  The other 12% comes primarily from out-of-pocket payments.  This, for example, involves people paying upfront for their general practitioner, GP.</p></speech>

In the Health Reform Alliance, as Deputy Naughton mentioned, we are focused on the outcome.  All we really care about in this process is that the quality of care for patients is maintained and then improved and that the outcomes for patients are better.  We would not claim to be the experts as to how we get to that system, we are really focused on patient outcomes.  As for the reason we are talking about the tax-funded system, it is based on not developing a system from nothing.  We must work with the historical system we have inherited and the evidence shows that our system is really a tax-funded system.  Moreover, until we can show that disrupting this system or moving to a completely different model would be more effective, it seems that the pragmatic approach is to work with the system we have and see how we can improve it.  In its recent report, the ESRI also made the point that it is pragmatic, particularly in primary care, to consider how one can extend out tax-funded access to universal access to primary care, because that is how it is going at present in the increased provision of medical cards for different ages and medical needs and so on.  Consequently, the reason we are talking about the tax-funded system is it seems that we have inherited a certain system within which we should work.  In addition, I am sure members have heard evidence from health economists that tax-funded systems tend to be much more efficient.  They tend to be less costly because of their nature.  One is pooling together all the funds and there are economies of scale.  One is not obliged to account for the cost of competition, for marketing between different health insurers and so on.  The evidence appears to lead us towards a taxation-funded model or a social health insurance model if we are talking about an efficient, affordable system.</p> <p>  As for private health insurance, we all accept there always is a role for private health insurance and probably always will be.  I do not believe there is any system in the world that does not have some level of private health insurance.  The Irish system is particularly unusual because upwards of 40% of people hold private health insurance at present but as I stated, its actual contribution in paying into the system is quite limited.  When one looks at how a person benefits from private health insurance, one really is getting early access to a consultant, as well as access to diagnostics, that then allow one to access the public health system.  Again, this is a unique aspect of the Irish system.  In other systems, if one had private health insurance, one more than likely would be treated by a private consultant in a private hospital.  However, within the system we have, one has private health insurance but actually is treated by somebody in a public hospital on a public contract who is using the portion of his or her contract that is for private health insurance.  It is an agreed part of our system but it is highly unusual.  The Health Reform Alliance certainly would not state that we do not envisage any role for private health insurance.  It is a choice that people will make.  It simply appears that in Ireland, a great number of people seem to be making that choice because they have difficulty accessing the public hospital system.</p> <p>  There was a question on whether, as one moves towards universal provision, a move away from private health insurance can be discerned and that certainly is the case.  As I stated, the level of private health insurance in Ireland is highly unusual.  I am not entirely sure of the figures in the United Kingdom but I think fewer than 10% of people hold private health insurance, which indicates that because they can get access to the service, there is not the same level of requirement.  Again, within the NHS it is split into two systems, whereas in Ireland we have a layering together of the two systems.  There was another question about the HSE, its structure and whether that is capable of providing a universal service.  That is a very broad question.  We were talking outside earlier about some of the real gains that have been made by the HSE in recent years, particularly in the clinical care programmes and in respect of models of care.</p><p>The Irish Heart Foundation is particularly interested in stroke.  There have been real developments in how stroke patients are being cared for, particularly in the acute service.  The HSE definitely has the potential to provide care of a good quality.  It is a question of how we can improve the structure we have in Ireland.  There are different types of tax-funded systems.  We have a single provider of care - the HSE - in Ireland.  There are multiple providers in the UK as a result of the system that was introduced there in the 1990s.  Even if we decide to focus on a tax-funded system, we will have to consider the various ways of providing for that.  As has been said, a number of decisions have to be made along the way.</p></speech>

The barriers to integration include the separate funding streams that exist at the moment.  The HSE funding is divided into separate streams.  Each section is very protective of its budget.  For that reason, it is very hard to make changes in the social care system.  We have never developed assisted living or anything like that because of the way the budgets are streamed within the wider Department and the HSE, which are very much focused on health.  In other countries, there is more local authority involvement on the ground.  The integrated care model envisages that health and social care should be integrated in a wider sense in communities.  There tends to be a great deal of segregation in Ireland.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has its budget and the Department of Health has its budget.  At the moment, there are separate budgets.  If a new funding system with moneys from each Department were to be developed, there could be more integration.  That would allow people to develop.  The suggestion at the moment is that having differentiated budgets is a barrier to integration.  It would be preferable if the HSE could have more integration within its budgets.  The acute care system uses up much of our funding.  Primary care and social care tend to come further down the line.  If there was a way of working to avoid the hierarchy that exists at present, that would help as well.</p></speech>

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government can build houses for older people or people with disabilities, but it does not want to take on the provision of services because that would have to come out of its budget.  It needs to be helped if it is going to be involved in providing that budget.  At the same time, the Department of Health cannot commit to a certain level of funding unless it has details of the assessed needs of those who are going to be using these houses.  Perhaps the additional integration that is needed can be facilitated by establishing a budget system in which each Department commits to provide a certain proportion of the money needed to support a person's living and health care needs.  Maybe we could put them together to further promote that kind of approach.</p></speech>

If people do not have budgets, that can delay discharge from hospital.  People in some parts of the country are not put on the list until that point.  As a result, the waiting lists really do not reflect people's needs.  Someone at the sixth or seventh point on the scale is recorded as waiting.  A hospital patient who needs some adaptation will not get it in time, so he or she will go to a nursing home.  Those kinds of issues can arise.</p></speech>

I think there will always be a role for private insurers.  People will always want that option.  We need to build confidence in the public health system so that there is less reliance on private insurance.  Our hope is that ten, 15 or 20 years from now, people will feel they can have confidence and pride in the public system and do not necessarily need to take out private health insurance to jump the queue.</p></speech>

Given that 77% of the budget is tax-funded, it is obvious that there is a high level of subsidisation of private patients in this country.  Would that be very unusual in other countries?  It has been mentioned that approximately 10% of people in the United Kingdom have health insurance.  Is it entirely private or is there any element of public subsidisation?</p></speech>

There may be an element of public subsidisation.  The manner in which Ireland subsidises private health insurance is very unusual by international standards.  There are the usual semantics when people talk about subsidies, but it is really a cost to the system.  The <i>sui generis</i>way our system has developed is quite unusual, as is the way subsidies have increased over time in line with the increase in the number of people who hold private health insurance.  That meshing of the two systems is particular to Ireland.</p></speech>

I have a few questions about the current structure, such as it is.  I am reminded of the saying that if we want to get there, we should not start from here.  Of course, we are where we are.  Do the delegates believe the Department of Health or the HSE should be the greatest driver of the introduction of universal health care?  Do they think the Department and the HSE should work closely together or should they be further apart if they are to achieve the changes necessary?  We can all identify the problems.  We can see them.  I welcome the suggestion that we should focus on the outcome rather than the issue.  It is important to follow that point by saying we need to focus on the need to achieve value for money when we are spending taxpayers' money.  I would be interested to hear the views of the delegates on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  My personal view is that because it involves spending taxpayers' money in the private sector, it is almost more counter-productive for the public health service than private health insurance providers.  It is like changing from driving on the right-hand side of the road to driving on the left-hand side.  It cannot be done gradually; it must be done all at once.  Do the delegates believe there is a point at which the leaflets will start to drop, or do they see it as a more gradual process?  I would specifically like to hear their views on the National Treatment Purchase Fund and achieving value for taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

There is general consensus that moving more services to primary and community care settings is the way to go.  As people come before the committee, we are hearing that primary care is the pillar on which the health service will change.  A great deal of unnecessary work is being put into hospital medicine.  I refer to chronic illness cases, for example, which do not need to be treated in a hospital setting.  The other side is that a great deal of necessary work is not being done in hospitals because of a lack of access to diagnostics.  There is a difficulty in integrating primary and secondary care services.  There is a difficulty with communications between primary and secondary care services.  All of these problems lead to increased and unnecessary costs.  There is a lack of capacity in the public system.  There is a lot of wastage in the public system because of the lack of integration and communication.</p> <p>  Many areas of the HSE work very well.  Certainly, cardiology services have improved beyond all measure.  Colonoscopy services in my local area have improved dramatically in recent years, although I accept that this improvement may not be universal.  Breast cancer and other services have also improved dramatically in recent years, in many cases on foot of adverse incidents that led to momentum for change.  However, as somebody said earlier, the general system is not fit for the 21st century.  I think many costs could be saved through integration and improved communication.  We are tending towards bolstering primary care services.  I would like to get the delegates' views.  I agree with Deputy Joe O'Reilly that using the National Treatment Purchase Fund is like putting the cart before the horse or a band-aid on a problem.  If the money was being put into the public service, it would prevent people from having to access the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I would like to hear the views of the delegates on how we could transfer services to the primary care model.</p></speech>

I am keen to pick up on the point she made about tax-funded systems being more economical.  There is probably a perception that a tax-funded system based on taxes paid by the general public for the purposes of a more egalitarian system probably costs more.  It was interesting to hear from experts who believe it would cost less.  Ms Loughnane painted some broad strokes in respect of how it might cost less or how it actually costs less in practice.  She gave the example of economies of scale and less competition within the system.  I am unsure whether the members of the deputation would need to consider the issue before sending in material, but is it possible for them to go into that in a little more detail?  Could they set out the broad strokes, how it plays out and the nature of those savings?  I am keen to hear a little on that.</p> <p>  My other question relates to moving in the direction of the tax-funded system and a public health system in this country.  What are the issues posed by where we are now?  In particular, I have in mind the issues with where we stand regarding church and State within the health service in terms of ownership of hospitals and boards of hospitals.  How great an issue is that?  How does the deputation envisage this playing out in terms of moving towards a tax-funded, publicly-run system?</p></speech>

I agree with many of the points Deputy O'Reilly made on the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  The Irish Cancer Society has done a good deal of work around waiting times for colonoscopy procedures.  We have found that the use of the NTPF is effective in the short term.  However, it is expensive and I am unsure how sustainable it is.  Probably, it asserts the primacy of the private system over the public system in terms of access to diagnostics.  At present, it is a useful tool in reducing waiting times.  However, there are ways to improve the system, for example, through better linkages within hospital groups.  Certain hospitals have huge colonoscopy suites and only five or ten people on their waiting lists, while other hospitals in the same group might have large waiting lists and large numbers of people waiting over three months.  There does not appear to be joined-up thinking.  This has improved in recent months, with a clinical lead appointed to head the national endoscope working group.  We hope that will improve matters.  On the whole, there are other ways of improving access to diagnostics.</p> <p>  This links to Deputy Harty's point.  There have been improvements in colonoscopy services but up to 46% of people are currently waiting over three months.  The HSE guideline is that 100% of people should be seen within three months.  That is significant.  The NTPF initiative has worked, but only for a period of one or two months.  There must be sustained investment and I am unsure whether it is affordable.</p> <p>  The question on primary and community care is apposite, especially in the context of the work of this committee.  We are facing into a chronic disease crisis and a cancer crisis - I am not being flippant in saying as much.  Cancer incidence will increase by 50% over the figure for 2010.  Chronic disease accounts for approximately 78% of all deaths or mortality in the country.  We know that 80% of chronic diseases are preventable and that 40% of cancers are preventable.</p><p>Certain measures help, such as investment in programmes like Healthy Ireland and other health promotion initiatives.  Often, these measures require targeted intervention in disadvantaged communities, where the rate of chronic disease is far higher than in the rest of the population.  I hope I have covered those points.</p></speech>

There was also a question about when the leaflet drop would happen in Ireland.  From our perspective, it has been positive to see the remit of this committee include consideration of a universal single tier system.  It is a major development in the Irish health policy sector to strive for that position.  Until recently, it was seen as a partisan approach to be interested in universal access to health care.  We have come a long way already in that there seems be cross-party support for the idea of a universal care system.  We are far closer to a leaflet drop than we have ever been in the past.<br/><br/>There was a question about coming up with a vision.  It seems to be for the Oireachtas to come up with a vision and then it is to be implemented through the Department of Health and the HSE.  Obviously, the Department of Health and the HSE would have a major impact on how that vision is constructed because they are experts in the delivery of care and policy.  <i>Ad hoc</i>policies are emerging all the time throughout the system.  There was a news story today about access to medical cards for people in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  That seems like a good development but all those developments are taking place without a vision.  Therefore, the quicker we can have a vision, the quicker we can commit to what we mean by &quot;universal&quot; in the system.  We believe this is what the committee needs to take by the horns.  It needs to define what we mean by a universal system, what is in and what is out, who is covered and so on.  While there is cross-party commitment to universality, what do we mean by universality in the Irish system?<br/><br/>Deputy Harty began a conversation around moving to primary care and integration between services.  I imagine committee members will hear this from almost everyone who comes before the committee.  That seems to be the solution to many of the issues we have at the moment.  As Mr. Gordon noted, one of the main reasons for this is that disease in the 21st century is chronic disease and multi-morbidity is a feature.  The system we have is not really set up to care for people in that way.  In the 19th or 20th century if a person was lucky enough to get in to hospital, she would have been in hospital for a short period and the come out better, all going well.  Instead, now people are living with disease for long periods and they need to be maintained and managed in the community.<br/><br/>Dr. O'Brien pointed out that our budgets are not really set out to cater for that.  We have acute hospital budgets and primary care budgets as well as limited social care budgets.  We need far more integration of budgets.  As Dr. O'Brien said, often the way funding is available will influence how care is delivered.  Integration across budgets seems to be a sensible way to do that.<br/><br/>As we outlined in our opening statement, we are keen for the committee to consider the health system in the round.  The health system includes home help and the factors that keep people well in the community.  There have been <i>ad hoc</i>developments, for example, the fair deal scheme.  That has been useful to help people get in to nursing homes.  However, it seems to have prioritised nursing home care over people getting the support they need to live at home.  We need to think about health and social care together, because in the 21st century, health is often related to social care.<br/><br/>Deputy Harty referred to improvements in the HSE and health care delivery.  As Mr. Gordon said, sometimes we see improvements in one area only to see problems in other areas.  Certainly we accept that moving to the centres of excellence and the development of the models of care across different chronic diseases are appropriate.  We are seeing positive developments but they are not available throughout the country.  That is the issue.</p><p>A stroke survivor living, for example, in north Dublin does not receive the same service as a similar survivor living in Cork.  Given that we are moving towards universality in the system, one would expect people to be able to access the same services across the country.</p><p> On Deputy Mick Barry's questions about the tax-funded system, I could give him the broad brush stroke answers in terms of economies of scale and the lack of competition.  We could also submit considerable evidence from different countries, including the Scandinavian countries which have tax-funded systems and the United Kingdom.  We recognise that there are other ways to provide a universal system.  For example, social health insurance is another model in which funds are pooled.  It appears to be less expensive than private health insurance delivered models.  It is said, with respect to taxation-funded models, that social health insurance models can have higher administration costs attached to them and so on, but there is a good deal of evidence that we could provide for the committee.  </p><p> The ESRI has been charged with undertaking research projects to examine the different models and costings.  I am not sure how its timelines meet the committee's, but any evidence the committee could obtain from that process would be very useful.  As we discussed, the Irish system is unique.  Therefore, evidence from other counties would be useful to a point, but we also have to deal with the situation in Ireland.</p><p> I did not expect to be asked a question on the issue of church and State with respect to health reform, but it is an interesting one.  In preparing for the meeting and trying to figure out why the Irish system was so unique, one point that popped up was that we seemed to move away from our European neighbours in developing a universal system in 1951 with the introduction of the mother and child scheme.  There was controversy in the development of the health system and we have moved along a different path from that followed in other countries, but this is not an issue that has come up in our discussions.  The issue of hospital ownership by the church is not one we have faced.  It does not appear to be an issue from our point of view and it is not something we have considered.</p></speech>

We found that one problem was communication after a diagnosis.  Approximately 30% of doctors said there was very little communication with consultants afterwards.  That is problematic in managing chronic illnesses.  As a general practitioner, the Deputy knows that there are certain low level solutions to certain problems.  There is a large health literacy problem among the population.  GPs and consultants tend to underestimate the level of people's health literacy.  Approximately 40% of the population encounter such difficulties.</p> <p>  Another issue in the system concerns access to GPs.  There is not only an issue with access to diagnostics.  In Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall's constituency, for example, there might be pockets where there would be only one GP for every 2,500 people, whereas in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where I live there might be one GP for every 1,600 people.  There is a need to provide a certain incentive for GPs to move into deprived areas because not only are there fewer GPs in them but also people living in the most deprived areas present with more comorbities.  There are more complex cases and because of the pressure exerted on GPs in these areas, they get to spend less time with patients who need more time.</p></speech>

The Health Research Board produced an interesting report on the integration of health and social care services.  It examined different ways of providing for a more integrated approach, especially in health and social care services.  It gave good examples of measures such as capitation.  If capitation was provided for local populations in primary care centres, they would have to manage people's health from the cradle to the grave.  Therefore, they would be incentivised to take prevention measures into account, intervene earlier rather than wait until crisis point was reached when people would end up having to enter the acute care system.</p><p>It is a more locally developed approach at a local area level, a population based health model but with a local based approach to it.  There are some examples of that in Australia.</p><p> There is reference in the report to the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, a not-for-profit group in the US, that take this type of approach and it seems to have very good outcomes on evaluation.  There are a few different examples given in that report.  Taking that approach, it must be based at a community level because, as Mr. Paul Gordon pointed out, different communities have different needs.  In a disadvantaged area, the approach would have to be at a community level and account would have to be taken of providing for the particular needs of the population.</p></speech>

That is the massive challenge we have.  There is a need for us to be realistic about what we can achieve.  We will have to set out a framework, give guidance and point in a certain direction as regards a plan for the next ten years or more.  There is also a need for consistency in political thought  and direction, which we probably have not had for many decades.  We spoke earlier about the fact that there is  a kind of consensus on the need for some form of universal solution or plan.  When we talk about universality, what does that mean to the witnesses as regards the type of services that would be available under a plan that we would direct and put forward, that would be realistic, meet expectations and be optimum?</p></speech>

The National Treatment Purchase Fund is a symptom of the crisis.  It is like putting homeless families into hotels and paying a huge amount of money to deal with the issue.  For the last number of years, we have seen the HSE, for example, in the case of children with scoliosis send them to hospitals in Britain to get the surgery they require.  That is one of the problems we have to examine as part of our consideration of a universal health plan.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about acute care, primary care and social care.  Social care provision is probably crucial, particularly with the demographics of our ageing population and older people needing care.  It is expected there will be an increase in the demand for such care.  I have had experience of a person being in hospital who could not be released unless they went into a nursing home or into a home-care situation.  All that has to be arranged beforehand with the social worker dealing with the patient and it takes a period of time for the person to be released as they go to a step-down facility and from there to the home-care situation.  It is a matter of linking all that together.  As was mentioned, we need to ask what are the outcomes and to work back from that and say what is needed to work around it.</p> <p>  Another major problem will be the issue of consultants and other groups that have a vested interest in private health insurance.  We as a committee have to present a model that people buy into and say that is the type of health service that we need and want and then we would move people into that.  That will be the big task for us.  Then there is the follow-up to that as regards the amount of money needed to pay for it.  I would like to get the views of the witnesses on that.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the National Treatment Purchase Fund being a symptom of a malaise in the public health system and that it is an expensive way of doing its business.</p><p>I do not know whether that is the case, because we do not know how much it costs, for example, to do a colonoscopy in the public system.  How much does every individual procedure and diagnostic cost?  I do not think we can compare until we have an analysis of the costs for these treatments in the public health system <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the cost in the private health system.<br/><br/>The other issue about private health insurance is that while it only contributes 9% to the public health system in terms of income, it contributes much more by the fact that those with private health insurance are not depending on the public health system.  We have to keep things in perspective if we are to reach a conclusion.  How many people are treated in the private health system who would otherwise be in the public health system if they did not have private health insurance?  There is no doubt that if the public health system is under pressure as it is, carrying out all those additional treatments and diagnostics in the public health system would probably cause it to collapse.<br/><br/>The challenge we have to face is how, over a period of time, we can get to a situation where we can extrapolate the interconnectedness of the two systems so that we have a stand-alone public health system.  The success of a public health system would be the fact that people would feel no need for private health insurance.  The UK has the National Health Service and I detect a slow, incremental increase in private health insurance there over the last number of years because of the pressures the system is under.  In a taxation-based model, the public health system is dependent on the public purse.  When there is a squeeze, the whole thing comes under huge pressure.  We will have to look at how we can ensure a certain level of ring-fencing in critical areas over a period of time.<br/><br/>In terms of a public health system and GPs, we all talk about primary care and we have a primary care strategy.  Ms Loughnane spoke about 1988.  Rory O'Hanlon was appointed Minister in 1988 and at the time he spoke about primary care being the bulwark for developing our health care system.  This was in 1988.  We are a long way away in terms of years, but not in terms of progress.  The key issue in all of that is GP-led services in the community.  What are the view of the witnesses on GPs being employed directly by the public health system, as opposed to the contractual arrangement we have?  Due to the difficulties we have in attracting GPs into particular areas, there is going to be a certain amount of cherry-picking.  It is a proven fact that in key areas where there are bigger socioeconomic problems there are also poorer health outcomes.  That is where we need more GPs, not fewer.  Regarding employment and contracts, where do the witnesses see the role of GPs being directly employed by the HSE?</p></speech>

That does not necessarily mean universal access to primary care.  There are three or four different types of medical cards now, all of which give people free access to their GP, but they will end up paying for their drugs and may not have access to other services like nursing, physiotherapy and dental services.  There is a broad range in regard to the description of primary care.</p> <p>  In respect of salaried GPs, moves are being made in the inner city, where a group called Safetynet is providing GP services.  It is actually a GP training scheme, where GPs are hand-picked to train in the inner city.  They will work in the inner city, in areas where there might be one GP for every 2,500 people, as opposed to one for every 1,600.  These are areas where one can innovate and can handpick GPs who want to work there.  In the same way, there are GPs who want to work in a rural area.  There need to be supports for all those types of GPs and general practices.</p> <p>  The move to free GP care is not exactly what it says on the tin.  Yes, one gets to see one's GP for free, but there are restrictions.</p></speech>

Not all private care is being provided in private locations and by private operators.  It is about the mixing of the two.  Often people are getting access to diagnostics through their private health insurance and then they are getting onto a waiting list to which other public patients who are waiting for diagnostics are not gaining access.  It is more complicated than in other countries, where private insurance entitles one to private care in a private location.  It is important for us to try to figure out how we can address that issue.<br/><br/>In terms of making the public health system more attractive, Mr. Gordon will talk to us about Deputy Kelly's question on what we are talking about when we refer to universal care.  In terms of making it more attractive, there is the ten-year vision, but there is also the question of how we maintain the system as we work towards the that vision.  I wonder whether there is an opportunity for this committee to make some recommendations about that.  There are issues around maintaining the health budget and getting it back to where it was in the 2008 period.  There are certain recommendations like that regarding a real focus on certain waiting lists within the public system, for example.  Again, as we are so interested in patient outcome and patient quality of care, resourcing of the regulation within the system is something that will need to happen.  As has been pointed out, we need to recommend resourcing of primary care.  There has been an agreement in respect of primary care for a long time, but the resources have not been going that way.  In terms of the committee's work, there might be the potential to make some kind of stopgap<font color="#FF0000"> </font>recommendations as well as the vision recommendations.  I was going to make the point Deputy Shortall made that we may be about to see salaried GPs in the system for the first time.  It seems to make a lot of sense to have salaried GPs.  In other systems where there are salaried GPs, those GPs can be incentivised and involved in health and well-being.  It makes more sense within a system such as that.  It seems to have many potential benefits.<br/><br/>There has been some conversation about the NHS.  I agree there have been many changes to the NHS since it was established in 1948.  The Health Reform Alliance is not saying that what Ireland needs is an Irish NHS.  It was just being used as an example of where a vision was articulated and actually came to fruition.  One thing that can be said about the NHS, no matter what changes have happened, is that there is still a commitment to universal access to care that is free at the point of access.  That is what we are talking about.  As Mr. Gordon will say, we have to ask what the care we are talking about is.  The NHS can be commended for that at least.<br/><br/>If one looks at Irish patients in the Republic compared to their counterparts in Northern Ireland, one can see the difference between having access to that kind of care free at the point of access and not having it.  There was a study in 2007 which looked at people who were ill but who did not go to their GPs.  In Ireland, 20% of patients said they had been ill in the previous year but had not gone to their GPs, whereas in Northern Ireland the figure was less than 2%.  This just shows that where care is free at the point of access, particularly that kind of lower-level care, which is the care we really want people to be able to access to stop them getting to the high level care, it does make a difference.  The mention of the NHS is illustrative rather than anything more than that.</p></speech>

We also need to consider what services are already covered, the quality of these services and what else will fall into that category.  Finally, we need to look at what out-of-pocket payment costs will remain and how far that will extend.  With that there is a need to acknowledge that it is not just about ensuring a package of health services but also ensuring a progressive expansion of those services when funding is available.  The World Health Organization's guidelines on universal health care, while similar in wording to our Health Act 1970, are a little broader and less conditional.  There is also a need to protect those at greatest risk.  For example, in the six or seven years following the economic downturn, people were paying an extra &euro;100 a year per person on medical care and prescriptions.</p><p>Out-of-pocket payments rose by approximately &euro;600 million between 2008 and 2014.  There are people who face what are described as catastrophic out-of-pocket payments, which means they forego regular staple goods or services to pay for medication.  We know, as do Deputies from individuals coming to their constituency offices, that people face a decision between paying a prescription charge or buying food for themselves or their families.</p><p> From our perspective, there needs to be a continuum of care.  This is a multifaceted structure, which involves health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, palliative care and an integrated social care model.</p></speech>

This is one way to define what one wants from a universal system in the context of what and who will be covered.  One approach the committee could take would be to examine what would be included in a health care basket.  This has some benefits.  It could consider how long people would be covered for rehabilitation and what out of pocket payments, if any, would be made.</p> <p>  There are other ways to do it.  The UK has clinical guidelines developed by NICE, which decides the clinical outcome that should be achieved and the health trust then decides whether it can provide a particular treatment based on whether it meets the clinical guidelines.</p></speech>

It is a group that develops the models of care for different diseases.  For example, it has a clinical standard for heart failure.  Based on what it states should be achieved for patients with heart failure, those responsible for the budget in the NHS can decide whether these services are covered.</p> <p>  As discussed, the health care needs of a people change, based on the population and medical developments.  If a health basket were established it would need to be updated on a regular basis.  The Netherlands, which has a health basket system, has an annual consultation to discuss what should be removed or included.

In 2017 we will have 20,000 more people who are aged 65 and over.  Some 2,500 are in the older age group of 85 years and over but our home help budget for older people, which was &euro;211 million in 2008, has decreased to &euro;192 million.  We have 30% more people in the over 65 group.  The funding has dropped by 30% since 2008 but the population has increased by 30%, so one could say there is a 60% deficit.</p> <p>  Small interventions can make such a difference to people.  A project on older people funded by the UK Department of Health found that every &pound;1 spent on low-level interventions for older people gained an extra &pound;1.20 for the acute care budget.  Here we seem to crisis manage.  It appears that when things come to a crisis, such as someone going to hospital, it is then that we start to look at what will happen to the person because he or she cannot go home and needs support.  A total of 60% of the older people's budget goes on the nursing home support scheme and only 30% goes to services in the community.</p><p>This shows the bias.  The policy is to support people to age at home but the budget follows residential care.  This is because the nursing home support scheme is legislatively underpinned and a statutory process is in place.  It is very transparent and easy to apply for and, as has been stated, it is easier to move people from an acute hospital because the process is quite easy.  It takes much longer for those seeking home care packages or home adaptations.  We incentivise people to move to a more costly outcome than is needed.</p><p> I often notice the discourse about older people and, in the context of emergency departments, people wonder about nursing home beds.  Very rarely do people wonder about community care for these people, although it has been mentioned over the past year.  We seem to have a way of thinking and this needs to be changed.  Perhaps that is something the committee could examine.</p><p> The care could be strength-based rather than deficit-based in nature, and Ms Loughnane has referred to this.  This means looking at people's strengths and how they can be supported at a lower level.  Someone could be given home help for four or five hours, which people do not get at present.  People may get home care packages but not home help in many areas.</p><p> Deputy Harty made an important point on innovation.  We must be innovative.  We cannot just think this is how we do things.  We must think of different ways of doing things.  We could examine the salaries of GPs who are in disadvantaged areas.  They could be trained to work in such areas so they understand the wider circumstances.  This type of localised approach would be much more cost-effective and generally more effective in the long term than having an overall blanket idea of how it has to be.  These are interesting ways to look at simple ways of doing things rather than more complicated ways which cost more.</p></speech>

Home-care packages vary in every part of the country and it is the same with medical cards.  The Chairman made a very good point.  In some areas people cannot get access to a public health nurse unless they have a medical card.  People cannot apply for home help or get a home-care package unless they have a medical card.  A GP visit card may entitle people to free access to GPs, but it entitles them to very little really.</p></speech>

Some hospitals use the social work services funding for a discharge planner.  There do not seem to be any structures.  Each primary care group does not seem to be funded in the same way.  They do not have to have particular professionals or staff or to relate the staff to the demographics of the area.  There does not seem to be any link to the demographic of a community or area in how funding is applied.</p> <p>  The allocation of funding for home-care packages is not based on demographics and is not ring-fenced, whereas the nursing home support scheme funding is ring-fenced and, therefore, its budget is known.  In the first three months of this year too many home-care packages were given out.  How can I say too many home-care packages were given out when that was the demand and people were assessed as needing them?  It meant that in some parts of Ireland, including Dublin and Galway, no home-care packages have been available for the past two months.</p></speech>

The more interventions we can make on the home care package side, effectively, the more funds we will have to go around other areas.  The fact that people cannot see that drives me insane and that we are dealing with huge waiting lists throughout the country while people are held up in acute hospitals, holding up beds at up to &euro;7,000 a week versus &euro;550 a week for a home care package.</p></speech>

It is the same thinking in that people do not think that by providing the service within the care system that in the end that probably prevents escalating costs.  Home help services have been reduced in most areas.  Previously, a home help would assist someone who had personal care needs but some would also help them prepare a hot meal or help them with essential domestic tasks but they are not allowed do that now.  In many areas all one can get is personal care.  As one social worker told us, we can wash the older person but we cannot feed them.  Thirty minutes to help someone shower once a week does not make sense.  It is done on certain days so on Monday and Wednesday they will get a shower.  God help them if they need a shower on the days in between because they will not get it.  Over Christmas the home helps are on two weeks holidays so the people do not get any help with showering.  Simple tasks like that are not that costly when one thinks about it.</p></speech>

A primary care centre is a building and it might be a new shiny one but it does not necessarily guarantee that people will get new shiny services.  If we had properly resourced primary care teams comprising physiotherapists, speech therapists, public health nurses, community care, social workers, speech therapists and general practitioners, that would be far more important than having a primary care building.</p><p>If the HSE is to build 80 primary care centres, it should rename them community care centres rather than primary care general practitioner centres.  They tend to be built around a cohort of GPs coming into the centres to anchor the services.  If a community care building was to be built, it would be far better if it was to supply diagnostic services.  Diagnostic services could be taken out of the hospital and put into community care centres which would mean one would not have to travel up to 60 miles to get a scan or an X-ray.  One could get those in one's community care catchment area.</p><p> Another point is that there is a huge problem in retention and recruitment of hospital staff, community staff, GPs and nurses.  There does not seem to be any joined up thinking in that we educate nurses, doctors and physiotherapists but they are then left floating in the wind, so to speak, at the whim of recruitment, which can be quite restrictive.  For instance, many qualified GPs are leaving the country because the system is so poor.  They are probably highly indebted if they have gone through graduate entry medical school.  They probably borrowed up to &euro;100,000, which is crippling debt.  People say that we have educated these doctors and ask why we are letting them leave the country.  They say surely they should be committing themselves to the health service of the country that educated them.  There must be a complete review because we educate these people but we let them go.  We do not fight to keep them in the country.</p></speech>

People become demoralised working in such a system.  If a public health nurse visits people who need a service, he or she has to say he or she cannot do anything for them.  Public health nurses wonder why they visit people when they cannot provide them with what they need.  People become demoralised because they are in a profession that helps people but they cannot access what they need for the people.  The same applies to social workers.  It is demoralising when a multidisciplinary team does an assessment.  There is the cost of doing an assessment for a multidisciplinary team.  If a person needs 21 hours, the team comes back with ten hours.  Then somebody else from the community does an assessment and looks at the resources we have and how we can give this person the minimum and still give him or her something but comes back with ten hours.  There is such wastage even in carrying out all these assessments when the person will not be given what he or she needs anyway.  It is very entwined, as Deputy Kelleher said.  One action causes the other; it is like a domino effect.</p></speech>

If we look at gynaecological cancers, for example, the difference in waiting times for ultrasounds is about seven days.  The waiting time for MRI brain scans, which are particularly hard to come by in both systems, could be up to 480 days in the public system and perhaps 20 to 25 days in the private system.  The waiting times for colonoscopies have risen about 129% in the last five years and it is probably slightly more than that now.</p></speech>

It is easier for patients once they are past the diagnostic stage.  The problem is with the waiting time where, if I am going in for a colonoscopy, I have to wait six months.  Within the existing waiting lists at the end of last month, there were 5,036 people waiting over three months for a colonoscopy.  Obviously, those referred for an urgent colonoscopy are seen within four weeks, but in the larger group waiting longer than three months there will certainly be someone who has a cancer and that may be at a more advanced stage than if it had been caught earlier or the person went through the private system.  That is where the ability to pay comes in.</p></speech>

It has increased over the past few years.  I cannot necessarily put my finger on a specific cause of the problem, but we have seen a huge increase in the last number of years.  What is required in that field is greater referral pathways.  HIQA produced specific guidelines in relation to colonoscopy for general practitioners at the end of 2014.  They were issued to consultants, but I do not think they have been followed up on with GPs or that any additional training has been provided.  As I mentioned earlier, there are problems with referrals between hospital groups.  What we would really like for patients is the right intervention for the right person at the right time.  One could have a GP for whom the referral path and guidelines are not there.  If someone presents with abdominal pain, he or she will send that patient on for a colonoscopy.  However, there might be a better intervention available.  That increases the pressure on the system.  If GPs have people coming in repeatedly with similar symptoms and waiting longer and longer, he or she may refer a patient as an urgent case whereas that may not necessarily be what is required.  That burden is there.  It is very difficult for a consultant then to say that the person does not need that intervention, because it could cause huge difficulties down the line.  Unfortunately, it is a cyclical thing.</p></speech>

There are chronic disease management programmes set out for primary care.  Why are they not being implemented?  Perhaps, I should ask Deputy Harty about that.  If there are best practice programmes in place that will achieve better health outcomes and better value for money, why are we not implementing them?</p></speech>

If one looks at the budget that goes to primary care as opposed to the budget that goes to acute hospitals, one sees that we are completely prioritising the latter field.  As Dr. O'Brien was saying, there are knock-on effects on all these different areas.  When one has very high waiting lists, it is understandable that a lot of budget goes to the acute sector.  However, while we have talked about the development of primary care, the budget has not really shifted in that direction as yet.  As we have discussed, there are serious staffing issues at primary care level.  The other thing, as Dr. O'Brien pointed out, is that in certain areas it is not clear who is entitled to or eligible for these services.  We have spoken a great deal about moving care out into the community, but we have not achieved it.  Budget and staffing have a lot to do with it.</p></speech>

Who is entitled to chronic disease management?  Is it a question of one's means?  That is a very simple thing to think about in the sense of what we mean by "universality".  If we want people with chronic diseases to manage their diseases, keep well and stay out of acute hospitals, there cannot be too much of a cost involved for them.  As such, the cost impact of people failing to participate, if it is an individual thing, must be looked at.  As Ms Loughnane said, it is more to do with capacity, but in thinking about universality, the question is whether we want everybody with a chronic disease to manage to go to their doctor to have the proper tests for COPD or cardiac issues and for stroke prevention care.</p><p>If somebody has had a stroke, how do we prevent another one?  If there is going to be a cost to the individual, is he or she going to continue to have tests?  Universality can benefit people so much by allowing them to access those things when they need them in a timely way rather than to put them off for years.</p></speech>

On the phasing in of universal access to care, do the witnesses have any general advice?  They were talking about it appearing to be Government policy to extend free GP care across the population.  That is only one element of it.  Entitlement to other health professionals, home help, physiotherapy and occupational therapy and access to subsidised medication are others.  Do the witnesses have a view on the phasing in of that and the most appropriate way to proceed?</p></speech>

If one did, one would then end up in further crisis.  With the health and social care integration programme, the HSE has developed a really good model of integrated care for older people in particular.  One cannot suddenly stop funding nursing homes.  We did that before and had a crisis of a 12 to 20 week wait for nursing home beds.  One cannot just take funding from one area and give it to another.  Increased funding will have to happen.  As a society, we have to ask how important it is for our population.  In all of our reports, it states that the health of our population is our most valued commodity.  As a preliminary matter, funding will have to be increased but it will have to be done in a targeted way.  Particular targets will have to be set out so that such a thing is achieved at primary care level with such funding.  Gradually, the savings should start to come into effect in the acute and other care areas.  Those savings could be used to fund the continued move to primary care.  Over a certain number of years, there will have to be increased funding for health which is targeted at placing services back in the community.</p></speech>

The medical card review group found that one could not prioritise illnesses either.  Chronic disease management could be the place to start or it could be a matter of starting at the level of the smaller services and interventions.  Start to do the small stuff first, which should give results that facilitate the implementation of bigger things.  That is what they found in the UK anyway.  There was a 30% or 40% fall in bed days just by introducing small interventions.  I am not sure what funding was distributed nationally, but the savings were quite good.</p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to engage with the chairperson designate of the Dublin Airport Authority to discuss the approach he proposes to take if and when reappointed to the role, as well as his views on the challenges currently facing the authority.  All members are well aware by now of the Government decision of May 2011 that put in place the new arrangements for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson designate to hear his views and we trust this provides greater transparency to the process of appointment to State boards and bodies.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  I draw his attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If he is directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.</p><p>He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submission or opening statement he makes to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in to make his opening remarks.  I also should explain to him that at 3:30 p.m., I will be obliged to vacate the Chair for other parliamentary business and so if he sees me leaving, he should not take it personally.</p></speech>

It has been a real privilege for me to serve as chairman of daa since I was first appointed in January 2012 and then reappointed 18 months ago in February 2015.  I am honoured that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has asked me to attend this meeting today in respect of reappointment to the role for the next 18 months, which is a key period for daa.  I am conscious of the core importance to Ireland of Dublin and Cork Airports and it has been a great pleasure for me to work with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, his Department and the daa board in defining the strategic direction for daa in alignment with national policy, as well as in ensuring that that policy is implemented.  I look forward to continuing to contribute to daa as a key engine for Irish growth and to continue to help deliver on its potential for the economy and community as a whole.</p> <p>  Before turning my attention to the daa, it may be helpful to outline briefly my own background and experience.  I am from Bishopstown in Cork and studied law at University College Cork to postgraduate level.  I qualified as a barrister in King's Inns in Dublin and then moved to the United States, where I completed a master of laws degree at Harvard Law School.  I qualified as an attorney in New York and began my career with a Wall Street law firm before joining the Irish law firm, Arthur Cox, to run its New York office.  I returned home to Ireland with Arthur Cox after seven years in the US.  I was elected managing partner of Arthur Cox, which effectively is its chief executive, in 2003 and was re-elected to the position for a second and final four-year term in 2007.  I continue as a practising corporate partner in the firm, which now employs 700 people and is one of Ireland's largest law firms.  I also am a non-executive director of Paddy Power Betfair plc, which is listed on the Irish and London Stock Exchanges and now employs more than 7,500 people, having joined the Paddy Power board in 2008.</p> <p>  Since I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in early 2015, there has been strong growth in the Irish economy, which daa has both contributed to and benefitted from.  Most notably, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport are at record highs with more than 25 million passengers in 2015, which surpasses the peak pre-crisis levels.  This growth momentum continues with volumes up by 13% in the first six months and more seats on sale every week from 16 May to 2 October in 2016 than the peak week in the summer of 2015.  Cork Airport, a key focus for the daa board over the past few years, has taken longer to recover but has now also returned to sustainable growth since the final quarter of 2015 and the prospects for Cork are good.  I will elaborate further on the impact of this traffic growth at both Dublin and Cork a little later.  Meanwhile, daa&rsquo;s international businesses have had a very successful year, winning significant new duty-free contracts in the new Abu Dhabi airport, Muscat and New Zealand.  In Saudi Arabia, we have been appointed to manage the new Terminal 5 in Riyadh, the first big win for daa International, our fledgling airport management business.</p> <p>  The growth in our business has been achieved with the unstinting support of our staff who safely and securely run our airports and give a great passenger experience.  daa is a commercial semi-State company that pays its own way and does not receive any Exchequer funds directly or indirectly.  The group finances all its investments from the cash it generates and from debt raised in the same way as normal commercial businesses.  As a commercial State company, we are also - rightly - expected to pay dividends to our shareholder.  Over the past four years, we have prudently managed our finances and structurally, the company&rsquo;s debt levels are in a better position now with net debt &euro;100 million lower and debt as a multiple of our earnings reduced from more than five times to just three times and we have improved our credit rating.</p><p>All of these have repositioned us well for the completion of a 12-year &euro;400 million re-financing, which we completed in June on notably attractive terms.  The long-standing pension problems, which created so much risk for employees and uncertainty for the company, were resolved during 2015 and a new pension scheme is in place since the beginning of the year.</p><p> We have announced plans to move forward with the new parallel runway at Dublin Airport, something I will return to in more detail later.  The last 18 months have also been particularly important in respect of the developments in the environment in which the daa operates.  These include the publication of the national aviation policy, the takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG and the review of the regulatory regime for airport charges currently under way.  In this period, security, particularly in light of renewed terrorist attacks internationally, has been a central focus for us while other international developments such as Brexit have only begun to play out.  Again, I will return to these themes.</p><p> I will comment on policy and industry developments.  I very much welcome the new national aviation policy which the Government has adopted.  This is the first comprehensive and integrated strategy for the aviation sector published for over two decades and it provides a cohesive direction for growth.  The daa will energetically play its central role in helping to deliver the benefits of this policy, not only through the development of the northern runway but in working with the Minister, the Department and all other stakeholders on the strategy.</p><p> I welcome the announcement by Government of the Metro North transport option as a frequent service with fast journey times connecting the centre of the airport to the city centre.  I urge, however, for this project to be accelerated as delivery by 2026 loses many years of structural economic benefit to Dublin and the country.  The most significant industry development of the last 18 months for the daa was the acquisition of Aer Lingus by IAG.  This offers new potential for growth both in Dublin and Cork airports, not least the quickly emerging potential of Dublin to become a European transatlantic gateway, a topic to which I will return.</p><p> As I mentioned, last year Dublin Airport handled over 25 million passengers and this year we are potentially on path to break the 27 million mark.  Traffic at Dublin has grown 33.7% in the four years since I joined the board of the daa.  Dublin Airport is now the second fastest-growing airport in Europe.  We are constantly expanding connectivity and service in Dublin with 39 new routes and nine new airline operators in 2015 and 2016.  This expanded connectivity of Ireland to the world is at the core of the daa's economic contribution to the country and we consider it a central part of our mandate.  The ongoing development of Dublin Airport as a gateway to and from the United States is central to the ongoing development of this connectivity as passengers transiting through Dublin strongly support the global network and frequency of routes available to those passengers whose origin or destination is Ireland.  The key success factors in developing this potential include our US Customs and Borders Protection service in Dublin, the continuing development of Dublin Airport as a transatlantic gateway for European and US travellers and the increase in capacity through the northern runway.</p><p> The daa has focused significantly on the development of Cork Airport in recent years.  The environment in Cork has been challenging since the financial crisis and the airport was also adversely affected by the terms offered by Shannon Airport since its separation.  I am pleased to report, however, that it has now turned a corner.  Cork has now achieved nine months of passenger growth and is back up to 2.15 million passengers, the second largest airport in the State.  Although the CityJet Cork to London City route failed, there are seven new routes into Cork this year, as well as three summer routes that are becoming year-round services.  The other core growth opportunity through Cork Airport for the Munster region, the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East remains the proposed Norwegian three-times-a-week flight to Boston.  The US authorities continue to delay granting Norwegian a foreign carrier permit.  I urge all stakeholders to continue to work to urgently resolve this issue and the daa will play its part in this regard.</p><p> The development of a new parallel northern runway at Dublin Airport has been incorporated in county development plans since the 1970s.  In contrast to airports like Heathrow, generations of previous boards and management of the company had the vision and foresight to assemble and preserve the lands and environs required to build it.  Although planning permission was granted in 2007, it is only now that the economic pace of the country and the growth of passengers at Dublin Airport require the development of this key national infrastructure, and it a core part of the national aviation policy.</p><p>The development of a parallel runway is necessary not only to sustain passenger growth at Dublin Airport but, critically, also to realise the potential for Ireland's connectivity with the world.  In addition to relieving ever-increasing congestion at the airport, the new runway, which will be 3,100 m in length, will facilitate new long-range routes from Ireland to cities such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Sao Paulo.</p><p> To sustain the levels of growth I described earlier, the objective of the daa is to deliver the new northern runway by 2020, which is as soon as is feasible.  The cost of the runway was estimated at &euro;245 million in 2014 for the regulatory process and the actual cost is currently estimated at &euro;320 million.  The change in the estimate is due to a combination of factors, including cost inflation, more comprehensive scope items and the added expense of working on a far busier airfield.  The project will, of course, be competitively tendered to ensure it is built at the lowest available actual cost.  Until that is done we cannot confirm the final price.  However, we can confirm that the project will be funded entirely by the daa without recourse to the taxpayer.</p><p> The planning permission for the new runway, as granted, contains 31 conditions, two of which are particularly onerous and would restrict the usage of the airport to a degree that would largely obviate the purpose of the new runway.  Should these two conditions remain, building the new runway would materially reduce the current capacity of Dublin Airport rather than increase it during the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  Specifically, the planning conditions provide that if the new runway is built there can be no more than 65 movements on the existing runways between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. in contrast with approximately 100 such movements currently and would also require that the new runway would have to be entirely closed during those hours.  These two planning conditions were designed and included many years ago at a single point in time and without any in-built mechanism to respond to changing conditions.  Such changing conditions in the intervening years have included the development of far quieter aircraft, which now account for 95% of all flights to and from Dublin.  As a result, the daa will apply to the planning authorities to have these conditions removed.  In doing so, we are centrally conscious at board level and throughout the executive management of our place in the community and the potential impacts on our neighbours.</p><p> We are committed to approaching these issues in a transparent and helpful way, listening to the concerns of neighbours and addressing them to the extent that we can in an open, constructive and objective manner.  We have already commenced this process of actively engaging with the community.  An environmental impact study will be undertaken for review by the relevant authorities and a comprehensive study of noise contours from the new runway will be completed to European standards.  We do not intend using compulsory purchase orders for any houses and we intend to go beyond what is required of us in the planning permission in terms of mitigating the impact of noise as we seek to find balanced constructive and responsive ways of addressing concerns.</p><p> The current system of regulation of airport charges has been in place since 2001 and, as noted in the national aviation policy, involves more onerous regulatory intervention than is required by European law.  Although the approach to regulation has evolved little during those 15 years, the industry it relates to in Ireland has changed dramatically, as have its competitive dynamics.  In that period, Ryanair has gone from being a small, primarily Irish and UK based airline to a world leader and Aer Lingus is now owned by IAG, one of the largest and most successful global aviation players.  These are our two major customers.  We value them decidedly and both have tremendous competitive power.  They can move aircraft, the most mobile of assets, from Dublin or Cork with ease and deploy them elsewhere in their international networks if the financial conditions in our airports are not appealing.</p><p> The regulatory system continues to ignore these realities.  It is costly, overly complex and disproportionate to the market position of the airport.  It has been striking to me during the past four years the level of distortion this system can cause.  It seems the regulator rather than the board determines the nature, level and timing of the daa's investment strategy for the airport.  In doing so, it often prioritises short-term considerations over long-term strategic investment in the airport, which is what is needed in Ireland's primary gateway.  Dividend return to the State, as the daa's shareholder, is de-prioritised in favour of increased return to the airlines and there appears to be little alignment between the regulator's mandate and the goals of the national aviation policy.</p><p> Last year, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport commenced a process of reviewing the regulatory regime in the aviation sector, a process we very much welcomed.</p><p>The Department has now commenced a public consultation on future policy, inviting submissions on a recently published report by Indecon that is assisting the Department.  It is of concern that this report recommends reinforcing the current regulatory approach or making it even more onerous while making no reference in its analysis to Dublin's two nearest potential competitor airports in Belfast, both less than 180 km away, or to the goals of the national aviation policy.  The daa will be making submissions to the Department on this report in the coming weeks.  Central to our submission will be the theme that Dublin Airport needs to operate within a regulatory system that equips it to develop the right infrastructure for long-term national economic development within an environment of competitive airport charges and adequate return to the shareholder.</p><p> In addition to the daa's two airports in Ireland, the daa Group also operates a successful international travel retail business, Aer Rianta International, ARI.  This business is truly global, operating in the Middle East, Asia, India, New Zealand and North America, and continues to expand its footprint.  Group turnover reported for 2015 in our international business was in the order of &euro;180 million, generating &euro;22 million in profit.  We have developed a new international business in recent years, daa International, daai, which provides international airport management advisory services and aviation training services.  Earlier this year, daai won a contract to manage and operate the new Terminal 5 facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  This terminal is now up and running.  We see promise in this business and will continue to work to expand it into a contributor of scale to the group.</p><p> Approximately 70 acres of uniquely located lands within Dublin Airport are suitable for development.  Dublin Airport central is about developing modern, sustainable office development on that footprint.  Members may have noticed the redevelopment of the former Aer Lingus head office building on the site over the past 12 months.  This is now a modern office building that will shortly be occupied by ESB International.  We plan to develop the site further commercially in the coming years, potentially in partnership with others, subject to obtaining the requisite planning permissions.</p><p> The daa is a service-led business and we have a great and dedicated staff who deliver continuous excellent service on a 24-7 basis.  The daa Group offers more than 3,300 full-time equivalent jobs, of which 2,500 are based at our Irish airports.  In 2012 when I became chairman, our airports were ranked among the lowest for customer services against comparable European airports.  That situation has changed dramatically and both Cork and Dublin Airports are now ranked among the highest for customer service.  I am particularly proud of the efforts of all staff in achieving the best customer service standards among peer airports, most especially while meeting the demands of a fast-growing business.  Equally, I am conscious of the need to deliver to staff and to create a cohesive, evolutionary employment environment that can flex and grow with the ever-changing needs of the business while creating a fair, forward-looking workplace in which our staff can thrive.  To achieve these goals, we have embarked on a transformation programme aimed at changing how all levels of the company work together, how employees are rewarded and build careers and how the company manages change in a fast-moving, dynamic airport environment.  I am happy to report that there is active engagement between management and staff representatives on these matters.</p><p> I mentioned a number of international developments that are likely to have an impact on our business.  In particular, we will be closely monitoring the impact of the UK leaving the EU.  At a national level, we see the importance of the UK-Ireland economic and tourism links, with Dublin-London the largest international route in the world.  In 2016, we expect just over 11 million passengers to travel to and from the UK through Dublin and Cork Airports.  Any change to the operation of the common travel area through the reintroduction of border controls between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain would make travel between the countries more difficult and could have negative impacts on trade and tourism apart from the significant cost and complexity implications at airports.  Equally, we are conscious that there may be opportunities related to Brexit and we are focused on identifying these at the earliest possible stage.</p><p> Before concluding, I wish to say a word about security, which in all of its aspects continues to be perhaps the key priority area for the company.  The terrorist attacks in recent months in Europe are disturbing and, as a company, we have studied each as it has occurred.  The safety and security of passengers and staff are primary board priorities and we continue to review actively our security arrangements and keep in regular contact with the Garda and other relevant State agencies regarding airport security matters.</p><p> I wish to highlight the work of my colleagues on the daa board who have worked well and cohesively with me over the past four years to formulate a pragmatic but ambitious strategy for the group that is aligned with national priorities and customer expectations.  In particular, I wish to acknowledge Mr. Kevin Toland, our CEO, who has done an exceptional job, not just for the daa, but in helping it to reach its potential as a key source of growth for the economy as a whole.  Under his stewardship, the business is performing strikingly well, with record traffic and profit levels, continued expansion abroad and ever-increasing connectivity.  I have made this point a number of times previously but I am certain that the yawning pay gap between what a CEO of Mr. Toland's ability is paid in the public sector and what he would be paid for doing the same job in the private sector is the most false of all economies for the country.  The positive impact that he has made in igniting Dublin and Cork Airports as key Irish assets speaks for itself.  I urge the committee to take the urgently required remuneration steps necessary to enable boards like mine to retain exceptional people of Mr. Toland's calibre within the public system where their energies are dedicated to advancing the economic interests of Ireland as a whole.</p><p> I thank the staff of the daa for their hard work, dedication and commitment to making our airports the best in Europe.  I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his officials, with whom we have good professional relationships, for their commitment and their ongoing support for all aspects of our business.  Thanks also to the group's shareholder, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, whom I also worked with as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, and his officials for their support over the past 18 months.</p><p> It would be a privilege to rededicate my own efforts to the daa over the next 18 months and to continue to fulfil the role of chairman of the company for that period.  I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the invitation to appear before them today and I am happy to address whatever questions they may have.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a couple of questions, particularly on the new runway.  According to the daa's report, it has already commenced the process of actively engaging with the community.  Will Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in update us on how that is progressing?  Has agreement been reached?  Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in stated that an environmental impact study would be carried out.  Is the daa conducting that study or will it engage an independent body?  He also stated that the daa did not intend to use compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for any house.  There are 40 homes in question.  If some families do not want to move, how will the daa be fixed then?</p></speech>

When discussing the second runway at board level, engagement gets a great deal of attention.  We started that engagement with the community in St. Margaret's even before we publicly stated what our next steps would be.  The night before, our CEO met the community to inform everyone of what was happening and what the next steps would be.  This process has been under way since.  We have met a broad range of community groups, their representatives and individuals.  If anyone wants to engage with us, we will meet him or her, generally at a senior level, by which I mean from the CEO and senior executive levels down.  This is not being outsourced, as we are taking this seriously at the core of our business.  We have dropped approximately 30,000 information leaflets and we have a website dedicated to the project for everyone affected.</p><p>We have also answered every question that has been asked of us.  We are trying to be very transparent from the start about everything we are doing, why we are doing it and the consequences of that.</p><p> That feeds into the second question which was about the environmental impact statement.  The scope of the environmental impact statement is being worked through.  As part of that there is consultation with not only each of the statutory stakeholders but also with the community and everybody else who wishes to participate, so the scope of the statement is defined having heard and listened to all of those voices.  The next step is that we appoint consultants who undertake the environmental impact statement in accordance with international standards.  They come back at the end of that and there is a further consultation at that stage on their environmental impact statement.  To the extent that mitigation factors are required we would propose those.</p></speech>

I am not an expert on this but there are international standards for environmental impact statements.  There is a series of chapters and each of them must be addressed.  The outside consultants are experts who do that to international standards.  Of course, that can be critiqued by anybody because once it is produced it is put out for consultation again.  People can offer their views on it or critique it.  It is a standard process and is as objective as one can get.</p> <p>  I will turn to the Deputy's third question about the homes.  Nothing that we do will be involuntary, because clearly that would be the wrong approach from our perspective.  Regarding the houses affected in terms of purchase, we will make an offer to purchase those houses.  As the Deputy says, it may very well be that families do not wish to move and do not wish to take up that offer.  If they do not, we will leave the offer open for a year after the runway becomes operational.  We are not simply asking people now if they wish to move and to take up the offer.  We will leave it open so they know what the actual experience with the runway is and can make the decision in that context.  If they do not wish to move, that is their choice.  We will offer them insulation in their houses to ameliorate any effects of noise.</p></speech>

The report is positive after the traumatic times of the last number of years.  As a Cork man my first question, of course, is about the Cork-Boston transatlantic connection that has been promised for so long.  Why is it taking so long?  There have been deputations, ministerial intervention and goodwill groups from local authorities to Boston and Norwegian Air Shuttle.  There is a European-American transatlantic agreement in place.  What is the reason this is being held up?  Is it because the American presidential election is under way at present?  I hope Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in can reply on that.</p> <p>  I welcome the proposal for a second runway in Dublin and I am glad the airport is not encountering as many intricacies as Heathrow Airport.  My question is about the conditions.  What is the point of having two runways if one of them must shut down when the other one is functioning?  I thought the idea behind having two runways was to deal with the intensity of the number of flights.  My understanding of it is that when one runway is open the number of flights is reduced from 100 to 64, but it shuts down then to allow the other runway to operate.  What is the advantage of having one runway shut down when the other is functioning?  Am I open to correction on that interpretation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016072000002#J00500"><p>I will deal with the Cork-Boston route first.  The reason it is stuck, essentially, is that it is a political issue in the United States.  As Norwegian is a low cost airline there is an amount of resistance in the US, from a political perspective and particularly from airline unions, to Norwegian coming in.</p><p>There is a fear that, for example, it will use staff on lower wage levels and be able to produce a more cost effective product.  Norwegian Air Shuttle has made a number of confirmations to indicate that this would not be the case and it would not be using those types of staff, but it has still become a political issue in the US.  There is a good deal of pushback because Norwegian is the first.  The US Department of Transportation has made a preliminary judgment that there is no legal basis to refuse this.  Due to the open skies arrangement between the US and Europe there should not be a legal basis to do it, but that department is still dragging its feet and has not allowed it.  The daa and many other stakeholders have been doing everything we can to try to get it progressed, but it is still blocked.  One would expect over a period of time that if the United States does not have a legal basis for refusing the permit Norwegian Air Shuttle needs, it would be granted.  As a fellow Cork man, who grew up under the flight path of Cork Airport, I am equally exercised about this, but we are being as thoughtful and progressive about it as possible.  We are engaging as many stakeholders as possible to get this progressed.  We just have to stick with it.</p><p> The Deputy  asked a good question about the conditions.  He is absolutely right.  There is a total of 31 conditions but these two are very troublesome.  Essentially, they do two things.  First, it states that once we build the second runway there is, for the first time, a condition that applies to the entire airport.  Once we have a second runway the entire airport cannot have more than 65 movements a night.  Currently, we have 100 movements a night.  That means approximately 3 million fewer passengers than what we currently have if that condition remains.  In addition, as the Deputy said, the new infrastructure we build, which is the new runway, would have to be totally closed down between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  When one considers matters such as connectivity, one of the advantages of the new runway is its length at 3.1 km.  We have many flights that require that runway and because they are long haul flights they can arrive at any hour.  To use the second runway to relieve the congestion that currently exists, because the air field of Dublin Airport is now totally full at various times of the day, and to ensure the airport is open for long haul flights in particular, the second condition that the runway must close down for those hours appears to be unworkable.</p><p> There are many other conditions that we will deal with but these two are major hurdles to realising the value of the new runway, not just for the daa but for the country in terms of building passenger numbers and connectivity.</p></speech>

That will be a significant part of the environmental impact study.  The study will look at these two conditions and say what their effect is now.  They will be studied in depth in terms of the noise profile of modern aircraft and the noise contours as well.  A noise contour essentially measures where the noise is produced around a runway.  As one can imagine, it is like to a long bubble around the runway but it has different effects in different places.  All of that will be canvassed as part of the environmental impact statement.</p></speech>

The figures presented today show turnover is up by 20%, that profit after tax is up, that there has been an improved return on equity, that there are extra passengers and there that has been a return to growth in Cork.  There are improved international operations.  There is little doubt as to why Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has been asked to stay on as chairman.  The figures are a ringing endorsement of him and also the staff working under the auspices of the Dublin Airport Authority.  As committee members, we should acknowledge this.</p></speech>

I attribute the success to the entire organisation.  It is a wonderful organisation which has returned to a position of real strength.

I thank the Acting Chairman for noting it.</p></speech>

It would open up Dublin Airport as a transatlantic hub, improve connectivity and our ability to connect with Asia and the Far East.</p> <p>  As I am not living in the constituency in which Dublin Airport is situated, it might be quite easy for me to say the restrictions being imposed under the planning permission criteria of 2007 are simply unworkable if we are to open up the airport and improve traffic numbers and movement through it.  Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in should try, as he proceeds, to have these onerous conditions removed.  Every effort should be made, with the local people who will be affected by the proposed new runway, to purchase houses that will need to be purchased and insulate those that will need to be insulated.  Treble-glazed windows should be installed.  Whatever needs to be done to minimise the impact on the residents living in close proximity to the airport should be done.  I understand there are new EU noise regulations to be issued.  The airport must adhere to them because we cannot have circumstances in which residents will be adversely affected by the expansion.</p> <p>  The one concern I have about the proposed second runway is the increase in the associated cost.  Originally, it was identified as approximately &euro;260 million, but now it has been identified as &euro;320 million.  At a time when labour and construction costs are falling, I do not understand why the cost of the second runway is increasing.  With due respect, I do not accept people saying it would cost more at Heathrow or another airport.  It is not being built at Heathrow Airport.</p></speech>

Based on the foresight of previous boards and CEOs of the Dublin Airport Authority, we are fortunate that we have the required land.  Possibly the dearest part of any runway project is the purchase of the land, but we do not have to do this.  I would welcome the chairman&rsquo;s opinion.</p> <p>  With regard to Terminal 2, there is talk of parking slots, parking stands and bus lounges.  The Terminal 2 building is open only for a few years and seems to be populated by check-in areas.  Capacity has already been reached in terms of parking stands.  I understand there is no capacity to extend Terminal 2, yet it is still being sought to extend it by parking buses off-site and bussing passengers to it.  Does the chairman believe or accept that Terminal 2 was built in the right location?  How much space has been allocated for check-in desks?  Most people who go to the airport have already checked in online and are just dropping off a bag, yet when one goes to Terminal 2, there is nothing but rows and rows of check-in desks with nobody at them.  I would welcome the chairman&rsquo;s opinion on that matter.</p><p> Last night I was reading the chairman&rsquo;s statement to a previous committee.  He complimented his board members and said they comprised an extremely competent board with the relevant experience to deal with the aviation sector.  Are all of the existing board members staying on with Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for the following term?  Has there been a turnover?  Is Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in happy with his board members?</p><p> Pre-clearance at Dublin Airport for transatlantic flights is unique to Ireland and of considerable benefit to the tourism industry.  I understand, however, that there have been difficulties with the home office in the United States in having the relevant personnel.  While it does not seem to be an issue this summer, it has the potential to be down the line.  Is the chairman aware of this and what is his opinion on it?</p><p> The chairman referred to national aviation policy.  While regional airports do not fall within his remit, what is his view on them?  Do they have a role to play?  I would welcome his opinion on Knock, Shannon which is no longer under his control and other regional airports such as Kerry Airport.  Do they have a role to play, bearing in mind the size of the country?  How can the daa interact and engage with the likes of Ireland West Airport Knock?  </p><p> Reference was made to Cork Airport.  It is great to see an increase in growth and a turnaround at that airport.  It is disappointing that the transatlantic flights to Boston flagged so many years ago are still in limbo as they would greatly enhance the potential of the Cork region.  Could the stalemate be broken through more diplomatic efforts, perhaps involving the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade working with the relevant governor or Member of the US Senate to advance the issue?</p><p> The chairman is not complimentary of the regulatory system.  He does not go into specifics; perhaps he does not wish to.  He has rightly identified that the customers of the daa are the airlines, including Ryanair and Aer Lingus, but they could move at the drop of a hat.  Are we at a disadvantage regarding the regulations to which we must adhere by comparison with some of the airports with which we compete?  If so, will the chairman identify the regulations which are having this considerable effect?</p><p> I have two more points to make and I am taking liberty as Acting Chairman.  The first point is on security.  When one sees what is occurring across the world, including in Nice last week, one realises there are events that almost cannot be planned for.  Who would have envisaged a lorry driver doing what he did in Nice?  What has the daa done to ensure security?  Everyone says Ireland is very low on the list of potential targets.  However, what would be done if people decided to get at the Americans in an area in which they chose to take a holiday?  A large number of Americans choose to holiday in Ireland.  What is being done in that regard?</p><p> The chairman spoke about the remuneration of the CEO.</p><p>I have never been one to subscribe to a rush to the bottom.  I believe that if one pays peanuts, one gets monkeys.  If we are to attract the right calibre of people into the appropriate positions, they need to be adequately remunerated.  Everybody has had to take a level of pain or a reduction in recent years.  It is only right that everyone had to take that level of pain and that those who could give the most gave the most.  However, we are now talking about having turned the corner.  Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about there having been a huge increase in the profits of the Dublin Airport Authority, daa.  As he identified improving figures across the board, he might indicate what his thinking on that is as opposed to being bland about it, if he does not mind my saying that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.303" nospeaker="true" time="15:00:00" ><p>Deputy Brendan Griffin resumed the Chair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-20a.304" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016072000002#N00200"><p>That is quite a menu.  I will start at the beginning.  I agree entirely with what the Acting Chairman said about the potential for the new runway and the opportunity for connectivity and everything that it will give.  Equally, I agree with what he said about every effort being made in that respect.  In implementing the new runway, we will make every effort to ensure the impact of that on our community and neighbours in the Dublin area is ameliorated, as the Acting Chairman said, in terms of offers of house purchases and insulation where it is appropriate.  We will do all of that.  That is very much a central part of our thinking.  I can confirm that to the Acting Chairman.</p> <p>  On the issue of noise regulation as we go forward, the Acting Chairman is correct in that under the new directive, there will be an active noise regulator in Dublin Airport as there will be across Europe, which will be helpful.  The daa at all stages will comply with whatever those regulations are.  These are imposed on an airport by external bodies and we will always adhere to those to the letter.</p> <p>  The initial cost &euro;260 million for the new runway comes from the last regulatory round.  That was a paper exercise essentially where we examined what it would cost to build a new runway.  If we compare that figure with the current estimate, which is only an estimate, of &euro;320 million, we are not comparing apples with apples.  It is more a comparison of apples with oranges in so far as the &euro;320 million estimate is much more inclusive of all the other work around the runway that would have to be done, such as taxiways, aprons, fire houses and all those types of facilities, which were not necessarily included in the original amount.  In addition, there is cost inflation and another factor which I had not thought of, namely, that a busy airfield is a difficult place to work from the point of view of security and everything else.  The busier the airport, the more expensive it is to do work in it.  There are those types of pressures that are building in respect of it.  Both the &euro;260 million and the &euro;320 million figures are still only desktop numbers.  The runway will be built and, ultimately, we will get the lowest possible price we can to build it through procurement in the same way as any commercial company would.  We will make sure that the costs in respect of it are kept to the minimum but, ultimately, to get there, we have to procure all the elements of it individually.  Until that is done, we will not know what the final price is.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman is right in that the contrast with the cost of building a new runway at Heathrow Airport would be a dramatic one.  The reason it would be so expensive at Heathrow Airport comes down to the land issue in that land would have to be purchased.</p> <p>  With respect to our terminals, a good deal of our congestion interestingly is more on the air side - in other words, it is more in regard to the runway, the taxiways and the parking stands for aircraft as opposed to only the terminal accommodation.  We are providing more gates and we are building more stands where aircraft can overnight because it is very positive to have aircraft come in and overnight in Dublin and from that base, leave early the next morning and come back.  We are providing parking stands and remote stands.  We have very little busing by international standards, so we are putting in buses to accommodate passengers as well.  What we are doing in as thoughtful and as a forward-looking a way as we possibly can is taking account of the airport as it is and asking how can we optimise it currently in terms of the huge increase in passenger numbers that we have experienced in recent years in order to keep the entire engine working.</p><p>Those are the initiatives being taken with respect to those elements and infrastructure to meet the current demand prior to the second runway being built.  <br/><br/>The Acting Chairman is right in that there is much more automation with the check-in process and that has gone very well.  It has taken some of the pressure off the terminal building but currently, the pressure and the constraints are on the air side part of the infrastructure, on which we are greatly focused.<br/><br/>The Acting Chairman asked about the existing board and the combination of its members.  It is a very good and open board.  We voice concerns, have discussions and conclude matters.  It is essentially the same board as 18 months ago with one exception.  The term of one of the non-executive directors has expired and she has to be considered in terms of re-appointment or otherwise.  The point regarding the board is apposite in that the mix of people on a State board is important in terms of getting the right mix of skills and the right judgment coming from the board.<br/><br/><i></i>Preclearance in Dublin Airport is core to the authority.  It is a huge advantage to us.  The gateway potential for Dublin Airport between Europe and the United States is very promising and customs and border protection, CBP, is a significant part of that.  At various times we have had resource constraints, which the Acting Chairman mentioned, but this summer we have not had those.  A year or 18 months ago we were in active dialogue, and we continue to engage in active dialogue, with Homeland Protection in the United States on the resources that are necessary for CBP here.  Our ambition, and this is currently the case, is that every flight to the United States is covered by CBP.  Once we go below those resources when people plan trips they are not sure whether they will get the advantage of CBP and that doubt dissipates a considerable degree of that advantage.  It is important that we continue to have the resources we have.  We are actively engaged at all stages with Homeland Security in the United States.  We cannot pay for any of that because it is a security issue from the US perspective.  It is a question of making sure we are speaking to the right people and that they understand what we are trying to plan for and our ambitions in regard to CBP.  That is an ongoing dialogue.  With the level of growth we have, undoubtedly we will need more resources in that area.<br/><br/>With respect to national aviation policy, the regional airports have a role to play.  It is difficult for me to comment unduly on that, as that is very much a matter of national policy.  From an international perspective, there are many more airports in Ireland than one would expect, having regard to our geographic area.  Airports in Europe are much more dispersed.  The general rule of thumb is that for the normal economic footprint - the length of time people will drive to get to a major airport - is an hour and three quarters or two hours of travel time.  With have quite a few more airports than one would expect based on that rule of thumb.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, the airlines delivering people make decisions to their economic or commercial advantage, which they should.  Ultimately also, market forces will dictate where they land, where they deposit passengers and from where passengers are coming.  The issue with respect to regional airports is probably more of a national policy issue.<br/><br/>On the issue of the proposed air route by Norwegian Air operating out of Cork, the more diplomatic efforts to address this the better. From a diplomatic or political perspective, we would very much encourage that and the more intervention and dialogue at that level, the better.  Ultimately, that is possibly the only thing that will move this on and get it done within a reasonable timeframe.  The Acting Chairman is right on that and we would very much encourage such an approach.  <br/><br/>The Acting Chairman said I was not complimentary of the regulatory system.  I am not.  There are a few issues involved.  With any regulatory system it depends on what problem the system is designed to address.  The regulatory system currently in operation was designed 15 years ago.</p><p>When it was designed, Dublin Airport was a monopoly provider of airport facilities in Dublin.  There were many smaller airlines and there was an imbalance between the two, but this has changed massively in the 15 years since, as have the competitive dynamics.  Our two major customers are among the most successful and competitive airlines in the world.  They are wonderful customers and we value them enormously.  They are very sophisticated and well able to compete.  The daa does not price to our cap.  Commercially, we decide to price below it.  This is not the behaviour of somebody with a competitive axe to wield.  It is commercially rational behaviour with very competitive airline partners.</p><p> The competitive dynamic has changed enormously and other airports in Ireland could compete with us very strongly.  Two are located only 100 km away in Belfast which, in airport terms, is close by.  In analysing the daa's competitive position the Indecon report which was recently prepared made no reference to either of them.  I do not believe they were included within its terms of reference.  It is not so much that I am not complimentary about the regulatory system; all of those involved in the system are doing the job they were asked to do and in the way the regulatory system was designed, but what is wrong is that the system was designed to solve what is the wrong problem at this stage.</p><p> The regulatory system is inhibiting two major issues which will still be issues long after I have left the board and which are very important for Ireland.  They are the long-term strategic element of the airport from an Irish and an economic development centric perspective and the return to the State.  As we become more efficient, the regulator will come in and take these efficiencies into account and give the benefit to the airlines.  That is how the system was designed.  This means, for example, that we can give far lower dividends to the State.  For me, a commercial company should remunerate its shareholder which, in our case, is the State.  The State has a lot of capital tied up in companies such as the daa.  These are the issues which are not properly addressed in the regulatory framework and the review presents an opportunity to get some of this right.</p><p> I agree that the issue of security is front and central.  It is very difficult to predict events such as what happened in Nice and it is very troubling, but we are very focused on the issue.  Four years ago we had an Article 50 issue, which meant that Dublin Airport had failed to meet European security protocols.  In the four years since we have taken on the problem.  Some of the issues had been evident for a number of years.  We have radically improved the position and turned it on its head, to the extent that security is now very good.  We brought in Mick Feehan, the head of the section with this function in the daa.  He is a former Garda assistant commissioner and it is job to run it.  We are very thoughtful in how we provide security and about the types of threat faced, but, as the Deputy said, it is difficult to prevent everything.  The topic is present at board level.</p><p> I raised the issue of the remuneration of the CEO because I am chairman of a semi-State body and it is part of my job to bring to policy makers the real risks faced in the system.  I agree entirely that in recent years it has been very difficult for people who have taken pay cuts.  I can only speak for the daa, but when we look at what we pay chief executives in State companies generally and particularly people of Mr. Toland's ability, the difference between what he is paid and what he would be paid if he were to lift the telephone and go back to the private sector is an absolutely yawning gap.  I do not state what we need to do is to close the gap entirely, but we should make movements to secure people such as Mr. Toland who do these jobs for exactly the right reasons and make an enormous impact.</p><p>It is hard to calibrate the level of value that Mr. Toland has brought to Ireland as a whole when we consider passenger growth and how the airports now function.  This has a huge knock-on value for Ireland as a whole.  If the daa were an unrestrained commercial company, we would absolutely be paying him more because it is a central risk to us that we lose somebody of his calibre and it would be a dreadful pity if it happened.</p><p> The Deputy asked me to be specific.  At the time Mr. Toland came in, in 2012 or 2013, it was intended there would be a performance-related pay element for chief executives of State companies but this never happened.  When he came, in he was on a fixed sum and he is still on the same fixed sum without any performance-related pay, although it was indicated at the time and there was an expectation this element of pay would come in.  In addition, chief executives of State companies do not have any participation in equity as they do in private companies.  For example, there are no share plans.  While I utterly accept that when we look at the figure, the amount of money is very high in comparison to an average salary, from a business point of view we must compare it with the minimum he would be paid in the private sector and the difference is massive.  The country could very quickly lose real generators of value if we do not fix this problem.  I have been consistent about this from the very beginning but I raise it is today as the chairman of a State company to point out a risk in the system.</p></speech>

New politics is in the process of sorting out this problem but we are not there yet.  With regard to security, and looking at what happened in Brussels recently, what is there to stop potential terrorists getting to the public areas of airports?  Has the daa considered looking at preliminary security on the approach to the airport?  Is it logistically possible?  There seems to be a risk that things have changed somewhat and we need to up the game even further.  Is this something that would be considered at Dublin and Cork Airports or any other airport?</p></speech>

This is very interesting.  Istanbul airport had external clearance zones but this did not stop the attack there.  Brussels was different because it did not have this.

Depending on where we put security, it could move a problem rather than eradicate it.  We must think through each of the steps.  We have very strong and experienced people going through all of the steps.  Security for access to Dublin and Cork Airports is significantly higher than it used to be, without going into the detail of it.  Although people can access terminals, it is more secure than it was.  We have taken quite a few preventative measures and measures to plan for a reaction if something were to happen because this is also very important.  We have learned from some of the incidents that have happened in other airports as to how to minimise damage and deal with a situation if something goes wrong.  We think about this along the entire journey, from the inception of an issue and how we prevent it through to moderating its effects.</p></speech>
