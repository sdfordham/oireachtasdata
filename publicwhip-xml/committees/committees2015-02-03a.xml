    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Cotter" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015020300003#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to address them today regarding developments in the global dairy market and the impact on exporters.</p>  <p>  The imminent removal of dairy quotas and the forecast 2 billion litre increase in Irish milk production by 2020, albeit at a time of short-term market weakness, represents a major and long-term opportunity for the sector.  It comes also at a time when the sector has already been making a significant contribution towards the growth in our overall food and drink exports, which recorded their fifth consecutive year of growth in 2014.  Dairy exports increased by 3% last year, leaving trade some 56% higher than five years earlier.  When dairy-based enriched powders - which are an integral part of the industry but are typically classed as a prepared food - are included, the value of dairy exports was almost &euro;3.8 billion, or 36% of total food and drink exports.</p>  <p>  Over the past decade, the value of Irish dairy exports has more than doubled.  As the dairy sector begins to realise the opportunities now opening up, it is set to dominate and drive total export revenues by the end of this decade.  The dairy sector is well positioned to do so, in that it has an international marketing footprint that is truly global.  While as much as 40% of our total food and drink exports are destined for the UK market, just 32% of our dairy exports go there.  And while almost 40% of dairy exports go to international markets, only 29% of total exports are destined for markets outside the European Union.  The growth in exports in recent years has focused on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, which now account for 80% of dairy exports to international markets.  Irish dairy products were exported to 138 countries in 2014.</p>  <p>  The most striking trend of all is the sustained growth in exports to China, which is now our dairy industry&rsquo;s second largest market after the UK, driven largely by the growth in infant formula exports.  The progress made is highlighted by the fact that in 2008, China ranked 13th in terms of export markets.</p> <p>In terms of our emerging branded presence and our pursuit of new opportunities in the market, the role of China in determining the fortunes of our dairy industry, both directly and indirectly, can hardly be overstated.  China is now the world&rsquo;s leading dairy importer and has a <i>per capita</i>dairy consumption level that is less than one third of the global average, so there is significant scope for growth in the future.<br/><br/>With up to 45% of dairy exports destined for international markets which predominantly trade in US dollars, and a further 27% destined for the sterling area, any change in exchange rates has the potential to impact on the competitiveness of Irish food and drink exports.  In January 2015, the euro was 14% weaker against the US dollar and 7% weaker against sterling.  These developments are helping to boost the competitiveness of Irish exports and should help to offset some of the decline in global dairy prices.  If all other factors were equal, it could help boost the value of Irish dairy exports to the tune of 8%.  However, a number of factors, such as availability, demand developments and the level of competition from other suppliers, will influence potential returns.  It is also likely to take some time before any such currency-related benefit may be fully realised.  The fact that the euro is weakening against other leading export regions such as the United States, New Zealand and Australia is helping to drive the relative competitiveness of European dairy products on world markets.<br/><br/>The drivers of growth in the demand for food are relentless - I will return to this in a moment - yet they are being met by new supply challenges that did not exist before, such as falling rates of growth in productivity, climate change, unpredictable weather events - identified by the FAO and the OECD as the single biggest contributor to volatility - a world facing water scarcity when agriculture requires 70% of it for irrigation, a fixed land supply, and the competing use of it for fuel as well as for food.  These factors will work to Ireland's favour in the future.<br/><br/>Favourable weather conditions and strong producer prices have led to a strong increase in production in many of the world&rsquo;s largest dairy export regions over the past year.  The chart shows that during the 11 months to last November, combined production in New Zealand, Australia, the EU and US increased by almost 4%, or 9 billion litres of milk.  The rate of growth slowed towards the end of the year as farmers responded to falling dairy prices.  Volatility is not a new phenomenon within the dairy sector.  Since 2007, weather-related supply shocks, disease issues, trade restrictions and so on have led to significant movements in international dairy commodity prices and resultant dairy farm prices.  The global dairy market entered 2014 at strong price levels, but international commodity prices started to ease in spring, with declines accelerating throughout the summer period.  Excess supply, combined with a slowdown in Chinese import demand, a Russian ban on the import of dairy products from the EU, Ebola in west Africa and falling oil prices, placed downward pressure on markets in the latter half of the year in particular.  The average global price of whole milk powder in US dollar terms fell by 42% in December 2014.<br/><br/>Looking ahead to 2015, the sector is facing some challenges.  However, as we progress into February, the outlook seems set to improve.  There have been some signs of a stabilisation or uplift in global dairy prices in recent weeks.  Dry weather in Oceania is accelerating the seasonal decline in Australian and New Zealand milk production.  Recently, the New Zealand dairy co-op, Fonterra, has reduced its milk volume forecast for the 2014 to 2015 season by 3%, reflecting the impact of dry weather on production.  Its previous forecast in December had suggested that output would be similar to last season.  This will have an impact on the availability of dairy exports in international markets.  Recent currency movements, with the euro now hitting a nine-year low against the dollar, as already noted, has made European dairy exports more competitive on international markets.<br/><br/>Looking at the medium- to long-term prospects for dairy, there are significant growth opportunities for the industry.  Population growth is certainly a key factor in driving the global demand for food, with the world population growing by a little over 75 million people a year, to reach just over 8 billion by 2025.  It is a population that is urbanising as it is growing.  Today, 54% of the population live in cities, and in ten years that figure will rise to 58%, driven almost entirely by Asia and Africa.  It will grow to 66% by 2050, when the world&rsquo;s population is set to reach 9.6 billion people.  That urbanisation, associated with the growth in the middle classes, changing lifestyles and shifting dietary habits toward more protein-based foods and dairy products, is what is really driving growth in the global demand for food.  According to an OECD working paper, some 3 billion people will join the middle classes over this and the next decade.  It can be seen from the chart that this market will be located predominantly in Asia.<br/><br/>Part of the reason the population is growing, and a major feature of demographic change in the developed world, is that people are living longer.  As they live longer, they recognise the link between diet and health.  They want to feel better, to look better and to lead an active and healthy lifestyle.  Health and wellness is undoubtedly the single biggest long-term driver of change in food markets today, and those who can leverage it effectively through nutrition are those who will ultimately prevail in the marketplace.</p> <p>This will be a key driver for value added dairy ingredients going forward</p> <p> In the meantime, that surge in demand finds expression in the latest ten year rolling forecasts from the FAO and OECD, projecting the growth in the global demand for protein, here in the form of livestock and fish products in the period to 2023.  The red bars rising highest on that chart represent the exceptional growth projected for the developing countries, or emerging markets; the dark green represent the more sedate growth projected for the developed countries, namely, those in the OECD area; and the lighter green is the average, namely, world demand.   It is notable how among the highest growth categories, representing the bars rising highest, are those representing the growth in dairy products.</p> <p> The scale of growth comes into perhaps sharper relief when expressed in terms of the total growth expected over the period, with total global consumption set to increase by 27% but increasing to 34% in China and more than 40% in Africa and India in the ten years ahead of us.  The FAO-OECD projections to 2023 were released in the middle of 2014 when prices were still high, albeit they correctly anticipated the subsequent decline which we have been recently experiencing.  As we can see from this chart, they are nevertheless projecting that dairy product prices will continue to remain well above historic levels over the ten year forecast period.  They similarly acknowledge that price outcomes are likely to exhibit variations around the projection trend, unsurprisingly, whether due to weather, or other changing conditions.  By any measure one might take, the medium-term prospects for dairy remain positive and Ireland, with its international focus and presence in the regions of the world where demand is growing fastest, is well positioned to benefit.  Markets will remain keenly competitive and it is a matter for each and every individual enterprise to pursue every competitive edge one can leverage in the global marketplace.</p> <p> It was with this in mind that in 2014 Bord Bia, in association with the industry, undertook an evaluation among key customers in three target regions - the EU, China and Saudi Arabia as a proxy for the Middle East - to assess buyer priorities, perceptions about the positioning of Ireland and our industry, and the role of sustainability in light of the earlier launch of origin green and the sustainable dairy assurance scheme.  A common thread running throughout our research was the emphasis placed on security of supply, with some referring to the need to move towards long-term agreements and extending to the search for acquisitions and alliances in China.  In this context, the growth potential opening up in Ireland has been a source of keen interest by customers.  Similarly, the perception of cost competitiveness and the potential of Ireland based on its grass-based production systems were seen as clear strengths.  In Europe, price and quality are not surprisingly perhaps the primary drivers of choice, yet managing volatility is an issue frequently cited as a concern for buyers.  The emphasis on price and quality &ndash; Ireland is perceived to be strong on quality &ndash; does not provide a basis for differentiation and the creation of value according to our research but sustainability does and Ireland is well placed to capitalise on our sustainable, grass based dairy production and the opportunities arising in the global marketplace.</p> <p> It must also be evident to us all that just as a large and expanding segment of our dairy exports are destined for markets in Asia and Africa, an understanding and insight into the use of our dairy ingredients and products by consumers in different cultural contexts is critical if we are to add value and differentiate the Irish dairy offering and support our customers in these markets.  Our consumer insight team in Bord Bia, in agreement with the wider dairy industry, has been working with industry to build these insights through ethnographic consumer research, which involves our researchers visiting and staying in the homes of consumers, shopping and eating with them and looking in their fridges, to better understand consumer attitudes and behaviour.  All the faces members see in this and subsequent images are people and families that participated with our team in this research.  The research advances our understanding in these markets, supports the industry&rsquo;s customers, while identifying product and messaging opportunities around dairy products among different demographic cohorts.</p> <p> We have most recently extended this work to the Chinese market where our researchers spent 300 hours over recent months, visiting and staying in the homes of consumers in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, studying their attitudes and behaviours, conducting brand clinics, and exploring how Ireland can uniquely position itself in order that working with Irish suppliers, including global infant formula players with a presence in Ireland and their Chinese partners, we can build an awareness and preference for our dairy products among premium Chinese consumers.</p> <p> On 26 March next, Bord Bia is organising Marketplace International where we will bring almost 450 buyers to meet more than 170 Irish food and drink manufacturers.  Up to 300 of these buyers will come from overseas markets and on the day there will be approximately 4,500 pre-scheduled meetings.</p> <p>The sustainable dairy assurance scheme, SDAS, which is an integral part of Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green initiative, was formally launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in December, 2013.  The scheme is a unique dairy farm standard in that it is a national programme that incorporates both quality assurance and sustainability criteria, and includes the routine carbon footprinting of all farms.</p> <p> This standard was developed in consultation with all industry stakeholders.  It has created a new challenge for competitors, just as it is winning the respect of customers.  The aim of the scheme is to demonstrate to our international customers at a business-to-business level that our dairy is produced in a sustainable manner and uniquely we can prove it.  The SDAS is currently being rolled out at farm level with 8,454 applications received to date, and a smaller number have been released for audit.  We have conducted 4,667 audits.  Some 3,793 of those farms are certified and we are on track to have most Irish farmers participating in the scheme by the end of 2015.</p> <p> The Irish dairy industry - through the Irish Dairy Board and the Kerry Group - is funding a Bord Bia campaign to the tune of &euro;1 million annually to promote the scheme and Origin Green to global customers, with a focus on China, the Middle East and Europe.  Bord Bia has developed an Origin Green ambassador programme involving ten talented, experienced and motivated graduates.  Their role is to raise the profile and understanding of the Irish food and drink industry&rsquo;s Origin Green initiative among key audiences internationally; to provide the Irish food and drink industry with a comprehensive insight into global best practice in sustainability; and to be a cohort of executive talent to lead the Irish food and drink industry in its ambition to become recognised as one of the most sustainable in the world.</p> <p> As part of this programme, the individual Origin Green ambassadors have already undertaken a series of six-month placements in leading international accounts such as Abbott in Colombus, Ohio; Coca-Cola in Atlanta; Fair Oaks Farms in Indiana; McDonalds currently in Chicago; Marks &amp;amp; Spencer; Metro; PepsiCo; Subway; Tesco; Walmart in Bentonville; Subway; Unilever; and Nestle.  Each one of these accounts is involved in the dairy industry.  Some of these individuals have been involved in dairy procurement and sustainability projects within these global leaders, which has had a direct and positive impact on these companies' attitudes towards Ireland as a leading global supplier of sustainable dairy.</p> <p> This is a world in which reputation is everything.  In a competitive dairy marketplace where countries compete with countries, reputation is critical.  This chart shows how some 30 years ago, 80% of the value of companies that made up the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 was made up of tangible, physical assets.  Today 80% of their value is made up of intangible assets, like reputation.  If reputation is so important to the valuation of businesses on the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500, it is also important for industries and countries.</p> <p> While we acknowledge that the dairy sector will experience periods of volatility due to a range of external market factors - in particular, weather - the medium to long-term trend is positive.  An industry focussed on market diversification, innovation and adding value, while seeking ways to differentiate itself in an ever-competitive market environment will help to insulate the sector from the worst effects of market volatility.</p> <p> I would like to thank the Chairman and other members for affording me the opportunity of addressing the joint committee this afternoon.  My colleagues and I will be happy to address any questions that members of the joint committee may wish to ask at this time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015020300006#J00300"><p>I thank Mr. Cotter for making his presentation to the committee.  The issue of concern that started us on this round of engagements was the effect that volatility in the market will have on farmers.  If the market price drops, processors figure out their margin and will drop the price to primary suppliers.  The problem is, however, that farmers cannot drop the price of fertiliser or inputs.  Ultimately, therefore, in this see-saw operation, a farmer at the bottom will bear the weight of depressed prices.</p>  <p>  It is great to tell us that, in the long term, prices must rise if the population increases and the weather becomes worse.  That is like telling us that oil prices must rise over time, but we all know that.</p> <p>We all know that.  However, if one was investing a few years ago, who would have predicted that oil would be at $49 per barrel now?  If one had invested on the basis of $100 per barrel, one might not be around to enjoy the $200 per barrel that will probably be the price in the long term.</p> <p> With all of this ongoing volatility, our concern is about how many farmers will get so squeezed that they will not be there to rise again.  On average, 18,000 farmers and 54,000 members of households are affected by this issue.  It is not enough, therefore, to say that we can sell more of the product.  The price at which the product is sold or, more importantly, the price the farmer will get for the product will determine the profitability for the farmer.  One of the concerns we must have is that more of the product with increasingly tighter margins for the primary producer and less room for error might produce a great deal more to sell and be very good for Ireland Incorporated's exports, but it might make the farmer far more vulnerable in the long term.</p> <p> What message can Mr. Cotter give us in respect of how the scenario he is painting will affect the farmer?  We accept the importance of processors and so forth in this situation, but our main focus on this arose from a concern for farmers and particularly for young farmers who might have invested a good deal in the dairy industry in recent times on the basis of expanding quotas and good prices for milk, be it by getting into dairying as a new producer or by rapidly expanding what they already had.  They might be very easily affected by volatility and might find their profitability impaired to the point of not being able to sustain their farms.</p> <p> Our understanding from the Irish Dairy Board is that New Zealand, Australia and the US have special arrangements or trade deals with China.  Would it be possible for Ireland to get a similar trade deal or would it have to be a Europe-wide trade deal?  Our understanding is that those countries have preferential access and, as Mr. Cotter said, China is a very important market.  Could he also outline the price at which China is buying?  Unlike many of our other industries such as beef, vegetables and so forth, where much of the product is going on the European Union market, this is traded worldwide.  Will we therefore be subject to world prices for the vast majority of our sales in the dairy industry?  At present, world prices are not sustainable for the Irish dairy industry.  I understand it would be equivalent of 20 cent per litre to the farmer.  When we get into these third markets what determines the price to the farmer and what price does Mr. Cotter consider sustainable over the next 12 months or two years?  There is a break even point and if it drops beneath that, given the large amount of third country exports this country has, would we be very vulnerable in terms of price?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015020300007#K00200"><p>I thank Mr. Cotter for his presentation.  It looked at the world market, potential markets and the growth involved for Irish dairy products.  My question is related to the question asked by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I do not come from a farming background but I listened to the discussions in this committee and in the Chamber and saw the newspaper reports throughout last year about how the ending of quotas this year was a great opportunity for Ireland and that farmers could step up production.  Suddenly, however, there was a crisis two weeks before last Christmas because prices were collapsing.  It appears that the farming model in Ireland might not be suited to the expansion that is required or to the potential for expansion that exists.  How does Mr. Cotter see the type of farming in Ireland fitting into the expansion that is to be delivered over the next few years?</p> <p>I am talking here mainly about family-run farms.  It seems to me that what has not been said is that they will have to move to industrial-type production rather than the traditional model we have had here.  What are the views of the representatives of Bord Bia in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015020300008#L00200"><p>I thank Mr. Cotter for his optimistic overview of the dairy industry.  It is great to see such optimism in the presentation but we all saw what happened with the building industry when the banks threw caution to the wind and handed money out left, right and centre.  We all saw where that ended up.  I would hope that we could promote caution in the dairy industry in terms of the message we are sending out.  Dairy prices are dependent on world markets and we should not get carried away with expansions.  Expansion should only be undertaken where it is viable and where those involved will get a proper economic return for their investment.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year we had a crisis in the beef sector.  Our major export market for beef is the UK but Irish beef was being downgraded on supermarket shelves in Britain.  The red tractor brand, which is the brand mark for British beef, was suddenly getting a premium price in comparison to what producers of Irish beef were being paid, partly because there was an oversupply of Irish beef.  Is there any danger of emerging markets like China and India developing their own agricultural sectors to such an extent that they will start replacing our products with their own?  I know such countries can never be fully self-sufficient, but is there not scope there for them to produce more themselves?  Could the premium products that we are trying to promote in China, including infant formula and so forth, be replaced by Chinese products eventually or by products from some other country?  We are doing well in China at the moment, but there must be a possibility of other countries entering that market and competing with us in the future.  In that environment, Irish produce would become a commodity rather than a premium product.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the expansion possibilities in India and China.  I know that the latter is a vast country, with enormous variations in terms of weather and so forth, but can its agricultural system move from its current model of peasant farming to one which is capable of competing with us?  In that scenario, we will not be able to command premium prices.  While I welcome the optimism on display here, I feel that cautious optimism is required because we all saw what happened in the building industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015020300008#L00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Cotter and his colleagues and thank them for their very comprehensive overview of the situation.  It is important to refer to the reason for this particular discussion today.  There is a fear that younger farmers in particular may have over exposed themselves in their quest for the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow.  They may not be aware of the possible consequences in the event of price volatility becoming a big issue.</p>  <p>  I should say that I am not trying to be negative here.  I produce milk myself and know what is involved.  Mr. Cotter referenced New Zealand in his presentation and ten or 20 years ago, the dairy industry in that country was quite similar to ours now.  Dairy farmers were looking forward to increased production and they also believed that there was a big pot of gold waiting at the end of the rainbow.  In some of this committee's previous discussions, however, we have learned that the New Zealand story is not as rosy as we thought.  We will find out more about that in a discussion scheduled for later on.  New Zealand farmers increased production rapidly and extensively but their profit margins have not increased substantially.  Many farmers in New Zealand are to the pin of their collar financially and animal welfare is becoming a major concern.</p> <p>Even though we were looking forward to being the New Zealand of 2020, we are now afraid that 2020 may not be what it should be.</p> <p> To pick up on Senator O'Neill's point, China and other new markets are coming on stream, which is very welcome.  We need more of them.  We are concentrating on China at present and it is the big place to be.  Is there a danger we are putting all of our eggs in one basket?  As Senator O'Neill stated, in the coming years China's domestic production will expand and we will be pushed out of the market and replaced by locals.  They will learn from us and others and they will not want us any more.  We will then be in a delicate situation with regard to where we will go.  Other markets are being developed but China is the big area.</p> <p> Bord Bia's ambassadors and initiatives are to be welcomed.  When did it begin to ramp up marketing?  Have staff levels been increased in recent years?  Apart from ambassadorial roles, do members of staff have other specific roles in marketing a product?</p> <p> We have a good product to sell and serious advantages with Origin Green and our grass-based system.  Who are our main competitors when it comes to marketing what we have to sell?</p></speech>

He addressed reality because in the space of a month the statistics from the Irish Dairy Board reflected the impact of the weather and the fall off and reaction from the Fonterra Co-operative in New Zealand.  I have known Mr. Cotter from more than 35 years, and I never heard him go out of his way is to set out an unrealistic situation.  He deals with reality.  Over the past 12 months I have cautioned that Irish farmers and anybody thinking of getting into dairy farming should tread warily and be careful.  There is no pot of gold in any dairy enterprise, and it would be foolhardy and irresponsible of anyone to project such as an image, and I have always held this view.  People should be very careful in this context.</p>  <p>  We had better get it into our skulls, because if we do not we are not dealing with reality, that when China and New Zealand sneeze we catch pneumonia.  Let us not think we are kings of the Kop.  What we do we do very well, but we make a very small contribution to the overall situation.  My colleagues are right that very soon some of the farmers, particularly in the Asian and Chinese markets and ultimately in the African markets, will develop.  At other levels we are promoting them to become self-sustaining and to produce themselves.  The saving grace is that populations are increasing by 75 million or 80 million a year.  This will be critical.  Population growth is very important but so is the ability to purchase.  The population needs to generate income to flesh this out.  This population growth, our quality, reliability and sustainability are important, but I must concur with what Mr. Cotter stated, that it is the intangible assets which will distinguish one in the field.  Nobody else will stand still.  This very competitive and we must be on our game or we will lose.  Intangible assets such as reputation and technology advantages will be important.  It is a function of the volatility of issues such as income and the weather, which come together to leave the market in a state of flux.  The new ambassadorial style, what I call in-your-face marketing, is interesting.</p> <p>Is it specific to dairy, the issue we are discussing, or is it used in the other industries, for example, beef?</p> <p> We broke into the infant formula market in China because of a problem in that country.  If the problem is remedied, what will happen in the long term?  We have become the premier producer of infant formula, with top-class products and niche developments that have seen us shine on the world market, but it would be foolish to believe that our position is not subject to threat, notwithstanding the expertise and quality that has gained us our prominence as world leaders.  Other people will hare after our position, so we cannot rest on our laurels.  This is the story that the witnesses have just outlined.  We must continue improving and remain production-focused in terms of the quality and technology that will achieve a market share for us.  It is time to batten down the hatches and be wary and not to do anything that is too wild.  When headage payments for sheep were introduced, everyone wanted to be a sheep farmer and everywhere one went the fields were snow white.  Some people did not even know the difference between sheep and something else.  I urge caution and "steady as she goes".  We will make it, but this year will be challenging.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Cotter for his excellent presentation.  Like Deputy Pringle, I am not from a farming background but a small, rural town that relied heavily on the surrounding farming economy.  I am increasingly aware of the changes and challenges.  In my home town of Drumshanbo, we have a food hub that has developed a concept that I understand is unique in Ireland.  There is only one other such hub.  Bord Bia has been involved.  Hopefully, the initiative will lead to more jobs thanks to much of what the witnesses have outlined.</p>  <p>  Are the continuing sanctions on Russia having an impact on food exports?  Ireland has been taking a multilateral approach with its European colleagues.  Bord Bia does not have a view on political matters, but must the effects that the crisis in Ukraine has been having on us be reviewed?</p>  <p>  Regarding the growth in the global middle class by 3 billion people, while the emphasis has rightly been on China and India, it is interesting that Africa will see considerable growth during the next decade as it creates a middle class.  What emphasis does Bord Bia place on that market?  It is one of which I am not very aware, although a well-known Limerick man heads up one of the largest agrifood companies in Zambia, Zambeef Products.  When I visited Zambia seven or eight years ago as part of a foreign affairs delegation, he spoke about how different the African food market was from the European one.  Is this a challenge?  Is the market different from the Chinese and Indian markets?</p>  <p>  While 70% of our dairy exports are sold outside the eurozone, there has been a decline since 2013 in the UK market, which accounts for 30% of those exports.  Regardless of the emphasis that has been placed on Asia, how are we positioning ourselves in the UK market?  Is it a stable market into which we can sell more food and, in particular, dairy exports?  Does Bord Bia have a plan?</p> <p> It is a wonderful idea to have an Origin Green ambassador because it allows access to the main suppliers of food and drink internationally.  What is the medium to long-term ambition of Bord Bia in this regard?  I appreciate that it puts high-profile and well-educated graduates into these companies on a six-month placement.  Mr. Cotter said the initiative would have a direct and positive impact on these companies' attitudes towards Ireland.  I presume the initiative is about sales and increased exports.  Is there a plan to increase exports among these companies, who presumably supply a large percentage of the world's food market?  Bord Bia knows the percentage, which I presume must be very high.</p></speech>

What proportion of cheese exports are from big processors?  I refer to cheeses such as Dubliner, Kilmeaden, and the various brands that have been developed.  What proportion of exports are from small farmhouse industries?  What proportion of exports are pasteurised and unpasteurised?  Is there a growing market for farmhouse, organic and unpasteurised cheeses?</p>  <p>  Is it fair to say that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has made it harder for small producers to do business?  I have been told that the reason for this is the fear of an E. coli outbreak or any type of outbreak in Ireland.  An outbreak would damage Ireland's reputation and thereby damage dairy exports, particularly to China.  France has a huge export market and has lots of unpasteurised cheeses for sale.  Is there a reason Ireland must be different and put all its eggs in  one basket?  As a country, we love, for the sake of simplicity, to keep all our eggs in the one basket, be it construction or inward investment, and in this instance big processors supplying pasteurised products.  If one likes chewing gum then I am sure one will love some of the cheeses we export, but other producers aim for a different market.  What is Bord Bia doing to protect the latter?  What is being done to protect them from attack by the Department?  Producers should not need protection from the Department, but it appears the need to do so has increased.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to outline how both boards have meshed together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Cotter" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015020300011#O00500"><p>I will first address the question on optimism.  I like to think that if members look back on my presentation they will see that everything I have said is referenced.  For example, there is projected growth in the world population of 75 million people every year up to 2015, with the middle class growing by 150 million people per year.  The projections come from the OECD and the United Nations.  The percentage growth in milk demand of 2.4% per year came from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the OECD.  Everything that I have put forward is based on projections by reputable third parties.  Therefore, members can have confidence that projections for the future are as good as we will get in terms of what is available.</p>  <p>  The forecast for the future is very positive.  The world's population is expected to grow to 9.6 billion from where it is today at 7.3 billion.  As a result, there will be a huge growth in demand for dairy products over the period.  If we do not supply the products then other countries in the European Union and countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States will do so.  This is an opportunity for Ireland.  The Irish dairy industry - farmers and dairy processors alike - have recognised the opportunity and invested.</p> <p>They envisage a very difficult year, but they are all taking a longer-term view in the belief that there is a future in the industry because Ireland is good at what it does.  Ireland produces its dairy produce from grass.  It is one of the most competitive countries in the world at producing milk.  It has an opportunity from which it cannot turn away.<br/><br/>With regard to the specific questions, we saw an increase in global production of 9 billion litres last year.  There was an increase of 4.8% up to the November period, at a time when demand was growing at 2.4%.  This was exceptional and based on the very good weather that all of the leading producers around the world have been experiencing.  It is a very unusual situation which means that Irish farmers will face difficult circumstances this year.  Prices will certainly be under significant pressure, as everybody has acknowledged.  Dairy farmers everywhere will have to face these difficult circumstances.  Arguably, Irish dairy farmers are in a better position than many to withstand the difficulties and survive this very difficult period to be ready for the better times ahead.<br/><br/>Not everything is in our favour in terms of free trade agreements.  China serves as an example in this regard.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v rightly pointed out, New Zealand and Australia now have agreements with China, which places them in an advantageous position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Ireland.  The United States does not have such an agreement.  Such an agreement would have to be forged between the European Union and China directly rather than between Ireland and China.  As far as I know, there does not seem to be any immediate prospect of this.  However, the Deputy rightly focused on a development that would be very positive for the industry were it to occur.<br/><br/>Deputy Pringle mentioned the family farm and asked whether we are facing the prospect of the industrialisation of farms.  Family farms and grass-based production systems are what put Ireland in its advantageous position today.  That is what is encapsulated in our Origin Green programme and the Sustainable Dairy Assurance scheme.  With regard to our international competition, we have something unique that nobody else has.  We have green credentials that nobody else can emulate and which we demonstrate every day.  Every 18 months, every dairy farmer submits himself for audit under a unique scheme that includes carbon footprint measurements in respect of water and biodiversity, in addition to food safety and animal health and welfare.  We have something that nobody else in the world can point to - namely, our uniqueness.  We are green and can prove it, and Irish farmers can compete with any country not only in terms of cost competitiveness and efficiency but also in terms of how we present our unique position and how we differentiate ourselves on the global market.<br/><br/>On the question of whether China and India will replace Irish produce with their own eventually, it must be noted that China has 1.3 billion people and is struggling to feed them.  When one considers that the world's population will grow by an additional 2.3 billion by 2050, one realises the market is also growing.  China will never be able to feed itself in the manner one might envisage.  While it produces milk, it is doing so under very difficult constraints.  It may need approximately 40 cent per litre in order to compete and produce profitably.  The ICOS representatives, who are to contribute after me, may have more information on that.<br/><br/>Ireland is very competitive in China, just as it is in any other location.  It is important that we build our market position while we have an opportunity.  There is a window for us to do so.  The industry has been very successful in this regard.  Everyone involved in it should be encouraged to continue to embed the progress in China.</p> <p>There are more Irish brands in the Chinese market which are familiar to consumers.  This gives us a certain security compared to brands that are not as well known to the consumers.</p> <p> On the question of whether lessons can be learned from New Zealand, Deputy Deering will know that there are.  Ireland can learn and is learning in terms of what New Zealand has done as it expanded over the past 30 years at a time when we were held to our current ceiling.  A positive consequence of the difficulties may be that it will make everyone think twice about the level of investment needed in the family farm system and the risks that need to be taken.  There are lessons to be learned from New Zealand.  I have no doubt but that Irish farmers will take them on board.</p> <p> On the question of whether we have put all our eggs in one basket with regard to China, out of a total &euro;3.8 billion in exports last year, if dairy-enriched powders are included, &euro;400 million of that &euro;3.8 billion went to China.  It is still a relatively small part and we are not dependent on that market in that we sold into 137 other markets last year.  Our industry is globally distributed and that will stand to it.  </p> <p> The industry's main competitors are other suppliers in the European Union, those expanding their production, as well as Australia, New Zealand and the United States.  We are all competing in a global market and we have to differentiate ourselves in whatever way possible to stand out from those competitors.</p> <p> With regard to Bord Bia staff levels, members will be aware that Bord Bia has been constrained by the public sector embargo on staff recruitment.  We have approximately 90 people and 11 international offices.  We are spread thinly but I believe that by undertaking a range of measures we have managed to expand our global footprint.  We have approximately 100 auditors working full time on our behalf.  They are outsourced but they are working directly as Bord Bia auditors.  We have a marketing fellowship programme which puts 20 experienced graduates into the market every year and they are linked into our offices.  We have ten Origin Green ambassadors and also graduate staff.  We leverage other resources in the marketplace.  We have a small core staff but in my view we have a much bigger global footprint that is efficiently distributed in support of the industry.  Everybody works to support the food industry.  We also have specialist staff for the dairy sector, including my colleague, Mr. David Owens, who is sector manager for dairying.</p> <p> Senator Mooney has put his finger on the matter with regard to the Origin Green ambassadors.  They are opening doors in leading global organisations that would never have opened before.  Such organisations are very reliant on the reputations of their brands in the global market.  The ambassadors have gained access for the industry.  As a result, some of those organisations have visited Ireland for the first time and others plan to visit in the coming months.  They are discovering that we have a dairy industry in Ireland that is unique, something they had not previously realised.  It may be a surprise to some that companies such as PepsiCo and Coca Cola, who are global leaders, are involved in the dairy industry.</p> <p> The sanctions on Russia have presented a difficulty for the dairy industry in particular last year.  It has put pressure on dairy markets and when combined with the slow down in Chinese buying, these situations have had a significant impact on the industry's current situation.  Senator Mooney also mentioned investment in Africa.</p> <p>Senegal was one of the markets in which we undertook consumer ethnography research, in which our researchers live with consumers to understand the marketplace.  This is an important market for Irish dairy products.  We are working with the dairy industry in identifying such markets where we need this type of understanding.  We will continue to do this into the future in Africa and south-east Asia in particular.  The reason we conduct that ethnographic research is because of the importance of understanding different cultural practices in such different markets.</p> <p> I will now address our plans for the UK market.  The population of Europe will peak in 2020 and will then start to decline, but uniquely the population of the UK is set to grow by 10 million in the next 25 years.  That is a market right on our own doorstep.  Irrespective of the other markets around the world, we must look at this major important market right on our doorstep.  It is the largest deficit market and with the recent depreciation of the euro, we have an extra advantage and a window of opportunity that will last for some time to rededicate ourselves to building our position in the UK market.  The Senator is absolutely correct; it is an important market and we must develop it.  We cannot ignore it.</p> <p> My colleague, Mr. David Owens, will address the farmhouse cheese sector which is relatively small in terms of the total cheese output.</p></speech>

In terms of exports it is just around 1,000 tonnes, so it might be just less than 0.5% of our total cheese exports.  It is quite a small-scale industry but has a large number of very small players.  Deputy McNamara might know some of them himself.</p>  <p>  In response to the question on pasteurised versus unpasteurised, I am not able to give the Deputy an answer but a colleague who works very closely with the farmhouse cheese sector would know which brands and cheese types are pasteurised.</p></speech>

France has probably the largest market and has both an internal and export market for its cheese.  Some of these unpasteurised French cheeses are readily for sale in Irish supermarkets.  These French products are subjected to less stringent testing than Irish unpasteurised cheese.</p></speech>

Since the launch of a &euro;1 million annual fund and the introduction of the sustainable dairy assurance scheme, we have established a dairy subsidiary board which has representation from the various dairy processors, from farm organisations and, of course, from the Irish Dairy Board.</p> <p> The &euro;1 million fund to promote the scheme internationally and to promote Origin Green for the dairy sector internationally is sourced directly from the Irish Dairy Board and the Kerry Group.  Everything we do, wherever it is in the world, is in partnership with our industry.  That is a basic principle of how we operate right across the food sector, including the dairy industry itself.  We do not do anything that is not in partnership, supported by industry and driven by the marketplace.  We have a close relationship with the Irish Dairy Board which is a positive supporter of the Origin Green initiative.  Hopefully, that answers the question.</p></speech>

Managing price volatility is not really the job of Bord Bia.  However, part and parcel of Bord Bia's job is ensuring that markets are secured and held.  The presentation was encouraging in outlining how Bord Bia is seeking new markets.  The overview has to be positive but, as Mr. Cotter will gather from members of the committee, in light of all that has happened in the economy generally, with every opportunity there is always a health warning not to lose the run of ourselves, no matter who is involved.  According to the New Zealand model, people have become busier.  They are more indebted but are not making more money.  There are all sorts of possible issues surrounding the environment and animal welfare as well.  That is why it has played on the minds of members here.</p>  <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending the committee.

We appreciate greatly the opportunity the committee is giving us.

The big challenge from the industry's perspective is market weakness.  We have one chart that demonstrates the level of movement from the peak.  The two lines relate to butter and skimmed milk.  They range from a return of more than 40 cent to 20 cent, so that shows the level of flux that must be dealt with by the industry.  The bottom portion of that graph demonstrates clearly where intervention levels are.  Intervention levels are at about 20 cent.  The European intervention system at 20 cent is relatively inadequate because it is eight or nine cent below the cost of production.</p>  <p>  The ongoing volatility is exacerbated by many different contributing factors.  One of them is the short-term global supply.  For the past 18 months, weather across the globe ranging from North America to New Zealand has been favourable to agricultural production.  This culminated in a production increase of about 4% or 4.5% while demand was only growing by about 2%, so therefore there was oversupply.</p> <p>China was huge in the market in the earlier part of 2014 and would have imported huge quantities of whole milk powder.  I suppose this was driven by its experience in 2013 when it experienced a shortage, an internal drought and a problem with foot-and-mouth disease.  New Zealand was not in a position at that time to balance up for its internal deficit.  That fuelled China's appetite for huge imports in the earlier part of 2014.  As a consequence, it has exited the market for some time and this has exerted a significant downward pressure on the market.</p> <p> While it is a political decision and we respect the authority of the EU to make political decisions driven and informed by what is going on in Ukraine, the Russian embargo dumped a lot of product back onto the market for which new homes had to be found.  A total of 250,000 tonnes of cheese and 30,000 tonnes of butter needed a new home.  While we are not exporting huge quantities directly to Russia, it nevertheless has driven the oversupply in the European situation.</p> <p> The superlevy is another issue.  Quotas end on 1 April 2015.  All of the opportunity that was spoken about earlier exists and farmers have been gearing up to deal with the opportunity to expand for the first time in a generation.  We have had the imposition of quota for more than 33 or 34 years, so naturally farmers have been taking the advice that there is an opportunity to expand and have been looking at their relative position 30 years ago when the size of the output from the Irish dairy industry was equivalent to that of New Zealand.  Over that 30-year period, New Zealand's output quadrupled while Ireland's stood still.  There was that pent-up need to expand.  Farmers are slightly ahead of the game in the sense that they have been building up stock numbers.  This is a requirement because one cannot turn on the milk tap.  It is not like a water tap that one can turn on.  One needs to plan well in advance.  The Commission committed to a soft landing.  Our experience has shown that this has not worked and the soft landing has not materialised.  Ireland is almost 6% over quota with a bill in the region of &euro;100 million.  It would probably be reduced if the current spell of cold weather continues.  We are looking at that type of impact.  The bill across Europe could be &euro;2 billion.</p> <p> ICOS has been working to combat the problem for five years.  It would have had speakers at many of the annual events at which they would have spoken about the challenges and opportunities.  We would have tried at European level to convene a coalition of like-minded people to see if something more could be done.  Those on the other side of the debate were greater in number so there was no great chance of success.  We now find ourselves at the eleventh hour with a huge problem.</p> <p> Much of the challenge is around cashflow management.  This year, 2015, looks like a perfect storm of negativity, with milk prices forecast to be at least ten cent per litre back on the average for the past year and a half.  This would not be overstating the impact.  This takes &euro;500 million from the cashflow of farmers and rural areas.  If one factors in the superlevy bill, which may cost farmers &euro;100 million, one can understand the difficulty faced by this industry, particularly farmers as the first link in the chain.</p> <p> The other thing that has happened over the past year and a half is that farmers have funded the early years of the expansion and much of that has been funded from the cashflow generated in 2013 and 2014.  Some of that needed to be capitalised but probably the banking facilities that were available to farmers were not as robust as they might have been and their appetite to lend might not have been as deep as people would have perceived it to be.</p> <p>Farmers would have used a certain amount of their cash-flow and this put them in a very invidious position heading into 2015.  If one takes into account those two points and the fact that the income return from the market for 2014 was strong and then considers that the cash has been spent but that we will still have to pay tax bills in the latter part of 2015, one can see that these are three huge challenges which need to be dealt with.</p> <p> In the context of industry strategies, Food Harvest 2020 identified volume targets.  That is fine and reference was made to volume and opportunity in the discussion which took place earlier.  There is an aspect of all of this which cannot be overstated, namely, the need to ensure the resilience of the sector.  We need to grow margins and not just volume.  If we learn anything from New Zealand, it is that volume alone is not the answer.  We must also ensure that family farms are economically viable.  It is from such farms that the industry itself and the jobs to which it gives rise flow.  In recent times we have been working to discover whether there is a way to counter volatility.  Some progress has been made in the context of farmers being offered the option to fix a price in respect of a proportion of the milk they produce.  This idea has not gained a great deal of traction, however, because when prices are high it is difficult to persuade someone to accept a fixed price in the mid-30 cent range when they can get 39 cent on the market.  It is also very difficult to get consumers to buy into the concept when retail prices for milk are low.  This concept must be further developed and expanded because there are huge advantages, not just for farmers themselves but for the industry in general and for end users.</p> <p> Back-to-back contracts could play a role in this regard.  These relate to circumstances where everyone is prepared to buy into a concept whereby there needs to be a reasonable share of the cake for all involved in order that the overall position is sustainable in the long-term.  In America, there are options around future markets and future contracts.  For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange sets the daily price of grain and farmers can take hedging positions as a result.  It is our contention that some sort of mechanism of this sort should be developed, whether in Ireland or at European level.  Serious consideration should be given to this matter.</p> <p> We welcome the announcement earlier today that funding is being made available for research on moving up the value chain, which is to be carried out in Limerick and at Moorepark.  In the context of the development of the Irish dairy industry, there is an absolute necessity for us to move up the value chain.  We must not just chase volume, we need to chase value as well.</p> <p> People are bound to ask what we want.  In the first instance, we are seeking a resolution to the superlevy bill of &euro;100 million.  The challenge in that regard will be massive.  However, removal of the butterfat adjustment could allow us to save up to one third of that amount.  The latter is technically possible.  In 2008, for example, the impact of the bill was halved when a 2% proportion was identified.  There is a further 2% to be obtained now by adjusting our butterfat coefficient.  The Irish dairy industry has been making progress in terms of adding more value to milk by means of the solid content.  When the base was set, butterfat levels were much lower than is currently the case.  The superlevy is not driven by litres, it is driven by percentage butterfat.</p> <p> We are of the view that serious consideration should be given to the level of intervention that exists.  The latter is far below the cost of production and is set at a base of approximately 20 cent, which clearly does not send a positive signal to buyers.  If the base was between 24 and 26 cent, it would send a very different message out to the purchasing community across the globe.  This could give rise to a two-pronged benefit because if overheating took place, product that is placed in intervention could be released into the market in order to cool things down.  It is not just a one dimensional tool and it could give rise to various opportunities.  It is worth examining and we ask that serious consideration be given to it.</p> <p> Other jurisdictions have access to volatility management financial tools.  Such tools are not allowed in Ireland.  In good years, those in such jurisdictions can place a certain percentage of their profits in accounts that are similar to the SSIAs people used to have in Ireland.</p> <p>The moneys involved can be drawn down at some future date.  It is at this point that they attract taxation.  We are not advocating that tax should not be paid on profits.  However, such facilities would assist in smoothing out some of the fluctuations between good years and poor ones.  The instruments to which I refer are available to people in Australia and New Zealand.  I am of the view that, from a national perspective, we should consider introducing something similar here.  There would probably be a short-term cost involved but, as time passed, money would flow back into the Exchequer.  These measures are designed to negate some of the worst exigencies of what is happening in the context of cashflow and cash management on farms for 2015.  In the long term, we need to continue to support innovation and technology.  We are of the view that, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the third level institutes, we need to encourage the pursuit of excellence and impress on people the need to add more value.</p> <p> There has been a great deal of discussion about infant formula.  I would not underestimate or understate the traction Ireland has in the infant formula market internationally.  Part of our impact in this market is driven by the fact that we have good-quality assurance systems and we are seen as being trustworthy because we do what we say.  Some countries prefer to use formula that is produced externally rather than internally.  Reference was made earlier to the huge opportunity that exists in this regard in China.  Each baby in China has four or five people interested in it as a result of the policy which obtains there.  As a result, no expense is spared to ensure that there is a high-quality product available.  We can supply that product, promote the image of Ireland and move up the value chain.</p> <p> Mr. Cotter referred earlier to the aging population.  With aging comes challenge.  In that context, there is a major opportunity regarding clinical nutrition and high-protein supplements for people who are aging in order to prevent muscle wastage.  The opportunities do not exist just at one end of the spectrum; they extend the entire way along it.  As a result, we need to invest in technology and build a platform of expertise in order that we might add value to the products we are already supplying.</p> <p> Market access is critical.  Some people selling into China have a marked advantage as a result of the zero-rate tariffs they have obtained.  The 15% rate we are obliged to pay represents a huge impediment.  Work needs to be done, probably at European level, to free up this and other markets.  The recent trade delegation to China was very well organised and extremely successful.  All the major players from the Irish industry took part in that mission and were on message, which was good to see.  However, the barriers to entry need to be addressed.</p> <p> I thank the committee for its time.  If the Chairman or members have any questions they wish to pose, we will endeavour to answer them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Murphy" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015020300019#W00200"><p>It is a great honour to come before the committee today.  I wish to warn everyone that there will be a small amount of repetition because I will be making some of the same points as previous speakers.  I will commence by making introductions.  I am a dairy farmer operating in Ireland but I also have interests in the United States and New Zealand and I do a little work in Chile.  Mr. Hurley was dairy editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>for 31 years.<br/><br/>I want to talk about the specific difficulties for dairy farmers in 2015 and place these in the context of ongoing measures.  We are of the view that everything fits together.  Our first slide shows the price of milk in the period 2005 to 2015.  Members can see the level of volatility.  In 2009 the price was 22.6 cent, whereas in the previous two years it was much higher.  We are of the view that the price in 2015 is going to be way down.  Again, in the past two years it was much higher.  We do not know what the position will be exactly, but this pattern is likely to be repeated every three, four, five or six years.<br/><br/>We would like to refer to what we term the grass-poor route.  When quotas were effectively removed in Northern Ireland in 1995, people brought heaps of stuff onto their farms, racked up their costs and moved away from grass.</p> <p>Their costs would increase from 30 cent to 35 cent a litre.  They will be in deep trouble this year.  We are probably advocating for the need to go the grass rich route, which is probably about 70% to 75% of the diet.  It takes a lot of skill on the part of farmers.  We want farmers to get help to enhance their skills in those areas.</p> <p> I refer to specific difficulties for dairy farms in 2015.  The super levy will be perhaps &euro;100 million.  There may be a milk price drop of 30% from 27 cent to 23 cent; we do not know.  There will be growing debt-to-fuel expansion and tax bills next November will top up on a very good 2014.  Many farm families will have serious cashflow difficulties in 2015, in particular if a low milk price year coincides with that, as it did in 2009.  Many farmers took two or three years to dig themselves out of a hole.  That may or may not happen again.  The actions of the Irish State, the Government or State bodies could be considered to alleviate these cashflow problems.  Lobbying in Europe has been mentioned.  I will leave that to ICOS, the IFA and the ICMSA.  </p> <p> Banks need to be considerably more flexible and I will give two particular examples.  The Teagasc funding needs to be maintained, and possibly increased, in terms of upskilling existing farmers and adequately training young farmers coming into the sector.  Many people are very happy with the state of training, but I question that quite strongly.  </p> <p> We will be hit periodically by very low milk prices.  Do we have the necessary risk management tools in place?  The US has wheeled in some risk management tools, to which Mr. Keane referred.  </p> <p> Sometimes it is useful to look back as a possible predictor of the future.  I read Des O'Malley's book during Christmas, in which he said he was disappointed with the Irish response to EU membership.  I would contend that the facts do not support that statement.  In the period 1964 to 1974 Irish milk production jumped by 59% and from 1974 to 1984 it jumped another 76%.  In that 20 year period Irish milk production almost trebled.  There was hugely enhanced knowledge and cutting-edge world class research at Moorepark.  </p> <p> If we follow sensible policies we can do at least as well over the next 20 years.  Looking forward to 2020, an increase of 50% will not be a problem and is very close to being a done deal.  Unless policies are sensible, we may end up like New Zealand where 25% to 28% of farms run into problems.  We need to ask whether we should put some sensible policies in place.  The real challenge is doubling production by 2025 and trebling it by 2030.  It is a question of whether we will have a superb dairy industry in the future.  We will have a very good dairy industry, but we could have a superb one.  </p> <p> On rebuilding a prosperous Irish rural economy, Dublin is flying ahead, as we all know.  Many areas of rural Ireland are still in recession.  We have to build on sectors of comparative advantage which can transform the rural economy.  In terms of tourism, the Wild Atlantic Way is superb and other ideas like that would be wonderful.  A major plank should be a flourishing dairy industry.</p> <p> What is the major prize?  Dairy exports at constant prices could be trebled from &euro;3 billion to &euro;9 billion.  Unlike multinationals, which are very welcome, the money generated from exports of dairy products largely stays within the State.  It whirls around and creates many jobs.  </p> <p>It is predicted that if we trebled production, the number of jobs in the dairy service sector would double.  Dairy farm incomes would increase by &euro;560 million per annum.  It is calculated that the rural economy would increase by &euro;4.25 billion every year.  It would be a rural stimulus.  It would create opportunities for young people to get into farming and for the beef and tillage sectors, which are currently losing money.  It is a major prize.</p> <p> I apologise if the next slide is slightly technical.  It refers to a range in production costs and percentage grazed grass.  The axis on the left refers to costs in terms of cent per litre, and runs from low cost at the bottom to high cost at the top.  The right refers to situations where there is no grazed grass in the system, which correlates to a very high cost, and on the left it is shown that very high levels of grazed grass correlate to a very low cost.</p> <p> I draw the attention of the committee to Northern Ireland.  When Northern Ireland was quota free, in effect, people put a lot more feed into the system, drove up production costs, considerably increased output and worked harder at a higher level of risk for lower profits.  It was madness.  The Irish industry is now at approximately 60% grazed grass.  Instead of moving to 40% grazed grass, we need to put a lot of effort into ensuring that our farmers move to the left of the axis.</p> <p> One can ask what the relevance of that is, but it is quite simple.  It takes skill.  There is a dual challenge in terms of upskilling existing farmers.  We need a strong advisory service.  Our research is excellent, but we need an increased emphasis, and probably resources, on getting that message out to every interested farmer.</p> <p> I also want to emphasise the need for excellent skilled young people to come into the industry.  About 600 people a year are entering agricultural colleges, which sounds good, but I question the figures.  I am aware that the Chairman had the benefit of going through the farm apprenticeship board, as I did, which provided excellent training schemes.  In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, about 75 highly trained people went through that scheme who were well fit to manage farms.  That stopped a number of years ago and is currently being revived.  About 16 people a year go through the schemes.</p> <p> Kerry estimates it needs about 75 people.  I do not have estimates for the rest of the country, but the figure of 16 can be compared with a demand which is close to 300.  One person is responsible for people coming through the system.  There is a need to put some money into the sector.  The return will be significant.  It is one area in which the State can invest and get a return of well over 100% per year every year.</p> <p> Banks need to have more flexible policies and I will highlight two such areas.  On interest-only periods, Bank of Ireland, which has a clearly stated policy, has said it will grant an interest-only year once in the lifetime of a particular loan.  A loan could be for a term of ten or 15 years.  As we saw, one can expect years where income is reduced, and over the course of a loan a farmer could easily be hit three or four times by such years.  Banks need to be more flexible in respect of interest-only periods.  For example, after 2009, during which some farms were wet and milk prices decreased, farmers required two or three years to climb out of that hole.</p> <p>Sometimes when businesses are basically sound, it is necessary for banks to extend an interest-only period for two years.  The State now has a big influence on the banking system.</p> <p> The second point on banks I would like to highlight concerns the financing of young farmers who do not have hard assets as collateral.  Irish banks say they will give an applicant very little money without hard collateral, be it land or property.  We all know a particular policy costs the State &euro;60 billion odd.  A young Irish farmer finds it very hard to get even &euro;30,000.  The banks state one may get more but, from my experience of talking to young people, I understand they are not getting it.</p> <p> Two young Irish people whom I know very well are in the United States with UMB.  US banks tend to be either very big or very small.  UMB is the strongest of all the small rural banks.  I met its representatives at a fairly high level in the past 12 months.  They said they always consider three factors.  The first is the person and his or her track record and integrity.  The second is the actual project, and the third is collateral.  If two of the three factors are very good, the bank goes ahead with the loan.  Irish banks are not doing this, except for tiny sums.  With regard to future development, we are choking the potential of many very good young people.  We need to move on that.</p> <p> On supporting the introduction of risk-management schemes, I refer members to the last US farm Bill.  Reference was made to greater "covering forward" or "fixing forward".  Glanbia is doing that to some extent and it should be encouraged more.</p> <p> In the last US farm Bill, the United States brought in a kind of insurance policy to insure for margins.  It does not put more money into farmers' pockets over the cycle but protects the profit margin where there are awful dips.  Even in the bad years, it will give one a certain profit margin.  We should examine this very seriously.  There is no reason we could not implement such a proposal.  It should be self-funding.</p> <p> With regard to the direction Irish farmers should take, when quotas are lifted I hope to God we move left.  If we do we will have a very vibrant, strengthening dairy farming industry.</p> <p> My final message is that we have a considerable comparative advantage in Ireland in terms of producing milk at low cost from grass.  More grass means more money in farmers' pockets, more sustainability and more processing and exports.  If we follow good policies, we can build a superbly internationally competitive dairy industry for the benefit of Irish farm families and the rural and national economies; let us all play our part.</p></speech>

I thank both ICOS and Positive Farmers for their contributions.  We will take a lot away from what was said here today.</p>  <p>  I will address the second submission first.  If I understand the delegates correctly, they are saying we should keep the input cost down and focus on profit rather than production.  One will not have any final choice; one can hedge one's bet on the sales price but one does not have final control over that since markets will be volatile.  One will not have any control over the external input costs.  All one can do is try to reduce the external input cost by focusing on grass.</p> <p> Over the past two or three years, I became fascinated by a certain phenomenon that I encountered by accident.  I went down to Cork where people started complaining about being undercut in the liquid milk market.  The complaint was that the milk was coming in from Northern Ireland.  Not being very familiar with the dairy sector, I was a little taken aback in the beginning until I understood what had happened.  Effectively, the quotas disappeared in 1995.  One would think it would be easier to grow grass in the south of Ireland than in the North as there is a longer season and more grass.  Therefore, I could not understand how the prices could have been worse in Cork.</p> <p> I am interested in hearing whether to delegates believe I am correct in my analysis.  When the quota was introduced in the North, farmers increased production considerably.  That, in itself, forced prices down somewhat, particularly in the liquid milk trade as the milk must be got rid of.  They opted for very dear systems.  Do we have evidence that the margins in the North went down?  Logic would ordain they had to go down.  One cannot have a dear system without an effect on the margin.  This is certainly the case in the liquid milk market, which is at the lower end of the market.  Irrespective of how much one increases quantity, one is left in a more vulnerable set of circumstances.  Although one might sustain one's profit by producing a greater quantity, is the delegates' message that one is more vulnerable to shocks, including those associated with health and price?  If that is the case, we should consider the Northern Ireland situation, in particular.  The phenomenon is somewhat akin to what happened in New Zealand, but that occurred on a mega-scale.  If what I describe happened right here on this island, we have a lot to learn.  I am certainly getting a clear message from the delegates today that farmers should increase grass productivity and keep the cattle on the grass for as long as possible.  If I understand the delegates correctly, they are saying the grass element should amount to 75% while the remaining elements should be reduced to 30% or 40%.</p> <p> I call food production with a narrow margin and a vastly increased amount of production "treadmill farming".  One is doing a lot of cycling but not going anywhere or gaining.  I am worried that while the industry and Ireland Inc. want an increasing amount of product in order to have more sales and, consequently, more money coming into the country, there is a danger.  I worry that the uninitiated, inexperienced or people who always chase the money when told where it will be, or those who always chase the rainbows, will get drawn into this and become victims of what should, in the longer term, be a good story for those who are experienced, have their costs right, know what they are doing and have a high level of productivity without losing the run of themselves.</p> <p> With regard to investment, the delegates are saying one should invest and focus on profit and safety.  A sad lesson we learned last week is that 58% of fatalities on farms occur on dairy farms although they comprise only 17% of farms.  Therefore, farmers should invest in safety.  Having a safe farm adds to profitability in any case, and it is normally more efficient.  There should be more focus on profit than production.  I presume the delegates will refer to the need to focus on inputs, such as grass, rather than getting gold-plated equipment or milking parlours.</p> <p> Some of the points the Irish Dairy Board made are the same as those made by the delegates today.  On seeking a resolution to the super-levy issue, I understand the Minister is saying it cannot be done.  Are the delegates saying that, as an Opposition spokesperson, I should be telling him to go back and try harder?  Do they believe it is not a dead letter and that it is possible not only to obtain a deferral but also a butterfat adjustment or some kind of write-off?</p> <p> My second question for ICOS, which is a fair one, concerns whether there is any way of reducing the super-levy fine by storing milk on the farm or elsewhere so it may not be purchased by the co-operatives until 1 April, rather than in the last week of March.</p> <p>By how much could the super levy be reduced if milk could be held back for a week or two?  What is the rule about when one has to buy the milk?  Could Mr. Keane's organisation store the milk for the co-operatives?</p> <p> I am interested in what Mr. Keane said about volatility management.  A proposal on tax was put by the farming organisations this year, and I think that is an issue for the future.</p> <p> With regard to preferable access to the Chinese market, do the witnesses believe that enough is being done at European level to get into China without any of the import tariffs?</p> <p> When everything went wrong in the economy and people could not get credit, and good projects could not get funding, having worked both as a co-operative manager involved in agriculture and in industry I began to wonder whether we had made a classic mistake in selling the ICC and ACC banks.  Whether it be a co-operative bank or a State bank, is there a need for small, industry-specific banks that would not deal with property or anything like that but focus just on productive industry and agriculture, as did the ACC in the past and the ICC in terms of industry?  If there was a bank with, say, &euro;2 billion capitalisation, and it need not be very big, we might be able to hive off part of DIB into it because we own it, and we should not be in a hurry to sell it.  Do we need specialist banks that know the industry and can take the approach the witnesses are talking about?  I agree that the number one priority is the person.  I do not care what one goes at in life.  I often point to the fact that a good friend of mine who has a degree in Celtic studies has one of the only knitwear factories left in Ireland.  The only difference is that it is located on the Aran Islands because he became very skilled and kept upmarket.  Logic would tell one he should have closed down a long time ago but he is doing very well.  He is hugely successful because he changed with the markets.  He focused on the high end of the market and one can only buy his product in the dearest places.  However, that success was to do with the creativity of the person and their project, not the location.  Is it more likely that a specialist bank would adhere to the criteria the witnesses spoke about rather than general high street banks that are trying to deal with 1,000 different types of industry at the one time?</p></speech>

I will focus in particular on Mr. Murphy's presentation.  I read with interest last week the document he and Mr. Hurley produced, given their history and experience of the situation in New Zealand and Northern Ireland.  In that document they referenced the difficulties developing in Northern Ireland in particular, which are probably on a smaller scale to what is happening in New Zealand.  They make reference to advice, Teagasc and where we should be going in the future.  I suggest that they should be giving advice to farmers in Ireland more so than some of the people who have been giving advice in recent years.</p>  <p>  There is a figure that has not been mentioned.  I am open to correction on it but I do not believe I am wrong.  Twenty years ago, in 1995, farmers were receiving 27p per litre for milk.  That is the equivalent of the price we are getting now.  Like Mr. Murphy, I am a small dairy farmer in Carlow and that is the price we are getting at the moment.  Input costs have probably quadrupled since then yet we are expected to take the same amount of money.  Therein lies the issue.  The inputs is the major issue that has not been addressed in those 20 years.</p> <p>We just keep producing and getting the same type of figure.  Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hurley rightly referenced that every few years an opportunity arises for the price to increase for a short period, but it reduces just as quickly.</p> <p> The big issue is the young farmer who may have been involved in a different area of expertise in recent years, say, tillage, who decides to take the opportunity of going into milk production because he sees the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow.  He may have a large block of land ideally located, in theoretical terms, for producing milk but the investment he will need to do that is where the problem arises.  If he has to invest &euro;300,000, &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 to get into the system, he will be facing major difficulties if we have the volatility that was mentioned and if he is basing his potential profit on a price of 30 cent per litre, with no guarantee of that for the future.  He is the one who is probably facing more difficulty at the moment as opposed to someone who has been in the system for many years who may only increase numbers by 20 or 30 as opposed to entering from the bottom, so to speak.  He is the one who needs more help and advice from everybody, be it in terms of skills or a bank in particular.  It is in that area that he needs the help.</p> <p> The banks have a huge part to play, and I understand we will deal with those at a later stage.</p></speech>

Efficiencies are crucial, and I agree with what the witnesses said in that regard.</p>  <p>  The super levy will be the first obstacle to any development we might have.  If we are facing levies of &euro;100 million, that is a substantial amount of money.  The farmers liable for those fines are the people we need to develop the industry, and they are starting from a very difficult position.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has left but he asked if anything could be done about that or if he should be doing more as Opposition spokesman.  Where we stand has been clearly laid out.  In terms of a European context, we have been told not to knock on that door, that we know the rules and we should adhere to them.  However, it is an issue on which we should be able to get some leeway in the coming period.</p>  <p>  The elephant in the room, so to speak, is the liquid milk situation.  It is not being discussed but it is the key issue.  Mr. Murphy concentrated on grass production, which is crucial, but as I have said in previous meetings, we seem to be heading for a situation where we will be looking for a drop of milk for our Corn Flakes in a few years time.  It is not possible to produce milk during the winter months for the money we are being offered.  The input costs are too expensive and we will end up in a situation where we will not have a constant supply of liquid milk at that time of the year.  I would welcome Mr. Murphy's comments in that regard.</p></speech>

As dairy farmers we are price takers.</p> <p>As Deputy Deering suggested, input costs have increased very substantially.  If 75% of the diet is grass, it is cheap and within one's control.  I am strongly suggesting that people control what they can and be less exposed to extremely dear inputs.  In Northern Ireland, there is a fair amount of evidence that dairy farmers average 85 hours per week right throughout the year, and not just in busy periods.  Teagasc did a survey and it suggested such farmers get approximately &euro;5 per hour return for their capital, labour and management.  They cannot afford to hire other people.  There are more financial problems on the approximately 4,000 dairy farms in Northern Ireland than there are on all other farms on the island of Ireland.  We should learn cheaply from some of the mistakes they have made so as not to repeat them.  In a year like this there will be incredible stress on some of those farms.</p> <p> A point was made about new entrants, capital costs and so on.  It is not something that anybody can control but I advise anybody going into beef, sheep or tillage farming to spend at least a year or two on very good dairy farms.  It would be a fantastic investment of anybody's time, as that person could avoid so many mistakes.  If a person is investing in all the bells and whistles but if the skills are not good and he or she is hit with a year like this one straight off, that person would be very exposed.  It is important to have really good training systems for young people coming into the industry.  That will lead to good outcomes in all sorts of areas and one would get a better return on training than any other single element.</p> <p> I cannot comment on the liquid milk system and it is probably more of an ICOS issue.  I am not involved with it.  I can comment on inputs.  We are a pretty expensive country when it comes to buying farm inputs.  The same drugs that could cost &euro;75 here might cost &euro;20 in Missouri in the United States.  Some of these drugs might be made in Ireland but there seems to a policy of pricing according to the market.  With human health medicines, for example, perhaps the State has not got the best value in certain areas, and that may be the case in certain areas in dairy farming.  I am surprised farm organisations have not tackled that area a bit more.  The Government cannot do much but farm organisations could do quite a bit.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland may have expanded operations but until recently, there were only approximately four specialised agricultural advisers.  In New Zealand, the ratio is probably one per 100 or 150 farmers but we are off that scale.  It is a shame that Rabo, which had more expertise in the area, has taken the decision to move from this country.  Part of the reasons banks seek hard collateral is because they do not have the experienced personnel to evaluate the people and projects.</p> <p>On the question of whether there should be a State bank, currently none of the banks has enough expertise in the agricultural area.</p></speech>

I understand and fully appreciate the political arena in which Commissioner Phil Hogan operates and take full cognisance of that.  With the superlevy butter fat co-efficient adjustment, it is a technical adjustment within the powers to be done.  That is my understanding under the Common Agricultural Policy programme.  It is doable from a technical perspective.  I do not know what other areas of impediment exist but it is a technical possibility and we advocate that it be looked at.</p>  <p>  Storing milk is not an option.  We are selling ourselves as a quality-assured milk-producing country and our products are quality assured to the highest standard.  The facility for storing milk more than two or three days is not there and it is not recommended that it be stored any longer than two or three days at most.  All players in the industry will do everything they can from the co-operative perspective to facilitate as much storage as is practical without compromising the quality of the end product.  We do not have great latitude in that respect.</p>  <p>  There was mention of the EU perspective, China and barriers to trade.  At EU level, agricultural exports relative to other types of exports are not significant but they are significant from an Irish perspective.  More work could and should be done.  We do not want to talk ourselves into a depression as there are major opportunities, and a small proportion of a huge market would satisfy the appetite for growth in Ireland.  We will not move the dial much but there are opportunities.  If we had an entry point, it would be very advantageous.</p>  <p>  The banks have moved somewhat in the past year to try to be more user-friendly, but lending against assets is a major restriction.  I do not advocate reckless lending in any way and we have a fair idea of the impact that may have had not only on the economy but on the people.  Nobody would advocate that.  Nevertheless, there is much merit in having a bank with specific expertise and which deals with one industry.  It should have an in-depth understanding of challenges and opportunities.  I do not wish to volunteer any more than that now but one can see how there would be an advantage in having a specific set of skills.</p>  <p>  Deputy Deering made a point about prices which is exactly on the money.  We have not got to the price he outlined but the indicators are that we may be getting there.  There is some good news from New Zealand, with the global dairy trade up 9%.  Perhaps a foot has been put under the fall but the level is still very low.  Input costs in Ireland are very high and we are price takers when it comes to fertiliser and imported feed.  Our use of nitrogen is in the tenths of 1% for the world.  Nobody will rush here with thousands of tonnes of nitrogen and we are a kind of add-on to Europe.</p>  <p>  I agree with Mr. Murphy's comments about efficiency and we must drive it at farm level.  There must be a major emphasis on training.  I do not disagree with any of those comments.  The farm apprenticeship board and the training programme, which lasted three or four years, gave participants a wealth of different experiences.  They did not just listen to one prophet and they had the advantage of having three or four different producers scattered throughout the country.  They came out of it with a fairly broad perspective.  There could be a major benefit there.</p> <p> New entrants to farming, regardless of their age, be they young or middle-aged, face a big challenge because of their lack of experience and the initial capital expenditure needed to start up.  They are in a vulnerable position to deal with volatility.  I would caution against being heavily leveraged.  The biggest impediment to the development of any of the industry is being too heavily leveraged as one cannot sustain any dip for a period of months, not to mention years. </p> <p> Much value has been driven from the liquid milk market both at processor and producer level.  Much of the overflow from Northern Ireland, because of the state of the industry in England and the flow of milk from England to Northern Ireland, would have given those producers an opportunity to expand at a great pace.  In terms of costs, it was probably not managed particularly well, but there were opportunities for processors to acquire milk that was contracted on the spot market at very competitive prices and sell it into a market in the Republic where milk was contracted, in other words, where people had contracted volumes to supply milk 365 days of the year.  Those volumes would have commanded a premium commensurate with the extra costs attaching to it.  Some 25% or 26% of the milk consumed in the Republic is from Northern Ireland.  I am not whingeing about that other than to say that there was not a level playing field in the sense that the southern Irish processors were buying on contract whereas milk from Northern Ireland was being sold here having been bought on the spot market and there were times that they had huge price advantages.  They have driven value from the food chain from the processor right back to the producer.  I would not disagree with that.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the presentations but I had to briefly step out.  Two questions came to mind as I was listening to the contributions.  Much of the discussion seems to be around our being able to command a premium for our product being green, so to speak, and being of a good and higher quality.  Is any premium being delivered in terms of price for farmers, if our product is extremely marketable, of high quality and the result of better quality production or is all being kept within the co-operatives and factories?  In terms of driving efficiencies to improve matters for dairy farmers, what evidence is there that efficiencies can be gained by the current structures that are in place?</p></speech>

For example, farmers in Holland who let their cows out to graze for 126 days a year for six hours a day are paid a bonus.  The Dutch perceive there is a benefit to be gained in the market from being able to tag on to the product that the animals were grass-fed.</p></speech>

When the market reaches rock bottom, whether it was 2006, 2009 or 2012, the price to the primary producer while it is very weak never falls to the full extent of the commodity price that is quoted on the world stage.  One would have to deduce from this that an element of the premium definitely gets transferred down the line.  Farming organisations and others would contend that is not a big enough share and I would not necessarily disagree with that.  It is not an easy task to get transparency on it.</p> <p> On Deputy Pringle's question on whether efficiencies can be gained and measured, they can.  At farm level, there is huge divergence in terms of the top 10%.  To take the top and bottom figures in any scale is an extreme, but to take the top quartile and the bottom quartile, there could be variances in production costs of 8 cent to 10 cent.  That is a big earn, there is a huge value addition to be gained on farms if we can educate farmers and have a sufficient knowledge transfer to execute that.  In other words, if we can bring the bottom quartile anywhere near the level that the top quartile is performing, there would be a huge economic benefit not only for those farms but for the communities in which they are located.</p></speech>

There is a huge variation between those at the top and those at the bottom of the scale.  There is a great job of work to be done to execute a knowledge transfer to improve the efficiency and the managerial skills of the farming population.</p>  <p>  This chart demonstrates some of the shift from a high input system, which involves feed concentrates and a good deal of confinement, shown on the right-hand side, to a low input system, in which much of the milk would be produced from grass-fed animals.  The further left one moves along that chart the greater the efficiency of the operation.   </p></speech>

That is what happened to farmers in Victoria in Australia during the past 15 years.  They had high costs.  They went down that route.  In other words, they went in the opposite direction.  They had a system of low grass-grazing and high costs.  The social carnage that has occurred there during the past decade has been horrific in terms of physical illness, mental illness, marital break-ups and suicides.  I do not want to forecast that happening here, but Northern Ireland is on the verge.  With the current drop in prices, the Northern Ireland producers are getting, on average, 30 cent to 35 cent per litre.  Milk prices are going to drop to 25 cent to 27 cent.  There will be serious problems there in the next 15 to 20 months.  When we are talking about figures loosely like this, we must remember that we are talking about people, farm families, children on farms, marriages and social cohesion.  If anything, that is one of the main reasons farm families should be keeping their costs down.</p></speech>

Is that not the case?  The far right-hand side of the graph is based on cattle that are housed all year round and fed grain.

The top 5% of farmers are more than three times as profitable as what would be regarded as general average.</p> <p>Second, I will throw out some interesting recent information from the United Kingdom in respect of the different approaches, namely, the grass-rich and the grass-poor approaches.  While the very best farmers can skin the cat in almost any way, I refer to the average industrial wage in the United Kingdom.  In the case of those people who, broadly speaking, were following the grass-rich route - it was not very rich but with a reasonable amount of grass of more than 50% - it took 127 cows to make the average industrial wage.  In the case of people who were more to the right on the graph we presented, it took 459 cows to make the average industrial wage.  Moreover, in a year like this, even if one had 10,000 cows one still would be making a huge loss.</p></speech>

One must take into account a greater input from non-grass sources because of the nature of the production cycle.  Does the Deputy not agree that essentially, it all boils down to price?  Everyone agrees the price premium for undertaking to supply milk 365 days a year has not been reflected in the general pricing differential and that has been the problem.</p></speech>

On telling him it was a leaf of grass, he replied it was not; it was a total diet for a cow going to produce milk.  I then said that was a different way.  It was a man in Ardfinnan and I believe the witnesses know about whom I am talking.  While the point is that it is difficult, nevertheless I believe this has been really interesting.</p>  <p>  Before I wind up this meeting, I note we are lining up the banks to appear before the joint committee next Tuesday because there is no doubt about their intricate involvement, being part of it and having skin in the game.  The level of expertise is a huge issue, as the ability to evaluate a farm business plan, particularly from somebody who does not have a strong asset base other than a single farm payment cheque, is a skill that must be honed and developed and this has been a problem.</p>  <p>  To summarise, this is an area in which I am fascinated anyway but there are immediate, ongoing, mid-term and long-term issues.  The immediate issue is about intervention prices.  The European Union intervention price is practically useless, because it is the world market price and does not bear any resemblance to the actual cost of production.  The joint committee has made this point previously.  As for the superlevy and the soft landing, I am not sure what can be achieved but the solution to it will be political.  There also is the immediate issue of bank flexibility.</p>  <p>  In respect of ongoing issues, there is the idea of the insurance policy, forward buying and selling, as well as the tax code from the perspective of sheltering money.  While the Minister for Finance has stated the five-year averaging introduced in the last budget may address this in part, it possibly is not enough.  There also is the issue of access to markets.  In addition, there obviously is the issue of banks, credit and the way in which young farmers can be recognised.  Within the tax code at least, there have been some developments in share farming partnerships that facilitate a person who has land but has nobody to farm it or who has decided not to farm it.  Consequently, there may be ways in which this could overcome the capital expenditure issue.  There could be a ten-year plan in which 10% could be reduced from one's equity in it over the period of the ten-year plan.</p>  <p>  In the long term, the major issue is knowledge transfer, which is about training enough farmers.  As Mr. Michael Murphy stated, I am a product of the farm apprenticeship board and have the marks to prove it.  While it certainly was a learning curve, it definitely benefits those who wish to get into management.  The new course to which he referred is a brilliant course that needs to be developed.  In general, education has been a key component in trying to manage and develop the economy and society.  The joint committee cannot emphasise education enough because for rural-based economic communities to thrive, at their core must be well trained farmers.</p> <p>These farmers generally, albeit not necessarily, will be young and will be supported by the advisory service, the financial services and obviously, by the political system.  The joint committee will finish its hearings on this subject with the banks next week and I hope it then will come up with a short report.  It should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the relevant information, recommendations and whatever should be sent to the various interest groups and stakeholders.  Hopefully, we also will be able to forward this to all the witnesses who have appeared before the joint committee for their observations, as although the report will have been concluded at that point, that still would be worthwhile.</p> <p> This meeting has been valuable regardless of the fact that few members are present.  Everything is recorded and Ronan McCabe, the policy officer who is assisting us, certainly will help members in drafting what we hope will be something constructive on the entire issue.  It is fascinating to hear that the real challenge will be doubling the output by 2025 and trebling it by 2035 and this undoubtedly is attainable.  I refer to one point that has not been mentioned although it was mentioned in other contexts.  The earlier comment made by representatives of Bord Bia on the sustainable dairy assurance scheme was that this is environment-proofed.  The perspective of the people who eventually will go out and sell the product is that in a system like this, Ireland's product actually is good for the global environment.  This is because in other countries, it takes perhaps three or four times the acreage or hectarage of land to produce the same amount of milk as do farmers here.  I let everyone else speak first and then they cannot come back at me.</p> <p> I thank all the witnesses for their attendance and for their presentations.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, whom the Chairman introduced, who work in the relevant areas in Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland's objective is to start and grow world-class Irish enterprises, targeting global markets.  For companies to maximise job creation, they need to grow their sales, and for a small economy like ours growth in export sales is crucial.  Achieving this objective will require a major drive for scale across all of our clients.  Recognising the diversity of the Enterprise Ireland client base, our supports are tailored to reflect each company's stage of development.  This ensures all of our clients, from entrepreneurs and start-ups, to exporting SMEs and large companies, can access the appropriate supports to help them to scale and grow.  I propose to take members briefly through our clients' impressive employment performance in 2014 before presenting our key achievements and plans in the specific areas identified for today's discussion, after which my colleagues and I will respond to any questions members may have.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland client companies continue to see year on year jobs growth, and in 2014 they created 8,476 new jobs which was the highest net gain in the history of the agency.  This impressive employment growth demonstrates the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland.</p> <p>Enterprise Ireland-supported companies directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.  In terms of their overall contribution to the economy, Enterprise Ireland's clients account for more than &euro;20 billion in expenditure in the economy and support more than 300,000 jobs directly and indirectly, equating to 16% of the total workforce.</p> <p> The outlook for new job creation in 2015 is positive and Enterprise Ireland's focus will remain on ensuring that our clients have access to all of the necessary supports required to build on this momentum.  This focus, coupled with our priority to support entrepreneurship across the regions and develop strong, export-focused, ambitious Irish companies that can win new business, will mean more jobs for Ireland during the next 12 months.</p> <p> One of Enterprise Ireland's core objectives is to deepen the pool of start-ups with the potential to scale internationally.  To achieve this, we need to ensure that we are working with the most ambitious and capable founders and placing them on faster growth trajectories.  Traditionally, female founders have been an under-represented source of start-ups and the potential of this cohort has not been fully realised.  Our aim is to harness this potential, support the creation of successful female-led international businesses and achieve great outcomes for Ireland.</p> <p> Since 2012, Enterprise Ireland has developed an integrated strategy to encourage more women to start innovative businesses with high growth potential.  Our work in this area is encouraged by the increased policy focus at Government level on ensuring that the under-representation of women in the start-up ecosystem and across the business community is addressed.  We provide tailored supports aimed at increasing the level of female entrepreneurship.  These include: highlighting strong female role models leading successful businesses; female-specific financial supports such as a competitive start fund; networking supports that recently saw the development of a web-based networking platform; and the development of female-specific development programmes, for example, Going for Growth.  We have already seen a 250% increase in the number of female-led start-ups from 12 in 2011 to 43 in 2014.  This includes a significant increase in the proportion of female-led high-potential start-ups, HPSUs, accounting for 18% of the total number of HPSUs compared with 7% in 2011.  While this is significant progress, we need to build on it and continue to focus on this important issue.</p> <p> The mix of dynamic, growing Irish companies and leading multinational companies, MNCs, in Ireland is creating an exciting pool of highly-skilled people working in innovative areas.  However, a key challenge facing many of the companies that have ambitions to scale is the availability of skills.  Enterprise Ireland has a clear understanding of our clients' skills needs and it is our role to work with the third level sector, Departments and other agencies to develop an appropriate response that will work to fill any gap.</p> <p> In the short term, programmes attracting critical skills to Ireland are central to ensuring the continued growth of Irish companies in tech and related sectors.  IT's Happening Here, an industry initiative that is supported by Enterprise Ireland, is an example of a programme that has been successful in attracting overseas talent to Ireland with clients successfully recruiting through the online portal and events.  Enterprise Ireland is also a key contributor to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation-led committee that is charged with promoting Ireland internationally as a destination for high-level ICT skills.  A national initiative is being developed and will be implemented as part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs.</p> <p> Our client skills unit works with our sectoral and start-up teams to understand our clients' needs, interacts with national policy makers and skill providers to ensure that their needs are fully reflected and contributes to the development of longer term solutions that will address gaps.  Areas that clients have highlighted include ICT skills, engineering and selling skills.  It is important to acknowledge the considerable efforts that have been made to increase the supply of skills such as Springboard, ICT conversion courses, JobBridge and Momentum.  Client feedback on these programmes and initiatives has been positive, with clients telling us that they are effective in addressing the skills gaps.</p> <p> In addition to the work we do on the wider skills agenda, Enterprise Ireland has developed a number of flagship programmes focused on supporting leadership and management capabilities in Irish companies.  In 2014, 246 managers participated in these programmes, with well over 1,000 participating in the past four years.  Key programmes include Leadership 4 Growth, the international selling programme and Excel at Export Selling, which are designed to equip Irish companies with the necessary tools to reach their export sales potential in global markets, as well as Access Silicon Valley, a further programme.</p> <p> In 2014, two new programmes were launched.  First, Innovation 4 Growth was developed to meet the needs of ambitious and entrepreneurial Irish companies seeking to use innovation as a key way to unlock opportunities in the marketplace.  Second, a pilot programme called Platform 4 Growth was launched which uses a blended delivery model combining online and face-to-face delivery.  It means participants enjoy the traditional benefits of peer networking while also having greater flexibility to custom design a learning package by mixing and matching modules that are best suited to their specific needs.</p> <p> With regard to regional development, the launch of 31 local enterprise offices in April 2014 represented a major commitment by Government to support entrepreneurship, micro enterprise and small business throughout the country.  Enterprise Ireland, through its centre of excellence, provides support, training and guidance to the 31 LEOs to ensure a professional and consistent level of support is provided to all start-ups and small business.  Significant progress was made during 2014.  The priorities for continuing the integration process in 2015 include gathering customer and client feedback and finalising the development of local enterprise plans and metrics.</p> <p> With two thirds of Enterprise Ireland's client companies located outside of Dublin, regional development is a key element of its 2014-16 strategy.  Our role in this space is to drive and nurture regional enterprise all the way from an originating idea, at local level, to the high potential start-up companies taking on global markets.  Our regional development supports are focused on four pillars of activity: prospecting for a pipeline of early stage start-ups and high potential start-ups; working with established clients and potential exporters in the regions to maximise job creation potential and to support internationalisation; working with the higher education sector to further strengthen the innovative capability of companies based in Ireland and support the commercialisation of research; and working with LEOs, community enterprise centres, IDA Ireland and others to enhance the ecosystem supporting enterprise in the regions.</p> <p> Enterprise Ireland's regional enterprise strategies are currently in development.  We are working closely with the Department as it develops a whole of government approach to regional enterprise development.  The four pillar approach was piloted in the midlands in quarter 4 of last year and included a regional enterprise forum with 120 people from the public and private sector in December.  The midlands strategy is nearing completion and the process will be refined and rolled out in the remaining regions this year.</p> <p> On behalf of Enterprise Ireland, I thank the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and the many Departments and agencies across the system.  They are critically important in enabling us to drive the development of Irish companies.  We are very proud of the record performance of our companies across the country in 2014.  The level of increased employment achieved is remarkable and endorses the strategy we have embarked on to 2016.</p> <p> Significant progress has been made in each of the areas being discussed today.  However, it is important that we build on this success over the 2015-16 period.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our female entrepreneurship team, which is led by Ms Jean O'Sullivan, on the substantial increase that we have seen in female led start-ups since 2014.  We will continue to work to fully realise the potential of this important source of start-ups.</p> <p> Client feedback endorses the approach that has been taken by Enterprise Ireland and others to address the skills gaps of our clients.  This is a longer term issue and we will continue to engage with the HEA and others to develop solutions that meet the needs of our clients.</p> <p> Supporting balanced regional development will continue to be at the centre of Enterprise Ireland's activity.  The Enterprise Ireland's centre of excellence has worked closely with the LEO network, since its establishment, providing professional and back-up support which will continue to be a major focus of our work in 2015-16.  </p> <p>Enterprise Ireland is keenly focused on its ongoing mission to start and grow world class Irish enterprises, targeting global markets and to move forward into 2015 with the objective of playing a central role in the implementation of the 2015 action plan which was published last week.</p></speech>

I welcome all the witnesses and appreciate their attendance.</p>  <p>  I shall be honest with Ms Sinnamon by saying I would have liked her to be more specific.  I want to know what we need to do to encourage more women into the sector and to achieve a more equal balance between the number of men and women. </p>  <p>  I wish to highlight another serious issue.  Taxation prevents people from starting up a business but it was not mentioned in the presentation.  </p> <p> I have another problem.  Last week at our meeting, reference was made to the shortage of people with selling skills.  Just because one does programming does not mean one can sell.  To be honest, I believe the information is a bit general.  I believed it would be more specific.</p> <p> My third point is on skills.  Rather than having a general statement on female entrepreneurs, I would like a statement outlining what we need to do from a practical point of view to encourage more women.  I would like examples.  The report is a bit general.  I refer to the availability of skills and the question of taxation.</p> <p> Child care was referred to last week, but I would not expect Ms Sinnamon to answer the question on this.  It concerns circumstances in which a person has to travel.  It was a very good point.  I am concerned that there is not enough meat in the submission.</p></speech>

The economy is improving, so people will move from job to job rather than becoming entrepreneurs.  We need more start-ups.  If somebody goes out of business, he or she must pay social welfare and provide for all of the redundancy payments himself or herself.</p>  <p>  Despite all the talk about encouraging entrepreneurs, the point on what we need to do about taxation is being repeated, but nothing changes.  A serious issue arises in the Departments in that they are suspicious of entrepreneurs.  We do not have an innate entrepreneurial culture and we do not regard entrepreneurship as we should.  Entrepreneurship requires all of one's mental and physical energy.  Generally speaking, one must work 24/7.  It is not like a normal job.  I am interested in Ms Sinnamon's experience in this regard.</p></speech>

Five issues arose.  We find that Ireland's issues prevail internationally.  The first is less access to finance and the second is a lower level of risk-taking relative to men.  Another is the lack of role models.  Females are recognised as being more affected by role models than males.  That there are fewer female entrepreneurs reinforces this.  There is a lack of technical skills and a relative lack of self-confidence.  We have intervened by trying to address each of these issues specifically, firstly by running competitive funds specifically for females.  When we ran these funds, a number of the women failed because of the competitive nature of the funds - there is a maximum number of participants allowable - but we then encouraged them to go for general funds.  Females who failed to get funding through a female-only fund were able to succeed with a general fund.  This broadened access to finance and also did a lot for confidence.  To be able to say that failure in the female fund had actually turned to success in the general fund was really very powerful.</p> <p>We have increased the number of development programmes, some of which are network peer learning by female entrepreneurs working through going for growth.  At this stage, we have put hundreds of women through such programmes.  A lot of work is being done through networks all around the country in terms of encouraging people.  We have launched some of these programmes in the regions, with, for example, Cork Institute of Technology, and in Dublin with DCU Ryan Academy.  This is all about building the confidence and the ambition levels of female entrepreneurs to go for growth and certainly that is feeding through.  There is much focus on the number of females starting businesses.  As big an issue at least is the lack of growth in those businesses going forward so it has been about trying to encourage more role models.  We have been sponsoring programmes to put a spotlight on the successful role models.  This is very important in terms of encouraging more people into it.  </p> <p> Many of the technical start-ups we have supported are led by females who do not have the technical skills but they have surrounded themselves with a team of people who have such skills.  We have taken each of those five areas and we have specific programmes in place on each of them.  We are more than happy to go into the detail, line by line, of all of those.  I will invite Ms Jean O'Sullivan in at this stage.  She is the dynamo who has been doing all the work at regional level and building confidence.  She has been working not only with Enterprise Ireland clients, but also with local enterprise offices and clients in every region of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jean O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015020300007#H00200"><p>As Ms Julie Sinnamon has outlined, we reviewed a number of challenges at the beginning when we were trying to build the strategy.  We went out and spoke to many people about what they felt was required to help encourage the number of female entrepreneurs to grow.  It is interesting to note that the work we are doing today is not only from an Enterprise Ireland point of view, but involves lots of stakeholders out in the community working together and harnessing our relationships with different corporations and networks.  As Senator White said, when one meets a female entrepreneur, one does not necessarily see those key challenges immediately, such as low self-confidence.  Where we saw it reflected was that they were not applying to our funds.  When we had female specific funds, they were the same funds that we were running throughout the year, which was an open offer for anybody to apply, but they were not applying for them.  We had about 87 applications for our first ever female fund and typically for the same fund we were only getting 14 females to apply.  That had been going on for a number of years.</p>  <p>  The quality of the 87 propositions put forward were on par with our normal call for applications.  The first questions were where were those women and why were they not coming forward to a general call and why were they not asking for support.  As time went on - this programme is running for about two years - on our financial funds, not only are females benefiting from them, but the more who benefit the more publicity they are getting and then more females are applying to our general call.  Where we used to have 14 people applying to our general call, we now have about 40 applying, which is a great increase.  The female financial funds were only to create awareness of the fact that funding was available.  When we started to speak to potential female entrepreneurs, we realised there was a lack of information to make the decision to build their businesses.  Some had domestically focused businesses and had the potential to export but had not looked at the issue before because they may not have known anybody else who was currently exporting and also they did not have the information to hand as to where the supports, particularly financial, might come from to help them.</p>  <p>  The second important issue in terms of that changed the percentages seeking investment was that we connected all those females together.  Ms Julie Sinnamon mentioned role models and understanding the process of applying for funding and how one has to pool together one's business plans and all the different pillars of support that are required in order to build one's business.  The online networking platform allowed females to be connected on the basis of what information they wanted to know from each other.  Who are they selling to?  What markets are they in?  Who has been investing in their companies?  What export sales programmes are they going on?  Have they gone through an accelerated programme and, if so, have they found it useful?</p> <p>Awareness and information has been very important to us in terms of what we are trying to do.</p> <p> The role model aspect has been very important for us as well.  Over recent years, we have seen reference to the same role models all of the time.  Women in business who are looking at taking the leap from corporate life into starting their own businesses are seeing only a small number of visible entrepreneurs.  However, there are numerous very successful female entrepreneurs in Ireland who simply do not have the same visibility.  We are, therefore, trying to profile all of the opportunities.  Even in the technology sphere, from a promotional point of view, anything one reads is typically about Marissa Mayer or Sheryl Sandberg.  However, there are numerous women doing well in the technology field who do not have the same profile.  Therefore, women in STEM subjects or STEM programmes think only a minority of women are leading technology businesses, which is not correct. </p> <p> When looking at the challenges which impact on female entrepreneurs, it is important to realise that not all of the challenges impact on every female entrepreneur.  Therefore, we really needed an integrated and focused programme which had actions across a number of key initiatives.  One of the things we did with our development programmes was to look at the challenges and then we looked to external providers to run programmes in partnership with us.  The NDRC programme, for example, focuses on females in technology.  The DCU Ryan Academy programme focuses on women in a main accelerator programme who wanted to be in a female accelerator programme.  The Going 4 Growth initiative looks at companies which are not necessarily start-ups but which have a keen interest in exploring the international potential of their business and growing it.  This focuses on growth and peer-to-peer mentoring.  Cork Institute of Technology is trying to attract those who are currently in corporate life into entrepreneurial experience. </p></speech>

This programme runs on Friday afternoons and Saturdays.  We piloted it initially to see if we could encourage more women to consider entrepreneurial activities before taking the plunge and leaving their jobs.  Our portfolio of clients are mainly male.  From my own reflections on the work I have been doing over the years, our male clients typically come in pairs and spin out of a company with, perhaps, another colleague.  Females typically come on their own and this is because they are risk averse.  They do not like the idea of someone else leaving a business to go into business with them at the initial stage.  They would rather have some traction before adding someone else to the business.  There are different variables which we have to consider as we go along.</p>  <p>  The programme has been running for about two years and, as Ms Sinnamon said, at that stage, 7% of our investments were in female-led businesses.  Ms Sinnamon mentioned high-potential start-ups, HPSU, and the competitive start fund, CSF.  When one takes our different equity investments, 23% of our investments in 2014 were in female-led businesses.  On a regional basis, 50% of them are in Dublin and 50% of them are in the regions.  Overall, 81% of them are in technology.  In Dublin, 82% of the investments are in technology.  The figure is higher again in the regions, with 84% of female-led businesses being invested in having a technology base.  </p>  <p>  We have moved along in terms of not only the type of businesses in which we are investing but also their scalability and how they can compete in international waters.  One of the pipeline issues for us is that typically entrepreneurs spin out of middle management positions within corporations of all sorts or they come from family businesses.  We are waiting on more females in middle management positions who are interested in spinning out to entrepreneurial life.  This is one of the pipeline gaps for us.  Now that 23% of our investments are female-led, we are brought to the top of the table in terms of international investments and technology-led businesses.  Around the world, about 8% of investments go into female-led technology businesses.  Best-in-class outside of Ireland would be New York-Silicon Valley which is around 15%.  We are leading the way in terms of our investments.  The numbers in which we invest are obviously smaller because of the scale of the country, but we have made great progress.  Not only this, but we are bringing others with us on this particular journey and we are working hand-in-hand with all of the stakeholders within the eco-system who are supporting this agenda.  </p></speech>

For example, it is a fact that the percentage of our entrepreneurs who are female was 7% but that has now grown.  The word on this development is not out as much as it needs to get out.  I also refer to the diversity of projects in which they are involved and putting more of a spotlight on them.  Certainly, one thing Enterprise Ireland has been doing is sponsoring a number of the female-focused activities.  It really is about trying to get those stories out and to encourage more people.</p></speech>

A small team in Enterprise Ireland has been doing work in this regard and there has been a massive amount of support from all the existing female entrepreneurs in the country.  They are doing a lot of the coaching and mentoring while continuing to operate their businesses.  There are people in venture capital, VC, firms, banks and accountancy offices, that is, there is a whole raft of people who all are supportive of this and who really are opening doors.</p>  <p>  One issue is still a lack of funding and more must be done in this regard.  I am not necessarily talking about Enterprise Ireland but perhaps there should be more angel funding or getting some of the high net worth individuals and there is the ability to do more to try to address the funding issues.  If one looks back over some of the work, I note that in the past two weeks, the 30% Club from the United Kingdom had its launch in Ireland.  A lot of the work that club is doing is to get successful female entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom to go into the schools.  This must start right back with getting this on to the agenda of children from second level and right through and this is a massive amount of work.</p>  <p>  One other point mentioned by the Senator was the attitude to entrepreneurs.  Over the past four or five years, there has been quite a move, in that there has been a less negative approach to entrepreneurs.  Increasingly, people appreciate the impact in communities.

These are overseas entrepreneurs, most of whom have no connection with Ireland, who have decided to come to Ireland to start a business because of the ecosystem within the country and because of the view that this is an entrepreneurial economy and is a good place in which to start a business.  However, from a tax perspective, there clearly are areas involving capital gains tax, share options and so on, in which the Irish offering has become less attractive in comparison with the United Kingdom's offering than was the case previously.</p>  <p>  There is an agenda of items.  Enterprise Ireland certainly will work with our parent Department to raise these issues because while I acknowledge there has been a cash issue within the Exchequer, over time this certainly has been an issue.  It was raised in the Entrepreneurship Forum report and is being raised constantly.  Consequently, there are real issues to be addressed on the tax side.</p></speech>

It represents 55% of our exports and is the most important sector.  Food is not getting 55% of our funding; it is getting a bigger percentage because there have been massive capital investment programmes in food.  It is seeing growth that it had not seen over the past 30 years, in particular on the dairy side, and this also is spinning off in the start-up side through the programme Enterprise Ireland runs jointly with Teagasc and Bord Bia.  It is attracting male and female entrepreneurs into the early stage food side and there is a higher number of food start-ups.</p> <p>We are not seeing as many large-scale start-up companies in food, something which is a key focus.

D'&eacute;irigh thar barr leo.  I have a couple of questions.  There is a feeling of push-pull in enterprise, especially in Enterprise Ireland.  It responds to the demand in society, to a certain extent, and obviously it has a role in generating demand as well.  I suppose some counties still do not feel the economic increase being experienced.  What can be done for those particular counties?  Is Enterprise Ireland working on the national spatial strategy?  Is it feeding into the development of that?</p>  <p>  I read recently that Denmark has ten times the number of export companies that Ireland has even though it is a similar sized economy.  What can be done to achieve those kinds of figures?  Are there enough connections between foreign direct investment and indigenous business?  How could that be improved?  Are there any comparators for Enterprise Ireland internationally?  Enterprise Ireland is doing very good work but could the committee be furnished with results of comparisons with other organisations, such as Scottish Enterprise or International Enterprise Singapore, which is further afield?  What work is Enterprise Ireland doing with enterprise agencies in the North of Ireland?</p>  <p>  Ms Nicola Byrne appeared before the committee last week and gave a really powerful presentation on the experience she has had in regard to female enterprise and she focused very much on the issue of supports for women.  I know that could be straying into the policy domain and maybe that is not what Ms Sinnamon wants to do, but what is her experience of that in regard to child care, etc?  Ms Byrne also spoke very much on issues of taxation.  Again, that could be considered policy area but what are Ms Sinnamon's views on that?  Ms Byrne really hammered home her view that we are focusing too much on trying to shove women into a tech box and she felt women's skills, as she put it, were not necessarily exactly the same.  Rather than fit women into that existing box, she asked if there was a need to create a space that harnessed the skills she felt women had better and that maybe that would be more successful.  Schools are a key area and that is where it needs to start.</p>  <p>  I refer to the networking programmes in which Enterprise Ireland is involved.  I was involved in the county enterprise board and developed a number of women's networking meetings.  Are there any key performance indicators in regard to how successful they are?  I know they are very well attended, etc., but are there any hard figures on new start-ups, exports, etc. that are generated from those types of investments?</p>  <p>  What sectors have the highest incidence of female entrepreneurs?  Are there any other socio-economic statistics in regard to the background of entrepreneurs because Ms Sinnamon mentioned that many of the spin-outs are occurring from middle management and management within business and corporations.  I imagine many of those would not come from lower socio-economic backgrounds, etc., especially Enterprise Ireland-type businesses, although maybe more so with the county enterprise or LEO-type businesses.  Are there statistics on that?</p></speech>

That is still the case but to a lesser extent.  It was good to note in our results in 2014 that 66% of the jobs were outside Dublin and that every region and sector grew.  That was a very different picture from the results for the previous year.  In respect of the experience in terms of where our investments are going, there is an increasing amount and the food sector is a large part of client companies.  There has been a significant amount of investment outside of Dublin in start-up projects.  It is well spread regionally.  I recognise that Dublin has been seeing a faster level of growth than the rest of the country but at least every region and every sector grew in 2014, which was encouraging.</p>  <p>  I will ask Mr. Tom Hayes to respond to the question on how we are feeding into the development of the national spatial strategy.</p></speech>

Within the next few weeks we will have a local enterprise plan for every local enterprise office from the bottom up in terms of the local enterprise office's vision for the county for which it is responsible, the strategic issues confronting the county, the objectives it will have and the metrics in terms of start-ups, expansions, jobs maintained, events and all of that.  That is very much the start of it.  Each local authority is undertaking consultation on the preparation of a county plan, which is the wider county plan in terms of all of the economic planning and positions within the county.  The local enterprise office plan will feed into that, so that it is an integrated county plan.  My understanding is that those county plans will be prepared by mid-year.  That is what is happening on the enterprise side.</p>  <p>  We are also developing regional enterprise strategies, to which Ms Sinnamon referred in her presentation.  These are somewhat wider than the county.  This process is an effort to look beyond the activities we are undertaking, to pull in other stakeholders and to ensure that Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices, the Chamber of Commerce and the IDA - all the key players locally - work together to see how they can enhance and strengthen the work they are undertaking locally rather than each being compartmentalised.  That work has started in the midlands.  There will be a midlands strategy launch within the next few weeks and then it will be rolled out.  The south east strategy is the next one and the plan is to have those completed by July.</p>  <p>  With respect to spatial planning, following on from the county plans, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will work on those.  There is an 18-month horizon for the development of those.  While we have views and we are part of many local agencies, local development groups and all of that, our key input will be on the enterprise part of those in terms of planning.  This week we are starting the process of each county preparing a pretty sophisticated enterprise plan for its area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.147" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Sinnamon" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015020300011#M00300"><p>With regard to a comparison between Denmark and Ireland, I saw a report produced by Finfacts last month on Danish exports versus Irish exports and numbers of companies involved.  I was surprised by the figures and asked our planning side to have a look at it.  It is very difficult to compare like with like.  The figures included in the Danish figures in terms of their exports included areas such as real estate, transport, storage and retail, areas which are not part of the Irish comparator figures.</p> <p>If one takes Enterprise Ireland and IDA clients, there are 1,000 IDA clients - approximately 4,000 clients in Ireland export.  Enterprise Ireland has about 6,000 clients on its books and then there are the local enterprise offices.  It does not count if one does not export off the island.  Many people in Dundalk would say they export to Northern Ireland.  It is very difficult to count the specific numbers so I am not sure about the accuracy of the numbers I saw in the report as it does not compare like with like.  That is not to say there is not a challenge to try to get more people to export because if we want to grow, then export-led growth is the key.  That is why the focus of the work we are doing with potential exporters is to try to encourage people who are successfully supplying the domestic market to look at new opportunities elsewhere.  However, some of the figures do not compare like with like.  The Danish figures and the Irish figures showed a significant differential.  I would take some of them with a pinch of salt, or at least I did when I read the detailed comparison between them.</p> <p> A question was asked about the difference between FDI and indigenous industry.  I started my career in IDA Ireland and then moved.  In the early stages there was very close collaboration between the two agencies and then they became very separate.  Increasingly, in recent years there is a recognition that many of the smaller multinational companies could benefit from the work done by Enterprise Ireland with its clients.  Our leadership programmes have included IDA Ireland clients, access to international markets for some of the smaller multinationals and as IDA Ireland continues to go for earlier stage companies rather than companies with massive global operations such as Intel, Enterprise Ireland offices overseas are available and are doing work with some of those multinational clients.  A total of 1,000 of the top multinational companies in the world are in Ireland and it is important that local Irish companies get access to them.  There is a global sourcing team in Enterprise Ireland that has been working to try to do that.</p> <p> In 2014 we did our first trade mission to Ireland.  We got multinational companies in Ireland into the room with small, local Irish companies as sub-supply.  We got a fantastic reaction.  We did it in Cork, Galway, Dublin and Limerick.  We had a very strong response in the four locations.  That is something we will do again.  In Enterprise Ireland we have a team of people, headed up by Alan Hobbs, who helps those linkages, in particular with multinationals when they come to this country on an itinerary.  We get them in on day one before they have put in place their supply chains for Ireland.  That is par for the course now.  There are very clear metrics between IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to make sure that happens.  For a number of years it was like two different islands and they did not operate as collaboratively as is the case now.  A senior management team composed of staff from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland work on all of the linkages.  Peer to peer leadership is also part of it in terms of opening doors.  The technology centres have been a really important element.  The programme Enterprise Ireland runs jointly with IDA Ireland involves clients of both agencies working on technology issues which are close to market and collaborating together.  Out of such collaboration business will emerge.  There is a lot done and it is very much an agenda item every time we sit down with the Department and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in terms of what is happening and to make sure it continues to grow.</p> <p> The issue of comparators is one that arose when we were putting together our strategy for 2014 to 2016.  The question was who do we compare ourselves with.  There is not another agency in the world that has all of the functions we do.  We could compare ourselves with different people in different areas.  For example, when I was in Australia at the end of last year I talked to the chief executive of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.  It is very strong on the international agenda with its companies.  It takes a very selective approach but it is very successful in terms of what it is doing.  Tekes in Finland is very strong and very good on the technology side.  Scottish Enterprise has a very strong history in terms of much of its involvement that is close to our enterprise development side and also the work the IDA does.  We have very close relationships with each of those enterprise agencies and we work with them.</p> <p>In fact, we recently recruited somebody from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise into one of our overseas offices, which is also a good source of information in terms of trying to learn from them.  Some of our best ideas have not been our own.  For example, innovation vouchers, which are really important concerning the engagement between local companies and third level, came from Holland.  It is a good idea and we are happy to copy it.  We are constantly engaging with all of these agencies and we have done some work in that regard.  There is not an exact copy but there are bits that we learn from and compare ourselves with on each of them.</p> <p> The engagement with Northern Ireland is a subject close to my heart.  Last week, we had a second trade mission between Invest Northern Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and UKTI.  We were at the Medtec conference with a group of companies, and brought together all the clients from each of the three agencies and the companies involved.  </p> <p> All of our leadership programmes are open to companies sent by Invest Northern Ireland and ourselves.  Medtec is our biggest event every two years and Invest Northern Ireland companies participate with Irish companies in the convention centre.  </p> <p> Interestingly, Invest Northern Ireland recently tendered for a programme, to be run by themselves, which has been granted to Dublin City University.  DCU ran the programme here for both agencies, so it has now got the contract to run a programme for Invest Northern Ireland.  We meet with the heads and chairs of agencies, as well as government departments North and South, a number of times a year to ensure that we are all on the one hymn sheet, so there is close collaboration.</p></speech>

Alongside those, there are a number of other programmes, so I suggest that we send the Deputy a brief note.  For instance, we cover the Acumen programme which is an all-island business development programme.  We also run Fusion which is the technology transfer programme, as well as the Halo Business Angels network which is to help early stage investment in companies.  We work with them on the student enterprise awards, which is an all-island third level undertaking.  In fact, last year's winner came from Northern Ireland and this year's awards ceremony will be in Belfast.  There are a number of others also, including Horizon 2020.  I suggest, therefore, that we should send the Deputy a briefing covering the areas in which we work closely with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the pull factor, which is an interesting point.  Rather than waiting for people to knock on the door, quite a number of our programmes - some of which have already been referred to - aim to attract, encourage, inspire and pull people in.  They include the competitive feasibility funds, which are mainly run on a regional basis.  We have just closed one in the south east which attracted 47 applications.  By putting a spotlight on the region, it helped to attract, inspire and encourage these people to come in the door.  They may not otherwise have done so without that particular programme's promotion.  </p>  <p>  There are two successful schools programmes, one of which is run by the LEOs.  It has been running for some time and has been recognised in Europe.  About 370 secondary schools in Ireland have participated in that programme, which involved 17,000 students in 2014.  The LEOs have been running that programme successfully for a number of years.  </p>  <p>  We also run the third level student enterprise awards which have grown in significance, quality and numbers in recent years.  Last year, there were close to 500 participants, while this year we expect to improve upon that significantly.</p> <p>This is individuals or teams within all of the colleges working together on their project and bringing it forward, and it will be narrowed down to ten.  Last year, between ourselves and the LEOs, we invested in all ten projects, such was the quality of the projects that came forward from the education system.</p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to mention the Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur, IBYE, competition, which was also to inspire and encourage the youth.  It brought in over 1,000 applications from right across the country.  It was encouraging and inspiring, pulling in entrepreneurs.  That provides a huge pipeline of early-stage start-up entrepreneurs in companies right across the country.  It culminated in an event in Dublin just before Christmas involving 24 finalists.  The quality of those projects was inspiring.  A number of them will have received private investment, and investment from ourselves and the LEOs also.  It was a good question.  Pulling those in must be a key part; we cannot merely wait for entrepreneurs to walk in the door to us.</p></speech>

Ms Sinnamon has regular meetings with the Minister.  If she went in tomorrow and he asked what he could do to get more women into business, what would be the policy measures that he could take or the programmes he could support?  On what three items would she say directly to the Minister, "Can you do something on this?"  That is my first question.</p>  <p>  Second, 23% of Enterprise Ireland's investment is going into female entrepreneurs or business people.  What percentage of those are young women?  That leads to my next question, which refers to the entrepreneur competition that was held.  If I remember correctly, no woman in Kildare got to the final stages.  What percentage of women took part in the finals of that competition?  Would there be a need - it is a topical issue among us parliamentarians - for a quota system in those competitions where the final would be pure but a certain percentage of women must reach the final stages?</p>  <p>  There is the fear of failure in every entrepreneur.  What are the comparable rates of failure among male entrepreneurs and female entrepreneurs?  Do females have a higher or lower success rate than their male counterparts, if there are any figures on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Sinnamon" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015020300014#P00300"><p>Deputy Lawlor asked, if the Minister was asked the question, what more we can do to get more women into business.  That is the question the Minister asked a couple of years ago, when we were at 7%, as to what can be done.  That is when we started looking at what were the issues that were stopping women going into business and that needed to be addressed.</p>  <p>  When Ms O'Sullivan was talking, particularly about the high-potential start-up side which is the larger projects, 66% of those being supported in that regard are middle and senior managers in existing companies.  In the pool that one is drawing from, given that there is a very small number of women in those position relative to men, there is a likelihood for there to be a bias towards male applicants.  Going back to the issues one is trying to address, they include access to finance, more role models, the confidence issues and technical skills.  This led us to run competitive funds to build confidence, to get the role models and to continue the sponsorship.</p>  <p>  Funding is still an issue.</p> <p>That is a matter about which there is probably a need to do something.  I would like to see more focus on angel funding or other sources of funding.  Even with bank funding and angel funding, I still believe it is more difficult for women to gain access to funding than men.</p></speech>

I will get the numbers for the Deputy.  There were over 1,000 applications throughout the country.   This was whittled down and 93 of the 1,000 received a form of financial support.  From my recollection, the relevant proportion pertaining to the 24 finalists is roughly one third.  I can easily get the Deputy the breakdown for the 24.</p></speech>

Last year, we ran a competitive start fund, which is our early-stage equity investment for graduates.  Some 40% of the successful applicants were female.  Focusing on particular areas results in different projects that we do not see daily.  The age profile very much depends on the type of company one is in.  We often have spin-outs from universities.  They are basically in life sciences and technology.  The age profile can be younger than that of those who have already been on a career path and who are spinning out of corporate life.</p>  <p>  It is a matter of focusing on different funding initiatives.  Typically women do not come forward seeking funding.  When Ms Sinnamon speaks about looking for additional angel and bank funding which could probably lend itself more to use by the female entrepreneurial population, it should be noted that many reasons for the figure for women being lower concern the fact that they are not actually applying for these types of investment in the first place.  Women actually approach business differently from men and often seek smaller amounts of funding as they go along.  Rather than seeking a &euro;200,000 investment, they often seek &euro;80,000, validate their idea, seek another &euro;80,000 and then seek another &euro;40,000.  The work we are doing on trying to create awareness concerns how to fund-raise and have a business funding strategy that will allow one to have enough money in the reserves to grow one's business and confidently take on orders, etc.  We all approach business differently.</p>  <p>  On the question of technology, I have a very practical view.  All the businesses we are seeing, regardless of the sector, have technology as an underbelly.  We are trying to encourage more women into STEM subjects so they will have a foundation in all levels of business, thus keeping their options open in terms of the types of businesses they may be able to build in the future.</p>  <p>  When I refer to a lack of technical skills among the women I work with, I do not mean they cannot outsource or bring others into their teams who have technical expertise but that it is very difficult to manage a software team if one has no basic foundation in any type of technology, be it related to engineering, electronics or software.  Education is the key to being able to provide all the opportunities so women can make informed decisions on which sectors will offer them the greatest potential.</p></speech>

Personally, I am very much against quotas.  Business logic should win out and there should not be a quota.  This has certainly been subject to significant discussion in the context of women on boards.  This is what the 30% Club, which was established two weeks ago Ireland, is about.  All the facts show the impact of a diversified board.  Therefore, the business logic should win out.  It is a matter of educating people to understand that.  The same applies to projects.  I strongly oppose the potential to include quotas.  It is important to use role models, encourage those who have potential and work with them as opposed to having a quota.</p></speech>

If we bring our companies to Silicon Valley and they are introduced to Bill Gates, he is so far beyond where they are that it is impossible.  The beauty of programmes going for growth is that it is people who are working and continuing to be female entrepreneurs who are unknown to most people in the community but are working every day at the problems the people around the table are facing and they are just given the benefit of that kind of exposure.  The question of making sure that role models are relevant applies across the board.</p></speech>

Having looked at the projects, when we had our first female feasibility fund, not one female looked for the full amount of money.  I have never seen males applying who did not look for the full amount of money.  There is a pace in terms of buying projects off in smaller pieces which will probably show a smaller failure rate over a period but potentially less as they do not achieve as fast because of the aspiration.  That is one of the issues in terms of working with the confidence and ambition to make sure the full potential is reached.  I have not seen any specific figures; it is all anecdotal.</p></speech>

Where do they see those fitting in?  Is it in schools or universities?  They also mentioned the boards.  Notwithstanding anything that happened in the past couple of weeks in relation to boards and encouraging female representation, how do the representatives see the new system applying to <i>publicjobs.ie</i>?  How does one encourage women to apply because often women or men may not think they are suited to a board?  If there are greater levels of female participation on boards, that in itself will encourage better ideas to promote entrepreneurship.</p><p>The representatives mentioned the appropriate response that will work to fill any gaps in terms of working with universities and other Departments and agencies.

In 2014, there were 38 colleges with 171 courses providing 6,100 places covering the Springboard and ICT skills conversion programmes.  Approximately 21 of these courses were in ICT skills conversion.  These programmes provided a solution in the ICT industry, in particular, in which currently there are about 1,500 tech vacancies.  Even with the number of people coming through, there is still a shortfall in the provision of skills.  We are looking at a number of initiatives to deal with this.  One is an attraction campaign, on a web portal, to bring talent to Ireland for both indigenous and multinational companies.  We are currently tendering for this as part of the Action Plan for Jobs initiative and we will expand on this.</p>  <p>  On the specifics of Springboard, ICT, JobBridge and MOMENTUM, employers, at various stages of their growth and of various scales of business, are positive towards it, in a general context.  There are people, applicants and employers, who have had a bad experience.  Employers will say the quality of the applicant is not quite up to scratch.  However, this is to be expected in any programme.  One does not expect complete success.  However, as a general rule, the feedback received is that these are positive initiatives.  From the participant's perspective, approximately two thirds of people have been placed in employment from the JobBridge programme.  This is a relative success.  The qualification from the MOMENTUM programmes refer also to the self-employed.  If a person is signing for credits without getting any payment for being on the live register, he or she can qualify for some of these programmes.  There is, therefore, some back-door entry for those who were self-employed and cannot get social welfare payments to go on what is a back-to-work type initiative.  This works quite well for individuals who wish to look at re-entry to the workplace.</p></speech>

We can refer back to the issue of role models and how success can encourage other people to do it.  In the past couple of weeks, when we were talking about women on boards at the 30% Club, role models were put forward as examples of females appointed to State boards.  There are registers of females who have put their names forward.  There are lists of people who are available.  These people have to put their hands up and put their names forward and should be encouraged to do so by their network of people.  Some people within the room were giving their experience and encouraging it.  It will take time for people to realise there is a different process in place and to put their names forward.  However, it will have to come from the people who are interested in doing it and who have the skills set to do so.  These are people such as Vivian Jupp.  There are registers of people who are suitable.  There are lots of people with appropriate skills, not just for public boards but for all sorts of public companies and any private company looking for board members.  They will have to raise their hands.<br/><br/>In terms of communication and encouraging more entrepreneurship, the programme starts in schools, including at second level.  In some countries, they are doing a lot at first level.  It is from day 1 in terms of encouraging it, through the school programmes, universities, boards and companies.  While I am not in favour of quotas, there is merit in putting, at times, a spotlight on certain figures within companies and reporting on this.  In some countries, they have reported on women on boards and in senior positions.  This has put a spotlight on the issue.  It is not a quota, but it makes people think about the process.  Getting role models to visit schools, universities and colleges from day one is important.<br/><br/>In terms of competitors and the entrepreneurship agenda, we constantly look at what happens in other countries.</p> <p>For example, when we were looking at female entrepreneurship, as Australia is a country that is listed as having had success in this space, we looked at Australia.  Ms Jean O'Sullivan may wish to comment in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jean O'Sullivan" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015020300018#T00200"><p>On Australia, the interesting point was that it had parity with 50% male entrepreneurs and 50% female entrepreneurs.  It is the only country in the world that has parity.  One cannot compare it directly because it is a large economy and many of those companies were domestically focused in the service industry, whereas the male sectors typically were mining and engineering.  Nevertheless, Australia still had parity and the research carried out to date on that parity suggested that while Australia did not have quotas for people on boards, etc., it did have quotas in political life.  There is a strong correlation between women in political life and female entrepreneurship because the policies that were brought about at that point were positive within the media in encouraging women to have full participation in the workplace, whether it was in entrepreneurial life, in politics or on boards.  It then became the accepted norm and while this goes back to role models again, it was more about profiling from a newspaper perspective.  Interestingly, I note the correlation between women in politics and women in business.</p></speech>

It was strategically focused with a clear intent about what would be the outcome.  Therefore, when all the multinationals were reporting, they all looked at their gender breakdown.  One sees this happening now when, for example, Google, came out in the United States last week and gave its reports on its gender breakdown within the company, which was not very positive.  All of the other checked companies then came out behind it, but this now has suddenly shone a light on why that is the case.  Consequently, I think information is very powerful in those particular instances.</p></speech>

I am thinking, for example, of women who have left the workplace.  It is correct that they must form a company in order to deal with Enterprise Ireland?  Is that off-putting?  Perhaps they receive support from the local enterprise offices in respect of establishing a company before approaching Enterprise Ireland or making a decision.</p></speech>

A lot of companies approach us initially from a feasibility point of view, where they have a clear idea of a business and need some funding to investigate whether it is a viable business model before they attract investment.  Our supports at that stage are about trying to get them to bring together an investor-ready business plan and for them to realise whether the product, service or technology in question will actually be valid from an international perspective.  It is only at that point that they will set up the company.  Even when they are working with the local enterprise offices, typically when they are trying to build up a business, they will set up a company because we all are trying to build businesses of scale and one must set up the company to be able to employ people and get the best benefits.</p></speech>

How does Enterprise Ireland match people?  For example, if women approach Enterprise Ireland with ideas, does it match them with other women or does it match them with people who would be helpful one way or the other?</p></speech>

However, we do not always recommend that a woman be mentored by a female mentor.  Really, we are seeking to have a person get whosoever can offer the best advice.  We find that programmes we support, such as going for growth, typically have all-female mentors.  However, that is a choice that women have taken in that they want to enter a network of other women where they can see the journey on which they have gone and whether they can learn from them in a trusted environment.  I am for networks in which women are mentored by women and then networks for women in which one is mentored by whoever is the best in that field.</p></speech>

At present, we have 392 mentors, of whom 53 are female.  As for our mentoring assignments, approximately 600 assignments are being carried out at present, of which 165 involve women being mentored by a male or female mix, which largely is male.  All our mentors are categorised by their skills set and experience.</p> <p>We will try to find the best match between the need and the pool of mentors we have.</p></speech>

We heard last week that there was a call for a degree in sales.  Maybe only one college is delivering on that.  Does Ms Sinnamon see a requirement for a full degree?  Many years ago, one could get a certificate in sales techniques or whatever.  Does Ms Sinnamon see a need for that?  The point made was that there are some skills which women need to build on.  I am not suggesting for a second that we direct people in one direction but that point was made.  Does Ms Sinnamon agree with that?</p></speech>

We get salespeople in and they are put through a programme.  The bottom line is a sales plan for the company.  That is a fantastic programme, which we have been running with DIT for six or seven years.  We also have an excel at selling programme.  That is typically one day - short and sharp - to get people to look at their value proposition and to do what they do.  That is our way of responding to the needs.  For years, marketing seemed to be a different form of life to selling but actually selling is really important and there has not been as much focus on selling as a career path as there has been on marketing.  We would certainly encourage anything that would help to drive the development of the sales skills within the country.</p></speech>

We are trying to focus on encouraging female entrepreneurship and on what else we can do.  Clearly, Enterprise Ireland is doing a huge amount, but I am really interested in what was said about going back almost to primary school, or certainly second level, as in other countries.  I do not know whether Enterprise Ireland itself would do that.  The local enterprise offices do terrific work in linking in with transition year students.  Maybe there could be a suggestion that girls-only schools could be targeted to see how that would pan out.  If we are serious about encouraging women, maybe we should do something like that.  What would Ms Sinnamon think about something like that?</p></speech>

There is no differentiation at the moment.  The biggest challenge is to increase the level of penetration in secondary schools.  Approximately 35% of secondary schools in Ireland participate.  One of the biggest challenges is to encourage the teachers because unless one engages with and involves them, it is very difficult.  A local enterprise office cannot just walk into a school and get students to partake in the student enterprise awards.  It is a challenge to get a higher level of penetration in secondary schools.<br/><br/>The Chairman made an interesting point now that a spotlight is being put on the female side to see if we can focus a little bit differently.  In terms of secondary schools, I am not sure what the level of female participation is <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>male participation.  I have been at a few of these awards ceremonies, which usually culminate in the national finals in Croke Park, and there certainly seems to be a very high level of girls participating in those programmes.  It is an interesting point and maybe some other spotlight could be put on the female side of things.</p></speech>

It was maybe a right of passage, a project or maybe part of an examination where one did something and submitted it.</p> <p>One might have then gone off travelling, got a job or whatever the case may be.  The has been a sea change in that respect in the past four or five years.  There is now a much more serious intent among those involved in following through and establishing a business.  Because of that, a number of them have gone on to be supported by the local enterprise offices and ourselves under various programmes and schemes such as the competitive feasibility fund, CFF, the competitive start fund, CSF and as high potential start-ups, HPSUs, in that some of them have got investment from ourselves.</p> <p> One of the areas we focused on in that competition was to ensure that there was a cross-fertilisation of functional skills as opposed to just whether it was a male or female involved.  One could have a good technical individual or a couple but they might not know how to put the proposition together from a business perspective in terms of its value, who would buy the product, how the money would be raised and how the business would be financed.  It was a question of putting together the team and the ideal team is somebody who has an engineering or technical background and somebody who has a very strong commercial or business development background.  If a team like that comes forward, whether its members are all male, all female, or a mix, there is better likelihood of them coming up with a better project.  I have seen that from casual observation and I have been involved in this for the past four or five years.  There is a very high level of female participation in those programmes.</p></speech>

I was there and there was a very impressive line up of young entrepreneurs.  Like Mr. Hayes, I was trying to recall how many women were involved, but there were quite of number of women there.  I spoke to some of them afterwards and one of them was from Offaly, which was wonderful.  She won the midlands leg of the competition and had a very innovative and different idea.  I found it interesting to talk to her and she spoke about the whole process.  It was one thing to be in the competition but she found the whole process very helpful and found there was learning every step of the way, even down to the networking and developing of presentations.  I compliment the initiative, which is a terrific one.  She said that having come through that, she knows that she will be able to go further now.  The first question she asked us was how could she improve further.  I was impressed having spoken to young people and hearing of the tremendous support they received and how beneficial it was to them.</p>  <p>  Does Senator White wish to make a final comment before we wrap up the discussion?</p></speech>

I will definitely be making a recommendation on the putting in place of a proper selling degree.  In Ireland marketing has a snob value and a salesperson has been seen as inferior.  I know that from my personal experience.  However, in the United States the salespeople rather than the marketing people are the ones who are most recognised and financially rewarded.  We will be recommending that from this committee.</p>  <p>  I was very impressed by what Mr. Hayes said in terms of the strategic plans for each enterprise board.  How will an equal standard that will have an entrepreneurial bias or drive be achieved in all the 31 enterprise boards?  This requires passion behind it.  I have said that from day one when this responsibility was given to the local authorities.  Is Mr. Hayes the person in charge of all enterprise boards?</p></speech>

I will not go into all the work that went on in terms of the legislation, the development of the framework service level agreement, SLA, with the local authorities, the changeover of the systems, the branding, staffing and finance.  A huge amount of work was involved.  That is behind us now and we are on a roadmap.  For this year there are eight or nine key deliverables, one of which is the local enterprise plans.  This week we will work with all 31 heads of local enterprise offices to ensure the business plan for each county will be of the highest standard and that it is strong and will feed into the county plan, because it cannot stand in isolation and must be part of an integrated plan.</p> <p> We must ensure the culture to which the Senator referred is maintained.  Part of the rationale behind the scenes is to ensure the local authority has a key role to play in enterprise.  It cannot just stand aside but must work hand in glove with the LEOs.  That is our role and we are driving it through our centre of excellence to ensure we have better entrepreneurs, small businesses and employment spread throughout the country.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Terry Sheridan, principal officer responsible for planning, Mr. Niall Cussen, principal planning adviser, Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan, assistant principal officer responsible for planning, and Mr. Colm Downey, assistant principal officer responsible for planning.  I propose that we hear the witnesses in the order in which I have introduced them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Witnesses' opening statements and any other documents they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on the departmental witnesses to address the meeting, beginning with Mr. Sheridan.</p></speech>

In May 2013, the Government agreed to the preparation of a general scheme of a planning Bill to provide for the planning-related recommendations of the final report of the tribunal.  It was also agreed by the Government at the time that other required updates of planning legislation should be addressed in the context of preparing such a new planning Bill.</p>  <p>  As outlined at our hearing before the committee in December, and further to the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 strategy, published in May 2014, the general scheme for a planning (No. 2) Bill is being progressed in parallel with a general scheme for a planning (No. 1) Bill, aimed primarily at addressing the current housing supply shortage, which is particularly acute in the Dublin area.  The main provisions in the planning (No. 1) Bill are the revision of the Part V requirements on social housing for developers, the retrospective application of reduced development contributions, the introduction of a vacant site levy, and use-it-or-lose-it provisions in respect of planning permissions.</p>  <p>  As I outlined at our previous hearing in December, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, are anxious that the planning (No. 1) Bill be enacted as urgently as possible to help address the current housing supply shortage, and that the planning (No. 2) Bill, which we are discussing today, be enacted subsequently, before the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  The primary planning-related recommendation of the Mahon tribunal was for the establishment of a new office of the planning regulator, whose main functions would be to evaluate and assess local authority development plans, local area plans and regional spatial and economic strategies during development and make recommendations on the content of such plans and strategies to the relevant local authorities and regional assemblies with a view to ensuring each plan or strategy sets out an overall framework for the proper planning and development of the area concerned.</p>  <p>  To monitor the performance of planning authorities regarding their functions under the planning Acts, we are required to undertake reviews of the relevant organisation and the systems and procedures used by planning authorities in regard to the planning functions; to facilitate research into what constitutes proper planning and sustainable development; and to conduct programmes of education and training for elected members and public officials of planning authorities, as deemed necessary.</p>  <p>  The core function of the new regulator will relate to the evaluation and assessment of local plans and regional strategies, including on land zonings, and making recommendations to the Minister on these matters.  Where a Minister agrees with the recommendations of the regulator, he or she shall issue appropriate directions to the relevant local authority on the steps to be taken regarding the revision of the relevant plan or strategy.  Where the Minister does not agree with the recommendations of the regulator, which we envisage will be rare, he or she will be required to explain the reasons for such disagreement, lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas and make them available on the Department&rsquo;s website, all in the interest of increased transparency.</p>  <p>  The Mahon tribunal also recommended that the national spatial strategy be given statutory underpinning.  Accordingly, head 29 of the general scheme establishes a legislatively defined approach to the development of a successor strategy to the national spatial strategy of 2002, to be known as the national planning framework.  Provision is being made in this regard for the procedures to be followed in the development of the new framework, including public consultation and participation in the process.  There is to be a periodic review of the framework every six years, in addition to the obtaining of Oireachtas approval of the national planning framework or any revised framework.</p>  <p>  The other main provisions in the general scheme, as published, largely emanate from a combination of further Mahon tribunal recommendations and specific actions required to be implemented under the Construction 2020 strategy.  Many of these relate to increasing transparency in the planning process and can be summarised briefly.  They include the publication of all submissions received on local area and development plans on the website of the relevant planning authority.  The chief executives' reports on such submissions are also to be published on the relevant website.  Any proposed grants of planning permission in material contravention of a local area plan or development plan must be submitted to the relevant regional assembly for observations.  Other recommendations are legislative underpinning for e-planning to facilitate the introduction of online planning applications and appeals; providing for the payment of reduced fees, or no fees, by elected members when making submissions on planning applications, and the noting of such representations on the relevant planning file; and requiring Irish Water to take account of the likely sequencing of housing and economic development as indicated in local area plans and development plans when preparing its water services strategic investment plan.</p>  <p>  In addition to allowing for the provisions outlined in the general scheme, as published, it is proposed to introduce a number of further amendments to the planning legislation on Committee Stage.  These concern improving and streamlining the existing provisions in section 180 of the planning Act relating to the taking in charge of housing estates by local authorities; improving the procedures relating to the designation of strategic development zones; the introduction of a new register indicating land purchase option agreements entered into in regard to the purchase of land for development purposes, to be entitled the Registry of Land Purchase Options; and a range of other miscellaneous revisions of the Planning Act, which we are still examining and reviewing.</p>  <p>  What I have outlined is essentially a short summary of what is proposed will be incorporated in the forthcoming planning (No. 2) Bill.  Quite a few provisions have already been published in the general scheme.  However, as indicated, it is intended that quite a number of further provisions will be introduced on Committee Stage, which is likely to be taken in the second half of the year.  We are actively examining all options in this regard.</p>  <p>  Once again, I thank the Chairman for affording us the opportunity to make this short presentation on the general scheme.  My colleagues and I are available to answer any questions members may wish to raise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015020300003#D00400"><p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  The content is all very laudable and appreciated on our part, considering the representations we have had over many years.  Many of us who served on local authorities were at the coalface of the planning departments for the areas we represent.</p> <p>Mr. Sheridan mentioned that many of the recommendations in the Mahon tribunal are contained in the two Bills and what is not contained in it will be in the general scheme to be produced.  Can he categorically state at this juncture that he believes the forthcoming Bills will, undoubtedly and without reservation, contain within them all the provisions made in relation to recommendations following those tribunals and what emanated from them?  Much of the political debate around this area has centred on the inactivity on the part of those in Government to be in a position to inform the public that they are addressing those recommendations and will have them as part of published Bills for enactment by legislators thereafter.  I think adequate time has been allowed to the witnesses and those on whose behalf they act to make those provisions in forthcoming Bills.  If nothing else, if the witnesses can give that commitment to the committee at this stage, it would be a job well done.</p> <p> That being the case, there are many other issues in regard to taking in charge and so on that we do not have adequate time in this short discussion to elaborate on.  That said, it is all very laudable, appreciative and cognisant of the various representations that have been made by Members from all sides of the divide with a view to addressing those deficiencies from which, as I said to others who appeared before the committee in recent weeks to discuss these issues, it would appear many lessons have been learned from the collapse in the building sector and in activity surrounding that sector.  We must be in a position, having learned from the mistakes, to put in place better procedures and mechanisms to police and safeguard the public's interest into the future.</p> <p> I am especially conscious of the area of enforcement.  I do not honestly believe that enough resources or personnel were in place within local authorities to ensure adequately that the enforcement of the relevant planning laws was one which we could stand over.  I heard some of the contributors last week from Cork County Council speak about the success they have had in obtaining development charges.  That goes without saying.  We should not laud ourselves for having collected development charges.  If they are applicable to the various permissions approved, it should go as a matter of course and should not be such that one should laud one another for the efforts after the event.  I am of the opinion that the way in which the enforcement of guidelines on planning and development, building control and the placement of bonds and the manner in which they are redeemed has left much to be desired.  I think it was because the eye was taken off that ball.  When it was imperative thereafter, the mechanisms in place in local authorities were not sufficient.  That was clear from the way in which many pillar banks were not adhering to the conditions of bonds that members of local authorities felt were adequately in place to meet the demands of a crash were it to arrive.  It arrived and those assurances that they understood were in place were not enforceable, and appear still not to be enforceable, with banks and their engineers taking three and four years to produce a programme to enact the bond and to have estates finished appropriately.  If Mr. Sheridan can give a commitment that we are in a position to produce Bills for the legislators to enact, that take cognisance of and are complete with all the recommendations of the tribunal within it, it will have been a good day's work.</p></speech>

His first question was on the implementation of the Mahon tribunal recommendations.  All the planning related recommendations emanating from the tribunal will be implemented on foot of the enactment of these Bills.  There are one or two from other Departments which are still outstanding.  All the planning related recommendations will be dealt with in the forthcoming legislation.  On the Deputy's second point about enforcement resources, I would agree that they have been insufficient or inadequate for the purposes of properly enforcing the planning laws.  That partly emanates from cutbacks in numbers in the public service, but the intention would be that proper and adequate resources will be put in place going forward.  During the boom years the numbers in place were quite significant in the planning service functions of local authorities, but they have been significantly reduced.  There is an issue there that needs to be addressed.  If we are to be in a position to ensure that the Act and the regulations are fully and properly enforced, the reality is that additional resources will be required.  I will invite my colleague, Mr. Niall Cussen, to respond on the issue of bonds and taking in charge of estates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cussen" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015020300004#E00300"><p>I certainly agree that the issue of bonds and securities in relation to ensuring the satisfactory completion of developments, particularly housing developments, has been problematic.  I can supply to the committee in due course information about the progress that is being made in regard to the actual amounts that have been collected as part of bonds and securities in different parts of the country.  Local authorities have been quite successful, although it has been a difficult and long drawn-out process in many developments.  With that in mind, we pulled together local authority experts, NAMA, banking experts, legal advice and so on and published updated advice on how bonds and securities are to be constructed into the future.  In the heady days when the construction and property boom was in full flight with so many planning permissions going through the process and so many bonds being lodged, maybe the eye for detail in terms of how they were drafted and, more properly, how they were implemented in cases where there were difficulties on site may not have got the level of attention it should have.  I am confident that, learning from the process, it is not something we will see out into the future.  We are looking now at a pace of development, albeit one we would like to increase in the context of the housing issues.  Certainly we will be more in tune with keeping a close eye on those details into the future.</p></speech>

It is a fact in all spheres of life that we have to have regulators and we have all seen what happened with crashes.  It is welcome that we will have a regulator.  Sometimes the regional planning guidelines and guidelines on enforcement were looked at and disregarded.</p> <p>I noted what Mr. Sheridan said on enforcement.  During the boom there was plenty of money in the planning and enforcement sections.  It is not all about throwing money at enforcement.  What is important is that when things are written down, we must read and implement them.  If we all do that we will have better planning all round. </p> <p> I have a question on the relationship between the new office of Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We hear about quangos.  Is this another body on planning, with its own office and staff?  An Bord Plean&aacute;la deals with appeals, but in addition, strategic development proposals go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This new Office of the Planning Regulator will lay out the regulation, but it must be synchronised with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Could there be a reduction of staff in one area to complement the other area, so that there will be no duplication of staff?  I cannot see, for the life of me, why it would be necessary to have a significant number of staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well as staff in the Office of the Planning Regulator.  I would like to get some information on that, particularly in relation to strategic infrastructural development.</p> <p>The actual recommendations to split all of the legislative revisions into two Bills is a good idea.  We know that the enactment of the provisions of the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill is necessary and must be fast-tracked to ensure houses come on stream very fast.  The No. 2 Bill will deal with the national spatial strategy, and has been retitled the national planning framework.  Why was it necessary to make this change?</p> <p> What happened in the past is that there was rezoning but no provision was made for infrastructure such as water.  I served on the council in South Dublin and we always said that if the then health board, the local authority, the ESB and every other body worked together we would save a great deal of money.  I welcome the recommendations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015020300005#F00200"><p>In the context of our discussion on this meeting, we considered whether we would do pre-legislative scrutiny of the planning and development (No. 2) Bill.  We are obviously working on the No. 1 Bill at present.  Part of the reason we were exploring this was to see what would be possible, because what is published and what will end up being in the Bill are very different, given what has been said.  The witnesses are working on other elements that will come forward.  I think we were interested in seeing how far we could push the boat out on that.  I have been very critical of planning legislation, particularly the early legislation, which was more about development than about planning.  Essentially, the constant criticism was that one sector had the ear of Government over decades to influence things from its point of view.  What we needed was a rebalancing of rights so that those who bought houses could live in estates that were taken in charge in a timely way, and the bonds were done in such a way that they would not expire before they could be called in.  There were deficiencies in the legislation from that point of view.  The roll-over on planning permission extends to a possible 17 years before those in the estate can petition to have an estate taken in charge.  This is an issue that becomes really problematic and I want to see if it is possible to make changes in this area.  Clearly the witnesses are saying that it is possible to do so.</p>  <p>  Another issue is the staff ratios in local authorities following the embargo on recruitment.  It is not an equal situation, as there are wide variations around the country depending on the level of staffing in the local authority.  For example, Meath County Council has half the staff that Kerry County Council has, yet Meath has a larger population.  That would be a very good comparator.  One cannot presume that one size fits all in terms of solutions.  There must be a targeted approach, but that is a separate issue to planning.</p>  <p>  My hope is that the following issues will be addressed.  If somebody has been served with an enforcement notice and has been to the courts, it is not enough for that enforcement order to be unique to that particular local authority.  Developers can move from one place to another and there must be some way of capturing enforcement orders on a national register.  People should have the chance to pinpoint the developers whom we want to weed out.  Even the construction sector wants to weed them out because do not do anyone any favours.</p>  <p>  We can focus on cost of the Office of the Planning Regulator, because in actual fact it will be a cost saving if it done right.  There is a relationship between the scattering of developments and the infrastructure that has been paid from the public purse.  There have been developments in places that have been flooded in the past.  Now flood assessments are required.  By ensuring that developments are done correctly, we will prevent a great deal of grief.  I think it is critically important from that point of view that there is a body with the specific function of making sure the spatial strategy and regional guidelines are enforced and that there is a means of enforcing them and they are taken seriously.  I welcome the fact that there is some scope for members at this stage to have an input into the pre-legislative work.  I suspect there are limits on what might be possible.</p></speech>

The establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator will be a new institutional arm of the planning system.  It is intended that it will be completely independent, and it is therefore proposed that it be established as an independent body separate from any other institutions within the planning system, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We received that legal advice on the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator and that is the reason it is proposed in the general scheme.  What is also intended is that it will be a streamlined, cost-efficient, well-run organisation.  It will have no involvement in the day-to-day decisions of the planning authorities in relation to individual planning applications but it will have an oversight role on the adoption of local area plans and local development plans.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that once the Office of the Planning Regulator is up and running it will prevent the occurrence of situations we had in the recent past that caused grief, as well as ensuring that once the national planning framework is established, the regional spatial and economic strategies that follow from it will be adhered to and not overlooked.</p> <p>The obligation on Irish Water to take account of the local authority development plans in the sequencing of its capital investment programme is to ensure co-ordination of the correct infrastructure in the right place when it is required.</p> <p> With regard to the poor performance and non-compliance by developers with the conditions of their planning permission, there is already provision in the Act, whereby planning applications may be refused when there is a real and substantial risk that the terms of the permission will not be completed in accordance with the permission granted.  That is possibly something that needs to be highlighted to the planning authorities.  These powers are already in place, so it is not a case of having to insert new provisions but of highlighting the existing provisions and ensuring they are adequately implemented.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Niall Cussen, to address some points.</p></speech>

The national planning framework is intended to succeed the national spatial strategy, which in effect is the highest level plan we have at present but it harks back to a different time, 2002.  The Government has approved the preparation of a new national planning framework and for it to provide a co-ordination function for the new regional spatial and economic strategies, which will replace the regional planning guidelines model we had in the past.  It will try to bring about a more holistic approach, brining economic development, planning, environmental protection and other such issues together.  There will be one national planning framework and three regional spatial and economic strategies to align with each of the three new regional assembly areas, midland and eastern, southern and northern and western.  That will provide the framework for co-ordination at local level.  They are priorities for progression development later on this year and probably into the first part of 2016.</p></speech>

I represent an area that was subject to more planning abuse than any other area in the whole country, namely, the Clondalkin, Lucan and Palmerstown area.  We were deprived of our town centre because of the inappropriate behaviour on the old Dublin County Council in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  We have to live the rest of our lives with the problems to which that has given rise.  In many ways, I do not like the idea of having a new institutional arm, the Office of the Planning Regulator, because in a sense it removes the democratic input to planning, but I understand why it has to be put in place.</p>  <p>  How will the national planning framework make a difference between what will happen and the practice before now?  We had a situation a few years ago when in my view there were far too many areas designated as areas of development, rather than keeping it to just three or four.  Will the new framework have an impact on that number?</p>  <p>  I have been asked to raise an issue which is not included in the Bill.  Will it be possible to add an addendum in this regard to the Bill?  There is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to promote and support universal design whereby all environments can be used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of age, ability or disability.  Is there any way this provision could be tagged on as an addendum to the Bill?  While progress has been made, particularly in term of access to public buildings for those in wheelchairs and so on, it has not trickled down to housing.  It would be very advantageous for us if we could get to the stage that housing was built in such a way from the start so that it would be more accessible for everybody.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015020300006#G01200"><p>This is a very important discussion document.  I agree with Deputy Dowds that the powers of the Office of the Planning Regulator would have to be carefully and finely tuned in order that the local democratic process would continue but also that the oversight, which seems to be one of the key issues, would be very thorough and very full in every respect.</p>  <p>  On the question of the regulator forming an opinion on possible systemic failures and corruption risks, that  is not a difficulty for me but I would have thought it would be a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would like the witnesses to expand on that.</p>  <p>  Again I agree with Deputy Dowds that the systematic abuse of the planning process by a small but significant minority of councils led to the tribunals and the appalling corruption they exposed.  I welcome the increased vigilance but we must ensure it is fine-tuned and the correct people are doing the right investigations.  I note that the witnesses are nodding in agreement.  I presume I will get a response on that issue.</p>  <p>  I like the fact that the Office of the Planning Regulator provides for research, training and education in planning as well as that one of its core functions will be to evaluate and assess development plans.  However, in the instance that the Office of the Planning Regulator forms an opinion with which the Minister of the day disagrees, the Minister will be required to explain the reasons for that, lay such reasons before the Houses of the Oireachtas and also make them available on the Department's website.  I would like to tease this out.  I presume a regulator would not form such an opinion unless it was a significant issue and the Minister would not disagree unless there were significant reasons for doing so, but the resolution of that difference of opinion should it arise, rests with the Minister.  That is my understanding.  Is the requirement to have an explanation given in the Houses of the Oireachtas adequate?  I am thinking out loud.  Should the Minister be obliged to ensure his or her reasoning is benchmarked?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015020300006#G01400"><p>Absolutely.  I presume the Minister's reason could be challenged in the court.  I am just looking at possible conflicts.</p>  <p>  The other important issue is a subject close to my heart and to the hearts of all of the people in the country who are marching, which is the powers of Irish Water and how it relates to the provisions of the Bill.  One of the key difficulties which I thought about a great deal when I was Minister of State was the question of the relationship between the planning authorities and Irish Water.  Which comes first, the chicken or the egg?</p> <p>The question is who decides where strategic planning takes place.  Will it be Irish Water when it sets out its national programme?  I know Mr. Cussen is shaking his head but I will query that, if he does not mind.  If there is a significant investment programme of &euro;60 million or &euro;100 million, Irish Water may have to decide where the needs arise.  They may decide to invest in the greater Dublin area, but if the Dublin local authorities have not planned enough housing or services, then that investment will theoretically come to nothing.  Alternatively, if elected councillors in Killarney or Drogheda decide to zone 200 acres of land there and insist on a huge new industrial development zone, that would not make sense either.  The key issue is striking a balance between the critical strategic investment that Irish Water will have to make and the wisdom of local authorities that want to develop their own areas.  </p> <p> I note that when Mr. Cussen commented on the spatial strategy, he said there were three regional committees.  Would they be the primary movers in the spatial strategy?  Is it from the bottom up or from the region down?</p></speech>

There are three regional spatial and economic strategies prepared in light of the Government's or the Oireachtas planning framework and adopted by the regional assemblies.  Obviously, Irish Water and the whole infrastructure piece is very important.</p></speech>

For instance, even outside those, there is the Industrial Development Authority Ireland, as well as where the HSE wants to put its regional services, and private airports.  It is a huge job of work that has to be managed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015020300007#H00800"><p>The issue for me is who is the generator.  In other words, does a county councillor present me with a plan or does the regional authority present a councillor or a citizen with a plan?  Those issues are critically important, including the identification of weaknesses in the last spatial strategy.  Mr. Cussen rightly said that was in a different era and, I might add, it was also a different government.</p>  <p>  For example, the industrial development of County Louth was decided by a Cabinet meeting.  At the time, under FOI, only the future spatial strategy for County Louth was released.  It was Drogheda versus Dundalk, rather than Drogheda and Dundalk.  In many respects, the criteria that will decide all of these hugely important strategic investment decisions cannot be imposed from above.  These are critically important issues to get right.  I presume they will be addressed when the legislation is going through.</p>  <p>  There are just two other points that I want to make.  One basic question comes back to the democratic process and the rights of communities to determine their own future.  In order to get it right, one cannot have a massive bureaucracy stamped by the regional assembly, the independent regulator, the Department and the politicians.  In order to get the mix right, local voices must be heeded.  Mr. Cussen has a huge job of work to produce this legislation.  If it is done right, it will be radical and good, but if it is wrong, it will be heavy-handed and overdosed with bureaucracy.  That is the trap into which we could fall.</p></speech>

I have personal experience of it concerning a strategic development zone, or SDZ, in my own county.  There needs to be a mechanism whereby people's reasonable concerns are properly addressed.  It is not always done in the current system.  Some of the so-called consultation can be a joke because it is just ticking a particular box.  That issue needs to be addressed, while at the same time taking note of what is good planning.</p></speech>

As regards Deputy Dowds' first remarks on the need for a regulator, it was unfortunate that such a body had to be established on foot of past occurrences, some of which were addressed in the Mahon tribunal with regard to particular incidences that occurred in his constituency.  That is the legacy of what happened in the past.  The purpose of the regulator is to try to ensure that past mistakes do not recur.  We want an efficient, well functioning planning system to ensure the proper planning and sustainable development of the country as a whole.</p>  <p>  We have had planning legislation in place for the past 50 years and it is constantly evolving.  We are looking at further changes to ensure that the planning system is fit for purpose to deliver on the objectives of Government, local authorities and regional authorities with regard to development plans for local areas.</p>  <p>  As regards the Clonburris SDZ, which the Deputy also mentioned on the last occasion, I made a point of going out there.  I was pleasantly surprised that the area has huge potential.</p></speech>

It was developed at the wrong time, as the economy was going into decline.  I understand, however, that South Dublin County Council is reactivating it.  It is proposing that the SDZ be extended beyond what was originally proposed.  Hopefully there will be developments on that front going forward.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd referred to the issue of corruption risks in local authorities.  The regulator will be mandated to undertake reviews of the organisation, and the systems and procedures employed by planning authorities in the performance of their planning functions.  Where it identifies issues like corruption risks, it will effectively be the first finder, and will report any adverse findings to the appropriate authorities for ongoing investigation - that would be the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the DPP, etc.</p></speech>

I am all in favour and do not have a problem with it, but what criteria would they have to objectively identify that?</p> <p>Could they form an opinion?  Could they have a hunch or would they have to have evidence?  The burden of proof is a huge issue. </p></speech>

The focus is not necessarily on corruption.  It only arises if there is a possibility that evidence may be found.  At that stage the regulator would decide whether there should be a deeper examination to determine whether there is any specific evidence.  Where evidence is found it would be passed over to the appropriate authorities.</p></speech>

It is broader than the planning policy arena, however.  It cuts across into building control.  The Deputy is obviously aware of the provisions of the building regulations, which have been transformative regarding accessibility to new buildings generally - not just public buildings but also residential homes.  Wheelchair access and general accessibility have been transformed by new building regulations over the last few years.  We will certainly examine whether there are any further enhancements we can make concerning the objectives that a local authority development plan must set out.  We are reasonably confident that the scope is there in the local authority objectives, which comprise a long list that local authorities can include in their development plans.  I have been reviewing development plans for the Department for many years and every such plan certainly has ample statements on ensuring that there is accessibility for all and ensuring universal design approaches to the built environment in their areas.  If the Deputy has more technical or detailed suggestions, we would always have an open view on them.</p></speech>

If the Deputy feels that particular aspects are defective, we will certainly raise them with our colleagues on the building control side.  We would be reasonably satisfied, however, that from a strategic policy perspective, the planning process is very pro universal design.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015020300008#J01600"><p>I thank the speakers for their presentations and for the documents that have been circulated.  I wish to raise a few items.  Earlier, Deputy Cowen spoke about bonds and housing estates that were not taken in charge.  Does Mr. Cussen have information on private estates that local authorities cannot take in charge because there is no bond or they do not have the money?  In addition, they may be in NAMA or in a complicated banking situation.  If Mr. Cussen has that information, I would appreciate it.  I have heard figures, although I am not sure whether they are right or wrong, but it is important for us to deal with facts.</p><p>I welcome the proposed Bill but I have a few queries that Mr. Cussen might help me with.  Part 2 of his document points out the investigative powers to examine, <i>inter alia</i>, possible systemic failings in the planning system and any corruption risks therein.  Where will the situation go after an investigation?  Is Mr. Cussen in a position, or will he be in a position, to carry out legal enforcement?</p><p>I welcome the provisions for research and training.  Will elected members be included in the provision of training and research, which are often difficult for elected local councillors to avail of?</p><p>Deputy O'Dowd asked where the Minister stands on all of this.  As I understand it from Mr. Cussen's explanation, where a Minister agrees with the recommendations of the regulator, he or she shall act accordingly and issue appropriate directions or instructions to the relevant executive on the steps to be taken in relation to the revision of a local plan.  Is Mr. Cussen saying, in effect, that at the draft stage of a development plan - whether it is a full county development plan or a local area one - the Minister can instruct or direct changes?  If not, when will the changes take effect?</p><p>We currently have a hierarchy of national, regional and local areas.  This comes back to what Deputy O'Dowd talked about.  If we have a specific input at local level for the betterment of a community or for a specific issue where it does not slot smoothly into the hierarchy, will the regulator be able to intervene in order to improve the situation, in the interests of best practice or for the best use of an opportunity to put a development plan in place?</p><p>Another issue that caught the headlines when this Bill was being proposed is that elected members may pay a fee for making a submission on a planning application.  Mr. Cussen now says it will be a reduced fee or no fee.  Will it be no fee or a reduced one?  Perhaps Mr. Cussen can clarify that matter.</p><p>As regards improving and streamlining the existing provisions in section 180 of the Planning Act on taking housing estates in charge, can Mr. Cussen explain exactly what he means to do in that respect?</p><p>Deputy Dowds raised the issue of disability.  He and I were contacted by representatives of the disability sector about this issue.  Section 25(3) of the Disability Act 2005 states that we must ensure all public buildings are accessible by 2015.  I agree with Mr. Cussen about the work that has been done in new legislation concerning public buildings and local authority housing.  However, there are a plethora of local libraries, sports complexes, swimming pools and council offices that are not accessible for those with disabilities.</p> <p>I hate to say it here but if a disabled person wanted to come to the council chamber in the town hall in my home town of Carrick-on-Suir, he or she had to be carried up two flights of stairs in their wheelchair.  There was no other way to get into the chamber.  We often had to move civic events from the council chamber to the local hotel.  That was unacceptable.  According to the legislation I have referred to, this is supposed to be dealt with by the end of 2015 which is ten months away so can the Department put a specific element into this Bill under miscellaneous revisions of planning Acts to deal with this issue once and for all?</p></speech>

It is a pity that we have to appoint a regulator in the first instance but we are obviously paying for our sins of the past.  Can the regulator overrule a decision of a county council?  I know the Minister has the final decision but can the regulator recommend or change a decision?  While I served on local authorities, I discovered issues in new estates such as speeding, which is a big problem in any estate I know, and parking in estates.  I visited an estate recently with six OPDs and 28 houses.  A total of 54 vehicles were parked there, many of which were parked illegally.  I often wondered how an ambulance or fire brigade would get into these estates.  These were local authority estates where one might not expect to see two or three cars parked where there are teenagers or those in their early 20s.  Should we look at it and should we have less density and provide more car parking spaces?  In respect of speeding, I have come across estates where people have been living for the best part of 20 years and discovered that a lot of speeding was taking place.  Speed bumps have been installed by local authorities.  Should we legislate so that at the building stage, the developer provides speed bumps in private estates and the local authority provides them in local authority estates?</p>  <p>  I have a point to make with regard to a road way where two cars cannot pass on but where one must pull into a ditch or gateway to allow the other to pass, where there is no speed limit sign and where the speed limit is understood to be 80 km/h.  I know we cannot expect them to be patrolled.  Sterling Moss or some of the other famous drivers would not be able to do 80 km/h on that particular road.  I am talking about roads in the heart of the Cooley peninsula where I come from which takes in the mountain regions of Omeath and Glenmore.  I see it from a planning perspective.  If the speed limit is 80 km/h on the road, the stopping distances and line-of-sight distances are not attainable in the vast majority of cases.  Indeed people have had to look for a slice of the adjacent field or property and may not have obtained it because there may be a difference of opinion between neighbours.  I am not sure whether we have legislated for an 80 km/h per hour speed limit on roads that do not have speed limit signs.  Should we legislate for a 50 km/h speed limit based on the width of the road?  I am talking about roads that may have grass growing down the middle.  Perhaps this is not something we can legalise but should or can we legislate for some of these changes?</p></speech>

It was an issue that was raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy last year in her Private Members' Bill.  We have committed to undertaking a detailed review of the existing taking in charge provisions, including the provision of adequate bonds and securities, in the development of the Bill.  As I have outlined, we will be coming forward with proposed changes to streamline, expedite, update and make the existing provisions more effective.</p>  <p>  In respect of the investigative powers of the regulator when they form an opinion with regard to certain issues in the performance of a planning authority, the regulator will essentially be looking at the returns of local authorities, the statistics that are coming in and the percentage over-turn rate with regard to decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la which reverse decisions of planning authorities to assess whether there is consistency throughout the country.  It will select local authorities at random and undertake reviews of their performance.  If any issues are identified, it will pass them on to the appropriate authorities, initially the Garda, for further investigation.  We are talking about trying to ensure a better and more equal outcome for citizens in the activities and operations of the planning system.  </p>  <p>  In respect of research and education and whether elected members will be included, providing education and research and support for elected members and public officials operating in the planning system will be one of the key functions of the regulator.  Mr. Niall Cussen and I have already been active in this regard of late.  We have engaged with the Association of Irish Local Government in undertaking a series of roadshows on the planning system targeted at the recent intake of councillors who were elected last year.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the role of the Minister and when his involvement will kick in with regard to development plans and any issues arising with regard to them, the final decision will rest with the Minister but the regulator will be fairly active during the development plan process as it is being drafted and published. </p> <p>As already outlined, any final decisions in respect of directions to local authorities will rest with the Minister and will be based on the advice of the regulator.  On the issue of fees in respect of submissions from elected members on planning permission applications, we will be advocating that such fees should not be imposed.</p> <p> The Senator referred to disabled access.  Perhaps we might consider the insertion of a relevant provision.  Mr. Cussen has already addressed this issue, which is much broader than planning and which is primarily a building control matter.  Massive progress has been made in the area of disabled access to buildings, particularly public buildings, in recent years.</p> <p> Senator Brennan referred to speeding in housing estates.  We issued a circular to local authorities on this matter quite recently.  I can forward a copy of the circular to the Senator for his information.  It indicates that speed calming and other similar measures should be addressed in the assessment of planning applications for proposed new residential estates.</p></speech>

Account must also be taken of the design manual relating to urban roads that was jointly published by our Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the past year or so.  The aim of that manual is to improve the design of housing estates.  One can achieve a great deal in terms of reducing speed by slightly tweaking the design of estates.  I will forward a copy of the circular to the Senator.  It is a matter for local authorities, under their by-laws, to set speed limits on existing estates.</p></speech>

That is what we advocate.  We also advocate that this issue should be raised during the pre-consultation stage in which local authorities and planning authorities engage with developers in order that speed limits might be incorporated in the design of estates.</p></speech>

There is a significant backlog of housing developments throughout the country which remain to be taken in charge.  This is a result of the boom years.  Local property tax and other considerations have been game-changers in the context of local communities' expectations regarding the quality of the service they receive in terms of ensuring that developments are ultimately taken in charge and maintained by local authorities.  Under circulars we issued in the past, local authorities are required to maintain registers of their developments and to report on progress regarding the taking-in-charge process.  The Office for Local Authority Management publishes local authority service indicators every year and these highlight the progress being made in respect of the taking-in-charge process.  Considering the level of activity in this area and in view of the work being done by unfinished housing development co-ordinators in local authorities, we expect to see a significant increase in the number of estates being taken in charge by the authorities.  One local authority recently highlighted the likelihood, quite literally, of hundreds of developments being taken in charge under an accelerated process into the future.</p>  <p>  While the Department does not maintain a register of the thousands of estates involved and their locations - that would be a very complex administrative task in its own right - individual local authorities, through their taking-in-charge teams and unfinished housing development co-ordinators, maintain good information in this regard.  Details of that can be found on the housing agencies websites.  The Senator also inquired about bonds, etc.  A huge amount of information is also publicly available in that regard.  I wish to bring to the attention of Oireachtas Members or members of the public who have queries in respect of this matter the fact that every local authority in the land has an unfinished housing development co-ordinator.  Details relating to this are available on the websites of the Department, the housing agencies websites and local authorities.  People should make contact and obtain the information they require, which, as already stated, is available.  We maintain an overview in respect of the general progress made on a year-to-year basis and we publish it as part of the report on unfinished housing developments, the most recent version of which was published just before Christmas.  Again, that report is available on the Department's website.</p></speech>

Some residents took out insurance with development management companies and a week prior to this being up they receive notification to apply for renewal.  If there is not a proper development management company in place, some people do not receive such notification and their insurance lapses.  Will what is proposed in respect of taking estates in charge assist individuals in such circumstances?  Proper management companies should be in place in respect of all developments.  This matter has been allowed to fall between two stools as a result of developers going bust.  Management companies, under the Multi-Unit Developments Act, are trying to clean up the mess but they are unable to do so as a result of a lack of bonds or whatever.  How is this matter going to be dealt with?</p></speech>

I am referring here to roads, streets, amenities and so on which form part of the normal streetscape with which we are all very familiar.  We need to be extremely careful in the context of lumping in the multi-unit developments in which there are, in effect, private areas and treating them in the same way.  There are issues in this regard which have been addressed in the Multi-Unit Developments Act.  We are aware, through our work in respect of unfinished developments, etc., of particular problems that have arisen in respect of certain developments.  It is necessary to follow a process of working through this with receivers, financial institutions and owners and the various arrangements under the Multi-Unit Developments Act, rather than to some extent importing the liabilities and legacy costs into local authorities.  The latter already face a significant challenge in the context of managing unfinished housing developments.</p>  <p>  The interface between the Multi-Unit Developments Act and the planning legislation is going to come into play as we go through the detail involved.  However, these are two different issues in that we are discussing the regulation of private space as opposed to the management or maintenance of public space.</p></speech>

They are areas to which people have normal access, but are more properly the job of the owners of those properties who need to come together, with the relevant interests, and figure out a strategy to deal with it and so on.  We would perhaps solve one problem but create many more.  We have to carefully examine the interface between the multi-units development legislation and planning legislation and make sure there is a clean, but understandable, transition from one to the other.</p></speech>

I thank members for their attendance and participation.  We are meeting to consider the Revised Estimate, Vote 40 - Children and Youth Affairs for the year ending December 2015.  The format in which the Estimates are considered allows us to consider how moneys are allocated to each programme, how moneys are allocated between services and to focus on many aspects of the Department's work.  There will be no division and no officials will speak, only the Minister, for the purposes of the meeting.  I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I welcome and congratulate Mr. Fergal Lynch, the Secretary General of the Department of Children And Youth Affairs and I welcome Mr. Dermot Ryan, assistant secretary, Ms. Mary McLaughlin, assistant secretary, Mr. Paul Fay and Mr. Ger Banville, all from the Department.</p>  <p>  This is a select committee of the D&aacute;il and we will discuss only Vote 40.  The 2015 Revised Estimates were presented to the D&aacute;il in a new programme-based format.  This means the Estimates contain the following information for each programme - how the money allocated to the programme is proposed to be spent alongside how it was spent in previous years, and the outturn in each case, the number of staff assigned to work with programmes and how this compares with the previous year, performance-related information, meaning performance indicators are presented alongside financial data for the current year.  Finally, administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole is summarised in more detail than was the case.  The Minister will speak first, followed by Opposition spokespersons and then members of the committee.  I ask members to ask questions rather than make Second Stage speeches.</p></speech>

The Revised Estimates for 2015 allocated gross funding to my Department of some &euro;1,026 million, which includes over &euro;991 million in current funding and &euro;35 million in capital funding.  When appropriations-in-aid receipts of just over &euro;26.6 million are taken into account, the net current funding allocated to my Department in 2015 is some &euro;1,000 million, an increase of &euro;26 million on the 2014 Estimate of &euro;974 million.</p>  <p>  Under the new performance accounting arrangements introduced in 2012, the subhead structure of Vote 40 is based on three programme areas: programme A &ndash; children and family support programme; programme B &ndash; sectoral programmes for children and young people; and programme C &ndash; policy and legislation programme.  There are two main elements to my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2015.  First, the Estimate for next year contains significant resources to fund the services and programmes provided by the Child and Family Agency, or Tusla.  This amounts to &euro;643 million, representing 64% of the Vote.  The balance of &euro;383 million relates to other programmes funded directly by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Child and Family Agency, or Tusla, in January 2014, saw the delivery of a key programme for Government commitment.  This was a historic development and a significant milestone in the programme of this Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of services to vulnerable children and families.  In 2015, the agency will have a budget of &euro;643 million, including over &euro;12 million in capital funding.  This is an increase of &euro;34 million, or 5.6% over the 2014 provision.  While I understand that this level of funding cannot address all of the challenges the agency faces in doing its work, this additional funding will assist the agency in alleviating service pressures in our child welfare and protection services and to also build on the extensive programme of reform, which is well under way. </p>  <p>  I met the board of the agency before Christmas and had a useful exchange of views on challenges and opportunities facing it in 2015.  Further, I have issued a performance statement to the agency under the Child and Family Act 2013 setting out overall priorities for 2015.  The agency is currently finalising its business plan for 2015, which will set out its plans for the year and how it proposes to deploy its resources.  I look forward to working with the agency to deliver the best possible outcomes for children and families in 2015.</p>  <p>  The agency is also developing a commissioning strategy that aims to ensure that the services it funds are clearly focussed on specific outcomes for children and families and are demonstrably cost-effective and efficient.  We have a responsibility to our citizens to ensure that public funding delivers the best possible outcomes for all our children and families.</p>  <p>  The 2015 capital provision for the agency is &euro;12.4 million, an increase of &euro;5.6 million over the 2014 provision.  Among the important projects that will be advanced are the next phase of the roll-out of the national child care information system and the related upgrade of the agency&rsquo;s ICT infrastructure.  The 2015 provision will also allow for some upgrading of special care facilities.  There will also be resources available to support minor capital development works during the course of 2015, including maintenance of existing facilities.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the good work undertaken in its first year by the board of the agency, led by Ms Norah Gibbons, and all of the staff in the agency led by the chief executive, Mr. Gordon Jeyes.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Estimate provision contains a sum of &euro;357 million that will allow my Department to deliver a significant level of public services, as well as a number of new policy measures that I will address over the remainder of my statement.  The policy framework Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures is the first national policy framework for all children and young people, from birth to age 24.  To maximise resources and achieve the best outcomes, it takes a cross-Government approach to working for children and young people.  To bring the commitments in this framework to fruition, my Department is developing an implementation plan across a range of Departments and statutory agencies.</p> <p>The Children First Bill 2014, which will put elements of the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on a statutory footing, was published in April 2014.  The core aim of this programme for Government commitment is to raise awareness of the issues of child abuse and neglect, and to clarify the role we all have to play in addressing these, in order to improve the care and protection of all of our children.  The Children First Bill aims to make the best safeguarding practice the cultural norm for anyone and everyone who works with children.  It has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and I anticipate Committee Stage will be scheduled in the near future.  I wish to reassure Deputies that in recognition of the fact that this legislation will create new statutory obligations, the commencement date will be scheduled to ensure that the range of sectors involved have adequate time to prepare for implementation. </p> <p> I am pleased to say that there will be no reduction in funding for youth services in 2015.  An amount of &euro;50 million is being allocated in 2015 to support youth services throughout the country.  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services throughout the country, including young people living in disadvantaged communities.  Funding from my Department supports youth work provision to some 380,000 young people, involving approximately 1,400 staff in 477 projects, with the vital support of 40,000 volunteers nationwide.  I never let the opportunity pass when I speak of volunteerism in this sector to express my appreciation and gratitude, and that of the Government, to the generosity and enthusiasm of these volunteers who make so much possible for us and young people.  </p> <p> This Government recognises the vital importance of investment in the early years of children&rsquo;s lives.  In 2015, my Department will provide over &euro;260 million to support the child care sector to enable children and parents access high quality and affordable child care.  To yield these positive outcomes, we know that quality service provision is crucial.   In that regard, a range of reforms under the early years quality agenda, aimed at improving the quality of services in the early year's sector, is under way and new standard operating procedures have been introduced.  Legislation to underpin a number of reforms under the quality agenda has also been introduced.  This legislation provides a statutory basis for the registration of early years services, and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for inspectors at a pre-prosecution level.  Regulations to give effect to the legislative changes will be published soon.  Under the proposed new system, all early years services will have to be registered in order to operate.  </p> <p> I warmly welcome the fact that budget 2015 has allocated a further &euro;13.6 million in capital investment funding towards the completion of the national children's detention facility project under way in Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin.  In addition to the capital project, the allocation of an additional &euro;1.8 million, in current expenditure in 2015, will provide for the increased operational costs of the extended Oberstown facilities under its expanded role.  </p> <p> The legal framework for detention of children is also being updated to provide for the legal amalgamation of the three existing children detention schools.  Also, the repeal of all current legal provisions which permit the detention of children in the adult prison system.  I am committed to working with the Oberstown board and campus management to ensure that the current change programme in the children detention school system is completed successfully.</p> <p> In conclusion, there is no doubt that 2015 will be another busy year for my Department and its agencies.  I intend to build on the hard work and effort by all involved in working with children and families &ndash; both State and voluntary organisations &ndash; in order to deliver on this Government's commitment to fundamentally reform the delivery of child and family services. I hope my statement is of assistance to the committee and I look forward to its input and our discussion on these issues.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and his team from the Department.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to the briefing for the select sub-committee that was prepared by the Department.  There may be other figures that I have been able to link up in the limited time available to me.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Child and Family Agency, the Estimate for 2015 refers to a sum of &euro;631 million and a 4.8% increase.  The Minister's commentary mentioned a budget of &euro;643 million and an almost 6% increase.  Can he rationalise the discrepancy between the amounts?  I refer to page 5 of the 26 pages of the briefing prepared by his Department on Vote 40 under the heading of current expenditure - A.3 Child and Family Agency.  The figure shown is &euro;631 million, which represents a 4.8% increase.  Perhaps I have missed something.  I ask the Minister to refer to the matter.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about another matter.  I am sure the Minister would support further funding to provide additional support to the Child and Family Agency.  I have recently indicated concerns to him, in a series of parliamentary questions, following what I regard as alarming information that there has been a re-classification of some cases where children are determined to be at risk.  This has been measured and only those at a particular level of risk then get the focus and address.  That situation would cause me considerable concern.  There seems to have been a re-determination of the trigger for action within Tusla regarding interventions.  Can the Minister comment on the matter?  Is he in a position to do so?  I have tabled parliamentary questions on the matter but have not had an opportunity to check if responses have been returned.  I share that concern with him.  That to me, and to those who have spoken to me of this matter, is indicative of the fact that Tusla, by its own admission, could not cope under current budgetary restrictions in terms of the scale of concerns that are presenting.  There are two elements to my query - the clarification of the discrepancy in figures and a query about a much more important matter.  I ask the Minister to comment on both matters.</p>  <p>  Before we discuss the headings I wish to again welcome the establishment of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and similar institutions.  As the Minister will recall from last Wednesday, the final passage of the Government's resolution had the support of the House, which is important.</p> <p>Both Deputy Troy and I sought to present amendments on behalf of our parties.  I note with hope the spirit of the Minister's remarks, in terms of the commission's potential to expand its address, depending on matters or issues that present in the course of its tenure.  I urge the Minister or whoever may be Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on the day, to be mindful of the two days of debate we had around the establishment of the commission of investigation and its terms of reference.  They should be mindful of that discussion and of spirit of the House.  I do not refer only to Opposition voices.  I acknowledge that these voices also came from the Government side.  We do not want to see anybody left behind. </p> <p> Finally, I seek clarification on a point regarding a reference at the foot of the C8, dealing with total administration but there is no designated letter and number on the entry.  It refers to grants to organisations part funded by the national lottery.  In the 2014 Estimates-----</p></speech>

I seek clarification as to the organisations and as to why grants part funded by the national lottery to these respective organisations, estimated as &euro;910 million in 2014, are not now to be provided.  There is a 100% discounting of these for this year.  I will leave it at that for now, but will raise other issues as we come to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22015020300004#C00400"><p>I will deal with the Deputy's last question first.  I cannot find the reference at the moment, but I know the answer to the question.  That is national lottery funding and we decided this year that it would provide just a one-off lottery grant to various services.  We made the decision together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to forego that lottery funding in order to maximise the money we could get for the agency, which is providing its services directly.  As a consequence, we managed to get the substantial increase in our budget for Tusla of &euro;26 million.</p><p>On the commission of investigation, I echo the Deputy's sentiments.  We want this investigation to be as inclusive and expansive as it can be.  However, we must always bear in mind that it must be conducted in an expeditious manner so that we get the required response for the group of people at the core of the inquiry, the mothers and babies who were in these homes.  We want to achieve this in a timely fashion because as has been pointed out, many of these women are moving on in years.</p><p>On the issue regarding the threshold for intervention by Tusla, I have significant information on that.  The agency has been undertaking a comprehensive data validation and verification exercise.  Therefore, by comparison since the establishment of the agency, data is not yet fully reliable.  All children in care should have an allocated social worker.  This is the case for 92% of children.  The Child and Family Agency has advised that it prioritised children according to need, with the aim of ensuring that any gaps in social work provision were minimal and that duty social workers and foster care social workers had oversight of the child's situation.  Referrals regarding emergency cases are dealt with immediately, for example, in situations where a child has been abandoned, is in immediate physical danger or is at immediate risk of abuse.  Where a child has not been allocated a social worker, the case is reviewed regularly by the principal social worker to see if there has been any change in the child's situation that would change the priority of the case.</p><p>The article in <i>The Irish Times</i>reports an increase in child protection and welfare referrals, from 21,000 in 2006 to 44,200 in 2014, but this is not an appropriate comparison.  The Measuring the Pressure report warns that data comparisons prior to 2012 must be treated with considerable caution, as referrals are now counted differently.  In previous years, a single recorded case may have included several children in the one family whereas now, a case relates only to an individual child.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that is only proper.  The number of protection and welfare referrals in 2011 was less than 32,000.</p><p>At the end of December, Tusla employed 1,396 whole time equivalent social workers, an increase of 29 since its establishment.  Some 164 social workers have been recruited since the agency was established and a further 219 are at various stages of recruitment.  At 6.7%, the turnover of social workers in the agency's first year of operation was less than international comparators.  I recall that when previously addressing this committee, the comparative figures for the United Kingdom were much higher, those for the US higher again and those for Western Australia as a percentage was in the low 20s.  From memory, the Australian figure was 23%, the US figure 20% and that of the UK was 15%.  We all acknowledge this is tough work and the turnover of social workers tends to be quite high.  It is a great tribute to the social workers working in our service that we have one of the lowest turnovers in this area.  I understand that in the past people liked to compare the turnover of social workers with the turnover of nurses, but that is not an appropriate comparison.</p><p>The Deputy expressed concern in regard to the disparity between the 5.6% I mentioned and the 4.8%.  The 4.8% increase relates to an increase in the revenue available.  A further &euro;12 million odd is available to Tusla in capital and when the two amounts are added together, we get the figure of 5.6%.  I apologise for any confusion that may have caused.</p><p>I did not intend any disrespect to Deputy Troy in not answering his questions first.  In regard to the adoption (information and tracing) Bill, this legislation is being worked on assiduously.  We are a small Department and have had significant work to do on the commission of investigation and its terms of reference, but we are working assiduously on the Bill and hope to have it ready in weeks.  I had a meeting on some of the heads yesterday and I assure the Deputy the Bill will come to the House long before the summer.  I think I have dealt with all the questions and we can move on to the various headings.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there has been an increase, but I am concerned because last year there was an overrun of &euro;25 million in regard to the new agency.  At the lead-in to the budget, the CEO of the agency, Gordon Jeyes, said he would require an additional &euro;45 million for the agency to stand still, but a further &euro;60 million would be required if the agency was to fill the vacant posts and finance essential new developments.  In light of this, I have a number of questions.</p><p>I have raised the issue of the guardians <i>ad litem,</i>GALs, a number of times.  I submitted a parliamentary question last summer on the full year of 2013 and up to August 2014.  If the trend continued, the GAL bill would be higher in 2014 than in 2013.  I acknowledge this is not an issue of Tusla's making.  It is a historical problem, but that said it needs to be addressed.  What progress has been made on addressing this situation?  It is unbelievable that such large sums of money are being spent on legal representatives.</p> <p>At the same time, there is a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, to which the Minister just alluded, on an internal report presented to the board of the Child and Family Agency last week which states,&quot;Backlogs are so acute in some areas that hundreds of extra staff are needed t bring numbers to manageable levels&quot;.  I emphasise that the report is internal.  Unpublished figures show that more than 8,000 abuse, neglect and welfare cases of concern about children at risk are waiting to be allocated a social worker.<br/><br/>What is the situation?  Through the last question I asked during questions to the Minister in the D&aacute;il, I raised the issue of the serious shortfall in the number of social workers.  I gave the example of a social worker I spoke to who did not even give me her name.  She said that instead of feeling they were helping families, social workers now felt they were part of a system that was causing further harm and stress.  I asked the Minister in particular about the recruitment process for social workers.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the approval of a social worker must go before an internal committee which is a working group headed up by Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  Even an agency or temporary social worker has to be approved by this committee.  Social workers are predominantly female and at an age where they will be taking maternity benefit.  If a person gives notice after they feel it is appropriate to state that she is pregnant, the notice to take maternity leave will not be considered by the working group until she actually leaves on maternity leave.  That causes a further delay in the appointment of replacement social workers.  If that is happening, it is a major issue which is contributing to the problem of so many cases remaining without social workers.<br/><br/>On the Children First legislation, to which the Minister alluded, I welcome the fact that it will come before the committee for debate on Committee and Final Stages.  I hope the Minister will take some of our amendments on board.  The Minister said he will not sign the commencement order for the legislation until there is a proper lead-in time, which is appropriate.  My fear relates to the national vetting legislation about which I asked a question during the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il earlier.  The legislation was approved by the Oireachtas 18 months ago but the commencement order has not been signed because, perhaps, of the financial implications of doing so.  Are we going to be in a situation where we will not be able to put into effect the Children First legislation which will make the reporting of child abuse mandatory?  Is the Minister sure that sufficient resources are being allocated under this head to permit the legislation to be passed and commenced this year?<br/><br/>I have raised the school completion programme with the Minister on a number of occasions, most recently before Christmas as a Topical Issue matter.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but it appears the programme does not have its own head in the Estimates.  It falls under the Child and Family Agency.  There is a worry that this means it does not have the same priority and may be diluted into the future.  If this is a mere perception, the Minister might say so.  Pre-school inspection services fall under this head also.  A further inspection is being approved by the Department of Education and Skills and I wonder if there is a duplication of work at a time when resources are very limited.  We should not be duplicating what we should be streamlining.  We should ensure that one inspector can do the two jobs rather than to hire an additional one.</p></speech>

I do not expect the Minister will to know but I ask in case he might.  Does he have any idea as to how that money might be expended in the course of 2015?  Are there any particular projects for which it might be earmarked?</p>  <p>  I refer again to an issue I have mentioned to the Minister.  It is not to cause him any discomfort, but to say to him that it merits further examination within the Child and Family Agency.  When the Minister read out the criteria for intervention, he talked about immediate risk.  Those were the words he used in his reply to me.  The word "immediate" could constitute something very much in the current.  It is very important to bear in mind that we have had over the past 12 months a number of cases that have come to public attention where the word "immediate" as I as a layperson understand it did not might not have suggested itself, yet there were very serious and tragic outcomes.  Substantial risk had been established by social workers in relation to some of those cases.  I acknowledge that within the budget here this is not going to be physically possible.  This is a problem.  We need more investment in Tusla, but I believe and there is a belief outside these walls that because of the constraints of the allocation, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has newly determined what the activation quotient must be in terms of immediate risk.</p>  <p>  There is a need to accept the following in regard to substantial risk and immediate risk; use whatever marker one will.  If a child is established to be at risk, the employment of the word "immediate" is less relevant than it might be in other instances.  This is very important and needs to be looked at in the context of the alarming and tragic situations highlighted in the course of the last 12 months.  I raise the matter because I fear that those tragic situations will continue to present until we are better provided and better prepared to intervene where a real and substantial risk exists.  I ask the Minister to give me whatever response he feels is appropriate, but the reason I raise it is to urge the greatest possible exercise of his and the Department's influence within Government to ensure that no child is left in an unsatisfactory position of risk because we are not able to fund the necessary supports and interventions.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned, in his response on this area to questions I have posed previously, the numbers in respect of recruitment.</p> <p>Approximately 100 additional social workers have been recruited while more than 200 "are in the process of...".  "In the process of" has been cited to the committee on many occasions previously.  It must be a long process.  I acknowledge it is important that we have the right people to do this most important work.  Can the Minister give a breakdown of the recruitment process and how it applies to the number in process at this point in time?  When will they get across the line and be properly engaged in the work that they, and we, hope they will undertake?</p> <p> The Minister also failed to point out that there is a greater turnover of social workers.  Statistics have shown that to be the case over a number of years.  A considerable number leave not only at the end of their natural life service.  Prior to the Minister taking up this portfolio, a comparison of previous recruitment data and the exodus of social workers highlighted a net loss.  Will the Minister focus on that to give us a sense of where we are at?  What is the total number in service?  By "in service", I do not include those who are on sick leave, maternity leave, career breaks through whatever special arrangement may apply, and so on.  How speedily does he expect the number in process to move forward into their intended roles as social workers under the Child and Family Agency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22015020300006#E00200"><p>Deputy Troy mentioned the issue of the GALs.  This has also concerned the Tusla, the Department and me.  We have examined different systems in Europe, the UK and Northern Ireland, in particular.  We have put proposals to Tusla, which are being examined currently.  The agency's officials are exercised about this issue.  There is no doubt that much greater regulation is needed in this area.  For instance, regulation of who can be a GAL is needed.  Currently, anyone can be a GAL.  We are examining this and proposals are in train.  As is only right, given the agency will implement them, Tusla will examine the practicalities around that.  The Deputy is correct that this is an important issue and we are acting on it.</p>  <p>  Social workers were mentioned.  Deputy Troy said the chief executive officer is involved.  The chief operations officer, Mr. Fred McBride, is involved in the social worker issue.  We have an obligation to ensure resources are apportioned appropriately across the system by the agency and, therefore, it has a process in place to review vacancies as they arise and to determine, for example, where and when these should be filled.  Reallocation of posts may be required.  The Deputies are correct about turnover and about staff on maternity leave.  At the end of 2013, Tusla employed 1,396 whole-time equivalent social workers, an increase of 29 or 2.1% since its establishment.  A total of 164 social workers have been recruited since the agency was established and a further 219 are at various stages of recruitment.  At 6.7%, the turnover of social workers in the agency's first year of operation is less than international comparators.  A total of 112 left the agency in 2014 - 20 retirements and 92 for other reasons such as career breaks.  Turnover in this area is partly a reflection of the challenging nature of the work because it involves working closely with extremely vulnerable and marginalised children.</p>  <p>  The age and gender of the profession is also a factor, as the Deputy said, with some teams under pressure due to maternity leave.  A total of 92 social workers are currently on maternity leave.  We have a pilot maternity leave scheme whereby temporary workers can be offered a 12 month contact to cover maternity leave and, in addition to ongoing recruitment, the Child and Family Agency is progressing a number of initiatives to address staff shortages.  These include the pilot maternity leave scheme, where temporary staff can be offered a 12 month contract to cover maternity leave.  In recognition of the challenging nature of the work, new entrants and graduates have a reduced workload for their first year with opportunities for regular supervision with experienced practitioners.  In addition, Tusla works with agencies providing family supports to ensure the agency's social work teams can focus on the children and families in greatest need of their specific skills.  The agency is preparing a workforce development plan for completion by the end of the summer and further measures to support staff retention will be considered.</p>  <p>  The agency employs 3,452.54 whole-time equivalent staff, which is an increase of 1.2%.  The increase in the number social workers, therefore, has been greater that the overall staff increase.  More than 83% of all staff are in the health and social care professional stream, which includes 1,396 social workers, 1,161 social care staff, 176 family support workers and 72 education and welfare officers.  I have no reason to believe that any replacement has to be approved by the chief executive officer of the organisation but I will double check that I am not giving the Deputy incorrect information.</p>  <p>  Deputy Troy is concerned that the lead in time for the Children First legislation will be overly long.  That will not be the case.  At the end of December I wrote to the agency through the Department in my performance statement seeking a business plan for 2015, which is expected later this week.  I then have 30 days to respond and the process specifically included at my request a stipulation that Children First be addressed in terms of preparation and planning.  We, therefore, do not anticipate there will be the same problem to which the Deputy alluded under another Act.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of inspections.  I have been at pains to reassure the sector in this regard.  I do not want additional red tape and people to be tied up with unnecessary administration.  I have spoken to the Minister for Education and Skills about this.  There will not be a duplication of skills.   The inspectors of the Department of Education and Skills inspectors will focus on education and learning in the preschool year, which is not part of the current regulations.  Tusla and the Department's inspectorate will work together to make sure the process works well and in collaboration.  It is the intention that the inspectors will be semi-contemporaneous in order that there will not be loads of different inspections with different personnel visiting schools.  I understand that the Department will consult the sector and will provide information between February and June.</p>  <p>  The Deputy specifically mentioned the concern around the risk to the child.  These are the experts at assessing risk and I made inquiries regarding all those tragic scenarios that pertained last year to ascertain whether social workers had been allocated and each case had one.  I am sorry that tragic scenarios will continue to occur because that is the reality of life.  It is not possible to prevent them, any more than we can prevent all instances of illness and unfortunate outcomes.  The open high priority cases are a mixture of cases where the initial referral determines a child protection concern and they need further assessment.  Those who are further along the process of assessment where the early work was done by a duty social worker now need an allocated social worker.</p> <p>They also include children in care where a social worker has left or been moved.  This is a difficulty.  I have spoken to children's groups about this and they mention this in terms of what they do not like about care.  They do not like moving place and having their social worker changed.  However, as we all know, staff move around and there is very little we can do about that.  People make career choices.  The agency is very exercised about trying to maintain continuity of care for young people.  It is very important.</p> <p> There are cases awaiting allocation to an assigned social worker, and these are reviewed regularly by the responsible team leader and principle social worker pending allocation.  They are managed through a duty system which will respond, as appropriate, within the available resources.  Some long-term child protection teams will operate this system, where cases transfer from duty and there is not the capacity to allocate immediately due to existing caseload levels or staff vacancies.  Each area has internal protocols for managing these cases, with team leaders holding responsibility for cases until they are allocated.</p> <p> We have been informed separately that managing cases on duty involves telephone calls to referrers or teachers who see the child regularly to check on the situation.  In some cases the duty social work team, which changes periodically, will call directly to the child or family to determine the current situation.  </p> <p> Cases which are high priority are defined as follows: initial assessment of child protection concern; further assessment of child protection concern; awaiting child protection case conference; a child subject to a child protection plan or a child subject to court proceedings; a child in care with non-approved carers; a child in care less than six months; a child in care in an unstable placement; and a child at high risk due to mental health or anti-social problems.  The majority of the cases in this category are awaiting further assessment of a child protection concern.  This is a dynamic process.  Cases are not left without any further assessment taking place or without anybody watching over the situation.  None the less, we are challenged in terms of trying to attract new social workers.  The issues of recruitment and the time it takes to recruit staff were mentioned, which we need to address.</p> <p> The school completion programme was mentioned.  It is an area of considerable importance and one which can bring children back into mainstream education.  We are determined to see it protected.  As with any service, there are areas where things can be improved and we can get more value-for-money.  The ESRI is compiling a report on this and comes with a clean pair of hands.  We will await the outcome of its findings and consider them in detail.  I have already covered ECCE inspections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22015020300007#F00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  On his point on the ESRI review of the school completion programme, is there a date for publication of the review?  To be fair, the participants in the scheme are quite anxious, as he knows, in terms of their vulnerability and sustainability into the future.  Any organisation that has a review hanging over its head always thinks of the worst outcomes.  It is important that we know when the ESRI will provide feedback to the Minister and how long it will take for him to mull over the review and bring clarity to the issue.</p>  <p>  In regard to educational outcomes, the Minister mentioned the new inspectors.  It is a duplication of work.  If it was the only thing the new inspectors were required to do, why not put a new section in the regulations and ensure that existing inspectors carry out the work?  </p>  <p>  I go back to the point I have continuously raised about the people who currently carry out inspections in early childhood settings.  As there is a requirement that public health nurses are involved, why, as promised by a predecessor of the Minister, would the Department not consider opening up the process to allow for applications from people with relevant early childhood care and education experience for inspector roles?  Those roles have been advertised and filled, but unfortunately the process has been restricted to public health nurses.  A change would help to target the problem.</p>  <p>  We could tick backwards and forwards all day on the issue of social work.  I accept that the Minister is trying to make progress in this regard, and it is difficult.  The figures he read out are unbelievable.  Of the 112 people who left in a particular year, only 20 involved retirements.  That shows that a serious proportion are leaving for other reasons, primarily maternity leave.  My information is that people are also leaving because of the pressure of their workload.  It is high because there are not sufficient numbers of workers to deal with the caseload.  </p>  <p>  While I accept that the Minister cannot answer my question now, I again refer to hiring people for temporary positions.  Does that need to go before a national committee?  Can that not be considered for those going on maternity leave, who have to give six months' notice?  I understand that cannot be done until a person goes on maternity leave.</p>  <p>  Part of the reason people are leaving this area, apart from the fact that it is highly pressurised, is that there is no career development.  Even if one wants to further one's career in this area, there is no senior social worker position for those who have five years' experience.</p></speech>

In real terms, leaving the capital allocation aside, there is a 4.8% increase, but that is not enough.  </p>  <p>  On departures, of the 1,396 whole-time equivalent social work positions, leaving aside the 164 recruited during the course of the year - because Tusla has been in existence for only a year - some 1,232 are still in place.  The 112 who left represent about 9%.  It is very high figure and one can make all sorts of international comparisons, but at the end of the day it is a very high departure rate.  Deputy Troy made the point that only 20 were retirees.  The other 92 left for other reasons, including burnout.  I understand that; it is a very difficult job.</p>  <p>  I refer to my question on the 219 posts which are at various stages of recruitment.</p> <p>I understand if the Minister does not have the information with him.  I was asking how soon any of these posts - preferably all of them - will be filled, adding to the number that are currently in service.  That is the crucial thing.  I am less concerned about whether he can answer in detail today, but I am anxious to try to impress on him and his colleagues that there is a huge job to be done in pressing for an increased allocation for his Department in order to properly address these issues.  </p> <p> I accept the point made by the Minister that we will not be able to avoid all of the tragic outcomes that have taken place.  I accept that, but please, let us not have a situation in which it is at all arguable, by whomever would want to take that course, that such a tragedy was caused by a failure of the system to respond.  That is what it comes down to.  In my view, we have got to be able to respond in all cases where at all possible.  My only concern is that we have sufficient properly trained social workers and a Child and Family Agency that is properly provided and resourced to carry out its function, so that we can minimise, if not eliminate, these terrible, tragic situations that create such anguish, pain and great upset across the whole community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22015020300008#G00200"><p>In regard to Deputy Troy's question on the ESRI report, I am not in a position to tell him precisely when that will be.  When the ESRI is finished its work - I do not have an indication when that will be - we will take a number of weeks to examine the report.  It would be unwise to do otherwise.  I fully accept the Deputy's point that those involved in the school completion programme will be anxious until that process is finished, which is understandable.</p>  <p>  In regard to the issue of inspectors, public health nurses are trained and have experience of child development, so they are suited to work in areas of inspection.  Around a quarter of the existing inspectors are from other professions.  Recent recruitments of principal inspectors were open to a wide range of professions.  The issue of recruiting others at the basic grade will be considered by Tusla and the Department.  It is an area that we need to examine, because public health nurses are also in short supply.  If we could take them off this work then they could get back to their other work.  It would be to everyone's advantage if we could train inspectors, in a different way, to look after this work.  However, inspectors that come from the Department of Education and Skills look at a different element - the education element.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the issue raised about social workers, I will repeat that the turnover rate for social workers is 6.7%, which is lower than many of the equivalent figures internationally.  It is lower than that of the UK, much lower than that of the USA and lower again than that of western Australia.  Social work is challenging.  It is a tribute to social workers here that the staff turnover is much lower than among our international comparators.  It is not true to say there is no career development, because there is; they can progress to senior social work, etc.  </p>  <p>  I wish to make a general point about Tusla.  At what point is one ever able to say that one could not do with more money and more things?  We have done particularly well in 2015, given the fact that we have come through six years of a very severe economic contraction, which is putting it mildly.  I shall not turn this into a political football.  We have managed to protect a lot of the funding in the area of youth and children, plus the ECCE programme, through the worst years of recession that this country has endured.  We have to keep our minds open in this matter and we will seek to improve.</p>  <p>  I wish to state two things.  First, we would like to get more funding for more initiatives.  Second, there is a huge duty on all of us here to ensure that taxpayers get value for money and that the things we are doing achieve the outcomes we seek.  That is one of the things I am very strong on.  There is continuous evaluation of the programmes we have in place to ensure they deliver on what we want, which is better outcomes for children, and are not just there to make us feel good or because we feel it is the right thing to do.  I do not have much more to say on this</p></speech>

It is a welcome development.  When the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, secured the funding for it, I acknowledged that fact.  It is only right and proper that when something is being done correctly it is acknowledged, and I have no problem in doing so.</p>  <p>  Sometimes there is a difference in the words used.  With regard to the phrase "formally handed over", sometimes a project is handed over to the operators when the facility is not yet in operation.  Is Oberstown in operation at the moment?  Is the building being used to house detainees?  If not, when will it do so?  Is the Minister confident that sufficient funding has been put by?  There has been a reduction in the capital spend, which I accept, and there has been an increase of 11% in current expenditure.  Will the increase be sufficient to ensure the facility is adequately resourced and staffed?  We know of situations in which people have children and teenagers with psychological issues but, unfortunately, because certain areas are inadequately staffed, these young people have had to be placed in adult facilities.  That is something we cannot see happen again.</p></speech>

There is money to staff these new units.  We will introduce legislation very shortly to allow the three units to be run as one.  I will give him an idea of the situation.  The increase in the capacity of child detention schools also requires an associated increase in staffing levels.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned the recruitment of an additional 67 residential care staff.  Following a recruitment programme carried out in 2014, the first cohort of 38 new staff were taken up at the end of November and a further phase of recruitment is currently being advanced.  It is intended that the required staff complement will be reached in the second quarter of 2015.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will know, some of these are new units.  They are all new units, but some of them will replace existing units and other ones are extra units.  Therefore, we will have increased capacity and we will be able to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, meeting the Government's commitment that no children under the age of 18 will be in adult prison facilities.</p>  <p>  To answer Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, I have not checked in the past number of days, but there are still 17 year olds on remand in St. Patrick's Institution. </p></speech>

Some preschool services have been put to the pin of their collar and may not survive.  A rally on this issue will take place in mid-February.  Will the Minister restore the capitation rate in place three years ago?</p></speech>

The allocation for 2015 has been reduced by &euro;2.6 million and the Minister indicated that 68,000 children will benefit from the scheme this year.  Some people make a substantial case for the introduction of a second free preschool year, while another strong lobby argues instead for having the highest possible standards apply across the board in the existing service.  Time and again, when lobbied on this issue, I am told there is a significant variation in the standards that apply.  The highest standards must be attained but this will not be achieved while the Minister holds the capitation payment at the reduced level that has applied in recent years.  The &euro;2.6 million saving in the current year could have been employed to help bring the level of supports and provision to the highest attainable standards.  It is my understanding that this is what many service providers and parents would appreciate.</p></speech>

It provides excellent opportunities to parents of young children who are trying to survive on a budget.  I visit many of preschool facilities and have listened to many parents speak on the issue.  While it is clear that the services are brilliant, service providers appear to be losing out financially on the preschool year and are experiencing serious difficulties as a result.</p>  <p>  The Revised Estimate notes that services may charge parents for additional services provided, including additional hours and activities.  Many parents tell me that the preschool year now costs more than previously because the services are introducing fees for additional services.  No one wants to tell a child he or she cannot participate in certain activities as the child could be left in a corner while the activity takes place.  I am relaying to the Minister concerns parents have raised with me.  </p>  <p>  The issue is one of funding.  Service providers argue that the funding available limits their ability to provide the programmes they wish to offer.  When they introduce additional activities, the costs must be met from parents' pockets.  Parents do not want to tell their children they cannot participate in a grow and stretch programme.  I agree with Deputies Troy and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that the matter must be reviewed.  I also agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point that while a second preschool year would be very welcome, we should first ensure the current free year is done right.  Young parents cannot afford to dig deep.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22015020300009#H00700"><p>To respond to the first concern expressed by Deputies, the small reduction in the funding available reflects the smaller number of children who are using the service.  This is the result of a small decline in the population.</p>  <p>  On a more general point, Pobal estimates that 24,000 people are employed in the child care sector.  It is important to remember that these services are provided by private, commercial and community child care services and the level of remuneration provided to child care workers and their conditions of employment are matters for the management of the relevant services.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme is for three hours per day, five days per week, 38 weeks of the year.  I agree with the design of the programme, which aims to provide parents with choice.  The service is paid for on a capitation basis in order that the State has some say in the standards and quality of care being provided.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Troy asked whether we should have taken the opportunity to increase capitation rates.  It would cost between &euro;5 million and &euro;7 million to restore the previous capitation rate.  The reduction in the number of children availing of the scheme will not generate sufficient savings to restore the capitation rate.  This is one of the areas to be examined by the cross-departmental group we have established.  </p>  <p>  Other issues raised include the possibility of introducing a second free preschool year, the quality of the service provided in the current year and what other facilities should be in place after ECCE.  I, like all Deputies, knock on doors and meet parents who tell me the service is great but they still have to pay someone to bring their child to and from the provider because they have to leave for work at 8 a.m. and do not return until 6 p.m.  We have to examine how we can help parents in that position.  There is considerable evidence to show that having children in a semi-educational setting is highly beneficial for but only for approximately three hours per day.  A different type of service needs to be provided for other times.</p>  <p>  We must also consider after-school care for children aged between six and 12 years and 13 and 18 years.  The interdepartmental group has much work to do and must examine all these issues.  I would like it to produce a number of well thought-out and costed options for the Government's consideration by the summer. </p>  <p>  The problem of charging for additional activities, which also applies to schools, is one the interdepartmental group can also consider.  </p></speech>

The additional charges which the Minister considers a problem are a necessity because the services require more money to break even.  I am a member of the board of management of a community facility in my constituency.  I was unable to attend a meeting of the board held last night but I learned that it is planning to organise a 5 km fun run to help bridge its deficit.  The current shortfall has been caused in part by the current capitation rate.  I cannot emphasise enough the need to increase the capitation rate paid under the scheme.</p></speech>

I presume it will be used to fund a new grant scheme to be introduced this year.  Will private services, which were unable to avail of the scheme last year, be eligible to avail of the new scheme?  Will the scheme be primarily for maintenance works or will service providers be able to apply to it to fund improvements in infrastructure?</p> <p>The funding for the CCCE programme and the CETS programme is being maintained at the same level and that is welcome.  In November 2013 the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs confirmed that a review of these schemes would take place.  Has that review happened?  If so, will the Department share the findings of the review with Oireachtas Members?  If it is not prepared to do so, will it give the reason?</p> <p> The new mentoring and service training support scheme was to be rolled out as part of the quality agenda on foot of the RTE expos&eacute; of the terrible activities, albeit in a small number of cr&egrave;ches.  When will this scheme be rolled out?  I understand that 30 staff have been employed but I also understand that they are in an office, unable to go out to do the work for which they have been employed.  I was told this as late as Sunday evening by one of the newly employed people.  They feel frustrated at the delay which means they are not doing their work.</p></speech>

Therefore, I am unable to provide  the Deputy with any further information at this time.  The review to which the Deputy alluded is not complete but that work will inform the interdepartmental group.  With reference to the new mentoring better start and training support scheme and the Learner fund, &euro;4 million has been ring-fenced to support the quality agenda for the early years services.  A total of &euro;2.5 million has been provided to finance a quality support service, Better Start, for preschool services.  Thirty graduates in early childhood care and education have been recruited to work directly with services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear framework and the Aistear curriculum.  The new service will work closely with the city and county child care committees and the voluntary child care organisations to support service-providers to improve the quality of their services.  The work of the service will be based on a new practice guide, based on S&iacute;olta and Aistear, which is currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment.  A total of &euro;1.5 million per annum has been provided to finance a training support scheme known as the Learner fund, which amounts to &euro;3 million over two years, to assist staff already working in the child care sector to meet the new child care qualification requirements which are being introduced from September 2015.  The Learner fund is being implemented in conjunction with Pobal and the local city and county child care committees.  It will allow individual staff to choose their preferred training provider from a list of accredited providers who have been approved following an expression of interest process.</p></speech>

The Deputy might confirm if that is correct.  I was not certain if the area-based childhood programme might also be.  I ask the Minister to offer some clarification on his Department's briefing document.</p>  <p>  With regard to child care initiatives, there is a drop of 12% on that figure which is the next area, subhead B.5.  That said, I welcome the fact that provision is being made for the after-school child care scheme where the focus will be to prioritise community employment participants with preschool children.  That is very important and it is in tandem with the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I refer to a reply to a parliamentary question I asked last June.  The scheme was originally formed with 6,000 places and an allocation of &euro;10 million.  In June 2014, after its first year in operation, 154 places had been availed of.  It is clear that the scheme is not working.  How many places are being utilised now?  If such a small percentage of places were taken up originally, how was the balance of the money spent?  Why is a significant sum of money being allocated to the scheme this year if it is not being utilised and availed of to the extent originally anticipated?</p></speech>

As a result, the number of places under the scheme was reduced to 500 in 2014, from the original figure of 6,000.  The funding allocation in 2014 was &euro;2.205 million and this has been reduced to &euro;1.323 million because of the decrease in the number of places from 500 to 300.  The number of places actually available is likely to be higher than this, as some parents will not require a pick-up service and some may require child care places for fewer than five days per week.</p>  <p>  The community employment child care programme is administered by this Department on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  When it was realised that the take-up on the after-school scheme was low, discussions with the Department of Social Protection led to the creation of a scheme targeted specifically at Department of Social Protection clients participating in the community employment schemes operated by that Department.  The programmes provide part-time care for children up to the age of five and from July 2014, after-school care for primary school children up to the age of 13, of persons participating in community employment schemes.  A total of 1,200 preschool and 800 after-school places are available on this programme.  The Department of Social Protection determines eligibility for the child care places.  It is a popular scheme and the take-up is good.  The cost of the programme in 2014 amounted to &euro;6.72 million and this is being maintained in 2015.  In addition, administration costs associated with the programme are expected to be approximately &euro;320,000.</p></speech>

Based on my exposure in my community and across my constituency, I can attest without question that the money directed to youth organisations and services is well spent.  The Minister has outlined the various programmes and services that are supported under subhead B.6.  There is no end to confirmation of my point on money being well spent in the lives of so many young people, for whom the funding has meant so much.</p>  <p>  I accept that the Minister has explained his position, but I would have liked to have seen additional money in this area.  As he said, the grants were for one year only and I cannot make a case to the contrary.  I have to accept what he has put in place.</p></speech>

This comes on the back of a disproportionate cut under the subhead in recent years.  That said, it is welcome that the funding is being maintained.  Is it through these funds that the money is made available to the various education and training boards, formerly the VECs, which administer funding to various youth groups throughout the country?  Each group must submit an annual plan.  Last year it was well into 2014 when the groups were advised of their reduced allocations.  This made it very hard for them to plan for the year ahead.  When will they be advised of their allocations for 2015?</p></speech>

I work on the ground locally and know the benefits of working with young people, particularly children in poorer areas.  Without some of the community organisations, the volunteers in particular, many children would slip into a wider space from which they would not be able to be taken out.  I acknowledge that the Minister cannot make any commitment in respect of the 2015 budget, but I ask that allocations be increased in this sector because of the great work being done on the ground by many organisations but particularly the volunteers who are not paid and who volunteer week in, week out.  Without them, many communities would not be able to survive.</p></speech>

The Minister referred during the last exchange to grants to organisations that were partly funded.  The grants covered a single year.  The area-based childhood programme covers four years, from 2013 to 2016, inclusive.  We know that Atlantic Philanthropies is closing down its support structures next year.  While I acknowledge that there is an increase this year which I hope will be maintained into 2016, we must think ahead.  I understand there are 13 dependent sites benefiting.  Will the Minister indicate whether he and his Department are looking beyond 2016 in this area?  One should make no mistake that all of the funds are focused on children and families in disadvantaged circumstances.  How do we fill the vacuum that will be created by the departure of Atlantic Philanthropies' support after 2016 and perhaps with the cessation of the programme at the time?  Is the Minister giving any consideration to this issue?</p></speech>

Much has been learned in this regard.  The total amount of committed funding available in the period 2013 to 2016, inclusive, will be &euro;29.7 million.  As I stated, there are 13 sites involved in the area-based childhood programme and ten are now operationalising innovative programmes in their respective areas.  The other three are expected to be operational early in 2015 as certain local issues have required increased engagement with Pobal prior to the finalisation of contracts.</p>  <p>  Ongoing implementation and governance support is being provided by the Centre for Effective Services and Pobal for the area-based childhood services throughout the life cycle of the programme.  Through providing this support, high fidelity and sustainable implementation of evidence informed services will be optimised.  It is the intention of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to seek to mainstream the learning under the area-based childhood programme.  The Department is in the process of considering how best this learning can be disseminated and replicated in mainstream services after 2016.</p></speech>

What is the position on the strategy and when will it be published?  Will the cross-departmental group about which the Minister spoke regarding the affordability of child care feed into the strategy?</p> <p>Will the cross-sectoral teams, about which the Minister has spoken, with regard to supporting children with special educational needs who want to attend a mainstream school be integrated into the early years strategy?

The objective of Ireland's early years strategy is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland's early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to six years.  The strategy will address a range of issues affecting children in the first years of life, such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, and play.  Considerable work has been done on the development of the early years strategy, and from the start the work of the expert advisory group has greatly informed the work.  I have signalled my intention to conduct focused consultations with relevant parties throughout the early childhood care and education sector before concluding my own deliberations on the strategy.  I am also mindful of the importance of other work which has been undertaken in parallel, in respect of the future investment priorities in child care.  Taking account of these developments, I expect to be in a position to publish the strategy once my consultations have concluded in the coming months.</p></speech>

It is looking at future investment in child care and the early years are but one section of child care years.  We have zero to six, six to 12 and 12 to 18.  People often forget about the 12 to 18 year olds and the latchkey kids, as they are called.  Many parents are very uncomfortable about the fact their children are under no supervision between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. and would like to see some way of having this addressed.  It is part of this work.</p>  <p>  I do not mind what way one feeds into the other as they will both inform each other.  I will not stand up and jump about it, but to me it makes more sense that the early years group would feed into the interdepartmental group.  They will both inform each other.  In my view one cannot operate in silos.  It is a terrible mistake we made in the past in other areas of the public services we deliver.  We need to ensure we have a seamless coherent service for children as they pass through various stages of development.  We all know the transition phase for children is the most difficult time, going from little school to big school and from school to university.  These are very difficult and challenging times for younger people.  The idea is to have an overarching policy that looks at how we invest in our child care through different age groupings, and how to get the best outcomes for the children.  We need to look at how we spend money now, as it is not always about vast volumes of new money but better bang for the buck we spend at present, and we need to assure and reassure ourselves, through continual evaluation, that we are getting the results we want for our children, which are better outcomes for them.</p></speech>

In fact the throughput has been very slow.  The committee had a particular focus on matters relating to the Adoption Authority of Ireland regarding overseas adoptions 12 months ago and before.  I am anxious to know how the AAI will employ this additional money.  What is expected of it?  Is there an increase in staff?  It is not about proposers of adoption, it is about children in the first instance, be they here in Ireland or overseas.  I echo the concerns of some that some young children have missed out on opportunities for adoption here in Ireland in recent years, and that certainly concerns me.</p></speech>

The additional funds are intended to support the authority in meeting its increasing legal costs, plain and simple.  There is no increase in staffing levels or anything of that nature.  Much good work has been done by the authority over the past year in terms of Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam with regard to foreign adoptions.  I am sure everybody here wants to be assured that any adoptions we do become involved in through inter-country adoptions are done with the best interests of the child at heart, and that we do not find ourselves caught in a situation where people cannot trace their birth mother or find out who they are.</p> <p>We are applying all of the new standards in that regard.  I am informed by the authority that the agreement and protocol to which it signed up with Philippines was adjudicated by UNICEF to be the standard to which others should look.</p></speech>

Members will have seen statements from Dublin and Cork airports outlining their responses to the committee's invitation.  Members will also be aware from correspondence that officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport did not consider it appropriate to attend today's meeting as the Irish takeover panel has ruled that Aer Lingus is now in an offer period and, under Irish market abuse law, the relevant officials are deemed to have access to inside information and are obliged to ensure that such information remains confidential.  Members are also copied with the submission made by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, which on balance views the potential takeover by IAG positively.  The committee has received a significant number of communications from members of the public on the possible takeover.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Emmet Oliver and Mr. Kieran Donoghue, IDA Ireland; Mr. Niall O'Donnellan, Enterprise Ireland; Dr. Neil Walker and Ms Mary Rose Burke, IBEC; Mr. Stephen McNally and Mr. Tim Fenn, Irish Hotels Federation; Dr. Neil Walker, IBEC; and Mr. Adrian Cummins, Restaurant Association of Ireland.  We hope this engagement will provide the committee with a greater insight into what the possible consequences of a potential takeover of Aer Lingus might entail.</p><p>I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I wish to advise also that any submission or opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Kieran O'Donoghue to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

They will be familiar with the role of IDA Ireland. We are the Government agency responsible for promoting Ireland as a location for foreign direct investment, FDI.  We report directly to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in this capacity.</p>  <p>  We currently manage an investor portfolio comprising approximately 1,100 international companies.  These companies employ more than 174,000 staff directly and spent approximately &euro;22.4 billion in the Irish economy in 2014.  Our client companies operate across a diverse range of sectors, including international financial services, life sciences, medical technologies, pharmaceuticals, IT, engineering, and online and professional services.  Companies in these sectors undertake both manufacturing and service activities and include firms such as Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Citigroup, State Street, Google, Facebook, Pfizer, GSK and many more.</p>  <p>  As a general rule, the principal markets and customers for these companies are located outside Ireland.  As a result, Ireland is a base or platform from which these companies export their products and services to the UK, continental Europe and other international markets.  In 2013, the year for which the latest data are available, exports by IDA client companies were valued at &euro;125 billion, equivalent to 67% of total exports from Ireland.</p> <p>As Ireland is an island nation with no direct land bridge to Europe and other markets, these companies are critically dependent on air, sea and telecommunications linkages from Ireland to their home countries, suppliers and customers.  In this context, Ireland&rsquo;s ability to win and retain foreign direct investment, FDI, is critically dependant on international air connectivity - for passengers but also, increasingly, for air cargo.  This dependence is increasing over time.</p> <p> There are several reasons why air connectivity matters for FDI, on which I wish to dwell briefly for a moment.  It provides the principal means by which international companies and their key decision makers visit Ireland and assess the country, the jurisdiction, as a location for investment.  Air access enables executives from existing companies to engage in person with their overseas headquarters and with affiliates around the world.  The functions or activities performed from Ireland are increasingly what we describe as &ldquo;high-touch&rdquo;.  Sales and marketing departments, EU headquarters and so forth require intensive face-to-face interaction between Irish-based executives and overseas colleagues and customers.  An increasing number of multinational companies are in the services sector rather than the goods-producing sector, which is generating increased demand for passenger services into and out of Ireland.  Services are expanding as a share of total exports from Ireland and now account for 53% of total Irish exports.  Manufacturing firms are producing more high-value, low-volume products that are increasingly being transported by air.  Air cargo currently accounts for 16% of total merchandise trade from Ireland by volume, but 38% in value terms.  As the markets served from Ireland increase in number and become more geographically distant, the importance of global reach and time-to-market considerations is expanding the importance of high-quality air connections into and out of Ireland.</p> <p> As a result of these trends and developments, Ireland needs frequent, direct and competitively priced flights to multiple destinations in the UK, the United States and Europe.  We in the IDA would also like to see the commencement of direct connections to destinations in the Asia Pacific region as our business in this region, particularly in China and India, grows.   As the committee knows, the largest segment of our business is made up of US companies locating activities in Ireland to service European, EMEA or international markets.  In a company&rsquo;s site selection process, the ability to fly executives from key cities in the US, convenient to their HQ location, directly to Ireland is an important consideration.  For example, several client companies have made representations to us seeking ongoing development of Ireland&rsquo;s air links with the west coast of the United States and other geographies.  Direct connectivity to the UK and Europe is also critical to winning investment projects from companies whose headquarters are in Europe.</p> <p> Significantly, there are destinations, particularly in the Asia Pacific region and close to second-tier European cities, that have no direct flights to Ireland.  In this case, it is important to have access to the large number of destinations served from key hubs, especially Heathrow.  This is achieved by high-frequency connecting flights from Dublin and other Irish airports.  While Dublin Airport is our primary gateway for inward investment, our increasing focus on trying to ensure a more balanced geographical distribution of inward investment within the country means that we need to preserve and, if possible, increase international air connectivity from airports such as Shannon and Cork.  At present, we have a total of 363 client companies, employing 64,000 staff, operating in the regions served by Cork and Shannon.  Such connectivity is a key part of a region&rsquo;s overall attractiveness that can influence the site selection and investment decisions of inward investors.  </p> <p> Ireland continues to have a strong manufacturing sector through the focus on and growth in high-value, low-volume products, typically in the life sciences and ICT sectors.  These are frequently shipped by air rather than sea due to the need for rapid delivery.  As a result, hold cargo as well as more dedicated air freighter options need to be available.</p> <p> Air connectivity is critical to winning and retaining inward investment projects.  We need long-term direct and indirect air connectivity to our major markets that caters for both passengers and freight.  We also need competition between carriers to ensure long-term cost competitiveness.</p> <p>With respect to any offer for Aer Lingus now or in the future, the IDA is not in a position to assess the impact of the sale of the company without a clear statement from potential buyers on their future development plans for the airline, its route network and services.  When such a statement is available, we would expect the relevant authorities here in Ireland to undertake a thorough due diligence of any proposal from a national interest perspective.</p> <p> In conclusion, therefore, I thank the Chairman for his patience and wish to make the following final points on behalf of IDA.  Ireland is a small, open economy that is highly dependent on trade and investment.  In this context and in terms of promoting Ireland as a location for inward investment, for tourism and enterprise development more broadly, it is vital that we maintain and enhance air access into and out of the country.  The IDA&rsquo;s principal concern is to ensure and develop air connectivity between Ireland and the sources of inward investment and the markets into which our client companies export goods and services both now and in the future.  Requests for information, especially from new investors or those contemplating expansion within Ireland, routinely ask for data on air connectivity, namely, on airlines, destinations served, frequency, etc.  This underscores, from the IDA's perspective, the fundamental importance of air access for Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract and support investment by international companies.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland is responsible for helping Irish companies export throughout the world.  More than 3,000 clients sell internationally to 189 countries, resulting in more than &euro;17 billion in export sales in 2013.  This has resulted in more than 300,000 jobs in these companies through direct and indirect employment, which is 16% of the workforce.  As we speak, clients are operational throughout the world in all major centres, with teams from these companies talking to buyers, investors and suppliers, working with key decision-makers on current and future projects, as well as working on-site in many locations.  All of this requires global mobility, which is absolutely central and which covers the sectors in which they are involved, namely, software services, engineering, life sciences and food.  Our companies are regionally spread throughout Ireland, with the majority of jobs being outside Dublin.  As for the markets into which our companies sold in 2013, in terms of exports, 36% went to the United Kingdom, 21% into northern Europe, 12% into southern Europe and the Middle East, 12% into the United States of America and 7% into the Asia-Pacific region.  As members can see, these exports are spread widely throughout the world.  These are global companies selling internationally.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland works with these companies in developing their business plans, building their capability, introducing them to opportunities overseas, helping them to access the knowledge and research in colleges and providing finance, both directly and indirectly.  We have 32 offices overseas in all the key markets.  As I stated, central to the selling ability of our companies is air connectivity to all key world markets.  Consequently, the critical issue for Enterprise Ireland is direct access to key markets.  Enterprise Ireland and its clients certainly seek to understand that there is a potential for increased direct access to global hubs for connecting flights, as well as access to regions in the United Kingdom, that is, not just the south east and London region but also to other regions in the United Kingdom.  Moreover, as a consequence of the regional spread of Enterprise Ireland's companies, access from Dublin, Cork, Shannon and throughout Ireland is of deep importance.  As a conclusion, the overall criterion for Enterprise Ireland and its clients as to changes in the provision of air connectivity is whether the current services are, at the very least, not disimproved.  Ideally, they would be improved.</p></speech>

I am IBEC's director of policy and corporate affairs.  My colleague, Mr. Neil Walker, heads up our infrastructure unit, whose policy remit includes transport and spatial planning.  IBEC is by far the largest business representative organisation in Ireland, with thousands of corporate members across dozens of industries, as well in the not-for-profit sector.  We operate a countrywide network of staff with regional offices in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Donegal and Waterford, reflecting the broad geographic spread of our membership.  This strong regional structure is supported by policy specialists based in our Dublin and Brussels offices.  There are frequent interactions on regional concerns, including regular seminars and workshops.</p>  <p>  IBEC's transport council, for which Mr. Neil Walker, is responsible, represents both the users and providers of travel and transport infrastructure.  It is the national voice of business regarding all transport policy matters.  Our core objective for transport policy, including air travel, has always been to ensure appropriate investment in services that will continue to support competitiveness, economic growth and an enhanced quality of life.  Our transport council has previously made submissions to Government on national aviation policy, as well as on regulatory issues concerning Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  Over recent weeks, we have taken particular care to consult with our members, through the council, in order to formulate a balanced and an informed position on the implications of a possible sale of the Government's Aer Lingus shares.  Given the size and diversity of our membership, it would be unrealistic to expect complete agreement.  Nevertheless, there is a fair degree of consensus on the issues at stake and on the approach that ought to be taken in response to IAG's most recent overture.  Our members have identified three distinct issues for consideration, namely, the impact of any share sale on the national economy, in particular business and tourism; the impact on balanced regional development; and the impact on our public finances.  In addition, I will offer brief observations on the concerns expressed by other stakeholders regarding the extent to which a sale of Aer Lingus shares might lead to rationalisation of jobs in Ireland.  I will also speculate on the potential consequences of a decision by the Government not to sell its 25% shareholding at any price.  </p>  <p>  It is important to start by acknowledging that there is no formal offer from IAG on the table and that we do not yet have all the details in regard to its plans for integrating Aer Lingus into the group in the event of a takeover.  However, subject to appropriate safeguards, such a deal could well represent a positive economic opportunity for Ireland as a whole.  As I will now outline, there are considerable synergies to be exploited to Ireland's overall benefit.  The resulting economic gains would, however, need to be shared across the regions and I will return to this particular point shortly.</p>  <p>  Ireland's ease of access to the rest of the world is a key competitive advantage and is crucial for jobs and investment.  Excellent connectivity is essential for foreign investors and Irish exporters, as well as our tourism industry.  There are good reasons to believe that IAG sees the possible acquisition as a springboard for further growth on the key North Atlantic routes.  In recent years, Aer Lingus has successfully grown its share of that market, reflecting the logistical advantage of our location, as well as the brand marketing of what is still seen as our national carrier.  Given the capacity constraints at Heathrow, the home base of British Airways, there could well be scope for IAG to promote Dublin as a secondary hub, thereby growing the amount of traffic and improving Ireland's international aviation links.  We do not believe that IAG is seeking to buy the company simply in order to strip assets, such as landing slots.</p>  <p>  A major concern, however, for some of our members is whether the business plans of IAG would include any commitment to maintaining strong aviation links to Shannon and Cork.  Any prospect of reduced frequency of access to Heathrow for Irish travellers would be a big concern, in particular for those using these regional airports.</p>  <p>  The outcome on Cork and Shannon Airports of any share sale must, therefore, be a consideration for the Government.  International connectivity is a legitimate concern, in particular for our south-west region which is heavily reliant on Heathrow as an aviation hub.  However, we believe judgment should be reserved until IAG has had an opportunity to explain its plans in detail and, if possible, to explore ways and means of allaying these concerns.  Recent indications are that IAG is, indeed, willing to give appropriate assurances, including binding commitments on the issue of landing slots.</p>  <p>  In regard to Ireland's public finances, if a formal offer emerges in excess of &euro;2.50 per share, this would represent more than 60 times the annual dividend paid to the Government over recent years.  It would allow for a reduction in borrowing or preferably for an increase in capital investment on essential public infrastructure, such as land transportation.  IBEC has for some time been arguing that the level of public investment has been too low for the needs of a growing population and that spending needs to double over the period to 2020.</p> <p>The proceeds of a share sale could arguably be put to good use rather than retaining the shareholding. </p> <p> In recent days, some stakeholders have expressed fears that a takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG would lead to large numbers of jobs being lost at the airline.  This appears to be based on observations of what happened to Iberia after it was fully merged into IAG in 2011.  However, the two situations are not really comparable.  Aer Lingus has undergone several rounds of rationalisation during the past decade, becoming one of the most efficient airlines in Europe.  As recently as yesterday, Aer Lingus has been seeking to achieve voluntary redundancies in its workforce as part of an initiative that commenced two years ago.  Any company, regardless of its ownership, aiming to compete and thrive in a dynamic international market must strive continually to be lean and efficient.</p> <p> It is worth considering also what might happen in the longer term if the Government was not minded to accept any bid.  Although Aer Lingus has been performing well in recent years as an independent national carrier, it remains a small regional player in what is an increasingly consolidated global industry.  There are few other groups in Europe capable of offering the same type of strategic fit as IAG, and there is always the possibility of a hostile bidder emerging to take control of the company at some point in the future.  The Government stake would not be able to block such an outcome.  We anticipate that the expert group now advising the Government on its best course of action will be cognisant of all of these points. </p> <p> To sum up, we see the proposed merger as potentially very beneficial for the company, for tourism, for inward investment and for the wider business community.  We acknowledge that there are legitimate concerns for particular regions but we believe that these can be addressed given sufficient goodwill and trust-building.</p></speech>

The Irish Hotels Federation, which was founded in 1937, is the national representative organisation of the hotel and guesthouse sector in Ireland, and we are a key stakeholder in Irish tourism.  Tourism is one of Ireland's largest indigenous industries, providing 205,000 jobs, which is equivalent to 11% of total employment in the country.  It accounts for almost 4% of gross national product.  With 54,000 people directly employed in hotels and guesthouses across every county and town, the hotel sector is playing a critical role in contributing to recovery in the tourism industry and the wider economy.  We believe the potential sale of Aer Lingus would have enormous implications for the tourism industry and the wider economy, given the unique challenges Ireland faces as a small island on the edge of the Atlantic with no passing footfall.</p>  <p>  Maintaining strong levels of connectivity with our international markets is of vital importance.  As such, the IHF has serious concerns about the sale of Aer Lingus and the prospect of the reallocation of its Heathrow slots to other routes down the line.  Let there be no doubt about what is at stake.  Any agreement that fails to safeguard those slots for Irish routes would have serious consequences for the long-term prospects of our national tourism product.  The future loss of these slots is very real risk for Ireland given the constraints currently faced by Heathrow Airport, which is now at full capacity.  In light of the critical strategic importance of these slots, it is imperative that the Government secure contractual rights to determine their use as part of any potential sale of the State's interest in the airline.  In this regard, we support the recent commitment from the Government to seek a permanent and cast-iron guarantee in respect of connectivity for Shannon, Cork and Dublin Airports.  </p>  <p>  The temporary five-year arrangement proposed by IAG is entirely unacceptable.  There needs to be a permanent commitment if any sale is to be considered by the Government.  From a regional perspective, for  Shannon and Cork, Heathrow slots are crucial in terms of providing tourism and business links directly to the south and west of Ireland.  The figures speak for themselves.  In 2014, passenger numbers between Shannon Airport and Heathrow stood at 233,000, while passengers numbers between Cork and Heathrow stood at 400,000.</p> <p>The loss of the slots would be detrimental for national tourism, business employment and the ability of the west and south regions to attract multinational investment and sustain economic growth.  Given the stakes involved, it is imperative that the Government uses its shareholding to protect the valuable slots in the national interest.  Any other course of action would be short sighted.  Thank you, Chairman, for the opportunity to address the Oireachtas joint committee.  We look forward to addressing any matters the members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian Cummins" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015020300008#K00300"><p>I am here in my capacity as chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland.  On behalf of the association I thank the Chairman and committee for inviting me here to speak on such a crucial issue for the tourism industry in Ireland.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland represents more than 1,700 restaurant owners and small businesses in every county and constituency in this country.  A substantial 45% of people involved in the tourism industry work in the restaurant sector.</p>  <p>  The proposed sale of Aer Lingus to IAG should not be rushed and whatever decision is made must be considered in the national interest.  Hasty decisions will result in the loss of a national asset that is respected worldwide.  Last week the committee heard from Chambers Ireland, trade unions and Shannon Airport.  I do not intend to go over old ground covered by the committee but to set out how the restaurants sector in Ireland views the proposed takeover.  Tourism numbers in Ireland have returned to 2008 levels after five lengthy years of despair and hardship, especially for small tourism businesses.  Markets that have seen significant growth are North America, mainland Europe and long-haul destinations, all of which have proven that access is paramount for tourism levels to continue growing.</p>  <p>  It gives me great pleasure to mention Ireland&rsquo;s flagship tourism project, the Wild Atlantic Way &ndash; 2,000 miles of a national treasure which has proven to be one of the greatest economic generators for the west coast.  This project is reliant on Ireland&rsquo;s aviation connectivity with the world.  When tourists arrive in Shannon and Cork airports they expect to start their journey on the world&rsquo;s most written about, iconic and talked about tourist routes.  Yesterday, when IAG released its statement giving the Government legally binding assurances to protect the 23 London Heathrow slots for five years, it was a step in the right direction.  It gave some reassurance to our all-important tourism industry but it did not go far enough in my opinion.  There was indeed something missing from the IAG statement, namely, the safeguards for Cork and Shannon airports with regard to connectivity to London Heathrow.  Also omitted from the statement was any reference on the future of the Aer Lingus regional brand servicing Kerry, Cork and Donegal.</p>  <p>  I suggest that the Government would give a commitment to the effect that the details of the proposed sale would be laid before the Oireachtas, as provided for under section 3 of the Aer Lingus Act 2004.  As an island nation, Ireland is very dependent on connectivity and the tourism industry strongly depends on access to the country.  It is simple; the more access, the more tourists will visit our wonderful island.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland is opposed to the sale of Aer Lingus if there are no long-term, cast-iron guarantees that the 23 Heathrow slots are safeguarded for Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports.</p></speech>

I wish to ask one question before I hand over to the members.  Mr. Donoghue from the IDA made a point that was echoed in the other presentations, namely, the importance of connectivity to all of the airports and the regions.  He said he would like to see the commencement of direct connectivity to destinations in the Asia Pacific region as IDA&rsquo;s business in the region, in particular in China and India, grows.  He then referred to clients continually looking for the ongoing development of connections to the west coast of the USA.  Could the ongoing and new connectivity that is needed be provided by Aer Lingus at present, the <i>status quo</i>as it were, or would it be better provided under a new arrangement?</p></speech>

Hubs such as Heathrow and, increasingly Dubai, are used for that purpose by our clients.</p> <p>However, strategically and thinking long term, should an economic business case develop to allow it to happen, a direct service to those destinations would be helpful to our clients.</p></speech>

From the bulk of what we have heard today it is clear that the State's part ownership of Aer Lingus has been vitally important in developing not just our tourism sector but also, as importantly, our key business sectors throughout the country.  Aer Lingus's access through Heathrow in particular, as identified by Mr. Donoghue, is a critical component of our foreign direct investment offering, and obviously needs to be maintained.  There is almost unanimity about the necessity to retain that connectivity.  Where the spread of presentations seemed to tail off was in how it is hoped to achieve that in a sale.</p>  <p>  To some extent, all the witnesses have referred to ways of allaying fears, which is what Ms Burke identified.  She spoke of putting certain guarantees in place.  Anybody I have spoken to in the corporate sector, however, cannot understand why we are discussing the notion of some kind of guarantee from the purchaser of the State's shareholding.  How one might put in place or structure a guarantee that would ultimately ensure that the State would not lose access to these markets is almost laughable when one talks to corporate lawyers.  Nobody in the real world is suggesting that one can put such guarantees in place.  That is why I would welcome it if the witnesses, who have indicated they accept the notion of selling the State's share, could outline how some kind of irrevocable guarantees could be put in place.  Two of the witnesses said that five years would not be enough and that it should really be in perpetuity, but nobody seems to be coming forward with any methodologies for doing that.</p>  <p>  Interestingly, Ms Burke is the only person I have heard in recent weeks suggesting that somehow &euro;2.50 per share might represent good value for the State.  Even people who support the State's disposal of its shareholding are saying that &euro;2.50 or &euro;2.55 per share significantly undervalues that shareholding.</p>  <p>  I want to ask all the representative groups - although not Enterprise Ireland or the IDA - if Aer Lingus is a member of any of their groups and, if so, what is the airline's annual contribution to those organisations?</p></speech>

I suppose we could go back seven or eight years to how this thing started in the first instance and how we were left with a 25.1% rather than 100% share, but we are where we are.</p>  <p>  As regards IBEC's position on this, has Ms Burke asked her membership in Limerick - which I represent, including Castletroy, Raheen, Newcastle West and all over County Limerick - if selling the 25.1% share in Aer Lingus is in their best interests?  The last time we went down this road, when the first 74.9% was sold, we saw the slots being removed from Shannon Airport and put into Belfast with great aplomb.  </p> <p>It was the only measure from the South the then First Minister in Northern Ireland, the late Dr. Ian Paisley, welcomed.</p> <p> What engagement has IBEC had with its member companies in the Limerick region?

We are a national organisation and we have to balance the views of members across all sectors, all sizes of business and all geographical locations.  Through the transport council, we have contacted our members who have an interest in this area and have looked at those.  As I said in my statement, it would be unrealistic to think that we would have complete agreement on the issues because there are quite a diversity of views, but there certainly is consensus on the three distinct areas that I outlined which look at the national interest: the impact on the national economy, particularly business and tourism, the impact on balanced regional development, and the impact on the public finances.  Those are the three issues that our members, as a collective, believe the Government needs to take into account.  Equally, as we saw, the Government's holding of 25% does not currently give any guarantees around the slots, and what appears to be on offer is some more control than the Government currently has.</p></speech>

If one asks any executive of a multinational IDA Ireland company in the mid-west, one element that has been key to bringing such companies into the Limerick and Shannon region is that it has an international airport and the deepest seawater port in the country.  I cannot square how IBEC would represent-----</p></speech>

The point I would make in that regard is that the 25% shareholding the Government has gives it very little control over operational issues as it currently stands.</p></speech>

Everyone seems to be agreed there are enormous implications for the sale if it takes place.  We have heard differing views.  I would certainly be worried about the issue, which has not been mentioned, of job losses.  IAG, if it was to take over here, would start trimming the workforce and start to bring it up to what it wants.</p>  <p>  I note IAG stated it would give a five-year guarantee on the slots.  That is not worth the paper it is written on.  What would happen after five years?  We have seen a steady growth in difficult economic times of sectors such as tourism and manufacturing.</p> <p>We are talking about putting that in jeopardy for the sake of &euro;300 million, which one can compare to the value of the tourism industry.  The people from IBEC know how many jobs and the level of exports that are involved.  I do not see the logic in a sale.</p> <p> The Irish people should have a say in this by means of a referendum.  This asset belongs to the State and not to any political party that comes into power or has the numbers in Parliament to deal with it.  When it comes to assets belonging to the State, the people should have a say.  There are vested interests who support that sale of the remaining shares owned by the State - for example, executive managers, among others, stand to make &euro;30 million.  If I had shares in a company, I would forever try to sell them if I thought the market was right.  We have one of the most modern fleets around.  It is not that big is good, which seems to be the general impression I am getting.  We have an airport and a service that is fit for purpose.  It is modern, up to date and doing extremely well.  Why would we take a risk in selling slots in Heathrow that mean a lot?</p> <p> IBEC never surprises me; it always seems to favour whatever deal is on.  Ms Burke indicated that she does not believe IAG would strip assets from the company.  I do not know what that is based on.  She also argued that the money from the sale could be invested elsewhere.  We are talking about &euro;300 million, and when we weigh that up against the risks, including the overall consequences, I cannot see the logic in making a statement like that.  When we see eminent people such as Michael Smurfit outlining their serious concerns, we should consider why we would sell something that is working and delivering in the middle of a massive recession.</p></speech>

I ask the representatives from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland about a hypothetical scenario in five years' time if we get guarantees on Cork and Shannon.  If disaster struck and the Shannon and Cork services lost those slots, what would be the consequences for people who are trying to go out and attract foreign direct investment in the area of the 33% of Enterprise Ireland-supported exports that go to the UK?  What are the consequences when one leaves Dublin and goes to other parts of the country?  Do the witnesses believe this could be detrimental for foreign direct investment?</p></speech>

If the regional airports, particularly Cork and Shannon, lost access to Heathrow, it would certainly have a negative impact on our ability to distribute foreign direct investment into the regions.  Our existing clients use that infrastructure to access Heathrow and travel beyond the Heathrow hub.  There would be a negative impact if that happened.  The reality is that we do not know what is likely to happen.</p></speech>

No more than anybody else in business, as the people from IBEC know, if I buy something, I would not have somebody else down the road running that business for the next five or ten years.</p> <p>If someone buys a company, he or she buys it and runs it himself or herself.</p> <p> I read Richard Branson's book over the weekend about what happened in England with BA and so on.  In the hospitality sector, we have the greenway in County Mayo.  Tourism figures have increased.  We are struggling outside Dublin to attract FDI, including in places such as Athlone, Carrick-on-Shannon, Limerick and Cork.  We have to put our best foot forward to get people working because that is not happening at the moment.  Is there a risk to tourism and everything else we have talked about after work even in the five year slot?  Five years in a person's life is a while but in the life of a country it is minuscule.</p></speech>

Our largest tourism market is the UK.  More than 3 million of those visitors came from the UK and, therefore, connectivity is absolutely crucial.  We must also never forget that we are an island and it does not pass one by.  It is either coming here or it is not.  From that point of view for businesses in our industry and in tourism all over the west coast and the south, connectivity is imperative for us to sustain growth.  Every industry has had a difficult five years but tourism has been a shining light and it would be folly for something to threaten that now.</p></speech>

We are at the 2008 level now and we need to move forward.  The west coast depends on tourism.  Many places are seasonal operations and they do not want to market their business by telling visitors they must fly into Dublin.  They want to market their business by telling them they can fly into the closest airport.  The assurance on connectivity for Cork and Shannon airports must be ring-fenced to enable major growth in our sector, especially on the west coast.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-03a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015020300012#O00400"><p>I welcome our visitors.  The <i>journal.ie</i>opinion poll on this found 58% of respondents against the takeover, 6% against it at the price and 21% in favour.  I find the comments of the industry representatives strange, given that they do not reflect what I am picking up.  My constituency comprises a substantial number of the diaspora and they are appalled that this is getting such credence.  The Stock Exchange rules should not have been invoked earlier and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport should have appeared before the committee.  Pro-takeover information is being leaked to the newspapers every day and Parliament has been restricted in its discussions of this.</p><p>I refer to the positive comments of the representatives of the development agencies.  IDA Ireland's submission states: &quot;We need competition between carriers to ensure long-term cost competitiveness.&quot;  I could not agree more.  Economists always oppose these anti-competitive mergers.  They welcomed the deregulation of the market and its opening up to new entrants.  In its home market, BA is substantially smaller than easyJet - by at least 10 million passengers - and Ryanair.  How BA came to be seen in this country as the patron saint of the regions and the tourism industry is bizarre.</p> <p>Let me tell the committee what its record is on the island of Ireland.  Northern Ireland has 190 air routes: eight from Derry, 81 from Belfast International Airport and 29 from George Best Belfast City Airport; of those, only one route is operated by British Airways.  In this country there are 264 routes, with 175 from Dublin, 41 from Cork, 30 from Shannon, 12 from Knock and six from Kerry - again, with only one route operated by British Airways.  How people formed the view that selling Aer Lingus to British Airways would promote Ireland as a destination is bizarre.</p> <p> Let us see how British Airways treats its own regions.  Glasgow has 268 routes, of which two are operated by British Airways; Birmingham has 217 routes, with none operated by British Airways; Manchester has 225 routes, with one operated by British Airways; and Edinburgh has 179 routes, with one operated by British Airways.  Guess where these routes go?  They go to Heathrow, because British Airways is Air Heathrow.  It promotes that hub.</p> <p> Let me give an account of what British Airways has done in the UK regions.  BA had previously operated a significant hub at Manchester, but Manchester operations ceased, along with all international services outside London, when the subsidiary BA Connect was sold due to a lack of profitability.  Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA, either to or from regional UK destinations, must now transfer in London.  When Ryanair was founded, Heathrow had 35 million passengers a year; the figure is now 72 million.  It says it is full in order to preserve the value of the slots.  It keeps expanding, and that is where BA plans to divert the Irish business.  It is really amazing that people from the business community cannot see the value of what is being done by Aer Lingus as a brand, particularly on the north Atlantic routes.  Approximately 2.4 million passengers travel between Dublin and Shannon and North America.  The equivalent figure in Scotland, which is a bigger country and also has a diaspora, is about 400,000.  British Airways is not what Willie Walsh tells you; it is what it does, and what it does is to seriously neglect Manchester, Belfast, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow.  I would advise members to go and look at the numbers before people make these presentations - wondering, as Deputy Fitzmaurice said, about what might be, and whether we can get a guarantee.</p> <p> On a radio programme last Saturday, I spoke against this measure.  I utterly oppose it and I will be voting "No" at every opportunity.  After the programme I called in to what used to be Superquinn in Lucan.  There is not the slightest shred of evidence that my good friend Senator Feargal Quinn was ever there, that he founded it, or that he worked in it for four decades, because it is now owned by Musgrave and it is called SuperValu.  That is what happens when firms take over.  Instead of asking whether we can get a guarantee on this and that, people should realise that it comes down to one thing: either they want a national airline, or they do not.  The pilots, who own 7%, are strongly in favour of retention.  Mr. O'Leary has 30% and the Government owns 25.1%.  We can make Aer Lingus a strong airline by it doing what it has been doing.  In every market in which it has competed, Aer Lingus has knocked British Airways for six.  This is the inferior competitor taking over a profitable airline which has made great progress under Christoph Mueller.  The concern I also have is that neither David Begg nor Christoph Mueller was at the meetings at which this was discussed, and we would rely on them to represent what the management and the workers have been doing in recent times.</p> <p> Handing the decision on a vital national issue over to a committee of bankers, financiers and accountants and the Stock Exchange takeover panel puts aviation policy in the lap of the same people who bankrupted the country on 29 September 2008, which we are now trying to investigate.  Do not make the mistake a second time.  This is a profitable airline that has been doing a valuable job.  It has 11 million passengers and people say it has an uncertain future.  In 2001, Ryanair had 9.4 million passengers, and it will have about 100 million passengers this year.  EasyJet, which had 11 million passengers in 2001, will have 65 million passengers this year.  There is no reason a profitable Aer Lingus cannot grow.  It does not have to be bought in a hostile takeover - and it is hostile, as far as the vast majority of Irish people in Ireland and abroad are concerned, and it should be seen as such by this Parliament.</p></speech>

As Senator Barrett indicated, in a recent poll, 58% of respondents said they were against the takeover and 21% said they were in favour of it.</p> <p>I do not know whether I am for or against it.  The people who are against it say the implications are enormous.  Job losses have been mentioned as well as the potential to lose the slots.  The connectivity between Dublin and the regional airports has been mentioned also.  </p> <p> Those for the proposal say it is a good development because IAG is in a much stronger position financially to grow tourism in Ireland.  It sees value in the Aer Lingus brand and it can probably provide direct access to the routes and the services indicated that Aer Lingus cannot currently do.  If the sale goes ahead and IAG takes over Aer Lingus, it will not become a dead duck because IAG sees the ability to grow tourism and improve direct access to Ireland for businesses.</p> <p> What is clouding everybody's view of this issue is the emotional chord.  Aer Lingus is Ireland.  When an Irish person gets on a plane in New York, London or Spain, they feel they are at home, which is not the case when they board any other airline in the world.  Our emotions are taking over in this debate.</p> <p> The other side of the coin is the potential political fallout.  When Aer Lingus was put up for sale by the previous Government some years ago, I do not know whether there was as much debate about it then as there is now.  It must be remembered that the Government only holds 24% or 25% of the shares in the airline.  If it decides to sell them, where does that leave Ryanair, which will carry 100 million passengers?  Could it block the sale?  Will this deal be good for Ryanair?  If the sale goes ahead, do the witnesses believe that IAG, with its strength and power, will sabotage what we already have or grow business for Ireland?</p></speech>

There does not appear to be any reason to think that IAG has anything other than growth ambitions for Aer Lings.  In our deliberations we have not seen any red flags that would indicate concerns.  From what we can see, it would appear there is growth ambitions from Aer Lingus and on that basis we see that there is potential for Ireland to become a bigger aviation hub and to grow its connectivity, thereby enhancing the competitive environment for both foreign direct investment and indigenous businesses.</p></speech>

The reality is that Aer Lingus has been in play for the past number of years.  There have been a number of takeover discussions and the expectation would be that if it is not this deal, Aer Lingus remains in play and therefore what will the future hold?  We will be back here again.  This is not a new place in which to find ourselves.  Aer Lingus probably will not survive as an independent entity in the long term and, therefore, we have to discuss the salient issues now.  It is a profitable, well-run and lean organisation and it is an acquisition target in a consolidating industry.</p></speech>

It must be borne in mind that we could face that after a five year period.</p></speech>

It may or may not be, but the issue here is the potential conflict of interest between the interests of the island of Ireland and the interests of IAG as a corporation.  At this point, IAG wishes to purchase 100% of Aer Lingus, and the Irish Government has something IAG is seeking.  In any negotiation of whatever price will be agreed by the Stock Exchange or whatever incentive IAG might seek to present in terms of commitments and so forth to the Irish Government, as time passes they will disappear into history.  Somehow or other we believe it should be possible for the various advisers involved to investigate the feasibility of a contractual option that the Irish Government will purchase now and which could be exercised in the event that at any time in the future those slots are withdrawn from the Irish market.  They are tradeable assets as long as they are 80% used.  While we have a minority shareholding in the company, we cannot dictate how they are being used, but the day before we sell is the day we have an opportunity to gain some ground in regard to what the future usage of the slots will be.  We strongly suggest that when discussing contractual rights over those slots, there must be some means by which the lawyers can devise a way whereby Ireland can purchase those slots now or have an option to purchase at market value at some point in the future, but in such a way that the strategic interests of the island of Ireland are protected in the transaction.</p></speech>

Let us be realistic.  With the best will in the world, we are not in a position to do that at some theoretical point in the future.  That is why I raised the Musgraves versus Superquinn issue.  In the case of the takeovers of British Midland International and British Caledonian, they disappeared.  The winner takes all in that situation.  Staying with what we have, which is a proven success and growing airline that is at the approximate point where Ryanair and easyJet were at the turn of the century, will give the growth, not relying on an airline which is completely overshadowed in its home market by easyJet, with its tens of millions of passengers, and by Ryanair.  I do not know where this growth is supposed to come from by relying on British Airways.</p>  <p>  I support everything Mr. Fenn said about tourism.  I was a director of Bord F&aacute;ilte in the past - the Minister, Deputy Bruton, asked me to go on the board - and my main work was to break up cartel airlines and secure some competition.  Now I am in the Seanad.  These two airlines should be competing but the far less impressive one has more money to take over the very impressive one, which has been doing well as a reformed legacy airline.  The restaurants and hotels need that, and I support them fully.  I would hate to be a Scotsman waiting for British Airways to deliver much in the way of tourism to his country.</p></speech>
