    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018030700003#E00200"><p>The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00038/17, from Mr. Paddy Lambe, entitled "Bureaucracy and the Public Services Card".  It is vital that the person who applies for and passes the driving theory test is the same person who sits the subsequent practical driving test.  A person's identity is established to a substantial level of assurance through the standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, registration process, which results in the issuing of a public services card, PSC.  The Department accepts that this requires effort from citizens but asserts that this is a once-in-a-lifetime process.  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the petitioner and to close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0048/17, from Mrs. Anna McKenna, entitled "Drogheda City Status".  It seeks city status for the town of Drogheda.  The committee agrees to keep the petition open pending the publication by the Government of its report on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability.  We are proposing to put a six-month horizon on this petition.  I seek the agreement of members on this proposal.  Perhaps members would like to say a few words about the petition before we make a final determination on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018030700003#E00300"><p>I accept the Chair's ruling, which will keep the discussion open.  Some of the issues that surround the petition have been pointed out.  In my capacity as Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on local government, I met Mrs. McKenna and seven other members of the Drogheda city status group last week to hear their petition, which seeks to have Drogheda recognised with city status.  The methodology being used by the group to indicate the merit of its proposal includes Dr. Brian Hughes's statistical analysis of the region.  I do not accept the Department's response that this proposed designation, in removing a substantial amount of territory, population and resources from County Louth, would have implications for the viability of the county.  Quite frankly, the status of Drogheda as a stand-alone entity has been recognised in statute for hundreds of years.  In the context of this State, it had borough status for 100 years under the Local Government Act 1898.  This means that for most of the lifetime of this State, specific resources were distributed towards the benefit of the people of Drogheda.  In the same way, the people of my home town of Navan had their own council for 100 years.  This was denied to them when the town council network was abolished in 2014 as part of the butchery of the system of local democracy.</p></speech>

I am being a diplomat today.  It has been recommended that this committee should wait for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government's upcoming report on local government structures.  Quite frankly, that report will not go far enough to address the deficiencies that exist.  Having tabled parliamentary questions on this matter - indeed, I have tackled the Taoiseach on it - it is clear to me that statutory planning and budgetary powers will not be restored to the five old borough councils that existed.  The potential exists for three new boroughs, including my home town of Navan, to come under the auspices of this plan because they exceed the threshold of 30,000 people.  The current arrangements are unacceptable because an authority that does not have statutory budgetary and planning powers is not an efficient local forum for the people it represents.  More worryingly, I understand the Department's upcoming report will consider whether the new directly elected mayor for Dublin should have executive powers over parts of counties Meath, Wicklow and Kildare.  As I said clearly to the Taoiseach last week, under no circumstances will any directly elected mayor ever get executive control over parts of County Meath.</p><p>As I have said to the members of the Drogheda city status group, the petition before the committee, which is based on the premise that population statistics should be used, is flawed because it includes residents and citizens of County Meath in coastal areas like Laytown, Bettystown and Mornington.  I have advised them not to take parts of another county to form part of their petition in order to attain the end result they want.  I support the people of Drogheda in calling for stronger local government.  It is a town I know well because it is close to my home town of Navan.  I have worked in that town for the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>group.  It is a great town that deserves strong local government, but not at the expense of the annexation of coastal areas of County Meath in order to strengthen the argument.  On that basis, I believe the petition is flawed.  The people of Drogheda should make their case in their own right without resorting to taking coastal areas of County Meath.  I think the case for Drogheda is strong enough in its own right.  I would support the call being made by the Drogheda city status group if it were based purely on the town of Drogheda.  However, I cannot support it as long as it is bumping up Drogheda's numbers by taking parts of County Meath.</p></speech>

We have essentially agreed that we will keep the petition open and put a horizon of approximately six months on it, pending the publication of the Government's report.  I want to pay due respect to what Deputy Cassells has said about the issues relating to the jurisdiction of County Meath.  When petitions come before us, it is important in the first instance that they come before us in the correct and appropriate manner.</p> <p>We are keeping this petition open because the committee feels that the petitioners have the right to be heard.  I agree with Deputy Cassells that from a territorial perspective if the petition seeks to traverse a border for which it has no mandate then one could argue on the basis of common sense and practicality that it would be very easy to close the petition.  The committee has given due consideration and this is the reason we are keeping it open and also in deference to the Members of the Oireachtas who are representatives of Louth, who have spoken on this issue.</p> <p> The committee proposes to forward a copy of the correspondence we have received on this issue from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to all Members of the Oireachtas, Senators and Deputies for the Louth and Meath constituencies, so they will all be furnished with a copy.  I thank the committee members for agreement on this issue.</p> <p> The next petition received for consideration is Petition No. P0001/18.  It is proposed to forward to a copy of the response from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner informing him of the Private Members' Bill on waste reduction and to close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p> I shall now turn to Petition No. P00040/17 regarding Respreeza.  I understand that the petitioner has withdrawn the petition.  The committee respects her right to withdraw the petition but we acknowledge that we received the petition and gave it some consideration.  This petition will be withdrawn.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p></speech>

I am aware that Deputy Denise Mitchell is running late owing to a family matter.</p> <p>  We are meeting to consider the Revised Estimate for Vote 40 for the  Department of Children and Youth Affairs which was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 14 December 2017.  I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and her many officials whom I thank them for the briefing material supplied.  The proposed format of the meeting is that we will deal with the Vote on a programme by programme basis.  At the outset of the consideration of each programme the Minister can give an overview of it.  We will then take questions from members. </p> <p>  I remind members and those in the Visitors Gallery that mobile phones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting and recording systems, even when left in silent mode.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  The briefing material supplied in advance on the various programmes has been forwarded to members.  We will proceed sequentially and members will be called in the order in which they indicate.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2018030700002#A00600"><p>I am very pleased to be here, together with my outstanding officials, to discuss my Department&rsquo;s Revised Estimate for 2018.  In my opening statement I will provide a summary of what is included in each of the programme areas and may not need to do so again when we come to discuss each of those areas.  </p> <p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I remain completely committed to ensuring the full delivery of the programme for Government commitments.  I want to see an Ireland in which the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected and fulfilled; in which their voices are heard; and in which they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and into the future.  Of course, we all know that if we work to allow them to achieve their maximum potential now, it will influence what happens in the future.</p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for my Department for 2018 provides for a gross funding provision of &euro;1.383 billion which represents an increase of just under &euro;73 million, or 6%, on its 2017 allocation.  As a result, during 2018 my Department will spend &euro;1.355 billion on current expenditure and &euro;28 million on capital expenditure.  This is a significant investment of taxpayers' money.  My Department and its agencies are charged with the delivery of a complex range of policies, legislation and children's services.  To achieve better outcomes for all children and families, I am sure Deputies will agree with me that we must invest wisely in key services.  I remembered this well in negotiating the Estimate for 2018.  I, therefore placed particular emphasis on ensuring a solid financial base for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, together with priority areas for its development.  I also prioritised continued investment in quality early years education and care services.  These two areas comprise 90% of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  I also prioritised a number of other key elements, to which I will refer. </p> <p>  I have allocated &euro;754 million to Tusla, which represents an increase of &euro;40.6 million, or 5.6%, on the allocation for 2017 when the increase on the allocation for the previous year was &euro;37 million.  I have allocated &euro;485 million for early years education and care services, which represents an increase of &euro;20 million, or 4.3%, on the allocation for 2017. </p> <p>  The Vote also contains almost &euro;62 million for youth services - &euro;59 million in current funding and &euro;3 million in capital support.  These resources will fund youth services throughout the country, including services for those at risk of disadvantage.  They represent an increase of &euro;1.5 million, or 2.5%, on the allocation for 2017. </p> <p>  Other key expenditure figures include &euro;28 million to meet the operational costs of the Oberstown children detention campus.  I wish to say a few words about that investment.  When I visited the campus on Tuesday, I was very impressed by what I witnessed and heard from the seven young men whom I met, as well as the director, Mr. Pat Bergin; the chairperson of the board of management, Professor Ursula Kilkelly, and some of the other members of Mr. Bergin's senior team.  They talked to me about the young men on the campus advisory council, the equivalent of a student council, and what they had achieved.  They had put in place a framework for the council.  This is the first time ever in a detention centre that young men have worked with my Department in identifying standards which will feed into the reform of standards in the Oberstown centre.  They spoke to me about the Gaisce awards they had received.  They also talked to me about the random acts of kindness week in the school.  They mentioned the various fundraising events in which they had participated, be it for the hospice or the Irish Cancer Society.  They raised almost &euro;2,000 in the past year.  I promised them that I would mention this during the debate on the Estimates because I was very proud to meet them.  Yes, they come from troubled backgrounds, but they are beautiful young men.  Based on what I saw, I believe the investment - that is what we are talking about - is paying off.    </p> <p>  To return to the Vote, &euro;18 million has been allocated to meet the operational costs of my Department, &euro;9 million for the area based childhood programme, &euro;6 million for the intervention programme for children and young people, &euro;4 million for the Adoption Authority of Ireland and just under &euro;3 million for the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, all of which have seen an increase on the respective provision for 2017.  In each case I am satisfied that the extra resources are justified and that the respective agencies are capable of delivering on the objectives set for them. </p> <p>  During the negotiations on budget 2018 I worked hard to achieve increased resources for the priority areas I had identified.  I am pleased that, as a government, we can back up our stated commitment to children and young people with increased resources, targeted at the areas where we want to make a real difference in the lives of children and young people and their families.</p><p>During the past few years I have been working to put Tusla on a firm financial footing and to give it the resources necessary to implement some key improvements to services.  The &euro;40 million extra for the agency this year means that it can continue to address a number of major concerns, including implementing the mandatory reporting provisions of the Children First Act, addressing my continuing concerns about unallocated cases, rolling out the national child care information system and supporting critical areas, such as private and residential foster care, and services for domestic, sexual and gender based violence, and child homelessness. <br/><br/>I have long been committed to the expansion of Tusla&rsquo;s out-of-hours social work service.  Tusla&rsquo;s financial allocation for 2018 means that this will become a reality.  It involves integrating the three existing out-of-hours services into one national service with a national contact number, and an out-of-hours call centre for all foster carers.  I am pleased that this initiative will ensure that all parts of the country will have access to a social work service on a 24-7 basis. <br/><br/>In the area of family supports, which cover prevention, protection and welfare services, I was pleased to able to fund an additional 11 family resource centres, and I will make an announcement about that next week, as well as providing increased funding to expand the excellent services provided by the existing 109 centres as well.  <br/><br/>I am placing great emphasis on reforming the school completion programme to ensure that it is organised to best effect with a new governance structure.  I believe that the programme does extremely important work with some of our most vulnerable young people, and I want to ensure that it is supported and developed in the years ahead. <br/><br/>In the area of early years, I am pleased that we have been making progress in the supports for parents of young children.  Since my appointment one of my key priorities has been to address the historic under-resourcing in the area of child care. <br/><br/>As we are all aware international evidence is clear that investment in children during their early years results in long-term gains to children, families, the economy and society generally.  I could not help thinking about that when I was in Oberstown.<br/><br/>In recent years the significant increases in resource provision has enabled my Department to advance a number of key reforms and 2018 represents another significant step forward in ensuring access to quality, affordable, and accessible early years care and education. <br/><br/>The ECCE scheme will apply effectively for a full two years from September 2018, and it currently benefits some 110,000 children.  This will peak at about 126,000 children by April this year.  In addition, there has been a huge uptake of the measures I introduced last September in advance of the affordable child care scheme.  In 2017 we had an uptake rate of some 98%, or 68,000 registrations of children.  The most recent figures available to my Department indicate that the registrations have now exceeded 70,000.  I briefed the joint committee on 24 January 2018 on the progress we have been making to introduce the full affordable child care scheme and I will be able to set out a more specific timescale on it after the vendor for the new IT system has been appointed. <br/><br/>Among the legislative priorities that I will pursue this year are the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 [Seanad] which passed Second Stage in the Seanad some time ago; the Childcare Support Bill 2017, which passed Committee Stage last week.  I thank members for their co-operation and contribution.  This Bill, when enacted, will give statutory effect to the affordable child care scheme.  The Children (Amendment) Bill which will form the basis for major reforms of the current guardian<i>ad litem</i>scheme and service. <br/><br/>I know the members of the select committee share my ambition to have all three of these important Bills enacted as soon as possible.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I believe that the significant increase in resources under my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2018 brings great opportunities for a targeted development and improvement of services.  I will work closely with Tusla, my own Department and all of the stakeholders to achieve the best possible outcomes and the best value for money.

I take it that the family resource centres come under programme A.  I welcome the increase in funding for additional family resource centres.  Last year there were 109 family resource centres and next year that number will increase to 119.  That is positive and the family resource centres make a significant contribution.  I welcome and acknowledge the work the Minister and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have put into this.</p> <p>  I understand the ECCE scheme comes under a separate subhead, but that Tusla comes under this programme.</p> <p>  The funding for Tusla has increased last year and this year.  I want to drill down into the additional &euro;40 million that has been allocated to Tusla this year.  Did Tusla put an emphasis on a particular service where it wanted to spend some of that money in its business plan?</p></speech>

The key priorities are obviously an increase in staff, with the recruitment of 442 new staff.  It wants to respond to expected further increases in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting.  There will be a further expansion of the Tusla out-of-hours social work service, as I indicated in my opening statement.  The Deputy also referred to the increase in the number of and the expansion of the family resource centres.</p> <p>  There will be the completion of the much awaited national child care information system which I know the Deputy will be happy to hear about.  I can speak a little bit more about that if the members so wish.  There is further development in terms of the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  We will be adding an additional service for that work as well as supporting increased resources to ones that currently exist.  There will be a focus on therapy services, the educational welfare services and of course, the strengthening of the current governance and management support services for Tusla.</p> <p>  We have not had the opportunity to speak about a new development, which we put in place last year.  We will continue to provide services to unaccompanied minors.  We are working on a plan to receive unaccompanied minors from Italy and Greece.  We have received as many as will be coming from Calais and we have built the capacity and the expertise so that right now there are plans to do that as well.</p></speech>

Those minors had been vetted and were identified and were able to come.  I had the opportunity about a year and a half ago to visit one of the places where we were receiving unaccompanied minors.  It is extraordinary the way the people work with these young people.  They were able to give the minors support, especially as they learned the language to prepare them to go to school.  The figure of 41 minors was as many as we could take from Calais, but it was a real priority for me personally.  The agency responded quickly and with great expertise to put together that programme.  Things have changed, in particular in terms of Italy, and I think we will be able to find ways to receive the young people here, whereas there were some blocks not so much on our side but in our negotiations with the Italian authorities.</p><p>I believe some of the Tusla staff may have travelled to Italy recently or will go shortly.</p></speech>

I welcome that the Minister singled out the school completion programme in her opening statement.  At every opportunity I get I will raise that programme and the good work the people involved do.  I honestly do not know how they do that fantastic work on the budget available to them.  I am aware the Minister had the opportunity to visit the one in Kilkenny recently, which was very welcome.  Is there any increase under the Tusla money for school completion?  I welcome also the Minister's statement that there will be a slight increase for the domestic violence support services.</p></speech>

I note with appreciation the work of the Minister's officials, and the Minister also, who were involved in putting this together but from a personal perspective, having visited Oberstown and seen the facility, I wish to note with appreciation the 8% increase earmarked under subhead A4 and the various additional expenditures that are planned on the basis of that facility.  I want to note that having viewed the work of Mr. Bergin, his staff and the facility.  They even referenced the Minister having visited them on Tuesday and the Gaisce awards of which they are incredibly proud.  They mentioned it several times while I was in the facility.  It is very worthwhile for us to make our rehabilitation services as appropriate as they can be under those circumstances.  That is my only comment. </p></speech>

I deeply appreciate his statement and I believe they will be as appropriate as they can be as well.  I want to acknowledge and express my appreciation for the great interest the committee has taken in this issue.  That helps and makes a difference, and it supports their movement towards these kinds of improvements.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Funchion for asking about the school completion programme.  To answer the question on the amount that has been allocated for 2018, as in 2017, it is the same amount of money that is being allocated, namely, &euro;24.7 million.  It is important to note the reasons for maintaining that investment at &euro;24.7 million.  As we are all aware, a reform of the programme is required.  I have been working very closely with the Tusla executive, the board, my officials and effectively all the main stakeholders on examining the best way to reform.  We had an event in Farmleigh at which we brought all the key stakeholders together.  We are analysing that.  I am getting more information from Tusla.  I am aware that the school completion co-ordinators particularly as well as project workers and others who work on the programme are deeply concerned about the future, particularly into 2019.  There is a sense of urgency to identify the way we will move forward in terms of governance, human resources and also the programmes they put in place.  While I knew that we would be examining that, we make a similar investment in 2018.  When recommendations are made to me and decisions made, and I ask for this information regularly from officials, we will be in a better position to identify whether we require increases and what those will be for 2019.  I will be passionate and committed to ensuring that we have those increases for 2019.</p></speech>

I know she has consulted with the co-ordinators but it is very important to them that they are consulted.  I have seen many good examples at first hand of people who have benefited greatly from school completion.  If a student is in a school completion programme school he or she has access to counselling, play therapy at primary school level and homework clubs that help students with homework.  The difference that makes to children cannot be measured.  I want to stress to the Minister the need to ensure that the co-ordinators, and not just Tusla officials, are always kept in the consultation process because they are the people who have been dealing with the programme for years and they know their stuff, so to speak.</p></speech>

For example, of the four who came to the Farmleigh event, we asked if they would identify themselves and that they would report back to the other school completion co-ordinators.  Subsequent to that, I have been to a couple of other regional locations including Kilkenny and my own constituency of Dublin South West.  I also intend to meet other co-ordinators on the ground in the context of the schools where they are working with the wider team, the home school community liaison officer, the education and welfare officer, the school principal and the chair of the local management committee.  I want to hear their concerns and take those into account as well as the recent event and the work of the officials and the Tusla executive, whose members I know have put a huge amount of effort into their recommendations.</p></speech>

It relates to the context and the impact indicators.  I see that the number of open cases with Tusla assessed as needing a social worker is up to Quarter 2.  I assume that is to June 2017.  At that stage, the number of open cases needing a social worker was 25,886 and for the entire year 2016 the number was 25,034.  Can the Minister explain that to me?

The announcement last year of the extra two years of the ECCE was very welcome but that does not come in until September 2018.  What happens to the children who thought they would enrol in January or April this year?  Some of the providers are saying they cannot take them on because the scheme has changed but, technically, it will not change until September.  What is happening in the meantime?  It is a question of operation more than anything else.</p></speech>

Indeed, there is an article in this morning's <i>Irish Examiner  </i>from Ms Catherine Corless on the specific request she has made in respect of the ultimate findings of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  I am going to operate on the assumption she contributed to that article on the basis of information she has been provided with in respect of DNA tracing.  Is the Minister confident the commission has sufficient monetary funding to complete this as quickly as possible?  I know it might roll into next year in respect of finalisation of the report, as is envisaged in the interim report.  However, the Minister might like to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2018030700002#D01000"><p>In respect of the money, as Deputies will note, in 2018 the overall budget is &euro;3.3 million.  That is a decrease of 44% or &euro;2.7 million on the allocation for 2017.  Why is there that decrease?  It is because there was an overall amount allocated to the commission to do its work, whether it was three or four years.  What it has found, certainly in terms of its work in 2017, is that there is more than enough money.  The Government agreed to extend the timeframe for an extra year, and in light of that agreement, the commission is scheduled to report in February 2019.  The commission still has sufficient money in respect of the overall allocation for its work.  We are spreading it out over a four-year period as distinct from the three-year period.  That is why there is a decrease in 2018.  This was agreed in formal engagement with the commission in terms of its work.</p> <p>  I will come back to the comment on Tuam.  On Deputy Rabbitte's question on whether the work will be completed by February of 2019, that is what I have agreed with the independent commission in respect of its third interim report and its request for that one-year extension.  As the Deputy is aware, the plan initially was to stagger the three reports - the history report, the investigative report and the confidential committee report of the evidence of witnesses who came before it - and that they would be sequential.  The commission made a decision some time ago, however, when it put out either its first or second interim report, that it needed to put out all of those reports at the same time to provide the best possible picture.  That continues to be the case.  My understanding, as I said, is that its intention is to report then.  That is all I can say right now because it is an independent commission.</p> <p>  In respect of the specific question, as the Deputy is aware, to complement its work and add to the transitional justice approach that the commission effectively is engaged in as well, a number of other things have been happening, particularly in regard to key stakeholders and survivors or people who were actually residents in the home.  One of these has been to facilitate a consultative process.  In terms of response to the second interim report, we are now moving towards a more representative facilitative process in which we have identified people to form a representative group to work with Mr. Gerry Kearney to take a look at the requests of the key stakeholders in terms of, for example, health and well-being supports and how to memorialise in relation to all of the mother and baby homes.  That that will begin relatively soon.  I have indicated as well to the people who are initiating this second consultative process that I would appreciate if they could report to me as soon as possible once they have gathered the group, taken a look at its suggestions and formed a consensus on the kinds of health and well-being supports that they would like and find useful.  I have asked that this would be recommended to me for the Government to have a look at it, and this may happen prior to the commission reporting to me in 2019.  It is important to say that.</p> <p>  I refer to what is going on in Tuam, which is narrower and distinct from the wider issues in respect of the mother and baby homes commission.  We are now marking a year since the discovery, and that is what the reports are reminding us of.  Since that discovery, we have put in place a process to try to respond appropriately to the terrible tragedy that was discovered and that we witnessed.  We are continuing to do what we said.  We are having a technical group look at the possible options for what can be done in respect of what happened in Tuam and to put that out to consultation.  We have passed that over to Galway County Council.  My understanding is that consultative process has various aspects to its methodology, one of which is to put out a questionnaire for people to respond to.  A second one, equally valid and important, is that the group would meet whoever wanted to meet it.  There was a gathering in Dublin and there will be a gathering in Galway relatively soon.  It is a facilitated process.  I asked that one or two of the members of the technical group be present for that so that there can be engagement.  When that is completed, recommendations will come to me in respect of all of the interested stakeholders who participated in the process.  We will bring that then to an interdepartmental group that my Secretary General, Mr. Fergal Lynch, has been chairing.  It will examine those recommendations, ultimately come to me and I will bring them to Government.  We are doing what we said we would do.  I am aware of how much time is passing and I really do appreciate the feelings as a result of that.  I hope it can continue at the pace that it is doing, that we will get those recommendations as soon as possible and decisions can be made.</p></speech>

I met a gentleman during the week who was part of the mother and baby homes.  He got the opportunity to attend counselling.  He called to thank me.  I do know what the Minister has said is starting to filter down.  People are appreciating that.  It was the first time he felt he was going to have the chance to speak to somebody - he is nearly 70 - and express what had happened to him, and that somebody somewhere was prepared to listen.</p><p>I know about the reports available today.

I want to comment on how those policy outputs map across the appropriations.  My first question relates to the affordable child care scheme.  We know there is significant staff turnover in child care facilities; some estimates put the figure at as high as 30%.  How do we address this high rate of turnover?  The overheads and administrative burdens in individual facilities are increasing.  Can anything be done about that?  Does the Minister have a perspective on how we can address the high rate of turnover, given the high level of qualifications within the sector?  Is there a mechanism to build in possible budgets for individual facilities to account for the increased overhead as a result of administrative costs?  Could the Minister allow for some provision to be made for continuous professional development?  It is a key factor in any career.  I understand some segments within the sector are asking for up to five days for some provision to be made for that.  I ask for a perspective from the Minister on where the policy is going in respect of all of these challenges.</p></speech>

We will go through them on an individual basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2018030700002#E00700"><p>Another issue is communications.  There has been some controversy - if I can use that term - about the SCU.  It was reported by Hugh O'Connell in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>that on July 9 the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, responded to a memo stating that the child care subsidy scheme being announced by the Government later in the summer should be a key campaign run by the SCU.  He is quoted as saying, &quot;Again, should be a thing the Govt is doing for you, not the Dept of Children &amp;amp;Youth ... I think there should be a campaign run on this throughout August.&quot;</p><p>I note the Minister has made some comments in the public domain about possible interaction with the Taoiseach on this.  I want to glean from the Minister who is in control of the Department's communications.  Is it now a function of the SCU?  Will it become a function of the SCU if it is not currently such a function or is the Minister in control of her budget line which, as I understand it, totals approximately &euro;113,000 if the FOI figure is to be believed?  I cannot see the specific figure in the Estimates.  Perhaps the Minister might assist us with that.  I would make the case that the Minister and her Department should be in control of the communications strategy<b>.  </b>If the interaction between the sector and all of its constituent parts is close to the Minister in terms of relationships I do not see the need for that to be elevated to the Department of the Taoiseach which is at another remove.  There is a political issue in terms of control and it is more of a political question for the Minister.  </p><p>I refer to the allocation for Tusla.  To be fair to the Minister, she has secured some &euro;754 million for Tusla, an increase of &euro;40 million.  In my mind I find it difficult to reconcile the increase in the budget for Tusla and the number of HIQA reports coming into the public domain across a wide range of issues.  I am trying to glean whether the HIQA reports are being acted upon on a regional basis and when we can expect success in respect of the recommendations in each of the HIQA reports.  </p><p>I tabled a parliamentary question seeking information on the number of social workers in the system.  The response I got was that there was an average of ten years duration in career length.  It is a tough job and I can understand that there is a high rate of attrition in the sector for all sorts of reasons.  Is there something in the Minister's vision which will speak to the budget lines before us and address the decline in numbers over a longer-term period?  Is the Minister liaising with other Departments to see how we can encourage more people to become social workers and social care workers?  They are key personnel and act as an interface between the challenges the sector faces and outputs.  </p></speech>

I refer to the recruitment of social workers.  The Minister spoke passionately about the recruitment and retention of staff.  I would appreciate if she could update the committee on the numbers who have been recruited and how we can retain current staff.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to bear with me because I will probably get this wrong.  Under the context and impact indicators for Tusla it is stated that the number of open cases with Tusla assessed as needing a social work service, which includes children in care, is nearly 26,000.  That figure is very high.  Could the Minister outline what sorts of services are required by those children?  Does she believe there are enough funds to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

In the budget for 2018, there were a couple of aspects of negotiations for the child care programme which I hoped would assist in ensuring increased resources for providers.  My ultimate hope is those resources could be shared with workers, although as the Deputy is aware I cannot make those decisions because I am not the employer.</p> <p>  The increase of &euro;20 million in the early years programme, in addition to the repurposing of moneys from 2017 to enable us to do some extra significant things for 2018, will, it is to be hoped, have an impact in terms of the moneys which ultimately get to the providers and workers.  This is by way of response to the question on turnover.  Some turnover is due to difficulties with pay and conditions.  For example, from September 2018 we will have two full years of the ECCE scheme which is why it was so important for me to increase the ECCE capitation from September 2018 because it will mean more money for providers.</p><p>We also continue to provide &euro;18 million to providers in recognition of the administrative burden in supporting various child care schemes.</p><p> The Deputy also asked that we would maintain our investment in ongoing continuing professional development.  I will be meeting the early years forum, which I established, later today to discuss staffing.  I have indicated that in my negotiations into 2019 I have an eye on quality which is a code word for the workforce and supporting it to provide that quality.  We have contracted an independent review of costs.  That work will be completed in plenty of time for me to have the information to negotiate for 2019.  We will see for the first time whether we are investing enough in costs and the examination of pay and conditions of the workforce.  We are substantially assisting services which have been in crisis, some of which has to do with staff.  We are also considering continuing professional development.  The learner funds have been going on for several years, and the S&iacute;olta and Aistear mentors in training are in place.</p></speech>

In addition we provided a certain sum of money per child registration per type of service in the interim measures introduced in September 2017 because we acknowledged there was additional work for the providers in signing children up to each of those services.</p> <p>  There were two questions about the child care campaign that we conducted in the summer, some of the Taoiseach's communications on that and the Department's communication of what we are doing.  It will not come as any surprise to the Deputy, because it was mentioned in the media, that I raised some serious concerns with the Taoiseach about what had happened with the strategic communications unit, SCU, and Project Ireland 2040, particularly focusing on the need for a Department to maintain editorial control of the use of taxpayers' money, the purchase of advertising or the content provided to the newspapers.  I welcomed the Taoiseach's response to those concerns, and we are now in the middle of a debate about what will happen as a result of the review by the Secretary General as well as the independent scrutiny by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, that is expected and by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland.  A lot of scrutiny will be going on, and then we will move to make some decisions.</p></speech>

I respect that the Taoiseach was willing to respond to those along with the other Independent Ministers, Deputies Naughten and Ross.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, in respect of the changes we were introducing last September to provide parents and their families and children with significant additional supports, it was very important for us to communicate and provide information on how these changes would happen for families and the providers.  The Department developed a campaign for that.  We did that during the summer and it was effectively a time in the early period of the strategic communications unit.  It had not been fully established and could not work with us to communicate the information.  I had exchanges with the Taoiseach on that, and I was very clear that we would be able to conduct the campaign ourselves.</p><p>It is very important that the departmental officials work with the communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach and provide their experience and expertise in the communication of our programmes.  We intend to do that through <i>government.ie</i>and with additional types of communication.  If there are any changes, the people with the experience and expertise will inform and be close to the ways of communicating what we need to do.</p></speech>

In 2018, Tusla expects to recruit an additional 45 social workers, 57 social care workers, nine nursing staff and 53 other health professionals, which include early years inspectors, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  That is a significant portion of the breakdown of the 422 extra whole-time equivalent employees it will recruit.  The grade breakdown for the remaining 145 is being finalised.  Family support workers are to be recruited.  The officials and I have been encouraging Tusla to complete its workforce strategy which it will do shortly for this year and for the next couple of years.  That will assist considerably in determining the mix of staff required to do the work of Tusla.  It is not to say that we do not need to continue to recruit the social workers.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we were engaging with other Departments to do that and the answer is yes, especially the Department of Education and Skills.  That is more medium to long-term.  There is continuing engagement between the officials, Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills to establish how many social workers we can turn out through higher education because we need more, not just for Tusla but for other agencies and organisations.  Therefore, it is important to work in the medium and long term to increase the number of social workers available to be recruited but also to be clear and creative about the mix of the overall workforce to respond appropriately to the number of services, referrals and cases, and family, early intervention and prevention work that Tusla does.</p><p>The other thing that is a key aspect that will be supportive for Tusla is the fact that there has been a major ICT roll-out - not just the national child care information system but the development of a strategy as well as the increase in something as simple as the number of laptops social workers and other workers will have so that they will be able to do their work more efficiently and get to the work they are intended to do as distinct from the time it might have taken in terms of administrative aspects so it would impact positively on staff productivity.  As Deputies are aware, Tusla established its own recruitment programme to deal with the significant issue of recruiting and the various types of professionals in addition to social workers.  There does not appear to have been significant issues recruiting most other grades with the exception of social workers.  It is important to acknowledge that Tusla has taken a proactive approach with regard to the other professionals it is looking for.  </p><p> In response to Deputy Mitchell's question about the open cases, 24,891 open cases were identified as needing a social work service at the end of 2017.  That goes back to a question from Deputy Rabbitte.  Of these, 19,999 had a named allocated social worker so, therefore, 4,892 were awaiting the allocation of a social worker, which represents 20% of the open cases.  I remind members that where a child needs an urgent response, they are dealt with urgently and immediately by the social workers.  The number of social workers at the end of 2017 was 1,466.  We hope that by the end of 2018, there will be an additional 45 so it needs to recruit 214 to achieve this because of those who will be leaving.  It is important to note that in addition to social workers, Tusla also utilises another agency for social workers in order to complete the work.  </p></speech>

How long a period are we looking at?  What is the timeframe?</p></speech>

I appreciate the Deputy's question about the HIQA reports.  Along with my officials, I have on occasion met with HIQA to listen to its general approach regarding working with Tusla.  As the Deputy is aware, HIQA reports include an action plan provided by Tusla to respond to the report.  This is accepted by HIQA.  Usually when those reports come out, Tusla's response is that certain standards have been met, others have not, action plans have been recommended and we are putting in place additional resources to ensure that these actions can be implemented if additional resources are required.  Certainly additional resources are being provided for the record keeping of the NCCIS, ten of whose regional centres are already piloting this new approach.  It has indicated that by June or mid-year, all of the regions will have that new information system working, which will impact significantly the sharing and recording of information and the ability to respond more quickly.  This is not in defence <i>per se </i>of Tusla but until that is in place, there will be some things that HIQA will continue to say to the agency that will be difficult to respond to as quickly compared what might happen once it is in place.  Once it is in place, we anticipate significant changes in that regard and that standards will be met.  Additional resources are being provided for family support and prevention services as well as the recruitment work about which we have spoken.  The Deputy asked a question about policy and practice.  Policy and practice are being improved through the roll-out of new practices called Signs of Safety, which will assist in the consistency and quality of the response.  I had the opportunity to work with some of the people in Tusla or at least participate in a conference where they looked at the approach they developed, training in terms of their workforce and Signs of Safety and the research that underpins to ensure that this was a model of best practice to continue the work they are doing.</p><p>Deputy Mitchell asked about the timeframe.  As I have already said, all urgent cases are seen immediately.  As the Deputy may be aware, cases are assessed in terms of priority - high, medium and low - particularly concerning the child's need for protection and support.  The length of time is three months, having made those points about any urgent cases being seen immediately and assessment in terms of a case's priority.  </p></speech>

With regard to the nine nursing staff, the Minister may be aware of Barnardos' "Lost" campaign, which is quite an impactful campaign.  One of its asks arising from that is that there would be a dedicated child and family public health system with guaranteed home visits.  I know that technically this is not the Minister's area but I ask for some engagement between the Department and the Department of Health on this issue.</p></speech>

If there was a facility whereby there were more home visits, it would have a very strong longitudinal effect because we know that sometimes home visits stop after a certain period of time once a child is born.  Starting off at home, Barnardos asks what can done to ensure all children have a good start and suggests introducing a dedicated child and family public nurse system with guaranteed home visits.  I did not give the Minister notice of my intention to ask this question but I would like to hear her perspective, whether she feels that this is something that is worth pursuing and whether she might engage with the Department of Health or the Minister for Health with a view to seeing whether work could be carried out between the two Departments on this issue.</p></speech>

Our public health nurses do extraordinary work that is so significant early on along with staying with children and families.</p><p>That is my first comment.  Second, we are already engaging with the Department of Health on this.  Third, in terms of the earlier strategies we are developing, we are also going to consider a dedicated child health workforce.</p></speech>

I will lead on this should anyone else wish to contribute.  Can the Minister give us information on subhead D.6, the Dormant Account Fund, where there is an increase of &euro;1 million?  Subhead D.7, EU receipts under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation have gone from zero to &euro;740,000.  What is that for?  Furthermore, has she had any discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, perhaps, or at EU level as to whether there might be issues relating to peace and reconciliation funding, which is in subhead B as well, as it applies to your Department and whether any impacts are expected in future annual accounts?  What impact might Brexit have on those subheads?</p></speech>

The PEACE IV programme is a cross-Border initiative funded by the EU, the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly and is managed by a special EU programme body.  That is a general response to the first part of the Chairman's question.  On the second part, virtually every time we have discussions in Cabinet regarding Brexit the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is very keen to emphasise that in our negotiations on Brexit the resources for the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation will be maintained.  To the extent that we are moving positively in the negotiation on all the elements, that is right up there in the negotiations.</p> <p>  On the Dormant Account Fund, the increase is attributable to new projects coming on stream, in particular crime intervention and peer support adoption.  There are others.  In addition, there is what we call the quality capacity building initiative or, effectively, the initiative we have been developing over the last year or two to mainstream lessons learned in the prevention and early intervention work and the investment of Atlantic Philanthropies over the last decade.  This is to ensure that those lessons become part of the system for ongoing training and mentoring on what we have learned for our current and future professional workforce, in terms of pulling together much of the data on the programmes that work into one place and one website.  That is one aspect of it.  We also are using the moneys for a youth employability initiative, the Big Brother Big Sister programme.  The increase in the Dormant Account Fund is responsible for a number of programmes.</p></speech>

I thank her for taking time out of her busy schedule to attend the meeting.  We always appreciate the valuable input that she makes to the committee and the time and consideration that she gives us.  We all have a job of work to do.  I have tremendous respect for committee members and they are working diligently on all aspects of our work.</p><p>One of the overriding issues, which is taking up a great deal of our time and hers, is Brexit.  Over the past number of months, officials and representatives of the political and social spheres and tourism and farming sectors have appeared before the committee.  It has been a fruitful, worthwhile exercise.  Members have engaged in an extremely workpersonlike manner with the witnesses and the witnesses have been co-operative and understanding of the requirements, aims and ambitions each of us has for the future of Europe.  Now more than ever, we have to look beyond Brexit to what will be the future of Europe for all our people and our exports and to our hopes and ambitions for future business and investment in the country.  I also welcome our guests in the Gallery.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call the Minister to State to make her opening statement, following which members may ask questions.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work the committee is doing, not just on Brexit and the future of Europe, but in engaging with so many different agencies, individuals and members of communities.</p><p>It has been said to me in the work that I am doing, and I see how much it is appreciated.  I have a lengthy address to deliver, but given the fact that I have not been here since November, there is some ground to cover.  The committee will forgive me, and may stop me if I am going on for too long. </p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation to the address today's meeting.  This is my third appearance before the committee as Minister of State, and I am pleased to say that there is much to report upon since my last appearance in November.</p><p> I will begin with the future of Europe debate which is now under way throughout Ireland.  I want to mention the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth which took place in Gothenburg in November.  I will give a read-out from the European Council in December before updating the committee on preparations for the European Council later this month on 22 and 23 March.  Finally, I would like to say a few words on Brexit.</p><p> When we met last it was just days before the launch of our citizens&rsquo; dialogue on the future of Europe.  Since then we have had a series of sessions, both public and private, within our institutions, colleges, universities and schools, and across the board.  We began with sessions of the citizens&rsquo; dialogue in Galway.  Two weeks ago we were in Cork.  My French colleague, Ms Nathalie Loiseau, joined me for a lively debate with over 300 staff and students in Maynooth University.  Tomorrow I will be in Letterkenny and next month we will be in County Meath and in Dublin for a special session with the non-governmental sector before the process culminates on Europe Day, 9 May.  A lot is happening, and the committee's participation and support in that is greatly appreciated. </p><p> The Government sees the citizens&rsquo; dialogue as a listening exercise.  We want to reach out to our own citizens to hear their needs and concerns without being prescriptive.  Participants at each session are encouraged to have their say on how the European Union can help us become more competitive, more prosperous, safer and more secure.  We want to hear from our citizens on how they envisage a more sustainable Union that is also more socially responsible.  Finally, we are keen to get their views on globalisation.  In other words, how can we shape it before it shapes us?</p><p> I have to say that I am very impressed by the level of participation at each session.  There is real engagement on the issues and if there is an overriding message, it is one based on fairness.  People want to ensure fairness in an increasingly competitive world.  They want the environment to be protected so they can hand it on to future generations in good shape.  There is also a demand for inter-generational fairness.  People want the young to enjoy the best of opportunities when they are starting their careers and their families and they want older people to be able to enjoy their retirement in dignity and comfort.  This is coming across already even though we have only had two of these engagements.</p><p> Of course the committee conducted its own future of Europe public outreach initiative last year and heard a good cross-section of public opinion.  I look forward to reading the committee's report in due course and I am confident that, together with a synthesis from our citizens&rsquo; dialogue process, Ireland will have a rich contribution to make to the wider European debate.  That debate is already under way.</p><p> I was very pleased that the first session under President Tusk&rsquo;s leaders&rsquo; agenda focussed on education and culture.  We owe it to future generations to equip them with the life skills they will need to cope with a quickly changing world.  The first discussions in November have already been translated into firm instructions from Heads of State and Government for work to get under way.  Examples include instructions to extend the Erasmus+ programme to other forms of mobility, to set up a network of European universities and to promote more co-operation in the recognition of third level and school-leaving qualifications.  Education is coming up time and time again in various different questions within the future of Europe dialogue.</p><p> Under the leaders&rsquo; agenda there have also been discussions on sensitive issues such as migration, the completion of economic and monetary union, institutional issues and the next multi-annual financial framework.  Each discussion involves an initial political discussion and it is envisaged that the leaders will have to return to almost all of these issues in the coming months.  However, each session has already proven useful in giving a direction to follow-up work which is being undertaken in the meantime.  The next leaders&rsquo; agenda discussion will take place later this month and it will look at taxation, in particular in the digital economy. </p><p> I will now address the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth, which took place in Gothenburg in November.  It would be remiss of me not to mention this summit.  As the Taoiseach told the European Parliament in January, we need to &ldquo;put fire back into the engine of our social Europe.&rdquo;  The summit recalled the need to put people first.  As a consequence it was agreed at the European Council in December that there would be a new start for social dialogue.  The European Council also agreed to tackle the gender pay gap and to deliver on the European skills agenda.  As I said just a moment ago, this work will be crucial if future generations are to be equipped to cope with the changes digitisation and automation will bring.</p><p> The European Council in December also welcomed the establishment of Permanent Structured Co-Operation, known as PESCO.  The EU relies on civilian and military assets provided by the member states to undertake international peace support missions to prevent and resolve conflict in support of the United Nations.  PESCO provides a mechanism to meet and to identify need for closer cooperation between partners, to ensure the availability of the military capabilities required for these purposes.  Our participation will help ensure that Irish Defence Forces personnel serving on future EU missions will be as well-prepared and well-equipped as they should be.  Membership of PESCO is voluntary and does not change in any way the triple lock that remains in place before we deploy any troops abroad.  PESCO was established within the framework of the Lisbon Treaty which was approved by the people of Ireland in a referendum in 2009.  Ireland joined the PESCO framework with the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> I will now address the rule of law.  In December, the European Commission launched a procedure under Article 7(1) of the Treaty on European Union inviting the Council to determine whether there is a clear risk of a serious breach by the Republic of Poland of the values referred to in Article 2 of the same treaty.  The Union is founded on its values, including the rule of law.  The move by the Commission follows legislation passed in Poland making changes to the country&rsquo;s constitutional tribunal, the judiciary, the media and the civil service.  These changes have raised serious concerns about the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers there.  The Commission has invited the Polish authorities to address these issues within three months.  I am pleased to say that the Polish Government has begun to engage with the Commission.  We want to see results from that engagement as soon as possible. </p><p> I am pleased to report that there has been engagement in the meantime with the Commission by the Polish Government and that the Polish Government has said it will publish a white paper by 20 March, the date on which the three-month period expires.  There was a lengthy exchange of views on the issue at the General Affairs Council in February.  During this exchange, I reiterated the importance Ireland attaches to respect for the rule of law and the values enshrined in the treaties and I emphasised the need for the current engagement to yield results.</p><p> Preparations are now under way for the European Council later this month.  As the committee members will know, the spring European Council normally addresses the jobs, growth and competitiveness agenda.  The European Council will take place at a time when the European economy is growing at a faster pace than any time in the last decade.  The European Commission published its country reports today as part of the European semester process and for the first time they incorporate the principles of the new European pillar of social rights.  This report has heretofore been solely focused on economic matters.  As a follow-up, the European Council will be asked to endorse the euro area recommendation which, as its name suggests, sets out economic policies for the euro area.</p><p> At the European Council in December the focus was on completing the banking union.  At this European Council, Heads of State and Government will look at progress to date in the creation of a capital markets union, which Ireland also supports.  We particularly welcome progress on measures that advance product markets which can help diversify funding to smaller, dynamic companies. </p><p> I should also mention that the European Council will benefit from the Trojan work undertaken last year by the Estonian presidency in advancing the digital agenda.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the digital Single Market, DSM, and, although there is still work to be done, we are on target to complete the DSM by the end of this year.  A DSM 2 package is expected later this year, but it is important that we keep advancing the legislative proposals already on the table.   </p><p> The European Council is expected to review the energy union where a lot of progress has been made on the &ldquo;Clean Energy for All Europeans&rdquo; package.  As a peripheral, less-well-connected country, Ireland believes that the energy union has the potential to greatly enable Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon future, just as the Single Market led to an economic transition for us and other member states.</p><p> The European Council will adopt procedural conclusions on the European Commission's strategy for a credible enlargement perspective for, and enhanced EU engagement with, the western Balkans.  An ambition of the Bulgarian Presidency is to achieve a clear action plan for each of the countries of the western Balkans, without creating unrealistic expectations.</p><p>Ireland shares this objective and wants to work with the Bulgarian Presidency to make the EU-Balkans summit in Sofia in May a success.  The Taoiseach and I discussed the summit with Prime Minister Borisov in Sofia in January and last month I visited Belgrade, Sarajevo and Montenegro for consultations with the respective governments there.  While there is much work to be done, we recognise the importance that prosperity and stability of the region holds for the European Union as a whole and firmly believe that the prospect of accession should be on offer to each applicant country that makes the necessary reforms to adopt the <i>acquis</i>.<br/><br/>The European Council is expected to frame the preparations for the western Balkans summit.  Three deliverables from the summit in May are envisaged and they are: a reaffirmation of the European perspective of the region; launching concrete and visible initiatives to improve the physical and human connectivity within the region and with the EU; and addressing how to better engage together in shared security challenges.<br/><br/>Since we last met, the leaders of the EU 27 decided on 15 December that sufficient progress had been made in phase 1 of the Article 50 negotiations.  We were very happy that we achieved the goals that we set out to achieve in phase 1.  We secured concrete commitments on the maintenance of the common travel area and on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement, in all its parts, and the gains of the peace process, including guarantees on avoiding a hard border and commitments on how this will be achieved.  This was a very significant step and we are extremely grateful to our EU partners for the solidarity they have shown throughout the negotiations.<br/><br/>The move to start discussions on the framework for a future relationship between the EU and the UK is hugely significant for Ireland in light of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK.  We have been consistent in our position that it is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests that there is the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade.  The optimal outcome would be for the UK to remain in the Single Market and the customs union.  However,, as the Prime Minister, Theresa May, confirmed in her speech last week, the UK&rsquo;s current position is that it wishes to leave both.  We look, therefore, towards an ambitious and wide-ranging economic partnership between the EU and the UK that includes a free trade agreement which would eliminate tariffs and minimise non-tariff barriers while ensuring a level playing field for our businesses.  There must be a continued advantage to Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Single Market.<br/><br/>We are working closely with the Commission task force and our EU partners as we prepare for the European Council, at which we expect further guidelines to be agreed in order to enable detailed discussions to begin on the EU's future relationship with the UK, later this month.  We hope that progress on agreeing transitional arrangements can also be made in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>Importantly, the European Council has been clear that progress in phase 2 of the negotiations, which includes the future relationship issues and transitional arrangements, depends on progress being made on translating the commitments made by the UK in phase 1 into legal text through the drafting of the withdrawal agreement.  In this regard, we welcome the Commission&rsquo;s draft withdrawal agreement, including a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which translates that commitments made by the UK in phase 1 into legally binding text.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland necessarily sets out the backstop option for avoiding a hard border and protecting North-South co-operation.  However, we have been clear that our preferred option is to solve these issues through the wider EU-UK future relationship agreement and we stand ready to consider proposals from the UK.<br/><br/>We have now entered a critical juncture in the Article 50 negotiations process as we get closer to the European Council meeting, which will take place in two weeks' time, on 22 and 23 March.  I assure the committee that, although this is far from a win-win situation, the Government is working hard, making the case that a strong and well-functioning Single Market is essential to economic growth and job creation and to Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic development.  Any free trade agreement with the UK must ensure that the integrity of the Single Market is protected.  We will be firm in arguing that any agreement must protect key sectors of the Irish economy, particularly in light of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.<br/><br/>I know we can count on the support of the committee members in our approach.  I thank them for their attention and I will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

We appreciate the time she has put into it.  I invite Senator Craughwell to lead off.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018030700002#C00300"><p>I thank and welcome the Minister of State.  I also thank her officials for the work they have been doing across Europe.  I have attended a number of COSAC and EU presidential meetings and every delegation I met spoke about the Irish border and the Irish problem regarding Brexit.  That can only be down to the work of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State and their officials.  People may not fully appreciate the level of effort that has been put in right across Europe to getting this unique Irish problem recognised and encouraging a cohesive response on the part of the 27 member states.  The Minister of State is to be congratulated for that.</p> <p>  I have already said privately and I am now going to say publicly that I am always most impressed when I see the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach.  They are always at one.  It is the type of cohesiveness we need.  I am really proud of the work that has been done across the issue.</p> <p>  Brexit is now the secondary problem in Europe.  The key problem is migration and the difficulties it is causing right across Europe.  The results in recent elections show the impact it has had.  It impacted on the UK referendum.  We have to get away from the one-size-fits-all approach.  If one happens to be on the Mediterranean, one is a refugee.  We must start clearly identifying economic migrants and refugees.  No country in the European Union would reject genuine refugees.  Economic migration is different and those who find themselves in certain parts of eastern Europe - or in Ireland - do not want to be there, they want to be in countries with larger economies such as Great Britain, Germany and France.  In order to save the European project, we have to start dealing with this quickly.</p> <p>  The Erasmus+ project has always interested me as an educator and as a person who came to education late in life.  We have concentrated quite a lot of those whom I would deem as members of the privileged class who made it to university.  I would love to see something similar in the apprenticeship area to drive apprentice-sharing across Europe.  There will be a logistics conference in Dublin on 22 March.  This will deal with logistics, driver training for the use of heavy good vehicles, etc.  There is no Irish representation in that particular group but a former colleague of mine, an assistant general secretary in the TUI, actually attracted that conference.  I hope we will see some co-operation on apprenticeships.</p> <p>  The Minister of State addressed social dialogue and the gender pay gap, which is a disgrace.  We have been talking about this since Adam was a boy and we still have not started to treat females in the same way that we treat males.  It is absolutely outrageous.  This morning, I spoke in the Seanad and tomorrow we celebrate 100 years of female suffrage.  Look around the D&aacute;il and Seanad and see how many women there are.</p></speech>

During my period as the president of my union before I came to the Seanad, I recall women having to resign because we could not have family-friendly meetings.  I would like to see some serious action in the context of social dialogue.  What the Department is doing with the meetings throughout the country on the future of Europe is a good start.  We need to build on that.</p> <p>  Permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, is being misrepresented in every corner of Ireland.  I am committed to Ireland's non-military alignment.  Ireland is not a neutral country.  It never was neutral.  Nowhere in the Constitution will one find a reference to neutrality.  We are militarily non-aligned and there is a vast difference between the two.  We need to get the message out there.  Government needs to get the message out there that PESCO will allow us to start seriously challenge threats to cybersecurity and the movement of what I call "soft terrorism" across Europe.</p><p>We need greater engagement on security.  I would prefer if people, when speaking about PESCO, discussed security rather than defence.  Defence in Ireland tends to conjure up the notion of uniforms, boots, guns and soldiers.  Security, on the other hand, relates more to policing our country.  With PESCO, we can tap into resources a little open economy could not possibly expect to manage otherwise.</p><p> Recently, at the Brexit conference in Killarney, the issue of the transitional period was addressed by lawyers from the UK and Ireland.  These people are distinguished legal brains.  It was their view that the transitional period could not be less than five years and was more likely to be closer to ten.  Deputy Donnelly will probably have more to say about that than me.  He may agree that they were saying ten years made more sense for a transitional period.  That we can turn off the lights on the European Union in March next year and move to the next stage is something they do not envisage.</p></speech>

She has done herself and the country proud.  I compliment her colleagues - the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers - who have engaged in the debate on Brexit.  They have done extremely well.  On that basis, I note that we are coming to a critical stage in the negotiations and should be careful not to go to the end product.  We will take each stage as it comes and maintain our position.  We will proceed in the clear knowledge that our colleagues in the UK decided of their own volition to leave the European Union.  They did not negotiate with anyone as to what the consequences might be in the event that things went wrong.  There will be consequences.  For example, if a particular arrangement were to emerge whereby the UK was to have the same benefits outside the EU, the Union would be put at risk and it would be only a short time before other countries wanted to do the same.  Against that backdrop, we need to continue to be consistent as consistency is important in the negotiations.</p> <p>  The various negotiators have not put a foot wrong, from an Irish perspective, in the context of the island economy, North and South.  The Good Friday Agreement has been dealt with extremely well and sensitively and that commitment remains.  If the UK leaves the European Union, as it has indicated it will do, it will make an application to return within five years.  I cannot see any other option.  The logic of where the whole debate is heading is that the intention was to leave at all costs and regardless of the consequences.  There will be consequences and they will not be beneficial to the European Union, to Britain, to Ireland or anywhere else.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the stance taken by the Irish negotiators and long may it continue.</p> <p>  The engagement on the future of Europe is a very worthwhile exercise.  The Minister of State attended Maynooth University and various other locations nationally on this.  This engagement is about taking ownership of the European project and, as such, it is hugely important.  Instead of remaining aloof from the European Union and saying what it is doing wrong, this is part and parcel of communities within member states taking ownership.</p> <p>  As to immigration, Irish people were economic migrants for many years and we should never turn a blind eye to the fact that we were in this situation ourselves.  There is a humanitarian issue and an economic one.  There are options of course.  We can all decide to rely on investment from south-east Asia, Australia, Canada and other places and send our youth there for jobs in the future or we can encourage investment job creation within this country and the European Union which will, naturally, bring with it people who are pursuing those jobs.  We have the option of either going abroad to get our employment or having the jobs here and encouraging people who want to work in various industries to come on board.</p> <p>  On low carbon, it is getting to the point where we need to be able to say to the European Union, environmentalists and ourselves that we can take certain steps which will have a substantial and positive impact on emissions.  If we do not do that, it will go on for ever and there will be talk of culling the beef herd and the other nonsense that goes on.  There are realistic things we can do, including the electrification of cars and reducing reliance on them.  Emission reductions will be achieved in that way without damaging our economy.  Let us do the things we can do without too much economic destruction first and after that we can look at the next important issue.</p></speech>

I also welcome the ambassadors and staff from embassies in Ireland who attend regularly.  I commend the Chairman on his work meeting ambassadors on a regular basis.  He has taken a particular interest in meeting all of the ambassadors, especially those from the European countries but also those from beyond the Union.</p> <p>  The Erasmus+ programme was raised earlier.  I agree with Senator Craughwell that there is a need to extend it for practical skills and apprenticeships.  There is no reason not to do so.  Certainly, I owe a personal debt of gratitude to Erasmus.  While I was not on it myself, family members have taken part.  It has been one of the best practical policies of the European Union.  After the UK leaves in March 2019, I understand it intends to remain within the Erasmus programme and to contribute to it.  I hope that is the case.</p> <p>  As to PESCO, it is clear the triple lock remains, which is very important, before we can deploy troops abroad.  We are in the United Nations also and people should be happy with that.  Ireland is a neutral country.  I do not agree with Senator Craughwell in that regard.  Neutrality has served us extremely well in the past and many families would not be here today only for our stand.  &Eacute;amon de Valera, his Government and the united parties at that time took a very brave and correct decision.  We should remember that.</p> <p>  I commend what is happening in the negotiations.  We have faith in Mr. Barnier and his team.  As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said, we cannot enter into bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom regardless of whether it likes that stance.  It is not in our interests to do so.  We are negotiating as part of the 27.  This committee has had regular meetings with our counterparts in the United Kingdom and we are going there at the end of March also.  It is a very useful exercise to maintain strong dialogue with our United Kingdom colleagues.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly was deferred last weekend due to weather conditions.</p> <p>  I wish the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Taoiseach and the Government well in the continuing negotiations.  In the circumstances, we are all united in this regard and speak with one voice through the Government as to where we stand in this country as far as Brexit is concerned.</p></speech>

My singular focus in the Oireachtas is on people with disabilities.  In Europe, there are 80 million people with disabilities.  The EU, in a very novel act as a non-state party, signed and ratified the UN convention in 2010 or thereabouts.  Within its own competencies, it is signed up to delivering on the convention.</p><p>I hope and trust that later today the D&aacute;il will be supporting the Government in ratifying the convention.  We are the last country in Europe to ratify it and I am very confident that we can stride ahead quite strongly at this stage.</p><p> In terms of the future of Europe, it is important to remember that the European Union grew out of the awfulness of the Second World War, beginning with the European Coal and Steel Community and so forth.  The same is true of the United Nations.  The EU and the UN are two of the good things that came out of that awfulness.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 promised human rights to everybody on the basis that they are human beings.  Almost 60 years later, the UN had to announce the need for a convention to make this happen for people with disabilities.  That says to us that we did not really get it under our skin that people with disabilities were equally to be honoured in their humanity as other people have been.  I know from my work in different states and my involvement with the European Disability Forum, the European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities and others that there are legacy issues across Europe.  We cannot take it for granted that people with disabilities are going to be properly and well dealt in to the future of Europe and every state within it.  Therefore, we have to take very specific measures both at home and across the EU.  Poverty, exclusion and loss of hope are the three hallmarks of disability in Europe and elsewhere, regardless of whether one is talking about a well-off or a very poor state.  There may be variations in that but these still persist.  The multi-annual funding framework, the EU semester and the future of Europe debate are key instruments but how can we make sure that they are used to assist and focus on people with disabilities and their families?  </p><p> I am concerned about a range of issues relating to Brexit.  As things move on, I am seeking reassurance and verifiable evidence that people with disabilities and their interests are being addressed regarding issues of serious concern such as cross-border movement, changes in regulations for items such as assistive technologies, pharmaceuticals and other medical products, service level agreements across borders, the loss of economies of scale in research into and treatment of rare diseases and so on.  These concerns must be attended to within the context of the bigger project.  On the issue of social cohesion and security, there is an old fashioned way of thinking about security and threats, namely, that they come from outside one's territory.  It is a spatial notion, that one could be invaded in some way.  However, we have enough evidence now that some threats come from how we treat people in our own states.  Often the revolution starts internally.  In terms of social cohesion, overtly dealing with people with disabilities and people from different socio-economic backgrounds can help to give a good foundation to a society and make it one that people will want to defend and promote.  We must see security as something we can control by having good public interest programmes and the inclusion of people.  We must ensure that people are not left on the edges and marginalised and this applies beyond people with disabilities.  </p><p> I thank the Minister of State for attending today.</p></speech>

The President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, made an important speech today in Luxembourg outlining the EU draft guidelines for negotiations on post-Brexit ties.  Is the Minister of State in a position to update us on that and on Ireland's view of the EU's view as outlined by Mr. Tusk?  There is cause for concern generally.  Mr. Tusk spoke about negative economic consequences in respect of trade and also made reference to the fact that if the UK leaves the customs union and the Single Market, there will be friction in the context of trade.  It is becoming clear that Ireland will have to rely on the backstop option which has been put forward if we are to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's views in that regard.</p> <p>  I have a question on PESCO but I appreciate that the Minister of State may not be in a position to answer it now.  I understand that the Minister of State at the Department of Defence was in Brussels yesterday where he talked about signing up to two of the projects on the menu, as it were, in respect of PESCO.  Does the Minister of State have any further information on that?  If not, perhaps she would be able to forward an update on it to us.  This is something about which the D&aacute;il should be kept informed.  </p> <p>  We had the Irish MEPs in here recently and they are very concerned about the multi-annual financial framework and the deficit in the EU budget post 2020, with the UK leaving the EU.  Would it be fair to say that our position on the budget is that we are in favour of retaining CAP and the Cohesion funding, are against a common consolidated corporate tax base and are willing to increase our contribution to the Union?  Having listened to the Taoiseach, I believe that is a fair summary of our position but perhaps the Minister of State could confirm that.   </p> <p>  In terms of institutional issues, the Irish MEPs, for obvious reasons, were very interested in the position of MEPs post-Brexit and, in particular, in the elections for the European Parliament in 2019.  I understand that there is a proposal to redistribute 27 of the 73 European Parliament seats left over following the departure of the UK and that Ireland may get two of those seats.  I would welcome any update on that issue from the Minister of State.  I note that a suggestion has been made regarding transnational lists for European Parliament elections.  I think that has been ruled out in respect of the elections in 2019 but that is something about which we should be concerned.  Transnational lists would remove MEPs from the people and would mean that MEPs would become more elitist.  That is an issue of which we should be very conscious.</p></speech>

She covered seven issues in her address and within that there are probably around 1 million sub-issues.  In that context, I will focus on just one pressing matter but before doing so, I wish to commend the efforts the Department has been making in terms of the debate on the future of Europe.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in Donegal tomorrow night and urge her to drive safely.</p> <p>  I will focus on Brexit and a number of key questions and issues that have arisen in the last fortnight.  In terms of the negotiation guidelines that will come out of the European Council meeting later this month, as Deputy Haughey outlined, Mr. Tusk has referred to the first stage of the free trade area negotiations.  The initial guidelines run to six pages but the final text of CETA runs to 1,598 pages.  When does the Minister of State think we might see a little bit more meat on the bones?  Do we have a concrete timetable for the trade negotiations? </p> <p>  In terms of the most recent suggestions regarding a customs border, avoiding a border on the island of Ireland but also within the United Kingdom as a whole is a joint priority of both the UK and the EU.</p><p>We should consider the legal manifestation of the political agreement reached in December, the option C backstop, which I absolutely do not believe will ever be needed.  I never want to see it being used.  In this regard, I would be much more optimistic than Deputy Haughey.  However, the draft text to be agreed at the European Council meeting was very much the representation of the European side.  I refer to the European interpretation as it related to paragraph 49 of the political agreement.  Do we, or will we, expect a British alternative as it relates to paragraph 50, maintaining there is no border within the United Kingdom as a whole?  If so, when do we expect that?  We expect a lot from the British side but we have not got much from it so far.  This frustration is shared across this State and in the remaining member states.  Do we expect a timeline for real suggestions for option B, the supposed imaginative solutions?  I do not believe there are any.</p><p> The suggestion by Prime Minister May that the US&ndash;Canada border might be a solution is downright laughable.  I visited that border on a number of occasions, and the Taoiseach visited it in August, and I noted it is absolutely not an acceptable proposal.  We need to be very firm with the British side that we will take its suggestions very seriously, but that those suggestions, in turn, must be serious in themselves.  That response has to come from the European side.  A number of people, particularly on the British side, have suggested it is time that Dublin started to negotiate directly, be it with Belfast or London.  That would be the most detrimental approach the Irish Government could take.  Our strength is our solidarity.  We are remaining within the European Union and the European family.  That is probably one of the wisest decisions we will make.  We must continue to negotiate as Europe.  A direct London&ndash;Dublin negotiation is not in our interest.  Our best option is option A, a deep and meaningful customs and trading relationship.  That can be achieved only on an EU&ndash;UK basis.</p></speech>

As my colleagues have said, she is doing an excellent job in what she is trying to achieve for Ireland in the current difficult discussions.  Depending on the week, we either feel we have something positive to work with regarding how Ireland will fare with the fast-approaching Brexit or we note that a different view seems to be presented regarding the island of Ireland and its trade with and through the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  I want to focus on one area, namely, trade in the SME sector.  No matter what area one talks about in that sector, there are serious concerns, whether a business is in a Border county, entrenched in the South or in the North.  I refer to trade directly with the United Kingdom and our exports via the United Kingdom.  Brexit is fast approaching and looks like it will happen although many people in the United Kingdom, Ireland and many other countries hoped it would be reconsidered and put to the people again in a referendum, this time with them having true knowledge rather than being misled.  It appears that, in some cases, people were definitely given information that has not turned out to be factual.  What solid discussions are being had to deal with trade?  A significant volume of our trade to the United Kingdom relates to the food business.  There are many food companies in the constituency I represent, and many of them export to the United Kingdom.  They are already affected because the current Brexit circumstances are affecting the currency.  The cost cannot be passed on to the customers.  The businesses are already being impacted negatively.  They cannot go back to the customer to get an increase to cover the currency change that has occurred as a result of the current circumstances.  The businesses are worried what will happen when Brexit arrangements are confirmed and put in place.  They are also worried about exports that go through the United Kingdom.  What discussions have been had on this with our European colleagues and the United Kingdom?  How can certainty and consistency be achieved so there will not be a negative impact on our export business, including in the agriculture and food sectors, on which we rely so much? </p> <p>  Is there an avenue for additional funding to support the various Departments in seeking trade and other business in other European countries to compensate in the event of a loss of business with the United Kingdom as a result of Brexit?  We do not want a loss of business; we want more business.  If there were additional resources made available to find additional markets in Europe and if business between Ireland and the United Kingdom were sustained, it would only be positive from a trade perspective.  Compensatory business options must be considered, however, in the event of Brexit having a negative impact, which it could well have.</p> <p>  As colleagues have said, there is serious concern over trade and business.  We are so dependent on the export trade.  I include our food business in this regard.  The matter is serious.  While there is a lot of talk, there is no real focus on solutions and outcomes.  What is the Minister of State's position on that?</p></speech>

We are glad she is here with us today because everything she is dealing with is very important, nothing more so than the whole question of Brexit.  We salute the Minister of State on everything she achieved in phase one in December but now we are in the crucial phase, as my colleagues have just said.  We have so much trade with Britain and through Britain to the Continent that it is vital.  We know the United Kingdom is not going to remain in the Single Market or customs union but we have to have the closest possible relationship, as the Minister of State appreciates, and there has to be a customs union, in effect.  Whatever it is to be called, be it an economic customs union, a partnership or otherwise, it will be vital to the European Union as much as the United Kingdom.  I am sure the United Kingdom does not want to abandon the 500 million people in the European Union, so whatever has to happen must happen.</p> <p>  Anything is possible with politicians in negotiations.  There will be a lot of bluster but we must not pay attention to that.  It is a matter of what will happen behind closed doors in working out a solution.  That is vital.  I am sure the Minister of State appreciates fully that this is what we have to achieve.  It is important for them but it is vital for us.  I do not want to add any more at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018030700002#F00400"><p>I have just three questions I would like to ask on Brexit.  The first concerns the transition period.  The proposal seems to be that there will be a 21-month period, which is a lot less than we had been hoping for.  I understand the Government's position, and certainly that of Fianna F&aacute;il, was that there should be a five-year transition period.  Did the Government, through the Minister of State, Minister, Taoiseach or officials, formally request a five-year period?  If so, what were the reasons for having a period that is considerably shorter, amounting to less than two years?</p> <p>  My second question is on the Border.  The Minister of State said Ireland has achieved guarantees on avoiding a hard border.  My fear is that this might be overstating the case.  The United Kingdom has reasserted its commitment to no hard border.  There is cross-party unity in the Republic regarding the view that there must be no hard border, and no border of any kind with Northern Ireland, yet we see what I believe is a concerted move from British politicians to begin to normalise border controls.  They are talking about the US&ndash;Canada border in what I believe is a disgraceful normalisation of that type of border.  The UK Foreign Secretary has talked about some checks.  A leaked letter from him to the Prime Minister refers to 5% border checks.  Many believe it was leaked by him or his officials.  I have debated with Brexiteer MPs who have recently started talking about the US border.</p><p>I have debated with Brexiteer MPs who have started talking recently about the United States border.  I believe that is a concerted move.  I do not believe the British Government is as committed to not having Border controls as we are in the Republic.  I believe some Brexiteers, including some very influential Brexiteers, would sacrifice Border controls around the Six Counties for the type of free market liberal freedom they seem to want.  Unfortunately, stating that we have a guarantee that there will not be a hard border is probably overstating it.  I very much hope I am wrong on that.</p><p> Will the Irish Government be insisting that the backstop, that is, full, ongoing, legally implemented alignment economically across the entire economy North-South, will be the default legal position come the last day of the transition period?  Obviously, we would love the United Kingdom to stay in the customs union and the Single Market, which is option A in the December agreement.  They said they are not doing that.  We are open to them coming forward with a new suite of technologies that no one in the world has ever implemented or invented yet to solve the problem technologically but they have not come forward with that.</p><p> Having agreed to this backstop, the Prime Minister stated recently that it threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK.  There is expert legal opinion to the effect that it does not and that it should be possible, but will it be the Irish Government's firm position that on the first day after the transition period, if options A and B are not in place, which are technological solutions or ongoing UK alignment to the European Union, there will be legal mechanisms in place and active on the ground that essentially will fully align Northern Ireland to the EU in terms of customs, regulation and standards across the entire economy?</p><p> In terms of our own preparations, President Tusk's comments should be very worrying for Ireland.  He referenced a free trade agreement, and specifically Canada.  He made it very clear that there would be Border checks and that there would not be a frictionless Border.  For our companies that means higher costs, reduced competitiveness and the Government's recent report from Copenhagen Economics referencing the threats to many thousands of jobs across the country.</p><p> With regard to relaxations to state aid and EU funding for adaptation, in terms of our businesses in agriculture, textiles and manufacturing across the board, we have to figure out how to get higher market penetration into the EU 26 and beyond.  Has the Government formally requested that state aid and new EU adaptation funding, or other supports for Irish business in response to Brexit, be added to the agenda?  Have they appeared on any of the agendas for meetings the Minister of State has attended at the European Council or any of the other relevant EU committees or are they due to appear on the agenda and be discussed in the coming weeks or months?</p></speech>

I ask her to compile her responses to the questions in the best way possible.  We would appreciate her help in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018030700002#G00300"><p>Absolutely, and to avoid any crossover I will just acknowledge the Deputy or Senator who may have asked the question a second time.</p><p>I thank everybody for their comments and questions.  Senator Craughwell spoke about migration.  Our prerogative in that regard is being committed to addressing the root causes and in all of the work we are doing that has been our sole focus.  We have committed to doubling the Africa Fund in the coming years.  We are investing more funding and support in Syria than any other project and focusing our dialogue with other larger member states on trying to reach a solution when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people currently moving throughout central Europe.  The biggest debate currently is on the number of people but also the amount of funding individual countries are willing to contribute to these various sources, but that is something that has not been finalised yet.  It is a debate that is ongoing.</p><p>We have seen a change in the political dynamic throughout Europe in recent years and this is possibly feeding into that.  It is an issue we need to address and one that has been on the agenda, certainly since I became Minister of State, but we are committed as much as we can be to taking in as many citizens as possible, supporting them financially however we can do that and, importantly, using our own set of skills to try to focus on the peace process missions for which we are renowned and recognised and contribute where we can to addressing the root cause in these areas.</p><p>With regard to the Erasmus+ programme, that has already been agreed to.  Ireland has probably used Erasmus more than most European countries and we see the benefit of it.  We see it now in primary schools, which are engaging with schools in other European countries.  Students are spending a certain amount of time in other countries also.  That is starting from a much younger age.  Outside of the school scenario we have apprenticeships now, and other social communities and organisations are now becoming part of it.  It is becoming much more widespread and it is very much a priority on Ireland's agenda but also that of other European countries.</p><p>With regard to the gender pay gap, that is an issue that was tackled by the Treaty of Rome.  It was raised again under the Amsterdam treaty, which set out obligations for the EU and individual member states to set out plans.  Our Department of Justice and Equality has its own section specifically dealing with equality and gender equality.  While I believe we have made significant progress in many areas, and not just in gender pay, I am conscious of a piece in a newspaper last week which showed that there is a further 3% gap.  That is something we have to acknowledge and try to tackle.</p><p>With regard to Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, the two missions we are talking about are concerned with maritime surveillance but specifically training missions.  There are discussions on a third one specifically focusing on cybersecurity and cyberthreats but the main two we have signed up to involve maritime surveillance and training missions.</p><p>On the transitional period, which was raised by other members and to which I might return later and deal with in more detail, Deputy Durkan raised the requirement not to go to the end product.  He is right in saying that.  We need to focus on the particular issues we are dealing with now.  It was important to agree the backstop position before Christmas.  However, that must always be the last case scenario.  We need to focus on options A and B and ensuring that we get the best possible outcome.</p><p>On the issue of immigration again, I agree with Deputy Durkan that 70 million people throughout the world claim Irish heritage.  As a country our citizens have travelled abroad but to go back to my initial comments, it is important that we invest in examining the root causes of immigration and support people at home to deal with their own economic, health and other issues affecting them.</p><p>Regarding climate, there are various areas on which we are focused.  New investment and innovation is important, particularly when we talk about renewable energy.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment<b></b>is developing a new plan on renewable energy, particularly focusing on wind, solar, offshore, onshore and other renewable energy sources.</p><p>Senator Leyden spoke about the Erasmus+ programme.  The programme is being extended and is very much supported.</p><p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of disabilities and stated that 80 million people in Europe have a disability.  I very much welcome the fact that the D&aacute;il will ratify the EU convention.  That is an issue I worked on when I was in the Department of Health because it crosses the areas of mental health, disabilities and justice.  There was a huge amount of work to do on it but I very much welcome that this is happening today.  There is a renewed focus on the social element that may not have been the case previously.</p><p>The social summit in Gothenburg was the start of that.  The new semester report, which has been published today, will include a social element for the first time.  In particular around the future of Europe debate, we are keen to ensure that the debate focuses on inclusion, dignity and a fairer society.  We will co-host a specific event with The Wheel organisation, which represents over 1,000 community organisations and many of which represent people across the board, including people with disabilities, young people and those who feel they have not been represented as well as possible.  We have a new Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsible for disability issues, which is an extremely important role and the budget has been increased.  </p><p> In terms of Brexit and the areas of North-South co-operation, we have identified 142 areas.  Health is one element and it is important that the common travel area continues as it allows the movement of people North and South.  What will be crucial is the continuation of similar regulations and standards, which we are working towards and forms part of the larger picture and the future framework but it is very much on the agenda.  On security, when we talk about addressing the root cause that does not necessarily just apply abroad, it also applies at home.  When we talk about supporting and increasing finances we need to ensure that we consider what happens at home.  Many of the challenges that arise abroad and in other countries stem from the inequalities that exist those countries' societies.  We must consider what happens here and not only abroad in the regard.</p><p> Deputy Haughey spoke about the EU draft guidelines and future trade arrangements.  Let me check my notes.  The EU draft guidelines have been published today.  They very much focus on the free trade arrangement and not the Single Market and the customs union.  President Tusk merely pointed out that if a country is not in the Single Market and customs union, then it cannot avail of the supports and benefits available.  That is why we have consistently stated that in order to achieve all of the things that we want to achieve, and that the UK has clearly said that it wants to achieve, then the best way to do so is to remain in the Single Market and customs union.  It is important that we study the new guidelines and they will move on to the next phase.  They will have to be agreed at the Council meeting in March.  We would like to see more detail from the UK which would influence our draft negotiating guidelines in March.  By the time we reach the April meeting of the European Council we will have further details and thus know the exact guidelines that we are negotiating.  As of now, we are negotiating on the basis that the Single Market and the customs union are off the table and, therefore, we only have the free trade agreement.  We do not know how we can fulfil all of the commitments that have been given by the UK in the absence of further detail from the UK.  We have to work with the UK on that matter.  </p><p> In terms of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, obviously there will be a hole in the budget.  A number of countries have clearly indicated they are willing to pay more, of which Ireland is one.  We would like to see that our key priorities are taken into consideration.  We want the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, completely upheld.</p><p> As for cohesion, Ireland will no longer be in receipt of the Cohesion Fund bar the INTERREG and PEACE funding.  As a small country, however, we know how beneficial the fund has been and believe other member states should have an opportunity to avail of such funding.  </p><p> The redistribution of seats in the European Parliament has been formally agreed and it looks like Ireland will receive two additional seats.  As Deputy Haughey has pointed out, the issue of transnational lists was raised at the last meeting.  Agreement was not reached so the matter will continue to be discussed and debated.  Member states have differing views on the matter.  It is important that we engage in new proposals.  We will probably not see a change, if any, until the next European elections, which will not take place for some time.</p><p> Senator Richmond mentioned Brexit and the current position thereon.  We need to consider the negotiating guidelines that have just been published.  The 27 member states must reach agreement on the negotiating guidelines, which will happen on 22 and 23 March.  </p><p> On the withdrawal agreement for the customs border, again the 27 member states must agree the draft Bill that was published last week.  The UK has already reacted but this draft Bill still has to be agreed by the 27 member states.  What we have asked for, and I think what the UK has agreed to do, is to discuss the existing Bill.  I do not think the UK will come with its own wording.  I think the UK will come with the anticipation that we will hope to reach an agreement based on the text that has been approved.  What is extremely important in this regard, and was said during the first five minutes of Prime Minister May's speech last Friday, was that the UK is committed to what was agreed to before Christmas.  While there seems to be a differentiation in how that can be translated into a legally binding text, we are at the beginning of that stage.  We need to work with the UK, through the European Union, to make sure that we are all very clear about what was agreed and that the language is very clear.  Sections 49 and 50 are extremely important in that regard.  Another paragraph in the agreement before Christmas also talks about any proposal that would reintroduce barriers, customs or associated checks.  To us, that is equally as important as the language used in sections 49 and 50, which was very clearly agreed before Christmas as well. </p><p> Deputy O'Rourke and Senator Coghlan asked about trade.  Since the referendum took place, one of the very first things the Irish Government did was to ask each Department to identify possible challenges posed by Brexit and how a soft Brexit and hard Brexit might impact on the industries and sectors that Department represented.  The Departments are also trying to identify what needs to be done, if anything, in all of those scenarios whether it is introducing new legislation or additional financial and other supports.  That work is being compiled and co-ordinated through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is chaired by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  A number of measures have been put in place.  Last year, our budget provided a &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme fund, which was officially put in place this month.  We also have &euro;25 million additional funding, particularly for the agrifood and drinks sector.  We have additional funding for State agencies like Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland in order that they can work with companies to ensure they are Brexit-proof and can address all of the possible challenges, that they are looking to diversify, can adapt and change and can adopt the skillsets they may need.  We have already seen a slight change as some of the markets have moved from the UK to the rest of Europe.  When it comes to food, and the agrifood and drinks sector, we are very conscious about that aspect.   </p><p> We have an Action Plan for Jobs.  It is looking at ways to ensure that all of our proposed plans are as Brexit-proof as possible.  Our financial services sector has a plan for the period right up to 2030.  We are re-evaluating all of the various proposals and trying to ensure they are Brexit-proofed.  Project Ireland 2040 is a national framework plan that proposes to spend &euro;116 billion.  Brexit is very much part of that plan.  We want to ensure, irrespective of the outcome, that our economy continues to grow.  We will also invest in a number of key infrastructural projects that link the North and South.</p><p>We are also looking at doubling our global footprint, which means not just opening new embassies but strengthening our embassies within Europe to make sure we can further diversify and work within Europe but also further afield.  The challenges we face were clearly highlighted in the Copenhagen report, which was commissioned independently.  It considers four different scenarios that we might find ourselves in based on the UK remaining with the EEA, an FTA, a customs union and the WTO, which is the worst-case scenario.  It sets out in the different scenarios in terms of what would happen if the Government did nothing.  I have outlined a number of actions that have been taken in the absence of knowing what the relationship will be.  We are working to ensure that, irrespective of the outcome, our SMEs and large industries are impacted as little as possible.</p><p> With regard to Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s comments, we have achieved the guarantees in as far as we can.  We achieved what we needed to in phase one.  We are now ensuring that it is translated into a legally binding text and we are at the beginning of that process given the document was only published last week.  While we may hear various different voices, we still have to sit down, through the EU, with the UK and negotiate the guarantees to ensure they go into a legally binding text.  We are at the beginning of that but as far as we are concerned, we have achieved the guarantees in so far as we can to date and we will do everything in our power to ensure what was agreed is honestly translated into a withdrawal Bill, including those commitments.  When the backstop that will come into play has not been set out yet.  It is the last-case scenario for us.  There must be a set timelines for it and it must be implemented but it would have to be agreed between the EU and the UK as we work through the withdrawal Bill.  That will take time and we are only at the start of that process.</p><p> Donald Tusk pointed out the reality in today&rsquo;s announcement that if the UK is to leave the Single Market and the customs union, there will be implications.  However, we have to work on the basis of the UK&rsquo;s commitment to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland to ensure we protect the peace process.  That is what we are focusing on now.  I will come back to the Deputy with more detail on the question of the relaxation of state aid.</p><p> The reason 31 December 2020 was chosen as the deadline for the transition period is that date is the end of the financial framework and to go beyond that would cause further complications.  While we might like an extended period, we agreed that there needed to be a set timeframe and this is the most realistic date.  If there is a requirement to extend that, it was said at the Council meeting that the possibility is there.  However, we are working towards the timeline of 31 December 2020.</p></speech>

The IHCA represents 85% of all hospital consultants working in Ireland&rsquo;s acute hospital and psychiatry services.  This statement is a summary of the detailed submission provided to the committee in mid-January, which I assume members have received.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s spend on treating mental illness is approximately half that of most northern European countries, at just 6.6% of the total health budget.  We have yet to implement many of the recommendations of the Government&rsquo;s 2006 mental health policy, A Vision for Change, with shortfalls across a spectrum of areas, including bed capacity, community care services and staffing.  The IHCA shares the committee&rsquo;s concerns that access is a vital factor to consider when examining each of the three high-level themes it has identified, namely, primary care, recruitment and funding.  The association agrees that while primary care is well positioned to provide care to service users and patients with mild to moderate psychological problems, those with moderate to severe illness often require specialist psychiatric care provided by hospital-based consultant psychiatrists.  Unfortunately, we do not have the resources or the number of consultant psychiatrists required to provide high quality, timely care and treatment to patients who need it. </p> <p>  The Hanly report in 2003 and the HSE national doctors training and planning unit in 2014 recommended that the number of approved consultant psychiatrist posts be significantly increased to 712 by 2016 and to 755 by 2024, respectively, to ensure that safe and effective psychiatry services can be provided on a timely basis.</p><p>Additional increases have been recommended, up to as many as 858 consultant psychiatrists by 2020, by the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  This represents more than a doubling in current numbers.  A further workforce concern is that of the existing 418 approved consultant psychiatrist posts, of which only 290 are permanent appointees. </p><p> Our psychiatry services in particular fall significantly short of the recommendations in A Vision for Change and in comparison with other European countries in terms of consultant workforce, bed capacity and funding. </p><p> Ireland has 6.1 consultant psychiatrists per 100,000 population, just half the EU average number of specialists and one third to one quarter the number in many EU countries.  Ireland is ranked below such countries as Romania, Slovakia and Greece, and has 22% of the number of consultant psychiatrists in Finland for a comparable population. </p><p> The prolonged and deepening consultant recruitment and retention crisis is due to the failure of the State and employers to honour the 2008 consultant contract and the imposition of discriminatory terms and conditions on new entrant consultants.  This has been exacerbated by the steep financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts applied to consultant salaries and systemic funding shortfalls in the psychiatry services and mental health services during the past decade. </p><p> The Irish health service is uncompetitive in recruiting and retaining the number of high calibre consultant psychiatrists it requires.  This sharp decline in competitiveness is evident from the fact that 31% of all approved consultant psychiatrist posts at the end of 2016 were either vacant or filled on a temporary basis.  Nearly three quarters of temporary post holders, some 37 of the 51 staff had agency contracts, thus increasing the overall costs to the health service.</p><p> More recent figures released in October 2017 confirmed that of the 201 approved consultant posts, in all specialties known to be filled on a temporary basis, psychiatry accounted for a disproportionate number of posts, some 50 posts or a quarter of the total. </p><p> A quarter of consultant psychiatrist posts advertised in 2015 and 2016 had no applicants, with 30% having only one applicant for the vacancy.  This recruitment crisis has also manifested itself in the appointment of 21 non-specialists to consultant psychiatrist posts across psychiatry specialist areas as follows: 15 non specialist to general adult psychiatry; four to child and adolescent psychiatry; one to psychiatry of old age and one to learning disability psychiatry.  This undermines the safety and quality of patient care and is in breach of the HSE&rsquo;s recruitment rules and the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  These breaches have occurred across the country in Carlow-Kilkenny, Cavan-Monaghan, Clare, Donegal, Kildare-West Wicklow, Longford-Westmeath, Mayo, Midlands, Sligo-Leitrim and Tipperary south. </p><p> Ireland is not self-sufficient in the provision of specialist trainees, as we are not training enough to meet the requirements or replace current numbers, particularly given the difficulties in retention at non consultant hospital doctor and consultant levels. </p><p> Shortfalls in community team staffing levels are restricting the services' ability to deliver care to users and patients.  The staffing deficits compared with levels recommended in A Vision for Change are up to 68% in intellectual disability services for adults; 47% in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, 42% in psychiatry of old age services and 22% in general adult psychiatry teams. </p><p> Ireland has the third lowest number of inpatient psychiatric care beds in the EU, with 34.83 beds per 100,000 population.  This is half the European average, and the bed capacity has declined sharply from 101 beds per 100,000 population in 2004.  This has occurred at a time when Ireland&rsquo;s population increased by more than 500,000 during the past 12 years, and while those aged 65 years and over increased by 35%.  While A Vision for Change planned for a marked reduction in acute psychiatric hospital beds, the promised alternative services have not been provided in the community. </p><p> The number of adult psychiatry inpatient places available for acute admissions, 972 acute adult inpatient beds at the end of 2016 has been reduced to the point where there are frequently no beds available at night in many community healthcare organisations, CHOs. </p><p> Given that there are only four CAMHS inpatient services nationwide, located in Dublin, Galway and Cork, children often have to make 400 km round-trips from their homes in order to access treatment, thereby experiencing significant separation from their family, friends and school. </p><p> Furthermore, there is no co-ordinated national system to resolve crisis situations when they arise.  This presents a significant patient care and safety issue. </p><p> The admission of children and adolescents to adult psychiatric units is a totally unacceptable but common practice, with 68 children admitted to 19 adult units in 2016.  A third of those admissions to adult units were in one region &ndash; CHO 8, which encompasses Laois-Offaly, Longford-Westmeath and Louth-Meath.  While this represented a 29% decrease on the number of such admissions in 2015, the admission of any child to an adult service is most unsatisfactory.  The downward trend may be reversing again based on available data for the first five months of 2017, as 44 children were admitted to adult units compared with 36 for the same period in 2016. </p><p> The relatively low number of child and adolescent psychiatrists and the shortage of required front-line resources has resulted in unacceptably high numbers of children on CAMHS waiting lists.  In September 2017, 2,333 children were waiting for their first appointment, with 1,472 waiting more than three months to be seen, an increase of 42% compared with October 2016.  The number of children waiting more than a year has also increased significantly from 170 in September 2016 to 317 in September 2017.  This is all against the background of a 26% increase in CAMHS referrals between 2012 and 2017. </p><p> There were also only 29 teams for psychiatry of old age in place in 2017 compared with the recommended 39 teams recommended in &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  The HSE projects that referrals to psychiatry of old age will increase by 17% between 2017 and 2020.</p><p> These deficits are not surprising, given that the 2018 mental health budget of &euro;917.8 million is 10% below that allocated in 2009, which was&euro;1,022 million.  As previously mentioned, Ireland's spend on treating mental illness is approximately half that of most northern European countries, at just 6.6% of the total health budget.  Designated, ring-fenced funding for specific clinical programmes in psychiatry is required to provide early intervention for first episode psychosis, the comprehensive treatment of eating disorders, and self-harm presentations in emergency departments.  Resources are also required to support the overall management of the services by executive clinical directors. </p><p> Moreover, there are substantial regional disparities in the allocation of funding and resources, with community healthcare organisations, CHOs, of similar population size allocated significantly different budget allocations and staffing.</p><p>The above deficits are contributing to significant access problems in the acute psychiatric services, as demonstrated by the persistent and damaging long waiting times for treatment and the unavailability of specialist services promised in A Vision for Change.</p><p> The association welcomes the work of this committee on implementing a single, long-term vision for psychiatric care and the direction of mental health policy in Ireland.  I thank the committee for inviting the association to its discussion today.  We are available to address members' questions on the above and the contents of the association&rsquo;s submission.</p></speech>

The presentation was extremely informative and a little depressing.  The four members present will have seven minutes each to ask questions.  I need to be strict on this because we have another group coming in an hour.  I ask members to ask questions rather than make statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1375" speakername="Gabrielle McFadden" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#E00300"><p>Seven minutes is a limit, not a target and, therefore, I will stick to that.  I welcome the witnesses and I thank them for giving of their time.  Their opening statement was depressing and negative.  Despite that, almost &euro;1 billion was spent over the past year on mental health services, with an additional &euro;59 million to be spent in 2018 and a further &euro;55 million in 2019, which is positive.  Dr. O'Hanlon said only 6.6% of the health budget goes to mental health.  How is that percentage calculated?  Did he include the money spent on mental health by the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality?</p> <p>  FEMPI has been a major problem in general and not just in mental health services, but the Minister for Health is working on that issue.  Appointments have been made.  For example, 120 psychologists are being appointed.  The recruitment drive has been successful and it is expected that those positions will be filled and taken up shortly.  It is, therefore, not all negative.  Are salaries the biggest obstacle to recruiting psychiatrists?  How much is a psychiatrist's salary?  If I come out of college after seven years, what is the starting salary as a junior and what are the salaries as I work my way up to being a consultant?  What are the different posts available?  I would love him to compare those to his counterparts in the NHS.  When I hear stories about psychiatrists, I find that the salaries that consultants earn are very high.  Doctors of psychology probably spend seven or eight years in college.  They work their way up to principal grade, of which there are few in this country.  The salary is approximately &euro;105,000.  How does that compare to a psychiatrist's salary?  What do the equivalents earn in the NHS?</p> <p>  Dr. O'Hanlon referred to inpatient accommodation.  That is a difficulty for us but people are accommodated as inpatients and do well.  When they return home, however, they do not do so well in their normal, day-to-day life and then they have to be readmitted.  What is his opinion on psychiatrists being part of home care teams?  A patient is supported to live at home in the conditions that caused the difficulty in the first place - the trials and tribulations of life.  People get cocooned in an institution and they achieve a certain level of recovery but then they return to the place where it all started to go wrong for them.  If more work was done by home care teams, including psychiatrists, perhaps fewer acute beds would be needed.</p> <p>  Telepsychiatry is used a great deal in the US whereby psychiatrists engage with clients on Skype.  The clients visit a primary care centre with proper facilities and the psychiatrist has dealings with them through Skype.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  I would like direct, specific answers, particularly to the question about salaries.  I am curious about the salaries and the different grades.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal O'Hanlon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#E00500"><p>There are a lot of positive things going on.  Many improvements are taking place in the standard of care but the problem is having the manpower to deliver them.  Home care is a good example.  Many areas cannot recruit home care teams, even though funding is available.  There is, therefore, a problem with recruitment.  All our services have lost people to other countries.  Staff we have trained or employed for years have left and we are employing agency staff at twice the cost to replace them.  The salaries appear generous but there is an international market.  The Chairman asked what contribution salaries make to the decision to leave.  I can only speculate on that, although research is being conducted into that.  Salary is a big component, as is the lack of resources to do our job adequately.  For example, to provide a fully staffed community mental health team, at least 12 AHPs and nurses are needed and many of our teams do not have that number.  It is not uncommon for people to start in the system with three or four staff.  There is also a difficulty in recruitment because there has been a breach of trust in the consultants' contract and it is difficult for consultants to feel respected by the system.  Dr. Browne will address the salaries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Roy Browne" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#E00600"><p>The salary for consultant psychiatrist - no private practice, type A - as of last month, was &euro;185,000.  With regard to my experience in respect of recruitment and retention over the past two years, I have been involved as an external interviewer for much of the consultant recruitment over the past number of years.  I was appointed 20 years ago and at that stage there were approximately 20 candidates for each post.  I was on two interview boards recently, one before Christmas and one after.  One candidate was interviewed for both posts and he got to choose which post he would take.  After Christmas, we interviewed a candidate who was not suitably qualified for the post.  We are now in a position where we have 50 posts unfilled.  Comparisons can be made on salary between many disciplines in many sectors of the workforce in Ireland but we are in an international market, which is even more competitive in the English-speaking world, and we cannot recruit people back to Ireland currently.  The problem worsened because in 2010 staff were offered the option to retain their pension entitlements if they left early and saved the State money by not having to pay them their full salary.  A huge number of consultants left, some of whom have returned as temporary consultants but others have never been replaced.</p><p>We have a significant problem at that end.  </p><p> I cannot answer the question about the figure of 6.6%.  Perhaps Mr. Varley might address it.</p></speech>

We are only working from the health budget.  </p> <p>  In terms of international competitiveness in recruitment, there are many factors at play.  Obviously, the headline salary is one factor.  We have made a submission to the Public Service Pay Commission comparing salaries with those on offer in the countries to which our doctors and consultants are going.  On average, they are paying somewhere in the order of 50% to 100% more.  In addition, cost of living comparisons with some of the destination countries show that living costs in Ireland are up to 10% higher.  Taxation levels are also 10% higher on average.  When one makes net comparisons, one sees that Ireland is not competitive.  That explains why we have not been able to fill posts that have been advertised, not only in mental health services but also throughout all specialties.  I know of posts that have been advertised four or five times across specialties such as pathology, surgery and so forth.  That is the real difficulty.  Being competitive comes into play.  The other fact that comes into play is that relatively we have fewer consultants across all specialties on an international comparative basis.  That means that the workload here tends to be heavier which often manifests in the number of patients in a clinic and I am not just speaking about psychiatry.  Furthermore, the resources available on the front line are more stretched.</p></speech>

What we are trying to get across is that the patients who are sick are the most important part.  While salaries and other elements are important, it is the patients who matter most.  We are arguing that for a host of reasons, they are not receiving the care they need.  While there is a lot of good stuff ongoing, there is a lot of bad stuff, too.</p></speech>

I will defer to Dr. Moore who is a child and adolescent psychiatrist on that question.</p></speech>

I am a paediatric or child and adolescent psychiatrist.  One can look at the research in terms of the short and long-term effects, but the most important point is that it is unfair when a child is admitted to an adult unit.  Despite the absolute best efforts of nurses, doctors and other staff in adult units, one ends up having a child in a room on his or her own, with nothing else ongoing in terms of the provision of treatment.  There is no education and no access to the normal rights of a child.  In paediatric hospitals parents are not just allowed but actively asked and encouraged to be with their children.  That does not happen in psychiatry units, even those which have child and adolescent beds.  It is devastating.  I see children all of the time in adult psychiaty hospitals who I had to admit.  One goes to talk to them and they are distressed because they do not understand the noises they are hearing from the people outside.  There are people in them who are 70 or 80 years old and it is wrong.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Anne Rabbitte's question and go back to what Senator Gabrielle McFadden spoke about, having inpatient units 200 or 300 km away does not make sense.  We should be treating people, particularly children, at home.  We should be linked with schools and the treatment teams in place.  If we need a bed, we should have access to one in the local paediatric hospital for a number of nights, rather than having to wait for a bed a long distance away or put children in adult psychiatry hospitals which, in fairness, are already full with adult patients.  My expert opinion is that, potentially and often, it is devastating for a child.</p></speech>

Dr. Moore has said children are in a room on their own.  I come from Galway where the children in adult psychiatry units are not in a room on their own.  They share rooms with adults.  What is the impact on them?</p></speech>

We do not treat children with any other illness in the same way as we treat children with a mental illness.  They are illnesses, as members know.  We are talking about severe bipolar disorders, schizophrenia and so on.  If a child has any other illness such as asthma or diabetes, we will not put him or her into an adult hospital with 70 or 80 year olds.  By the way, I mean no disrespect to such patients.  However, we seem to think it is okay to do it for children with a different type of illness.</p></speech>

The demand for acute psychiatric beds has become acute.</p><p>The patients in the acute psychiatric units are incredibly unwell and generally are treated as an inpatient for as brief a time as possible because somebody else who is worse is waiting to get that bed.  In a situation where a young child is being exposed to behaviours, which at times can be very bizarre - nobody wishes to hear about this -  because people are extremely unwell, one has to accept that must be very damaging for a child.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  The opening statement indicated that in 2016 alone, 31% of all approved consultant psychiatrists posts were filled on a temporary basis.  Can one of the witnesses define "temporary" in that context?   Is it three months, six months or five years?   The opening statement also refers to non-specialists being appointed to consultant psychiatrist posts.  People who were not qualified were appointed to consultant positions on a temporary basis.  Are they qualified for those positions?</p> <p>  On the issue of agency staff, almost 90% of temporary post holders had agency contracts.  These post holders had temporary contracts and non-specialists were moved into consultant psychiatrist posts.  It was stated that it costs more to hire agency staff.  As Senator McFadden said, if a qualified consultant is paid &euro;185,000 a year, are these temporary or agency staff being paid more than &euro;185,000 a year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Varley" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#G00400"><p>On the information the Deputy referred to in terms of 31% of the posts being on a temporary basis, that is because they cannot be filled on a permanent basis.  Half of the approved posts which are not filled permanently are filled on a temporary basis, the other half are not filled at all.  I am talking about the health service generally.</p> <p>  The issue of the duration of contracts can vary from months to years, sometimes repeated over several years.  That gives rise to a situation where somebody who was appointed on a temporary basis may end up in a contract of indefinite duration, in other words, permanently in the post.  A high percentage of the temporary appointees would be agency appointees with agency contracts.  While we have submitted a freedom of information request to the HSE for information as to what they are paid, to date most of the replies I have received in recent months refused to provide me with information on the cost of an agency consultant or doctor.  Therefore, I do not have that information.  I know of evidence in acute hospitals generally rather than in the mental health sector where the payment for agency employees could be significantly above that of a long-serving permanent consultant.</p> <p>  Regarding consultants' salaries, I should add that  the maximum is &euro;185,000, as referred to by Dr. Browne.  The starting point for newly appointed consultants is about &euro;120,000.  The starting point for a medical graduate joining a hospital as an intern is in the early to mid-&euro;30,000s.  When one compares their salaries with hospitals elsewhere, those hospitals elsewhere pay more. Unfortunately, those are the facts internationally, when one makes international comparisons.  I am not sure if I covered all the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

I cannot get my head around that problem.  If we have people who are qualified to fill posts but we cannot employ them directly, yet we can sublet them to another company and pay them more to do the exact same job for which they are qualified, therefore, what is the problem?  I cannot understand it.  A photo and message was uploaded by a psychiatric nurse to Facebook, which shows how toxic the situation is.  That message came from four psychiatric nurses during the weekend.  It states:</p><blockquote>This is a picture of 4 Psychiatric nurses who had to work to work because being psychiatric nurses we are bottom of the pile in regard to lifts by emergency personnel, because for some unfortunate reason people must think, people's mental health goes away when the snow comes! ...<br /><br />Or maybe we are not seen as &quot;real nurses&quot;.<br /><br />As a newly qualified nurse I've learned so much already about the country and how we are valued.<br /><br />But STILL, We put on our boots and WALK to work.<br /><br />THESE ARE THE KIND OF NURSES YOU ARE LOSING TO OTHER COUNTRIES!!</blockquote> <p>That is a statement from psychiatric nurses.  They went public with that message.  We are paying agency staff more money and they probably have less responsibility than full-time staff.  I can understand the gap in terms of pensions and so on but it comes back to the issue of the recruitment and retention of staff.  We are wasting money on agency staff when we could be giving it to people who have spent their time here qualifying and want to work in the system because we recognise that it is not all about money.  When staff feel they have no self-worth in the system, we cannot fix that problem.  If we keep subletting these qualified personnel and privatising the service, we will have a dog chasing its tail for the rest of his life.  We will be dead and buried and another committee will be in here asking the same questions.</p><p>How do we fix that problem?  Are the unions responsible for this or does it come down to the contracts?  Do the personnel have bad contracts?  This issue is very frustrating.  I was a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, which deliberated for 12 months, and this same issue has come up again.  We are wasting money left, right and centre.  Is it &euro;2 million a week that is spent on HSE agency staff?</p></speech>

I ask if they could also address the answer to that question in the context Senator McFadden's question.</p></speech>

I cannot tell the Chairman what the psychiatrists are looking for, but I can tell her the reason we cannot get back most of those who we are trying to recruit.  They are people we trained who left to work in America, Australia and New Zealand, the major territories that are taking our graduates.  The National Health Service is not attracting as many of our graduates because it suffers many of the difficulties from which we suffer in the Irish health service.  There is an enormous preponderance of managing performance in terms of vetting etc.  These are very self-driven people, as are the nurses - to whom the Deputy referred - the psychologists and the social workers.  These are people who are very much driven to look after their patients but find at times they are unable to have the necessary resources, for example, a room in which to see their patients or a secretary to type up reports.  They type up the reports themselves and that is fine but it probably would have been more helpful if they had seen other patients and had been able to dictate those reports.</p></speech>

The other part is that when we get the permanent posts through, they go to the Public Appointments Service.  I sit on the interview board with all of the various people.  One person turns up and they are either suitable or not suitable.  Therefore, there is also a problem with attracting them to come back to work in a system which they regard as toxic.  It is something nobody likes saying about a system in which they work but, as time has passed, many of us feel it is a toxic system that at times tries to diminish the amount of work we can do.  I was struck by the mixed messages from the HSE coming up to the snow event.  Staff members were told that if they could not get into work, they would not be paid but then two days later, the message was that it would try to give staff a bedroom because it realised that it could not get any staff to come in and work.  Four of my nursing colleagues spent three days in a hotel room coming back into work on shifts every night.  Thank goodness they did so because otherwise we would have had probably one nurse looking after a group of 15 patients who were all extremely unwell.</p></speech>

I do not mean to be disrespectful, but my analogy might make it simple.  If a doctor comes to this country to be a consultant, he or she can either train to be a specialist, which takes three years and a lot of work and study on a lower salary, or go to an agency and work immediately as a consultant, although he or she has not been trained for it.  After three or four years, he or she will have a contract of indefinite duration allowing him or her to be a consultant, even though he or she is not.  In that sense, it is a no-brainer and I mean no disrespect to anyone.  The solution is for the Legislature to examine the Medical Practitioners Act which does need to be examined.</p></speech>

A number of weeks ago the secretary general of the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland attended a meeting of the committee and painted a very dark picture of mental health services in the State.  It was so dark that everybody was flabbergasted at the position on retention and the morale of psychiatric nurses.  The report given today is not as damning, but obviously it contains an analysis of mental health services in the State.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to one point on which I want to obtain the delegates' professional opinion.  Some of the questions have been answered.  With regard to CAMHS beds, early intervention is key to most things medically.  When there are waiting times that are completely unacceptable, medically and socially, what is the damage in the short and longer term to a child who is not being seen, with a view to receiving a key mental health intervention?  It is completely unacceptable that there are waiting times for essential services.  It is a societal issue.  In the medical opinion of the delegates what does a delay do to the child and family?</p></speech>

It is due to not having sufficient manpower in the service to provide an appointment.  I ask Dr. Moore to answer because he is the expert on child psychiatry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran Moore" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#H00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question, to which there are a number of elements.  I shall answer it honestly.  The simple answer is that it is absolutely devastating.  The Deputy is correct in that regard.  It is important when designing services that we try to examine the difference between mental health and mental illness.  I say that because at any one time approximately 20% of children broadly have psychological difficulties which may extend from difficulties within the family and bullying at school to the other end.  I am not saying one is different from the other, except where there is a very severe illness such as schizophrenia which is a long-term biological illness that, unfortunately, will require an input from the medical and other professions for the rest of the patient's life.  It is about working out how we deliver the service.  That is why we would very much welcome having psychologists in primary care services.  In some parts of the country there is a waiting list of approximately four years, which is crazy.</p> <p>  To go back to our bit, it does not make sense that specialists end up seeing children who do not need to see them.  Many of the children on the waiting list for the specialist service do not necessarily need a specialist service.  However, they do need to see somebody, which is why we are very much promoting the idea that primary care psychology services and all of the other ancillary services should be resourced also.  On our side, we really need help with the more specialist service.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, early intervention is key in anything about which we know.  We know that 50% of mental illnesses which will require psychiatric intervention come on before the age of 14 years and 75% by 25.  The earlier the intervention, the better, including in cases of autism and ADHD.  Not only does it help the child, but it also helps society in order that people can work in the community and will not need to be in receipt of disability benefit for long periods.  It is best to have intervention as early as possible.  Expenditure is far lower than at the other end where one ends up treating people.  Even with those with whom I deal, 17 and 18 year olds, it is almost too late.  It is not too late, but it can be in some cases where people are already in trouble with the Garda or may not be able to work or go to school.  It is not just about resources and early intervention, but they do have a huge influence.</p> <p>  To answer the questions on retention and recruitment, a large part is that people really enjoy working together when they are able to do so and when the resources required are in place.  Colleagues of mine are frustrated across the spectrum.  The psychological stress and burden in being overworked cause a lot of difficulties for people.</p> <p>  On the point about psychiatric nurses, there are really good, interested people who want to work and do work.  However, the system does not work at times.  Perhaps if we had more people and more support available, we could do better.</p></speech>

I started off in the Eastern Health Board, which then got divided into three, then four and then across the country into nine.  The system is now getting regenerated in a smaller number of community health care organisations, CHOs, over time.  They will eventually be linked back into hospitals.  There has been a burgeoning bureaucracy and, often, a management structure that is not sure what it is managing.  We are nearly back to where we were once upon a time where we had a health board for a local area and there were inputs from the carers, the politicians, the people who used the health service and the experts' managers.</p></speech>

Are the HSE subsidies given to mental health professionals comparable with those given to other health professionals?  Getting colleagues of the witnesses back into this country was mentioned.  What is the most attractive element of working outside of Ireland and what is the least attractive element of working in Ireland for mental health professionals?</p> <p>  Dr. Moore mentioned that getting people at 17 years old may be too late.  He is right.  I represent the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  There are many issues there and work is being done by child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  How can we intervene at an earlier age?  There are problems at national school level as opposed to the witness meeting them when it is too late at 17.  Perhaps Dr. Moore might comment on that?  </p></speech>

On the issue of recruitment, when a consultant retires, or is flagged for retirement, I have had the experience of ringing a hospital looking to speak to "consultant Murphy" and the answer has been that he retired and his replacement was not there yet.  What processes are in place in that case?  Does people flag their retirement two years, two months or two weeks in advance to give the opportunity for somebody to be put in place?  Could the system be adjusted so that a consultant does not retire until there is a replacement there for him or her?  It is a very difficult scenario.  The person at the top of the ladder with regard to much of the decision-making is not there and therefore everything behind it begins to stack up.  Then we have unfortunate consequences.</p> <p>  The same point applies across the board with doctors, nurses and all the way down.  In the witnesses' experience, is the recruitment section of the HSE in need of an entire overall to try to go some way towards fixing this problem?  The witnesses said there is a worldwide shortage.  However, some countries fare better than others.  As pointed out earlier by Deputy Neville, the money seems to have been put into the system.  I would be interested in the witnesses' points of view on what could be done better?  What could the committee recommend be done across the entire recruitment organisation of the HSE in order that we can go some way towards resolving this problem?  I do not think it is going to come from politicians shouting about it.  It is not going to come from the HSE trying to defend the indefensible.  It is going to come from a broad-brush approach by saying this is how we should try to fix this problem.  I would like the witnesses' comments on that.</p></speech>

Is it a common practice for non-specialist doctors to act as consultants?   Is it a concern and is it acceptable or is it a blurring of professional lines?  Is it safe and is the HSE attempting to normalise it and make it acceptable within the recruitment process?  What are the consequences in the short term and the long term, both for the health care system and for patients?</p> <p>  Ireland has the longest targeted waiting time in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries of 18 months.  We are even failing to meet that.  The Minister regularly blames the lack of staff.  Is that purely a staffing issue, and therefore a recruitment issue, or are there other key difficulties that could be resolved but are leading us to have the single worst waiting times in OECD countries?  There are eastern European countries where 25 years ago, we were looking at their health care systems and families were going over to those countries to rescue children from those systems.  We remember the television programmes back in the day.  They now have far superior health care systems in terms of waiting times and access than we do.  In the respect we have not moved.  They are my two questions.</p></speech>

One of the key questions concerns the witnesses' recommendations with regard to recruitment and retention of staff.  What should this committee recommend to the Government to try to get over that significant barrier and to make it more attractive?  In a general sense, how many patients per day, week or month would a psychiatrist see across the different disciplines?  Are there targets and, if so, are they met?  How is that particular issue dealt with?  Regarding college places, is there an issue with college courses and placements?  Should a body of work be done in that respect?  Are we turning out enough graduates to fill the gaps?  Is sick leave also an issue that needs to be addressed within the system?</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to try to answer as much as possible of those questions.  What we will probably do is follow up with a letter if some of those questions cannot be answered now.  Who would like to start?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.249" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal O'Hanlon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#J01900"><p>To start off, there are no subsidies for working in the mental health service as opposed to other branches of the HSE, to my knowledge.  There are pretty standard working conditions.  In respect of what makes a post attractive, I am in an odd position in that I spent 13 years in North America.  Coming back, my working life changed because I was spending less time seeing patients directly and a lot of time looking for resources for patients.</p><p>One spends time looking for a bed for someone, trying to squeeze him or her into a clinic or trying to arrange someone on the team to plug a gap for an unfilled post in order that someone gets a home visit, etc.  That is a difference.  In general, when someone is recruited into our health service, many of the simple things to support him or her, such as a desk, a computer, an office in which to see patients or access to enough office suites to be able to work productively, may not be in place.  It has been a long-standing problem in the system that these things are often not in place.</p><p> Salary is certainly a factor, but there is also the difficulty in understanding the management structures and the ethos.  In other jurisdictions there were very clear governance structures that were very centred on patient care.  There was very heavy medical influence on these as there were other professionals influencing them, but there was a clear voice.</p><p> I will try to deal with part of the question of recruitment.  Overall, the HSE generally cannot recruit for a local competition.  It needs special permission to do so.  Therefore, often it will recruit from a national panel.  For many other disciplines, if we wanted a nurse with particular expertise, we may not be able to organise a competition in one region to do so.  We would have to pull off a national panel, which means someone may get a job in Dublin but may wish to work in Donegal.  Therefore, that person may be there for six months and then a job may come up in his or her desired location and he or she moves.  This is very understandable, but then one must start the whole process again.  In general, my experience has been that it takes about six to 12 months to recruit someone.  That seems to apply to all grades, and the stages-----</p></speech>

This applies to all health care staff, in my experience.  For consultants it is different in that the first step is the consultant appointments committee, the preparation for which is time-consuming, taking about a month.  Dr. Browne sits on that committee so he can probably speak a little more about the process thereafter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Roy Browne" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#K00400"><p>I think part of the question concerned what we do about pre-recruiting, so to speak, and being prepared to replace someone who is retiring.  We know that most consultants contractually finish at 65.  We know their dates of birth, so it is not beyond the wit of man to recognise when they will leave.  Some may wish to go earlier.  If so, they must give two months' notice, which is obviously a difficulty if one has only two months to recruit.  The recruitment process is very independent of the HSE.  It is carried out through the Public Appointments Service.  It involves a very detailed description of the job in a particular layout, including the resources that are available to the applicant to do the job.  This goes to the consultant appointments unit where it is then compared with the national programmes.  The question is asked whether this consultant post needs to be refilled.  Generally, it does.  As Deputy Brassil said, if someone is doing a necessary job and then leaves, someone is needed to replace him or her.  Once this process happens, which takes place over the space of about two or three months, it then goes to the recruitment process, which probably takes, through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, three or four months to advertise, shortlist and interview.  Then we run into the difficulty that we are often bringing people back to Ireland from jobs abroad if they are finishing their training or something like that.  They have a period of 180 days to meet specialist registration requirements, so then there is the difficulty of getting them a start date for work.  Therefore, as Dr. O'Hanlon said, we are often talking about in excess of a year to progress this.  This still misses the point that once we have gone to the PAS and the candidates have been interviewed and so on, I turn up on the interview panels and one or two people turn up to be interviewed, some of whom are not suitable for the job.  Therefore, even as we go through the recruitment process, we run into difficulties at each step.</p> <p>  One thing I will say more generally about mental health services and recruitment is that, as Dr. O'Hanlon said, there are national panels.  There are people who are offered jobs in Dublin who are living in Cork.  They have two weeks to refuse the job and it goes to the next person on the panel.  If there is a panel of 80 people, it can be seen that a year later, the last person, who is now in Donegal and wants to work in Cork, is being offered the post he or she wants.  This is a huge difficulty.</p></speech>

This touches on the comments I wanted to make.  We have two main problems from a service delivery point of view.  First and foremost is a lack of front-line resources.  I know we all hear we spend more on our health service than the other European countries.  When we drill down into the figures, we do not see this level of resourcing presenting itself on the front line, so there is the question whether some of it is being lost, more so here than elsewhere, in administration, etc.  The indicators for this are quite obvious, and we have already touched on them, namely, the number of beds, doctors etc. we have in the mental health services.  The same applies to the acute hospitals.  We have the lowest number of beds on a comparative EU basis across the acute hospitals and mental health services.  We have the highest occupancy rate, at 95%.  The recommended level is 85%.  We are therefore occupying to a higher level.  We have the longest waiting lists, as people have said, the reason being we have the lowest number of doctors and, on top of that, relatively speaking, an even lower number of consultants.  Accessing the service, both mental health and acute hospitals, is coming back to the basic raw material.</p> <p>  How does one attract back consultants and doctors?  The country made an absolutely fatal mistake ten years ago.  It breached a contract blatantly such that the Minister of the day and the State offered contracts to 2,500 consultants, signed up to them and, within months, refused to honour them.  I say it was blatant because I used to work in the Department of Finance in the early 1990s, after the depression at the time, and in the equivalent of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, we had a golden rule, which was one did not break contracts.  Why?  Once a contract with an employee or a group of employees is broken, they can no longer trust the person or body that broke the contract.  We must remedy this breach in order that people can trust the State and, I stress, will honour the contracts they enter into.</p> <p>  The second thing we need to do, and it is an issue not just for the medical profession, but for teachers and nurses as well, is to end discrimination against newly employed professionals because equal work should have equal terms.  These are very simple things, but unless we address them there will be problems.</p></speech>

The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland was formed in 2009 as the professional body for psychiatrists in the Republic of Ireland.  It is the sole body recognised for the training of doctors to become specialists in psychiatry and for providing career-long competence for specialists in psychiatry, as regulated by the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 through the Medical Council.  The college is not a regulatory, disciplinary or industrial relations body.  It is a not-for-profit professional membership organisation and a registered charity.</p> <p>  The mission of the college is to promote excellence in the practice of psychiatry.  The college fulfils its mission through education and training of psychiatrists; provision of continuous lifelong learning for psychiatrists; advocacy for resources to support best practice in the delivery of mental health services; promoting best practice in education, training and research in psychiatry; and public education on issues related to psychiatric illness, psychiatric services and mental health promotion.  To fulfil our mission of promoting excellence in the practice of psychiatry, the college focuses on supporting, representing and leading member psychiatrists nationally and internationally; promoting excellence, best practice, recovery and collaboration in mental health care; setting standards for trainee psychiatrists; supporting the continuous professional development of our qualified members; working with key stakeholders, Government committees and agencies, as well as other organisations; promoting human rights and ethical conduct in psychiatry and mental health services; and working with service users, carers and their organisations.</p> <p>  The college also has several specialist groups called faculties, representing the main psychiatric specialties which exist in Ireland.  These include academic psychiatry, addiction psychiatry, adult psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, learning disability psychiatry, liaison psychiatry, medical psychotherapy, old age psychiatry, and social and rehabilitation psychiatry.  The college has several committees which take an active part in college projects including Refocus and the college advisory group.</p><p>Refocus is the recovery experience forum of carers and users of services and it originally formed in late 2011, with ten people with experience of the mental health services as patients, ten of their family members or carers and one psychiatrist.  Members give their time to work with the college in improving training of psychiatrists and in identifying ways to improve the mental health services.  The committee now comprises eight people with experience of the services -  namely, service users - eight family members of service users and eight psychiatrists.  The committee is jointly chaired by one psychiatrist and one non-psychiatrist.  We also have an advisory board comprising persons of high standing in Irish society.  It meets with the college officers to advise on how to progress the aims of the college and its members.</p><p> The subject at hand today is recruitment and retention of psychiatrists.  Recruitment in psychiatry is controlled by the HSE and the main private psychiatric service suppliers.  The HSE is the main employer of trainees and consultants in psychiatry, and the recruitment role is carried out by the HSE national doctors training and planning, NDTP, department.  It incorporates medical education and training, consultant appointments and medical workforce planning and was established in September 2014.  The role of the college is limited to the recruitment of trainees and the training of doctors to specialist level.  The number of trainees that can be appointed to training schemes run by the college is set by the NDTP in consultation with the college, as a training body.  Training is financed by the HSE through financial agreements with all relevant colleges in medicine and, in our case, with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, and through salaries to trainee doctors.</p><p> The structure of training is as follows.  To train to be a specialist in psychiatry takes at least seven years after qualification as a doctor and internship, so we are talking about at least eight years after a five to six year undergraduate course.  Training is divided into a one-year foundation year, followed by a further three years of basic specialist training, BST, and then higher specialist training, HST, of at least three years.  BST is a general training in psychiatry whereby trainees rotate through various specialties and also complete exams and research.  This follows on from the foundation year from which doctors must have graduated and then completed a year&rsquo;s internship.  HST is in specific speciality areas, broadly divided into adult or child and adolescent psychiatry but also involving subdivisions within each depending on the long-term career ambitions of the trainee.  To enter HST, doctors must have successfully completed BST.  Completion of HST leads to the granting of a certificate of specialist training that guarantees to the public that the doctor has achieved all the competencies set by the college as necessary to practice safely as a specialist in the area of psychiatry that he or she trained in.  The college holds that a doctor should not be a consultant if they are not a specialist in the appropriate area of medical practice.  Unfortunately, we are aware, as I am sure the committee is, that this is frequently not the case in the Irish mental health services.</p><p> The college holds interviews yearly and, depending on a number of factors, has a variable number of places to offer in training posts.  These include the rules of the NDTP, the progression of trainees already in schemes through their training and the numbers leaving training.  The latter is, hopefully, due to people completing training but can be due to other issues, such as lack of progression due to academic issues, change in career choices and decisions to work abroad.  The training run by the college is flexible in order to maximise its attraction for young medical graduates who want to be trainees.  By this I mean that the trainee can take time out and can map their route through training to its completion in consultation with college trainers, who are all practising consultant psychiatrists.  This allows for high quality medical graduates to travel or to work in other areas of medicine and return to training in psychiatry in Ireland.  It also gives employers an idea of the workforce that is available at any given time over a number of years.  The college also allows for part-time training to facilitate doctors who have other issues in their lives that might have previously prevented them entering formal training, such as family or carer issues, which is common, and they can still take part in full specialist training, even though it may be extended due to the other activities they are involved in.</p><p> Regrettably, there are still difficulties filling training posts in psychiatry and there are also difficulties in getting specialists to fill consultant posts.  This is an issue across medicine in Ireland, not just in psychiatry.  There have been several reports in recent years that have examined the generic issues involved and proposed remedies.  These include the MacCraith report and the recent report on consultant recruitment and retention published by the HSE.  It is difficult to work out why many of the simple proposals in these documents have not been implemented, particularly as they were well enunciated prior to the reports being published.  These include: developing a culture in our health services where trainees feel respected; planning for consultant retirements; remuneration; and simplifying and speeding up the process by which consultant posts are established, advertised and filled.</p><p> There are specific issues affecting recruitment in psychiatry that the college works to overcome.  These include the so-called "hidden curriculum" in medical schools where psychiatry, and to a lesser extent, general practice are portrayed as not being worthwhile, having poor patient outcomes and not being branches of medicine.  The college works on these erroneous perceptions through publications, participation in national recruitment days and our summer schools for students.</p><p> The committee may ask why the foundation of new medical schools and the evolution of old ones with increased places have not helped.  Unfortunately, up to 50% of medical graduates have left the country following completion of their internships in recent years.  Internationally, 4% to 5% of medical graduates choose psychiatry as a career.  Unfortunately, in Ireland we have 4% of the 50%, which is insufficient.  Even if an increase were achieved, it would not be enough for a consultant-delivered service.  The college has been closely examining the factors that adversely affect recruitment and retention to psychiatry in Ireland.  Most of the reasons are outside the college&rsquo;s control.  We know that a high percentage of new medical graduates intend to go overseas, drawn by a multitude of factors, including a search for adventure, peer pressure, perception of better working conditions in some accessible countries, perception of better career opportunities in some accessible countries and a perception of poor health service conditions and career opportunities in our own country.</p><p> The college interacts regularly with its trainees who identify poor resources in mental health services and reduction in remuneration compared to other countries as reasons for leaving Irish psychiatry.  However, their experience of their training in psychiatry is overall a positive one.  The Medical Council carries out an annual survey of trainees - Your Training Counts - which is independent of the training bodies.  This survey provides an overall score of trainee satisfaction with training called the D-RECT score.  For the past two years, the highest score for any of the 13 training bodies has been for psychiatry, with a particularly high score for supervision, assessment and feedback, that is, the direct links with a consultant superior who ensures the trainee gets education and supervision, which can only guarantee better services to service users.  We work continuously with trainees and consultants, and with the recommendations in the aforementioned reports, to improve their overall satisfaction and experience further.</p><p> The college has circulated a detailed workforce planning document to the relevant stakeholders in Government and the health services, and we have also sent a copy to this committee.  With consultant psychiatrist numbers of eight per 100,000, Ireland ranks behind all other northern European countries.  In order to provide for a consultant delivered service in all areas of psychiatry in the future, the college believes there needs to be 800 consultant posts nationally.  In fact, this number will be higher in the future, based on current and expected population changes, regulation and legislation changes and changes to the working practice of psychiatrists, such as job sharing and so on.  This equates to a ratio of 16 per 100,000 people.  This would allow for the increases in clinical demands and the multitude of non-clinical activities expected of specialist consultants, which include administration, training, examining and continuing professional development to maintain their own competency.  It also allows for the other factors that currently impact on service delivery, such as leave, sick leave, maternity leave and parental leave.  Currently, these are leading to the curtailing and even closure of services, especially in sub-specialist areas where a consultant leaves for one of these reasons, even for a short time.  Of course, an increase in consultant numbers will require a concomitant increase in trainee numbers if the increased number of posts are to be filled.  We have yet to get an opportunity to discuss this document in a detailed, practical fashion with those who are tasked with delivering clinical resources in the health service.</p><p> The college continues to point out that the percentage of the health budget allocated to mental health services falls far short of that recommended in the decade-old policy on mental health, A Vision for Change.  The college believes that changes in population numbers and demographics mean the A Vision for Change figure of 8.4% is insufficient and that a figure of 12%, in line with other First World economies, should be the target.  We have proposed that this increase should occur in a rolling way over several budgets.  The rationale for this is that mental health problems account for 13% of the burden of disease across the world, according to the World Health Organization.  The college has been lobbying for this for several years in successive budget submissions without success.  Other organisations in the mental health area agree with us on this.  We are happy to supply copies of our budget submissions to the committee, if required.</p><p> The poor budget allocations affect recruitment and retention.  As stated already, highly trained clinicians wish to work in clinical environments that enable them to use and develop their skills.  In psychiatry, this means appropriately staffed multidisciplinary teams with an appropriate range of available milieus, such as inpatient beds and day hospital and community services, and a range of treatment options, such as psychotherapies, vocational training and pharmacotherapies, available as needed.  Terms and conditions are also an issue.  Modern medical graduates are looking for a fair salary, an environment that encourages and facilitates challenge, career growth and progression and a good work-life balance.  Once again, resources affect these to an extent that means other health services providers, either private providers in Ireland or providers in countries abroad, are more attractive.</p><p>There are legislative and administrative issues that affect recruitment and retention also.  A change in the Medical Practitioners Act has excluded doctors from countries - such as, for example, India - that previously supplied candidates for training posts, many of whom stayed to take up consultant posts.  Requests from training bodies, including ourselves and the Medical Council for a change in this have not been productive.  I brought this issue up with the Minister for Health last week and he promised to review it.<br/><br/>Doctors from outside the EU have demands made on them as regards maintaining their legal status and that of their families in Ireland which seem more limiting than those of other countries in which they can work.  That doctors on four-year training schemes with guaranteed jobs for those years still have to apply for work visas at the start of each six-month placement is a factor that must act as a deterrent to such high-quality doctors to work in Ireland.  Difficulties faced by spouses in gaining work visas and by parents in gaining visitor visas of sufficient duration to allow them to have input into their children's and grandchildren's lives is also an issue.<br/><br/>The philosophy of formatting medical training in Ireland is that there should be the exact numbers taken into training as are required at consultant level.  This is not a philosophy set by us.  It does not allow for losses due to dropouts, emigration or career changes to psychiatric practice or need that increases the requirement for trained specialists.  The ideas of the NDTP and of the college as to the numbers who should be allowed into psychiatric training do not always coincide, with the college looking for higher numbers at both BST and HST than we are eventually allowed.  Since its formation, HSE-NDTP had approved 60 new entrants to BST in psychiatry each year.  With improved interest in our programme, the college requested an increase of 10% this year.  HSE-NDTP approved a 5% increase to 63.  The pity of this is we have good applicants but we cannot take them in.<br/><br/>The equity of financial support for training across and between medical disciplines is not transparent and there is a feeling that psychiatry gets less than other medical specialties - this is in the grant with the service level agreement, SLA, between our training bodies and the HSE.  We make continuing efforts to clarify this but so far have not been successful.  This has led to a perception among specialists and trainees that the playing field is not level and that psychiatry is not seen as important by the national leadership.<br/><br/>The following are some solutions.  The college wants mental health services in Ireland that are based on a philosophy of recovery and that ensure access to assessment and intervention with an appropriate menu of interventions available to people with mental illness based on need, not geography or ability to pay.  This requires financial and cultural change.  The recommendations as to how this could occur are in the documents referred to and in submissions by the college to Government over the years.<br/><br/>There are some changes that we see as being easy to make.  First, barriers to training posts in psychiatry could be lifted.  The college has poured significant resources into promoting psychiatry as a speciality and then when this is successful, we are told that there is a limit to the number of trainee doctors we can appoint.  This is despite the fact that there remain significant vacancies in trainee posts throughout the country.  Second, a quality mental health service needs a highly-qualified and experienced team of medical professionals to deliver high-quality services.  The service cannot continue to rely on depleted multidisciplinary teams, MDTs, with no trainee doctors and sometimes no consultant due to absence, such as retirement or sick leave.<br/><br/>We need the primacy of teaching, training and research to be reinstated within the profession of psychiatry to ensure MDTs maintain and attract highly-qualified professionals.  The President of Ireland, as patron of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland has been quoted as saying:</p><blockquote>... the promotion and undertaking of research must always be a central aim rather than an optional extra in mental health.  Developing new ways of preventing, diagnosing and treatment of mental illness must continue even while acknowledging the need to be more efficient and using resources more effectively.</blockquote><p>In addition, the recruitment process for consultants needs to be fit for purpose.  For example, recruitment for a vacant post should start months before a consultant is due to retire instead of after he or she has retired.  I have been through this process in the past year whereby it was only after my colleague retired that I was sent the documents for the post that was to replace her post which then had to go through the various stages to get ratified before we could even look at advertising for someone to replace her.  It has not happen yet, two years later.<br/><br/>On legislation relating to registration and immigration, amending the Medical Practitioners Act to allow recognition of the internship year in other countries would allow more doctors to come and train here.  In our simplistic way as non-legislators, we feel this could be done rapidly.<br/><br/>The disparity of salary at consultant level has an impact on those who carry out altruistic work for their profession, such as training and examining.  New consultants, who are on a lower salary than colleagues, are less likely to participate in doing this sort of important professional work, which ultimately affects the standard of training and education in the services.<br/><br/>We are happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

It is great to see three women present, especially given the week that is in it.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  On public service and psychiatry and consultant psychiatrists, we learned in the earlier session that a senior consultant would earn approximately &euro;185,000.  The public would not understand and I suppose would not empathise with one who says that that level of salary is not attracting what we need.  We went into the different reasons such as, for example, that perhaps it is more than just salary, but we all are recovering from the idea that &euro;185,000 will not attract psychiatrists to a post.</p> <p>   I am not sure if we got the detailed breakdown from the CHOs or from the HSE of the amounts and contract duration of the temporary and agency consultants who are being employed, some of whom do not have the speciality of the post in which they are employed.  I would be interested in that because it seems to be nearly double &euro;185,000.  It seems we are shooting ourselves in the foot by employing many different bits and pieces here and there.  Agency staff, while dedicated, do not feel like a whole part of the team because they can be gone on a whim and perhaps their dedication to the area is not as robust as that of permanent staff.  However, I would like to see those figures.  They are significant in the budget about which we give out.</p> <p>  Dr. Hillery spoke of material change to allow doctors from other countries - he referred to India in particular - to come here and amendment of the Medical Practitioners Act.  That is something practical that we can take on.  It is like where eventually Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann listened and changed.  It took the unions several years but Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann announced recently significant material change to its operation and recruitment.  Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann is taking in post-experience as opposed to training experience and training modules and it will allow many other nurses to apply.  Perhaps we could work on the Medical Practitioners Act.  Given that it takes a year, according to the previous group here before the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, and two years, according to Dr. Hillery, to get a post through all the red tape and all the various committee stamps, sealed, signed and delivered and then eventually advertised, at which point maybe only one or two turn up for interview, it is such practical steps that we are here to look at, listen to and act on and we have got so many so far for the interim report that will issue towards the end of this month or next month.</p> <p>  Given that there is a new unit being built beside Portrane, I will focus briefly on forensic psychiatry.  We have not done this previously, as there has been concentration on child and adolescent mental health.  The level of incarceration in this country was significant in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, more so than in Russia.  At one stage, we had 22,000 patients incarcerated behind asylum walls.  That seems to have shifted now to the prisons and there is a significant number of prisoners with severe and enduring mental illnesses who are being incarcerated.  On the forensic psychiatry part of it, will we be able to provide enough beds in the new unit?  Would Dr. Hillery know that or can we find out?  I refer to those waiting lists of 30 to 40 persons throughout the country who are either in prison or in other approved centres who cannot get into the forensic unit.  Will the new unit accommodate all that is needed, given the increase in criminalising those with mental health difficulties?  Its seems as though the pendulum has swung from incarceration in asylums to prisons.  I do not want to overstate it but we need some correction on that.</p> <p>  The committee has discussed IT systems at length.</p><p>I know we cannot get IT.  The public cannot get email addresses when they are looking for information on their children or to set up meetings with CAMHS.  We seem to frown upon IT systems that will modernise things and make matters easier if we go with the flow and have a fit-for-purpose IT system and apps for the public and ourselves.</p><p> My final point relates to capacity.  It is all about capacity.  In part, recruitment and retention are about not being able to deal with the chaos because of the capacity issues that people find overwhelming.  While they want adventure abroad, they also choose a caseload that can be managed where they feel they can do something worthwhile for their patients or those whose care they are entrusted to improve.</p></speech>

I think a salary of &euro;185,000 is very attractive.  I do not think anyone would disagree with that.  The trouble is new entrants are paid considerably less and there are differentials across the health services that make it unattractive.  It involves the differences in salary between two people working in the same department, which is a change that came in a few years ago.</p></speech>

All the trainees I talk to - Dr. Plunkett will address this in a moment - want a fair salary but many of them feel that the new entry-level salary is not fair, particularly compared to what was there before and what they see in places such as Australia or Canada, to which they can go and where they see the quality of life the Senator has just referred to - with better supplied teams, more guaranteed hours and guaranteed progression - as being better.  I would agree that &euro;185,000 is a very attractive salary but the new entrants are not eligible for that.  That is an issue and has not been discussed at length.  Salary is not the main deciding factor for trainees.  I might come back to the agency issue but Dr. Plunkett might comment on matters from the trainees' point of view.</p></speech>

I really appreciate Senator Devine bringing that issue up.  As Dr. Hillery mentioned, it is not salary that attracts people to or puts them off work.  What attracts people to or puts them off work is whether they can work effectively and be trained by somebody who is a specialist in the area and who is dedicated to developing this service and post.  As the Senator mentioned, a locum - despite being a professional and being dedicated to his or her professional practice-  is not in a position to develop the service or make long-term changes because there is uncertainty around how long he or she will be there.  Within the service in which I work, I am aware that possibly the majority of consultant posts in Connolly Hospital are locum cover or temporary consultant cover.  Not knowing who will be working alongside you or supervising you on call from day to day is a really fraught place to be as a trainee.  A trainee coming through will consider how the profession will develop if this is the landscape where people are not in jobs for 20 years and do not have that security and that base.  That point is really well made and I appreciate the Senator bringing it up.</p></speech>

First of all, there is the risk to the public because of non-specialists.  Dr. Plunkett's point is really valid.  The public is going into a service that has no continuity and that has "leaders" who are not in leadership roles because they are temporary.   I had an excellent higher specialist trainee a few years ago.  In line with the Medical Practitioners Act, I went to offer a second opinion at a Dublin hospital.  I was not happy with the notes I had seen so I went back and asked the trainee about it.  She told me that the consultant in question was her senior house officer before she came to work for me but the person got the membership and then applied for a consultant post rather than applied for training because the money for the temporary consultant post was good.  So it has two effects.  It is taking certain people away from training because they see that this is better paid but it also means that the trainees, who are experienced, qualified and write papers - my trainee at the time was finishing her MD - are answerable to somebody with fewer qualifications and experience.  This cannot be good for the public.  Part of the reason for the agencies seems to be a historical issue that goes back to when I was a junior doctor, which is a few years ago now.  When someone is due to retire, we know when they will do so.  People usually retire on their 65th birthday.  It is after this that everything kicks into place so there is a mad rush to look for someone to fill the post.  Sometimes they ask the person who has been doing it to stay on.  Many of us do not want to do that anymore so they look for someone else.  A process then arises for the creation of a consultant post that, as I have outlined, can take a few years while in the mean time, roles are filled by locums and the higher trainees who we have trained are looking around and saying that no post has been advertised for which they have been trained but there is one in Australia, the UK or somewhere else or in the private sector and they may as well try that.  We just do not seem to be able to get that act together.  It has been going on for as long as I remember and it is very damaging.  The most significant point is that it puts the public at risk.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on this committee to come up with a very strong recommendation about the recruitment process and how to go about it.  I welcome anybody who comes in with solutions listed in his or her  final paragraph.  I think Dr. Hillery suggested that recruitment for a vacant post should start months before a consultant retires.  I would suggest a minimum of 12 months to give the system some opportunity to recruit-----</p></speech>

It really is time to change it.  The witnesses went through the training process.  If I am correct, we are looking at about 13 years from someone's first day in college, which is an inordinate amount of time.  Is there any jurisdiction where psychiatry is a stand-alone qualification where somebody decides at an early stage in his or her career that this is what he or she wants to do, is trained as such, comes out with his or her primary degree and possibly trains for a period of ten years after first starting?  Does that occur anywhere else and, if so, is it something at which we could look?</p></speech>

"Consultant" is an honorary term and an advertising term.  We just talk about specialists.  We feel all consultants should be trained as specialists in the areas in which they are consultants.</p><p>Not all consultants are specialists, but they should be.  Consultant is a job that is advertised by the HSE or by a private provider.  Private providers tend to insist on people being on the specialist register, but it is not necessarily so with temporary posts, especially.  When the permanent posts were advertised by the HSE they are always for the specialist register but at the end of seven years, we certify people as specialists and we consider that they are competent to be specialists in that area and they are competent to be consultants.</p></speech>

As was said, for undergraduates, it can be four or five years.  In other jurisdictions, one can be a psychiatrist in four to six years.  Our point there is twofold.  Once people qualify as interns they are working within the system and they contribute quite significantly in terms of our higher specialist training, doing research or doing projects, service management, etc.  We would make a strong case for the benefit of being a medic, a doctor, first because a person's mind, body and brain are all the one.</p> <p>  Also, our training programme over the last five years in psychiatry has brought in psychological services.  Many people will need psychological treatments or they will need their team to be trained like nurses, in solution-focused and other types of psychotherapist, which ultimately benefits our patients.  That is incredibly important because not everybody will need a psychologist.  Perhaps a complex presentation will need a psychologist.  There are very many mental illnesses where psychological interventions are needed and that is where we have training in that now in social.</p> <p>  We would not be for shortening it because it shows a commitment in that regard, even though there are models and there was some concern in another jurisdiction, where everything was problem solving, four years, etc., and then through in three years, that there were gaps and the gaps were related to the medical knowledge of the presentations.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  We have often spoken about how psychiatry is a specialised service, so who is providing that service at primary care level?  That is the first question.  The witnesses have proposed many simple proposals to the HSE, I presume, and have come up with some very simple answers.  Why will the HSE not take up these simple proposals from the people who know what they are talking about?  That is the second question.  I only need brief answers to these questions.  Why is it that some applicants cannot be taken on?  What is preventing some applicants being taken on?  How many graduate every year from the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland?  The witnesses said only 50% of them stay in Ireland but I would like to have the exact number.</p> <p>  I refer to recruitment.  We heard from previous witnesses that there is a panel of people.  The witnesses mentioned the HSE but the previous witnesses did not mention it.  They mentioned some other panel that is responsible for the recruitment.  It is done at national level.  Someone may want to go to Donegal but they are here hanging around in Dublin before they get there.  What is the problem there?  Why is it  like that and what can be done about that?</p> <p>  I thank Deputies Carey and Buckley for giving me the time to ask those questions.  I would be grateful if those questions were answered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.297" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rois&iacute;n Plunkett" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#P00600"><p>A couple of the questions require short answers and one of them requires a slight clarification.  I refer to the question about how many people graduate from the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and linking it to 50% of those people leaving the country.  Those are fundamentally different colleges we are talking about.  Some 50% of medical graduates leave the country after graduating from university.  The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland is a specialist training body like the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland or the Irish College of General Practitioners, so once one has qualified as a doctor and has done one's intern year, one is a registered medical practitioner.  One can then go into a specialism, either directly or after some years practising.  Dr. Kennedy might be best placed to answer how many people actually graduate.  One has to do one's basic specialist training, BST, and the examination in order to proceed on to higher specialist training, HST, and then through.</p></speech>

On the issue of doctors from countries such as India, it is a matter for the Department of Health and the Oireachtas to change the Medical Practitioners Act.  We had been told it was dependent on a large Bill to put through certain factors to do with the Medical Practitioners Act and that we had to wait for that, but we have been told that for a few years now.  Then two weeks ago, all of us on the medical register got an email saying the Medical Practitioners Act had been amended to say that we had to have indemnity for our practices.  That made me wonder.  There was already an ethical guide that we had to follow.  I do not know why it needed to be put in law, but we need a provision in law so that we can take more doctors in.  Many members will know doctors from India and other countries who are consultants or general practitioners, and many in psychiatry.  Their successors can no longer come here to be trainees.  Funnily, they can be on the general register, so they can come here and practise without any supervision or any education but they cannot become consultants and they cannot enter our training schemes.  The delay is with the Department of Health which is saying it wants bring a larger Bill to the Oireachtas.  However, we would say if it can bring one forward on insurance, surely it can do so on this issue.  I put that to the Minister last week.</p></speech>

One goes to see a specialist when one has specialist needs.  At a primary care level, one goes to see one's general practitioner who should have access to other inputs at a primary care level that are appropriate to one's needs.  That especially includes talking therapies.  The general practitioner, GP, can prescribe medications if he or she thinks it is appropriate.  There is a national counselling service which is supported by the State but I hear from my GP colleagues, and the committee has probably heard from the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, that this was very good when done at a pilot level in the north east but has not become as accessible when rolled out across the country.  That is an issue.  I am not sure if that answers the question.  Primary care should be the same for people who have diabetes and respiratory problems.  If one is at a certain level, one gets inputs from primary care but it needs access to the different inputs it would like to give people.</p></speech>

Many children and adults probably do not need psychiatrists, so there should be something at primary care level that filters all of this.</p></speech>

There are people on waiting lists who should be dealt with by school psychologists.  They probably have some form of reading problem or mathematical problem.  They may have an intellectual disability of a mild level.  They may have a variant of autism.  What they need is an assessment and then to get the proper supports and that is not psychiatry.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, two things happen.  They go on waiting lists to see psychiatry in order to get these assessments but they are left on the waiting lists.  They are also increasing the length of the waiting lists but the other problem is that if a child who has an intellectual disability or educational support needs is put in a mainstream class and an assessment is not done, the child will eventually develop mental health problems, as any of us would if we were in an inappropriate place without the supports.  Then the child will need to be seen by a psychiatrist but that should not be happening.  That is at educational and other levels.</p></speech>

I will go through it as fast as I can.  The presentation mentions the college requesting a 10% increase on the entrance for the BST in psychiatry and the HSE said it will only be a 5% increase.  Why is that?  That is the first question.  There is a shortage of everything here but it is saying to keep that shortage.  I will explain why I am looking at that.</p><p>That is the first one.<br/><br/>I very much welcome that the page on solutions in the submission refers to ensuring &quot;access to assessment and intervention with an appropriate menu of interventions available to people with mental illness based on need, not geography or ability to pay&quot;.  That is also contained in the Sl&aacute;intecare report that we hope to drive on also.  It might be a little thing but it is progressive.<br/><br/>The submission also stated:</p><blockquote>barriers to training posts in psychiatry could be lifted.  The college has poured significant resources into promoting psychiatry as a speciality... we are told that there is a limit to the number of trainee doctors we can appoint.  This is despite the fact that there remain significant vacancies...</blockquote><p>Who advised the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland of that and why is it the case?  I cannot understand it.  The multidisciplinary teams always seem to need to be specialist or consultant-led.  Can we not think outside the box?  In the Portuguese model nurses are allowed to prescribe medicine because they got an opportunity for promotion up through the grades.<br/><br/>The one thing that really grieves me is the lack of common sense on recruitment when it comes to retirements etc.  Who makes the rules meaning that we have to wait for the individual to retire?  Do the witnesses feel they are being held back on that section?<br/><br/>The specialist groups of faculties include medical psychotherapy.  Interestingly I got an email today from an individual who is trying to get an internship and wants to work in CAMHS, work with adults and work as part of a psychiatric care team.  However, the reply from the HSE is that it is not recognised at the moment.  Therefore the individual cannot even get a chance to progress.  They are more or less forced to go to England or somewhere else to get that training.  I cannot understand why that is.  If it is part of the curriculum and part of what we have to do, it runs contrary to everything to have people who want to work in the system but are being told they will not be able to qualify in this country.  I think that is absolutely ludicrous.</p></speech>

The Deputy talked about the IHCA making appointments; that is done within the HSE by a committee and the NDTP is part of that system.  In my six years in the college, we have regularly had constructive arguments with the NDTP about the number.  Perhaps they were not so constructive, as I have said.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Health, he helped us out one year in asking the HSE to extend the number of trainees we could have.  It is a constant issue for us.  Why is that so?  I could say that I do not think psychiatry is taken as seriously as some other specialties in medicine but I have no evidence for that.  It is just the feedback we feel we get.  We will keep campaigning on that.  As the Deputy will know from the document we put together, we need many more trainees.</p> <p>  The block with regard to the Medical Practitioners Act was snuck in as part of an amendment to the Act a few years ago and it needs to be taken out again in order that we can get more people from abroad who want to train here and allow them to train.  Obviously somebody in a training post, rather than in a non-training post is better supervised and is a better doctor for the public.  The international evidence is that departments containing trainees produce better outcomes for patients.  That is why we need the Department of Health to propose a change in the Oireachtas to free that up.  The limits are set by the NDTP and we keep battling away.  Any support members of the committee can give would be very welcome.</p></speech>

It is really important that it would be, in the same way that an oncology service needs an oncologist at its head.  That is not to say that there is not an opportunity to develop nursing roles further.  Specialist nurses form a very useful part of an overall team.  It ties in to what the Chairman was talking about earlier.  The development of primary care mental health services would be welcome.  It would lead to more access to other helpful supports at primary care level for people with mental health difficulties who have not met the threshold for mental illness.  When a person meets the threshold for mental illness it is important that they have access to a specialist psychiatry service in secondary care, which is consultant led and multidisciplinary.  It only needs to be for a brief period of care while they are acutely mentally ill and then they can go back to good supportive primary care mental health services in the same way that people with other illnesses go from primary care to secondary care and back.  That is the vision we have.</p></speech>

We have surveyed our members in the past year about their role and what they are doing.  We say, "rebranding the shrink is to think outside the square."  Many of our consultants want to work in teams with that flexibility.  We are happy to get nurses trained up with some medication prescribing or some psychological therapies.  We want the leadership there.  Sometimes our members feel a little disconnected from management in how that change can be effected.  Modern consultants want to work within teams and bring our experience to bear in that way.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the psychological therapies.  While we want primary care to do that, I also find in my practice that someone is referred to me who perhaps should have been referred much earlier.  It can be a real shock to see people with that kind of illness.  We have the ability to work with primary care to provide assessments.  There is not an inopportune assessment actually, but we need to be able to have a quick discharge back to the relevant care.  Psychologically there are therapies that are very helpful, as the Deputy will know from previous discussions, which have an evidence basis.  Some others are just a waste of time; a good friend could do the same thing.  A community pulling together after a trauma is much more powerful than a specific psychotherapy in the early stages of trauma.</p> <p>  It is about the evidence-based treatments that we have between primary care and us.  It is not always that talking therapies will do the job because they will have side effects if they are not recognising what is needed or indeed if another resource like a community or a housing resource is what the person needs for his or her distress.</p> <p>  The college would be very open to agreeing that the consultant does not have to do everything.  We do not want to be photocopying, as well as providing psychotherapy, but we want to be able to assess, liaise and lead, based on the evidence.</p></speech>

There is another HSE committee, the CAAC.  I do not know what it stands for but it is the consultant appointment committee.  It is an important committee.  It needs to look at whether a job is needed and what the job description should include.  It goes across medicine and is not just in psychiatry.  As I illustrated with an example earlier, when my colleague retired I was asked by one of my senior colleagues to draw up the job description with him.  However, that was two months after she had retired.  I fully support having committees that oversee things to ensure we are not wasting money or appointing the wrong type of consultant.  However, surely that could happen a few years down the line, as Deputy Brassil suggested earlier.  It is not about saying that we have too many committees; we probably do not have that many.  However, there are hold-ups in the system that we should eliminate by starting earlier or else seeing if they can be freed up in some other way.</p></speech>

In particular I welcome my fellow Clare man, Dr. Hillery.  Many of the issues I wanted to raise have been raised and answered.</p><p>Perhaps we could get more information about the individuals within the system, an issue raised by the Chairman.  Could we get a breakdown of the figures in terms of positions available?  If those positions were filled would there still be a shortfall?  Reference was made in the presentation to leave, such as sick leave, maternity leave, paternity leave and so forth.  Can the witness quantify what type of impact that is having?  There was also a reference to modern medical graduates looking for a fair salary.  Dr. Plunkett said it is not just a salary but that other factors come into play.  Can the witnesses give a figure for what they would quantify as a fair salary?</p><p> I note the issues raised regarding the Medical Practitioners Act.  That must be addressed.  The committee should examine that and advocate for change in that area.  Points were also made about the recruitment process.  It must be fit for purpose and it certainly is not at present.  It must be done in advance to plan for matters such as retirements.  I agree with Deputy Brassil's point that it should be done 12 months in advance.</p><p> I commend the witnesses on the positive and constructive proposals they made in the presentation and on their engagement with the committee.</p></speech>

The impact of leave has been such as to close down services.  Last summer I was contacted by a very specialist service in the south of the country.  There was one consultant who was taking parental leave so she was told by the HSE that the service would close because there was no leadership for the multidisciplinary team.  There should be more than one consultant in order that one of them can be off for whatever reason.  The impact can be that bad or else it can slow things down and increase the bottleneck in the waiting list.  Whatever one's training, all the colleagues I have worked with, be they nurses, social workers or psychologists, want the cover of a consultant because of the various approaches taken by the courts in Ireland.  As responsibilities are usually pointed towards the consultant, there must be a consultant involved from the point of view of carrying the responsibility.  Even if the person is only off for a week or two it can slow down movement through the waiting list.</p> <p>  It is hard for me to say what is a fair salary given that I am at the other end of my career.  I do not know if I should ask Dr. Plunkett to respond or whether she will be slaughtered by her colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rois&iacute;n Plunkett" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#R00300"><p>It might be useful to explain.  A consultant contract was introduced in 2008, which had a very attractive salary.  That was the carrot, as it were, for the fact that there was a stick with many other less attractive changes, such as the retirement age moving from 55 years to 65 years and limitations to the types of practice people could do.  That contract was a huge change and the promised salary was higher.  When Senator James Reilly was Minister for Health he unilaterally cut the new entrant consultant salary by 38%, which was, in fact, less of a reduction of cost for the HSE than there would have been by reducing everybody's salary within the HSE by 1%.  Obviously, it was a move that was easy to make because, in theory, one is going from large figures to slightly smaller, but still large, figures.  However, it was not a very wise decision.  When one comes to the end of long training and goes into a job with a huge amount of responsibility one would expect a salary to be commensurate with that of a highly trained business person or a highly trained doctor in another service.  The salary having been cut so drastically, understandably in the midst of huge economic hardship at the time, has never been properly redressed.  The MacCraith recruitment and retention process has come out of trying to mend some of the difficulties with recruitment and retention.  Acknowledging that it is not just about money is very important but, at the same time, if one is in a job where somebody else is earning 38% more that is difficult to swallow.  It is same as the position for the new entrant police or firefighters.  It is just not fair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miriam Kennedy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#R00400"><p>We are not in industrial relations, IR, but there has been feedback from colleagues and people who have emigrated.  They have said that when it went to the new &euro;105,000 and &euro;111,000 rate, which people said is grade eight or principal officer, they actually left the country.  They were very keen on research and service development but said it was from the point of view of mortgages, loans, moving their family around and the worry.  Somebody else mentioned a salary of &euro;185,000.  I have many colleagues who have said that somewhere between the two is good, as long as it is equal across the board.  It is the disparity for some of our colleagues.  We used to have a session for research time or supervision time and we used to be able to get cover to keep up our CPD and to go to two-day or four-day conferences during the year.  We are not covered for that now.  There are all of those shifts within the system.  It is always hard to say but certainly in the case of psychiatry, where most people are in public jobs, even those who are in private practice, we do not have the same drive from the salary point of view, although I might be shot by colleagues for saying that.  If it is a good commensurate salary that is fine.  There is not a huge amount of private practice, nor is that the driver.  Our feedback from people, when asked why they stayed in it, is that the driver seems to be that people say it still floats their boat even though it is difficult.  We care.</p> <p>  I will respond to Senator Devine because she mentioned something very important, which is trans-institutionalisation.  Having worked in forensic psychiatry as well, not all the beds will be filled by the new ones.  It probably comes back to what makes us psychiatrists.  I have never met a psychiatrist who does not love a person with schizophrenia.  It is just that one understands what it is to be different and to experience the way they experience life and the difficulty.  There is real trans-institutionalisation.  What would float our boat is to be able to have step-down, rehabilitation and so forth within the system, and to bring them back.  It is not just the medium secure but also people who have been devastated by the effects of illness early in their lives.  The college is hugely committed to the issue of what we can do to make those links and provide those services.  Forensic psychiatry will not be the total thing.  It is also to do with not just homelessness but picking them up earlier.  I have worked at a time when there were changes in contract and changes in the public service where suddenly everything was centralised and I could not replace two community psychiatric nurses, CPNs.  I was told that the 40 young men with schizophrenia could come to outpatients.  I said: "They will be sick in six months.  If they cannot get up and get their breakfast, what does it matter to have an appointment there?".  That joined-up thinking is awfully important.  We are very passionate about the quality of life.  What makes us exhausted is if one does not feel one is involved in that type of improvement or one is leaving people out on the street.</p></speech>

My first question relates to doctors practising as consultants who are not specialists in the areas.  How common is that?  Is it acceptable?  Is it becoming normalised in the HSE or is there an attempt to normalise it?  How safe is it?  Is it potentially dangerous?  Is anybody effectively overseeing or accounting for any of these non-specialists practising as consultants?</p> <p>  My other question relates to another restructuring of the HSE.  It appears the implementation of the restructuring will mean there will be nobody at the top table with the term "mental health" in their title.  There will no longer be a director of mental health.  How concerned are the witnesses about that?  We already know mental health is the Cinderella of the HSE but with nobody at the top table any more, will accountability and representation be lost?  On a deeper level, is there a concern that the restructuring relating to the finance side, and I am finding it difficult to get a handle on that at present, will mean accountability for the spend on mental health will be lost?  One of the ways we hold the Government to account is the ability to compare year on year on year and I am concerned that this restructuring will mean we will no longer be able to do that because there is a blurring of the financial side of it.</p></speech>

The committee will remember that in A Vision for Change it was envisioned that there would be a czar for mental health, similar to the approach taken in cancer services which has been very successful.  Cancer services have improved exponentially since this approach was taken, but the same never happened in the mental health service.  However, we did get a national director within the HSE, but we are not sure what will happen now.  We have a very good national director, with whom we have a good relationship, but she is to be given a broader remit.  We do not know what will happen, particularly given the focus on psychiatry.  The people Dr. Kennedy has just mentioned are often left out.  I refer to people with a chronic and enduring mental illness.  We see them as valuable members of society who are able to recover, but they are often left out of the discussions.  That is a worry for us and we are not sure how things will turn out.  We would appreciate public representatives addressing this issue, too, because the czar for psychiatry and mental health was never appointed.  At least, we were given a designated lead and the term was used.  Having it used in a high position in the HSE was really important because perceptions are very important and it has been fruitful.  </p> <p>  We also have concerns about accountability and what will happen to the finances.  Mental health services not seen like cardiology or neurology services.  It is not the case that a certain amount of funding is allocated to psychiatry and a certain amount to primary care services.  As Dr. Plunkett put it more eloquently than I could when we were discussing it earlier, I will ask her to outline the issue again.  We are worried about a further dilution in the new set-up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.324" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rois&iacute;n Plunkett" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018030700002#S00200"><p>It is a fundamental cultural problem.  There is the lack of clarity on the distinction and delineation between primary mental health care and psychiatric services and secondary care services.  Part of the problem is that psychiatry is actually housed within community health care organisations, CHOs.  It is housed within the primary care CHO structure rather than within the acute medical division as such.  There are cultural and historical reasons for this.  In the old asylum culture the asylums provided social, psychiatric and institutional forensic care, with all kinds of function rolled into very messy and difficult arrangements.  Now that this has changed and deinstitutionalisation has happened, there has, unfortunately, not been a delineation between primary and secondary psychiatric and mental health care services.</p> <p>  Primary care services have large resource needs because of the number of users.  In primary care services there are always more people with a lower acuity of illness.  They require resources because there are so many of them.  Within secondary care services there are smaller numbers but higher levels of complexity.  Therefore, these services have different needs which also require resources.  When resources for both are drawn from the same pool, there is a very clear problem.  That is why primary care and secondary care services have different budgets in order that the amount that can be drawn from either is limited and both are ultimately protected.  Without that structure within mental health and psychiatric care services, there is a real risk that nobody would be well served.</p></speech>

We do not actually have numbers, but we worry that it is becoming normalised and not safe.  People are not overseen to the proper level when they are the final decision maker on the provision of treatment.  I have given an example of the concerns I have come across in my daily work.  We must realise part of the problem is the delay in appointing people about whom Deputy Pat Buckley.  Locum posts are not attractive to specialist trainees.  They want consultant posts in which they can do something.  As they cannot do it in a locum post, they will go elsewhere.  This means that people who are not as highly trained occupy the positions.  As they will also move on, there is no service development.  As well as being unsafe for the individual, it is unsafe for the region because a service does not evolve with a leader in place.  One wonders if this is influenced by the consideration that if temporary staff were used, the same pension and leave issues would not arise as in the case of a permanent appointment, but I am sure that is not a factor.  Perhaps the committee might explore this issue with the employers who would be more able to answer the question than we are.  It is a worry.</p> <p>  Dr. Kennedy was our leader on the issue of competence assurance.  She will outline what a specialist is about and what we expect of specialists which is not expected of non-specialists.</p></speech>

Dr. Hillery has noted that people on our specialist register have to keep up with continuing professional development requirements every year.  They must show that they have updated their competencies not just by keeping a log but also by having a work plan.  Many of them also work in peer groups, which is incredibly useful.  They must declare this to the Medical Council.</p> <p>  The reason we cannot refer to numbers is that some people who are passing through are on the general register.  This requires a practitioner to somehow maintain his or her level of competency.  They have to come to us to get into that system.  As such, we do not have the numbers, although the employers would.</p></speech>

Obviously, the weight accorded to salary, job description, work patterns and so on depends on one's point of view.

People are looking for a fair income, but what is most important for them is being able to practise what they set out in life to practise.  That means having the necessary teams around them and access to treatment places such as inpatient beds - such access is becoming rarer and rarer - or day hospitals.  Most importantly, our philosophy is to treat people where they live and work.  To do this, we need staff.  As I said at another meeting earlier this year, we are the boots on the ground part of medicine.  We need recruits, be they doctors, nurses or psychologists. without whom we cannot treat people in their communities.  The other risk is that without them, figures can be used to show that it is cheaper than an inpatient service.  I have to keep saying everywhere I go that in running a proper community service one will not save money, but it will make for better quality outcomes for citizens of the State.</p><p>If we save money, people will suffer.  Perhaps one could save money by locking people up in institutions that are badly run.  To have a proper, modern, mental health service, however, which we all believe should minimise the amount of time people spend in hospital, we need staff.  </p></speech>

Interestingly, something like 40% were interested in doing psychiatry when they entered medical school but that figure dropped significantly, to below 10%, by the time they left.  Some people reflected that it is not necessarily a bad thing.  What is the perception of psychiatry about?  It has led us to think we do not want everybody to be interested in psychiatry because one needs mental agility, passion and love for it and one must withstand exposure to things like suicide.  There are many different things.  If we could get 4% or 8% of medical students we would still be able to attract the people we need, who are leaders.  There are some figures we could send on which indicate there is a drift in this regard.  We do not want the people who come to psychiatry to get burnout.  There is more and more information about burnout and it is recognised as the push in the system.  The mental health of physicians is an issue.  We want to attract 4% or 8% to our training programme and we want to ensure they stay.  I agree thoroughly with the Deputy that the culture within which one works is probably the biggest factor in deciding whether one will function well and whether one will burn out and still smoulder on.  We can send on those figures if the Deputy is interested.</p></speech>

If the committee is getting the NDTP in to talk, it will talk about the MacCraith report.  When it was being looked at, it was clear that one of the points at which people were being lost was after basic specialist training, BST, and before higher specialist training, HST.  The reason for that was there was a bottleneck because more people were recruited into basic specialist training than into higher specialist training.  The response to that by the HSE's NDTP was to try to make it less of a pyramidal structure and more of a funnel structure, so there would be the same number recruited at BST as at HST, and therefore graduating out as consultants.  In theory, I understand why that would be the response to stop people leaving but what happens is that people who leave to do a fellowship, have a baby or train abroad and who want to come back are restricted from returning because of the funnel system.  We used to have a pyramid system in which people would train for four years in BST.  They would get their membership and would be partially qualified as specialists.  They would be able to go abroad with marketable skills and there was clear competition to get into higher specialist training.  There was a loss of some people but they could come back in and compete for higher specialist training later.  Now it is much more restricted and getting into higher specialist training is more difficult if one does not run through.  That is as a result of the HSE's NDTP's decision to change it from a pyramidal structure to a funnel structure.  It is something we are trying but it can limit people returning.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Professor Ken McDonald, national clinical lead for the heart failure programme, and Professor R&oacute;n&aacute;n Collins, national clinical lead for the stroke programme.  We are honoured to be here to represent the clinical care programmes.  All of the programme managers and health care professionals are working together to develop different models of care and care pathways to help to improve health care services.</p> <p>  As the population ages, we very much welcome the opportunity to share with the committee the progress made to date and the plans for the future in the older persons programme and chronic disease management under the national clinical and integrated care programmes.  In the course of the opening statement we will update the committee on the three national clinical programmes and cover some information from the integrated care programme for the prevention and management of chronic disease, ICPCD. </p> <p>  The objective of the integrated care programmes is to design an integrated model of care to treat patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to home as possible.  The ICPCD programme focuses on a number of chronic diseases that impact on a large number of patients.  Approximately 1 million people suffer from a variety of chronic illnesses, including dementia, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.  The Irish longitudinal study of ageing reports that 65% of the over 65 age cohort live with comorbidities and multiple illnesses.  The current and projected impact of chronic disease presents a major challenge not just for the health service but also for Irish society and the economy.  We have more people living longer and the numbers with chronic disease and multiple comorbidities will increase.  While it is very welcome that the range of investigations, tests and treatments available is increasing and improving, it comes at a cost.  We must continue to implement change to meet present and future challenges and the projected demand on services in the next decade.</p> <p>  The ICPCD programme aims to provide better care for people with chronic diseases.  This will be achieved by providing for a continuum of preventive, management and support services for patients with these conditions.  It is built on an approach which helps people to understand and care for their own condition, with education playing a key role, in collaboration with their general practitioner and the primary care team.  It includes easy access to diagnostics and specialist supports in the community and close co-ordination with hospital services in order that people can receive the care they need when they need it and in the most appropriate way to meet their circumstances, be it at home, in the community or hospital.  This will require a significant reorientation of service delivery and associated resources and will be challenging, but we believe it is the best and most sustainable approach for the health service. </p> <p>  Through the patient narrative project, patients have clearly articulated their expectations of the health care they wish to receive.  They want person-centred, co-ordinated care services that provide them with the services they need.  They want care based on a full understanding of their lives and their world, combined with the information and support they need.  They want care that respects their choices in building care services around them and those involved in their care.  The proposed model of care for people with chronic diseases honours this and will be co-designed in partnership with patients, clinicians and managers who, together, are the stewards of health care. </p> <p>  Having given the committee a brief overview of the ICPCD programme, I will take members through the work of the national clinical programme for older people.  The population of those aged 65 years and over is projected to increase by between 58% and 63% between 2015 and 2030.  The so-called "older old" population, that is, those aged 80 years and over, is set to rise even more dramatically, as outlined in the recent 2017 ESRI publication entitled, Projections of Demand for Healthcare in Ireland 2015-2030.  As older people have complex health care requirements, the health care system needs to adapt to meet the demands associated with this demographic change.</p><p>For this to truly happen, we need a culture change to drive the shift in how we think and provide care, especially for the ageing populations.  If we get it right for this group of patients, we will get it right for everyone.  In line with the recommendations outlined in the national clinical and integrated care programme for older people, NCPOP, the core principles, otherwise known as the ten-step framework, which we have included in our briefing document will support and drive better outcomes for older people at risk or living with frailty and are being implemented throughout the country.  Examples of achievements are frailty education programmes, with 22 established, with more than 130 trained facilitators and 550 health care professionals trained in the programmes.  Twelve integrated care pilot sites have been developed in the past 18 months and there are numerous other sites throughout the country where local managers, clinicians and health care professional are delivering innovative change, providing evidence that these approaches work.</p><p> Growing up and growing old, something we all hope to do, is not easy.  Prevention is always a challenge in ageing; therefore, emphasis is placed on wellness.  As a result. the NCPOP is collaborating synergistically with other projects to work towards the joint goal of healthy ageing.  A few examples include the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, and how it will inform policy and give us an evidence base to further improve and target resources and innovation; the Healthy Ireland initiatives to promote wellness and maintain independence that speak to the real importance of the public health message; and collaboration with the acute and emergency medicine programmes and the new dementia clinical lead and national dementia strategy in addressing education needs such as frailty education and managing people with dementia and delirium in the community and hospital.</p><p> With regard to future plans, as described in our briefing document, the evolution of the local governance group structure around the theme of "ageing well in the community" will champion the pockets of excellence emerging from the learning in those areas that are redesigning and implementing pathway stages of the specialist geriatric services MOC and the ten-step framework.  The delivery of this type of care needs to be built on.  Every older person should have access to the right care and support, with personalised, co-ordinated care, integrated between services and putting the older person at the centre of the care pathway.  Collaborative working with the integrated care programme for older persons indicates that co-ordinating care for older persons is better, but while some of the costs involved could be met through identifying inefficiencies within the system, there is little doubt that significant investment both in staffing and infrastructure is needed to ensure health and social services will be resourced to effectively manage and respond to the health care needs of the rapidly increasing older population.  The ageing population is testament in part to improved health care in Ireland and to be welcomed, but we need to rise to the challenges it presents.  Care for the older person is everybody&rsquo;s business.  It is imperative that as these new ways of working are designed and developed under the clinical programmes of the RCPI and the HSE that there be continued ongoing support and investment in implementation as we continue to work with local and regional areas.</p><p> I will hand over to my national clinical lead colleague, Professor Ken McDonald, to describe the national clinical programme for heart failure, NCPHF.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ken McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#E00200"><p>I am grateful to the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to provide information on the NCPHF.  I have circulated my opening statement and associated information, on any of which I am happy to take questions.  I will concentrate on the central, important achievements of the NCP and how they relate to other chronic illnesses that we face.  </p> <p>  Heart failure, HF, is generally recognised as one of the most challenging chronic diseases.  It affects upwards of 90,000 people in the State.  A total of 250,000 people are at immediate risk of developing it, with 10,000 new cases every year.  The disease significantly curtails longevity, but of equal importance to those with the disease and their family members is that it curtails quality of life, which is probably best exemplified by the fact that 20,000 hospital admissions every year are directly related to it.  These hospitalisations usually result in a stay of ten or 11 days.  The HF hospital requirement drives the budgetary demand associated with the condition - &euro;700 million annually.  The fact that we are focusing on hospitals underlines what the NCPHF is trying to do.  It is attempting to transfer what has been historically and still is, to a certain extent, a hospital-centred, reactive care process to one that is community-centred, proactive and preventive, involving at its centre the patient and his or her family and a GP-led, well resourced, HF service with unfettered access to specialist opinion and diagnostics outside the footprint of the standard secondary care service as we know it.  That is the umbrella goal of the programme.  In many generic ways, it is similar to that of the NCPs in dealing with many chronic illnesses.</p> <p>  I refer to what has been achieved.  It may seem to be a contradiction that the first achievement I will outline is hospital developments under the NCPHF.  For us to securely provide a community-centred chronic disease management service, we need effective hospital management of heart failure in all our regions.  That was the initial goal of the NCP when it commenced.  Clinical programmes are available in 12 admitting hospitals.  We would like to have them available in all admitting hospitals, but resources are the restraint in that regard.  The programmes that are in operation, however, have been effective in reducing the numbers of readmissions with heart failure and length of stay.</p> <p>  I would like to focus on three developments under the NCPHF in respect of community care.  I would like to conclude on one on which I want to put a great deal of emphasis because it has pertinence throughout the chronic disease environment.  Given that 250,000 people are at immediate risk of developing heart failure, with 10,000 new cases every year, as Dr. O'Shea said, prevention has to be a strong component of a chronic disease programme.  In this country we are fortunate to have developed the first internationally proven preventive strategy in one of our units.  The HSE NCP has seeded it as a pilot study in one region.  The NCPHF not only prevents heart failure but it also prevents other cardiovascular admissions to emergency rooms.  If it were rolled out throughout the State tomorrow, it would have a dramatic impact on these admissions, saving up to 100 trolley bays a day, which would be a significant impact.</p> <p>  Moving from prevention to the disease, I mention the demonstrator project which is part of all clinical programmes.  As part of it, we place clinical nurse specialists in the community.  The purpose is for these well trained nurses to be assistants to GPs in the management of chronic disease, freeing up the GPs to focus on the more medically demanding aspects of chronic illness management, in particular, heart failure, and to have someone specialised at nursing level who can deal with the housekeeping but nonetheless important aspects of chronic disease management.  Our experience with the process within the NCPHF has been relatively modest to date.  The programme has been in operation for the past 18 months.  However, according to the preliminary information we have received, it has improved the overall quality of HF cases and GPs are positive about the development.</p> <p>  I will conclude with a strategy that has been pioneered by the NCPHF.  It is an important development, not only in dealing with heart failure but also with cardiovascular disease in general.  It will also have an impact on the wider chronic disease framework.  I refer to the concept of virtual consultation.  It can have an impact on two central problems that we encounter every day in our discussions on health care and the media - waiting lists for outpatient appointments which are increasing and the use of acute medical units and emergency rooms.  Virtual consultation is an online, real time, interactive case discussion between the GP and specialist.  Multiple GPs can be online at any time; therefore, there is a group learning aspect.  The cases usually take five to ten minutes to discuss and six to seven can be dealt with per clinic session.</p><p>Returning to the two metrics I mentioned, what was interesting was the impact on waiting times or referral into the outpatient system and on the acute medical unit, AMU.  In respect of the approximately 400 cases discussed in the pilot area, GPs have informed us that 80% of this would have been referred into the outpatient system, with a similar percentage referred to the emergency room, ER.  This highly innovative way of dealing with heart failure and chronic disease could have a dramatic impact on outpatient waiting times, preserving real outpatient slots as opposed to virtual outpatient slots for people who truly need them.  The ancillary benefits of this are self-evident.  First, the patient no longer has to travel.  The patient must always be at the centre of all we do.  Travelling for a patient invariably in heart failure and also having other chronic illness or an elderly individual with multiple diseases is never easy and it often involves taking a family member out of work.  The second benefit is group learning.  </p><p> That is an overview of our achievements to date.  As clinical lead, I would like to see us focus into the future on all four of those strategies and to continue their development, namely, development of the hospital programmes, the STOP-HF prevention strategy, the demonstrated project and, in particular, virtual consultation.  I am happy to take questions on any issues.</p></speech>

It is probably no accident that Professor McDonald, Dr. O'Shea and I are here because there is a common theme running through the topics being discussed this morning and a big challenge ahead of us in terms of our ageing demography and the cardiovascular disease that will be associated with it.<br/><br/>In Ireland, stroke is the third leading cause of death, the leading cause of neurological-acquired disability in adult life and one of the overall causes of adult acquired disability.  The Stroke Alliance for Europe, SAFE, has estimated that in light of our demography if we do not change the curve of incidence, we probably will experience a 58% increase in stroke numbers over the next ten to 15 years, which will represent a massive challenge for us.  We have come through a very tough period economically but it is important to acknowledge the considerable achievements to date in stroke.  I have been working in stroke since I was a young doctor in 1995 and I have seen tremendous changes both here and in the UK.  I returned to Ireland from the UK in 2005.  In 2008, we had only one stroke unit in this country.  Currently, 85% of our acute hospitals have acute stroke units, which is the foundation of all stroke care.  In 2008 less than 1% of our patients were receiving emergency clot-busting treatment whereas now almost 12% are receiving it.  While this is in line with UK and European norms we could do better.  In addition, there has been recent technological advancements in the area of retrieving clots.  For example, the majority of strokes are caused by a blockage, similar to a blockage in a pipe.  The two analogies to clearing that blocked pipe are clot-busting - pouring Domestos down the sink - and Dyno-Rod.  Dyno-Rod in this case is thrombectomy, which is a new technology available to us that is showing massive promise.  It is now the single most important treatment for stroke.  This service has been developed in Ireland over the past three years with very few extra resources.  <br/><br/>All of these changes have had a huge impact in our country.  We have reduced mortality from stroke from approximately 19% in 2008 to 12%.  This has come without an increase in disability, in that the discharge destination to nursing home for stroke has remained constant at around 15%.  More people are surviving stroke, and are doing so in an independent state that allows them to go home.  We should acknowledge that tremendous work is being done by the stroke programme and my predecessors but, more important, by a committed multidisciplinary team involved in stroke across the spectrum throughout the country.  In regard to mechanical retrieval, our stroke strategy was to develop a two-centre approach initially, one of which is currently working 24-7 at Beaumont Hospital and the other in Cork University Hospital, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, with plans to operate this centre on a 24-7 basis from the start of the third quarter.  This will also cover the southern area.<br/><br/><i></i>With regard to rehabilitation services,<i></i>recovery after stroke takes time, requires skilled multidisciplinary team working and appropriate staffing ratios for critically ill patients with significant physical and psychological difficulties.  Rehabilitation is obviously a no-brainer in terms of reducing length of stay in hospital beds but, more important, it is a patient-centred model of rehabilitation and it is often better psychologically for patients to rehabilitate at home.  The national stroke programme has introduced three early supported discharge teams, which have been operating for the last two years in the north and south of Dublin city and in Galway.  We are happy to announce that this year, we have funded early supported discharge teams in Cork and Limerick, with plans to further extend this service.  <br/><br/>In terms of cure and prevention, it is disappointing that the number of people attending emergency departments within an ideal timeframe remains low.  At least 60% of patients who have a stroke do not present at our emergency departments in an ideal timeframe.  When it comes to acute stroke treatment, time is of the essence.  The brain does not survive for very long without its oxygen supply.  I am sure the committee is familiar with the FAST campaign.  We would like to see it reintroduced.  We have strong evidence from this country alone that when the FAST campaign was running, there was a significant increase in the number of people presenting within a much shorter timeframe after onset of symptoms.  The numbers now presenting have relapsed to pre-advertisement era, particularly in areas of lower socioeconomic resources.  This is a concern for those involved in the stroke programme.<br/><br/><b></b>On future plans, the national stroke programme has a number of immediate challenges to meet.  We believe that no acute stroke patient should be treated outside of an acute stroke unit.  We still have a number of challenges in setting up acute stroke units in one or two hospitals.  Stroke unit care reduces death and disability from stroke by 25%.  It is the foundation of care that applies to all stroke patients.  We must have stroke unit care for our stroke patients or, at least, bypass procedures if it is not possible to have an acute stroke unit in a hospital.  As for the time to treatment, it is not all about simply presenting to the hospital.  There is an onus on us to improve our assessment and door-to-treatment times.  Our median times for door to needle or door to injection of clot-busting treatment have not been historically good but they are improving.  While the median time in this regard in 2013 was approximately three hours it is now down to one hour and 40 minutes.  Together with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, we have introduced a quality improvement initiative for all stroke teams throughout the country to try to improve the processes and to ensure local improvement in door to injection times. <br/><br/>With regard to rehabilitation, in particular for patients under 65 with stroke, services have been historically poor due to under-investment and an age cut-off to protect the over-subscribed services within geriatric medicine.  The national stroke programme advocates an all-age approach to the funding of stroke rehabilitation and will be working with colleagues in the national programme for rehabilitation to explore areas of commonality and to ensure that our intersecting Venn diagram also meets the needs of younger people with stroke.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, Professor McDonald, Dr. O'Shea and I are here today because there is a common theme in the topic being discussed today.  Approximately 40% of the patients who have stroke also have underlying heart disease and the majority of them are older.  The national stroke programme has looked at how funding can be obtained for the stroke programme going forward and we reached the conclusion that we need a more organised strategy.  We have decided to produce what will be a realistic five-year model for stroke in terms of treatment.  We realise that this needs to be broken down into four areas, namely, acute care and cure, restoration, life after stroke and, most important as we move on in time, to change the demographic prediction from the Stroke Alliance for Europe.  We need more investment in prevention and in primary care to prevent stroke.</p><p>We also need to have some investment in research and education.  The stroke programme has organised four specialty focus groups led by individual chairmen in these areas who have been tasked with producing what is a realistically achievable strategy within five years - not everything we would ideally want - that will have the most impact in the four areas of acute care and cure, restoration to living, prevention, and research and education.  We will cost the strategy and we hope to be in a position to deliver it to the health service commissioners and to Members of the Oireachtas later this year.</p><p> After the presentations I will be very happy to take any questions on stroke that members may have, but now I shall hand over to our chairman Dr. O'Shea.</p></speech>

Emphasis is on prevention of illness where it is possible.  Initiatives that focus on total wellness, such as Healthy Ireland and Making Every Contact Count, are being promoted.  In the case of an illness - and Professor McDonald and Dr. Collins have alluded to examples in stroke and heart failure - provision of the right care at the right time by the right person at the most appropriate location in our community is our focus and a common aim.  Where a patient is chronically ill, self-management education and support is important.  Many people with chronic diseases can manage their condition at home, as Professor McDonald has said, with support from their GPs and primary and community care services and the HSE continues to work towards ensuring these supports are available.  A common themes for us all is that given the changing landscape of ageing in Ireland over the next decade, it is important that we have an age attuned and age accommodating society and clearly co-ordinated pathway-driven health and social care services for older people.</p> <p>  The clinical and integrated care programmes show how true collaboration happens when patients, carers, health care professionals and managers from across the care spectrum bring to bear their knowledge, skills and experiences to resolve persistent challenges and tackle common problems together.  The benefits of reducing the incidence and impact of chronic diseases are nationally significant, societally and economically as well as individually and personally.  They extend far beyond the impact on the health of individuals to our children&rsquo;s future, the well-being of the communities in which we live and the economic prosperity of our society.  This increasing focus on people with chronic disease and the health and social care needs of older people can only be achieved if we all work together politically, medically and clinically with the health care professionals and with people in society.</p> <p>  This concludes the opening statement.  Dr. Collins, Professor McDonald and I will endeavour to answer any questions members of the committee may have.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

The witnesses have clearly set out the need for change and for further education on a lot of issues and they also referred to trying to get change in the HSE service.  A big complaint I hear from practitioners is that when they can clearly see the need to approach a problem in a different way and they try to effect change, there is resistance to getting the change.  Practitioners complain to me that when they come up with a comprehensive plan for a change, they encounter resistance.  I am referring to both people who work in the community health care sector and those who work in hospital services.  The witnesses have given us the figures for the demographics but have targets been set for trying to achieve the change required in each area?  Within the HSE's different regional health divisions, is change happening more in some areas than in others and are clear targets set in each area?</p> <p>  I also wish to raise an issue regarding people who working in the community - and I have raised this previously in the health committee - and the numbers of nurses working within the community.  Over the past three years the numbers of public health nurses have gone up from 1,460 to 1,540.  This is an increase of 80 nurses in real terms.  Do the witnesses believe there should be an increase in this area and is there a need for targets to be set around people working out in the community and working with people, rather than patients having to come in to the hospital service?  Over the same three-year period there has been a huge increase of 17% in the number of people in administration and management.  I raise this issue in the context of priorities within the HSE.  On the one hand there is resistance to change and on the other, we do not appear to be recruiting staff in the areas where we really need people - and especially in the types of services the witnesses want to provide.</p> <p>  A GP told me recently that there are only about two consultants in the area in which he works - it is not the Cork area - that he can actually telephone to discuss patient care.  He spoke of the disconnect between those who work in the hospital system and those working in the community, especially GPs.  The witnesses have given the example of the innovative communication project between GPs and consultants.  How could that level of urgently-required communication be fast-tracked in order that more people can be kept out of the hospital services and in order that those who are working in the community can deliver the service that is required?  The practitioners in the community also need this support.  I believe this is one of the things we need to do but how do we fast-track it to make sure the back-up support is there for those working in the community?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses again for the work they are doing and for the innovative projects they have taken on in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1262" speakername="Margaret Murphy O'Mahony" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#G00700"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee this morning and I thank them for giving up their time.  I am the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on disability and I deal with a lot of people who are post stroke and some of the patients are left with horrific injuries, as Dr. Collins well knows.  Have the witnesses any suggestions on preventative measures?  Could there be a public campaign on healthy living?  An acquired disability is very hard, not only on the person but also on their families.  All of their lives are turned upside down.  In some cases, perhaps with better lifestyle choices, the disabilities could have been prevented.  The witnesses might share their thoughts on that aspect.</p> <p>  I note the HSE has successfully piloted a home-grown heart failure prevention service on the east coast and that there are plans for the midlands also.  I am flying my own parish here but Cork needs more services there.  Will Professor McDonald indicate if there are any plans for that area?  Cork and Kerry seem to be a little bit left behind in this field.  The Irish Heart Foundation advises that diagnosis is often late due to inadequate availability of diagnostic tools.  This appears to be the case in Cork.  Can this be resolved? How would Professor McDonald suggest it can be resolved? </p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and I thank them for their presentations.</p> <p>  The ESRI report indicates that over the next number of years, there will be a dramatic change in the demographics, with the consequences in terms of demands on health services, the need for us to change how we provide health care and with regard to planning.  Dr. O'Shea noted we have more people living longer with chronic disease and multiple co-morbidities and while it is good that the range of treatments available is increasing and improving, it also comes at a cost.</p><p>Cost is one matter but we are quite adept at identifying problems early on.  However, we are not as imaginative in coming up with solutions to meet them.  Bearing in mind that it takes a long lead-in time to establish and expand the capacity of training programmes, as well as encouraging people into those various fields due to changing demographics, how advanced are we in assessing the number of professional clinicians we will need in our health services in the years ahead?  Where are we in providing people at consultant level and nurse specialists in community care and geriatrics?  It was stated that the health care system needs to adapt to meet the demands associated with changing demographics.  How do the pathways and integrated care programmes which the witnesses are developing fit in with the recently published Sl&aacute;intecare report?<br/><br/>Professor McDonald stated, &quot;to fundamentally alter the epidemiology of heart failure, HF, the HSE has piloted a home-grown HF prevention service on the east coast&quot;.  Is it preventive in the context of changing lifestyles and habits or identifying it and then addressing it in a clinical setting?  What type of resources will be required to roll this out across the country?<br/><br/>It was stated that, as a result of the virtual clinic intervention, for every 100 cases discussed, there is a reduction in emergency room-acute medical unit referral by 90% and outpatient referral by 80%.  In our deliberations at the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, it was evident there is significant silo thinking in our health services between hospitals, community care and GP services.  GPs told the committee that in some areas, depending on the consultant, the chances of ever being able to talk to that consultant are diminished.  Rather than having the goodwill of individual consultants and GPs having a personal relationship, surely we need to have to a defined system in place where there can be continual contact between GPs, who are specialists in the community, and consultants in the hospitals.  Is it possible to break down those barriers?<br/><br/>Speaking to nurse practitioners and emergency medicine consultants at the coalface, there seems to be a cohort of elderly people who are transferred from nursing homes to hospitals.  If there were a greater number of geriatric community services available, such as specialist nurses able to insert intravenous antibiotics in a nursing home, these older people would not necessarily have to go to hospital.  Another issue, which causes great distress to the individual and the family, is the lack of palliative care available to people in nursing home settings.  Are we transferring elderly people unnecessarily from a nursing home, which is effectively their home, to a busy hospital setting?  Should there be proper community services available in clinical and palliative care.<br/><br/>Professor Collins stated:</p><blockquote>The success of acute treatment of stroke is extremely time dependent.  Over 60% of our stroke patients currently do not present to our emergency departments within an ideal timeframe.</blockquote><p>He referred to the success of the Act FAST television campaign in identifying when someone is having a stroke and getting them to a hospital in a reasonable time.  He also stated, &quot;a third to half of all strokes may be prevented through lifestyle change, management of blood pressure and identification of an irregular heart rhythm, and a nationwide approach to cardiovascular disease prevention&quot;.  There are two types of prevention.  The first is a rapid diagnosis whereby the person gets to hospital quickly which prevents a severe outcome.  There is also prevention where one identifies early on people who are potentially at risk of a stroke.  Will Professor Collins elaborate on this?<br/><br/>Across all the health services, we need to move to a situation where hospitals work beyond the traditional five-day week, eight-to-late model, particularly in the area of diagnostics.  Have the witnesses identified ways whereby we could use our assets and infrastructure in a more efficient manner, bearing in mind that an MRI in a private hospital can be done every hour but not in our public systems.  We do not have that enhanced capacity in our public system because of demarcation lines and industrial relations issues.  Would it make a big difference to the capacity of the health services if we are able to address rostering issues, increase the number of professionals working in the health system and use the assets that are already there effectively in diagnostics and prevention?</p></speech>

Using the older person programme as an example, people have a good understanding of what needs to be done and the demographic changes occurring.  There is a need for support both politically and financially for the implementation of the models of care we have in the older person programme.  It is no accident that the first step in the ten-step framework in the programme is establishing local governance groups.  I have had the privilege of travelling around the country with Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly, our co-lead, looking at all of the integrated care sites, hospital sites, the community sites, the integrated care programme and frailty education programme.  I see the enthusiasm, drive and desire of people at the coalface to deliver this integrated care.  The governance group gives a unity between the CHO and the hospitals to pull that together.</p><p>If we use the knowledge and experience gained from the pilot integrated care sites, of which there are 12, and the frailty education programme sites, this will empower people with knowledge and understanding to effect change from the ground up.</p><p> We need leadership and direction from the HSE and the colleges in respect of the clinical programmes and unifying people.  From a public health message point of view and from a multidisciplinary and professional perspective, education is one of the key enablers in all of this.  It is important, it is not threatening and everybody is willing to sit around a table and talk about those things.  It has a wonderful way of breaking down barriers between different groups.  Having pilot sites and other sites across the country develops new ways of working within teams and groups.  That helps improve flow throughout the system, which is one of the challenges for us all.</p><p> We hear regularly about trolley numbers.  They always a concern and a worry.  When I go down into the emergency department on a post-call round, it is devastating to find that a person has been there for longer than he or she should be.  However, it is not actually an emergency department issue.  It is an issue around getting good control of community services, good access to community care and good programmes around the country.  Deputies have mentioned some such programmes in terms of good input to outreach programmes and co-operation and co-ordination with general practitioners.</p><p> Older people are big users of health care.  If someone over 80 or 85 attends hospital, he or she has a 50% chance of requiring admission.  It is not that they do not need the admission; they do need it.  What we need is co-ordinated pathways of care that get older people through their acute illness quickly and get them out of hospital, back home or back to the nursing home quickly.  Professor Collins mentioned the success of the stroke unit.  We know about the success of the cancer care programme and how well people do in coronary care units.  The same is true of older people in specialist wards.  They are more likely to go home and to do so more quickly.  They are less likely to need to go into a nursing home.  We have a lot of initiatives in this regard; there are a couple in Kilkenny and some happening in County Cork, in Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's area, where we are demonstrating that taking a targeted approach to patients leads them to spend less time in hospital.  If exposed to interdisciplinary service and the allied health professional team early in the course of an illness, a person is less likely to functionally decline and more likely to go home more quickly.</p><p> Senator Colm Burke asked about the need for change and the drivers relating to that.  It is a question of having clear plans and models of care from the HSE and from the programme.  After that it is the ground-swell of people working together to provide that care.  That leads on to the Senator's second point, which is the staffing question.  There is a lot of work being done around workforce planning.  We talk about the importance of new ways of working.  Through both the HSE and the national doctoral training programme in the Royal College of Physicians, in 2014 there was a clear look at workforce planning.  However, the workforce has changed and so has that sort of medical workforce planning.  Work practice has even changed in the past two or three years for me as a consultant.  My clinical job today is different from what it was three or four years ago.</p><p> We recently saw the Department of Health create 120 new advanced nurse practitioner roles.  They are not new in the sense that we have had advanced nurse practitioners in stroke care for a number of years.  While we have had an advanced nurse practitioner dimension, these posts are clinical advanced nurse practitioners.  In the first tranche, 43 of them were appointed in older persons care.  They are going to become an incredibly important group over the next number of years as they evolve, providing co-ordinated care and crossing the boundaries between hospital and community.</p><p> Our challenge in staffing is comparable to capacity.  I certainly welcome the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which we will talk about later in response to some of the other questions.  It clearly identified issues around capacity, funding and more integrated work practices.  All of the models we are talking about very much fit with that.  Going back to the 1980s and 1990s, bed capacity was taken out at that time.  According to OECD figures, for 2015 we had 3.3 beds per 1,000 of the population.  The figure is approximately 4.5 beds in other countries.  We are not just investing for the now but are playing catch-up from underinvestment in the past.  When money goes into the services now, we do not see the added value from all of it because it is playing catch-up.  That is a problem for us.  I welcome much of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I welcome the focus on the fact that, while capacity expansion is needed, there is also a consequent need to employ additional health care professionals to provide for those beds.  I welcome that it clearly states that there will need to be a &euro;2.8 billion increase in funding by the end of the ten-year programme.</p><p> Although there are big challenges for us, I am proud when I look at the group of people who are working together, directed from the HSE's clinical strategy and programmes division, and when I see how the different clinical programmes are evolving.  Of most critical importance, however, are those on the front line and how they are providing care.  We only need to think back to last week and the efforts that health care workers made to keep things on the road both from a transport point of view, getting people in and out of work, and people being at work and staying there, to understand how committed people are to the work we are doing, in spite of the challenges.</p><p> Senator Colm Burke asked a specific question about two consultants, virtual clinics and staffing.  Professor McDonald might be better positioned to respond to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ken McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#J00200"><p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for his questions.  Before getting onto the virtual consultation issue, I would like to add a couple of thoughts on the need to change.  As the Senator pointed out, is critical that any of these programmes contain measures that we can examine to see whether they are being effective.  This is the State's money we are spending so we need to be able to match it up against key performance indicators and all of the programmes provide that data.  For example, we know length of stay in cases heart failure has reduced since the development of heart failure care programmes and that saves bed days.  Reporting these improvements back to the people involved in these change processes encourages them to continue with the process.  Even though we have gone through a very difficult time economically, if we continue to show that the process is bringing improvement, albeit sometimes at quite a slow pace, it still acts as an encouragement.</p> <p>  The Senator's second question was about staffing.  He mentioned nurse involvement in chronic disease management.  For my area, heart failure, it is a very important development.  The national clinical programmes are very conscious of the role that people in allied health care can play in the management of chronic disease.  However, we also need to protect the nurse so that he or she is not out on his or her own.  I always see the nurse role in the community as being under the guidance of the general practitioner, to try to co-ordinate the overall care of the patient.</p> <p>  When we are talking about allied health care, one group that we have not yet mentioned today that is also an underused resource in the community is that comprising pharmacists.  They have a very strong role to play in chronic disease management when one considers an issue such as adherence to medical therapy, such a bugbear for us in the system.</p> <p>  Coming back to virtual consultation, this crosses a couple of the questions from Senator Colm Burke and Deputy Kelleher.  On the value of virtual consultation, I think it breaks down this divide that we have between the consultant led specialist services and the general practitioner led community services.  That is a real Achilles heel for us at present.  Virtual consultation is a very strong way of breaking down this divide because it removes the reliance on the goodwill of a couple of GPs who might know a couple of consultants, as Deputy Kelleher said, for them to interact on a specific case.  It formalises the process in the same way as happened with our outpatient clinics in hospital and our formal clinics.  Virtual consultation needs to develop and, to use Senator Colm Burke's term, it needs to be fast-tracked to provide an alternative mode of interaction between primary and secondary care.  Even if its impact is not as dramatic as the first 400 cases would indicate from the pilot projects to date, and if outpatient referral is reduced by 50% rather than by 80%, that would still be a dramatic impact.</p><p>We need to take a strong look at this process, and not only cultivate it in heart failure as much of what we are talking about is generic across chronic disease.  We need to look at developing it as a strategy for chronic illness and to learn from the experience.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#K00200"><p>There is a breadth of interesting and insightful questions.  Returning to Senator Burke's question on the culture of change, I very much agree with Dr. O'Shea.  My experience, having followed the leader and now being the lead, is that I have not seen barriers or resistance to change in the health service once clinical leadership and direction is given, and there is involvement, particularly among the multidisciplinary team and the stakeholders, and where a cogent argument is made.  While there is a pervasive sense of doom and gloom and we have come through a difficult period in Ireland, for a small country with very limited resources, together we have achieved quite a bit.  Most of that has come by pulling together and enacting change rather than as a result of receiving huge resources.  I replied to Senator Burke about the fractured relationship between general practice and the hospital system.  Speaking personally, not on behalf of the HSE, I have never seen such a fractured relationship between the two.  There is a real onus on fixing general practice, which will remain broken without investment and a new contract.  Fundamentally, that needs to happen because our whole health service is built on what happens in primary care.  If that is wrong, the rest of the system will be wrong.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked specifically about stroke prevention.  He is correct.  There is an acute aspect.  When a patient arrives in hospital there is a question of whether we can prevent disability but neither Deputy Kelleher nor myself wants to be on a table sweating it out, wondering if a treatment will work or not when facing the prospect of being paralysed down one side of the body and being unable to talk.  We would by far prefer not to have been in that situation in the first place.  Personally, as current lead but also on behalf of the clinical advisory group in the national stroke programme, we are wholly committed to seeking increased investment for prevention.  It is the third leading cause of death in this country and our leading cause of acquired adult disability.  We reckon we could prevent one third to half of all strokes through lifestyle change as Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony alluded to, in areas such as exercise, weight, not smoking, keeping alcohol consumption levels low and even managing blood pressure.  </p> <p>  Getting blood pressure right at 60 or 70 years is important but if we get it right in middle age, such as my own age or that of Deputy Kelleher, we can half a person's risk of stroke.  That is a screening target which needs to be tackled.  The other big target in prevention relates to irregular heart rhythms.  For laymen, irregular heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation, can be completely silent.  A person will feel nothing, but it is analogous to having a cement mixer which is not mixing the cement correctly leading to clumps forming in the cement.  If that clump falls into the pump chamber of the heart, it fired like a bullet from a gun down the pipe until it gets jammed.  It is a very important concept to understand.  Most people in Ireland know nothing about the problem, yet it causes one in three of all major strokes in the country.  Moreover, if one gets a stroke due to this mechanism, one is more likely to be disabled as a consequence and the acute treatments are less likely to work.  That is another screening target for prevention.  Through the national stroke programme, in collaboration with the HSE, we have demonstrated that we can introduce an effective, simple screening tool in primary care which has been through a health technology assessment and has been approved.  However, to return to my remarks at the start, if the primary care end of things is wrong, we cannot do any of this.  It is very much dependent on our getting the situation sorted out in primary care. </p></speech>

To return to Professor McDonald's point about telemedicine virtual consultation, it is something of which I am a huge fan.  I was involved in a telemedicine pilot for strokes back in 2009 and have seen the value in bringing expertise to the table there and in heart failure also.  It is very simple.  Telemedicine does not have to be high-tech, it can be merely a secure screening showing an ECG in practice, and asking others what they think and then establishing a care pathway based on that.  We are currently piloting one in Tallaght.</p> <p>  Returning to the point about nursing homes, there are an increasing number of nursing home admissions in my hospital but the number of nursing homes built in our area has also increased.  One problem I have looked at is how the planning and co-ordination of this does not appear to be thought out.  If I built a brewery in Tallaght, I would probably have to ask the local council if I could use 20% of its water, yet we can build many nursing homes in one area.  It is not unique to Tallaght but we need to refer to how it might impact an acute care area if one introduces a population of people with complex care needs.  I am a geriatrician myself as well as specialising in strokes.  Of course frail older people should not be bussed around unnecessarily into hospitals but there are several factors at play.  First, returning to my opening statement, we need to get primary care resourced again to look after these populations and second, we need effective communications between GPs on the ground, through nurse specialists, geriatricians and the integrated care programmes that Dr. O'Shea spoke about.  This can happen through community teams and also through effective telemedicine consultation.  Nursing homes are an are in which I am very interested.  Often it is not the case that the general practitioner lacks the skill mix to sort this out but they are complex cases that need two sets of eyes, two opinions and reassurance that the treatment and the care pathway are right.  Much can be done to improve how we model our care of our most vulnerable people.  We always look back on history, but in 20 years we might ask if we did a good job for our frailer persons in nursing homes.  Dr. O'Shea referred to this.  There is great hope in integrated care.  We in geriatric medicine are very committed to looking after what is occasionally referred to as the lost tribe, the people who live their life in residential care, and remember that 15% of stroke patients also end up requiring nursing home care.  They need support too.</p> <p> On the Act FAST campaign, there are numerous health advertisements about everything on television, some from private industry and some from our own public health initiatives.  Strokes are our third leading cause of death and our leading cause of acquired adult disability and we have taken off what was probably the most important advertisement explaining what the symptoms of stroke are and most important, what one must do when one sees them, that one does go to hospital as soon as possible.  I would encourage all support for initiatives.  The Irish Heart Foundation has asked for that advertisement to be put back on televisions.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid O'Shea" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#K00500"><p>Some of the issues have been covered in responses to other members' questions.  Before turning to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's specific questions, I will comment on primary care and general practitioners.  There is now a GP primary care lead physician in the national primary care programme in the HSE.  In a very welcome move, the Irish College of General Practitioners is now looking for three GPs to be appointed to the chronic disease programme.  That type of engagement is actively happening.  That is really important.</p> <p>  Dr. Collins referred to nursing homes.  If one looks at international figures, one would expect 33 people per 100 nursing home beds to require hospital care annually.  Their lengths of stay range between eight and 14 days.  Very good work is being done around the country with clinical nurse specialists, but not yet in the case of advanced nurse practitioners.</p><p>I mean clinical nurse specialists working in pilot schemes around the country.  They specifically look at nursing home patients who have been admitted to hospital and conduct follow-up, virtually, by contact with the nursing home when those patients are discharged back to the nursing home.  There are areas around the country that are considering specific nursing home outreach initiatives.  At present there is one in north Dublin and one in south Dublin to name but two.  The initiatives have clearly demonstrated reduced hospital admissions and that is when there is interaction between nursing homes, the multidisciplinary geriatrician team or clinical nurse specialist and the GP.  It is a little like the question around admission avoidance, which is a term that I am uncomfortable with.  One really wants the right person looked after in the right place.  There is no doubt that there are nursing home residents and frail older people who require acute hospital care, and when they come in they need care in a quick, appropriate and targeted way.  Let us consider the huge improvements that have been made in the care administered to a person who has suffered a hip fracture.  In such cases we have focused units that have a dedicated bed in the emergency department, ED.  The person is admitted straight away for X-ray scanning and is then sent straight to the orthopaedic ward for an operation, with clear pathways and performance indicators outlined thus resulting in good outcomes for the patient.  All of the pockets of work have shown that if one has integrated, co-ordinated and focused specialty care - which is what all of the models have shown in terms of specialist wards and specialist multidisciplinary teams who provide focused care with expert nursing care - then patients will be discharged more quickly and are less likely to go into a nursing home.  Clearly, if one came from a nursing home then one will return to the same one.  Equally, with such teams and care one is less likely to functionally decline in hospital.  We must build on these pockets of excellence that are located around the country. </p><p> Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked specific questions about acquired disability after suffering a stroke.  I will begin by reiterating what I said about the value of targeted and co-ordinated models of care on a ward and clear follow-up care in the community.  If one needs rehabilitation that either happens in the acute hospital or in an appropriately staffed rehabilitation bed.  This is where I think language in everything we do is key.  If we mis-designate a bed by calling it a convalescence bed or misuse a bed that is a transitional care bed that gives potential licence to not staff in a correct way the rehabilitation needs required by the patient.  Quite separately from the neuro-rehabilitation report that will be launched, rehabilitation for an older person, whether it happens in a hospital, in one's home or in a rehabilitation bed at an off-site or on-site facility, is about the appropriate minutes of exposure one receives if one is able for rehabilitation.  Dr. Collins will now comment on the stroke perspective before we continue to reply to questions. </p></speech>

The national stroke programme gives a commitment to provide rehabilitation for all ages and phases of the stroke.  I shall reiterate the point made by Dr. O'Shea.  There is some concern about using terminology such as "step-down", "convalescence" and "transitional."  Such terms can imply that fewer resources are required when that may not be the case.  Instead, a person may require a different type of resource and extra manpower in other areas.  Dr. O'Shea was correct to make that point.</p> <p>   In the Cork area, restoration to living is our second pillar of the stroke strategy.  It is not just straightforward rehabilitation.  We want to bring people back to full vocational life and being able to engage in the things that they did before suffering a stroke such as driving, pastimes and recreational activities.  That must be our ambition.  It is a challenge but we will work very closely with our colleagues in the national rehabilitation programme to deliver that vision.     </p></speech>

One of the witnesses said that the present system of care is relatively inefficient, ineffective and is ultimately unsustainable and that integration was a key factor in making the system more efficient and effective.  Please concentrate on the barriers to integration and what are the roadblocks to rolling out an integrated programme.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on general practice but first I wish to declare that I am a GP.  General practice is now akin to a slow puncture because it is gradually fading due to a lack of infrastructural support, resources and a new contract, as mentioned by Dr. Collins.  We hope that the latter will come to fruition this year but the negotiations are painfully slow.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is a very comprehensive document.  It is not perfect and not everybody likes everything in it.  Key to the success of Sl&aacute;intecare is a properly functioning primary care service.  If one does not have a properly functioning primary care service one cannot build on integration and all of the processes that the witnesses have described. </p> <p>  The witnesses have mentioned that a cultural change is needed, and that we have to adapt, of which integration is a part.  Concentrating on the cultural barriers, where do the witnesses feel we are not dealing with demographic changes, an increasing elderly population and an increased general population?  </p> <p>  Integrated management has been mentioned.  We have talked to representatives of the Carlow-Kilkenny team about the development of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  The Carlow-Kilkenny integrated model has been referenced significantly in the report but there are other models of integrated care.  I find it very difficult to communicate with my hospital colleagues.  We are trying to set up an integrated care committee in our region where we can have a dialogue with our consultant colleagues.  I hope that the initiative will come to fruition.  That is a key area to develop integration.</p> <p>  I believe every nursing home should have a designated medical officer.  I mean one person who looks after the overall management of the medical structures in the hospital and implements certain protocols.  Let my explain why.  One may have 30 patients in a nursing home.  There may be ten GPs who visit in order to deliver care to their patients but they are ten different people with ten different ideas so there is no overall structure.  Consequently, when a patient falls ill overnight or at a weekend quite often the default position is to refer him or her to an accident and emergency unit.  If one doctor was in charge who had an overall protocol, although not necessarily looking after all of the patients but implementing a management protocol for various acute illnesses, such an initiative could prevent many patients going to accident and emergency departments.  </p> <p>  Finally, I wish to state that community intervention teams, that include specialist nurse practitioners, are a halfway house between a person being looked after in the community and being looked after in hospital.  Please comment on community intervention teams and barriers to change, in particular.  </p> <p>  I call Senator Dolan and he will be followed by Senator Conway-Walsh.   </p></speech>

My interest in being in the Seanad, and thankfully I manage to do so, was to represent the interests of people with disabilities and chronic illnesses.  This week has been designated Brain Awareness Week, which focuses on the fact that almost 800,000 people suffer from neurological conditions and whatever.  Therefore, this debate is timely.  I recall, and my recollection dates back nearly 20 years, somebody saying that one third of the people who suffered a stroke died, one third of them escaped and one third of them were left with a legacy.  Can the witnesses give me a breakdown of the current statistics?  I think fewer people die from strokes at present so more people will be in the category of being left with a legacy.</p> <p>  Some Members of the Oireachtas had an opportunity the week before last to listen to a presentation made by a man called Mr. Martin Quinn.  He suffered a stroke when he was in his early 50s and he talked about the frustrations he experienced when dealing with the health system, the economic impact of a stroke, the impact it has on family life, etc.</p><p>He mentioned that a stroke nurse had left the local hospital in Clonmel, County Tipperary and not been replaced.  Is there an issue with gaps when a practitioner such as a nurse, doctor or allied health professional leaves a post or goes on maternity leave?  If so, to what extent and what impact does it have?</p><p> On people with disabilities and the question of comorbidity, sadly, many people with Down's syndrome get Alzheimer's disease early.  It is welcome that people with disabilities are living longer, as are those in the general population, but it will lead to issues with comorbidity.  Are more preventive measures needed?  What are the issues in that regard?</p><p> As regards the determinants of prevention in terms of early intervention, what assets that are not included in the health Vote could be of assistance in the taking of hard or soft measures that would affect people's lives?  I do not wish to ask a leading question, but it is great that certain potential problems are not issues in the lives of some people.  They are not clinical issues, but they can be of help or hinder in the outside environment.</p><p> When I was young, I thought having a stroke was almost a rite of passage for grandparents.  I began working with the Irish Wheelchair Association in 1980 and remember that a woman in her early 20s had a stroke.  I could not believe a young person could have a stroke.  The level of awareness is changing in that regard, but to what extent is stroke an issue for young people and what are the implications?  Such persons have many years of life ahead of them and their normal expectations are more or less dashed.</p><p> I thank the delegates for being very strong and clear in their focus on people's lives, that it is not just about patching people up but, rather, their being able to have a life and relationships.  I again thank the delegates and apologise that I had to leave the meeting for a time.</p></speech>

I disagree with nothing they have said.  The models proposed are fantastic and should have been put in place many years ago.  They are the way forward.  The language used by the delegates would lead people to believe everything will be patient-centred and so on.</p> <p>  On treating patients with heart failure, I very much like the idea of having 12 hospital-based acute units.  What is being done in that regard to fill geographical gaps, particularly in counties Cork and Kerry?  Is there an estimate of the funding required to make the service available throughout the country?</p> <p>  How many stroke patients have access to a stroke unit?  The Irish Hospice Fund and Health Service Executive national stroke audit shows that only 29% of such patients are directly admitted to a stroke unit.  The FAST campaign was of great benefit.  Have the delegates sought funding for a new campaign of the same ilk? </p> <p>  In my experience, one of the main problems people encounter after a stroke is the lack of availability of physiotherapy in many areas.  I am aware of people's experiences in that regard in Mayo, the county from which I come.  Patients are discharged from hospital, but thereafter are not provided with physiotherapy and their health deteriorates as a consequence.  Is that a big concern for the delegates?</p> <p>  Another issue relates to timing and the centralisation of services.  As services become more centralised, it will take longer for some people to get to the units or care services they need.  This also applies to patients suffering from heart failure.  Problems are being caused in patients being over an hour away from a hospital and by the relevant infrastructure not being in place.  It is wonderful to have the models referred to by the delegates, but it will be a huge problem if people cannot get to them or do not have access to them.  It could lead to apartheid in access to health services.  Have the models been rural-proofed in their development and the decision-making process?</p> <p>  I must ask about the withdrawal of Versatis because chronic disease is directly linked with chronic pain management.  Approximately 25,000 patients rely on Versatis to control their pain.  Were the delegates consulted about its withdrawal and can they comment on the decision?  Are they concerned about the fact that so many people with chronic disease are trying to manage pain without Versatis?  Are they concerned that patients' relationships with their GPs and consultants were undermined by the decision?  Is it a good use of public money for such senior personnel to review the reviews?</p> <p>  I am very interested in virtual consultations and how they will be rolled out.  When the pilot projects under the primary care programme were set up in ten areas across the country in 2000 or 2001, information technology was to play a huge part in providing access and having a better alignment between hospitals and primary care settings, but that never happened.  I am concerned that although virtual consultation is a wonderful idea and absolutely the way forward, it will not be delivered, similar to how it was dropped from the development of primary care services almost 20 years ago.  I am concerned about the potential impact of the lack of broadband on its delivery, particularly in areas of the west.  Will the roll-out of virtual consultation services be population-led?</p> <p>  I have many concerns about post-stroke patients trying to access rehabilitation units.  A fantastic job is done in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, once patients are admitted.  However, patients are begging for beds in order to access timely post-stroke rehabilitation services, which are of great importance. </p> <p>  I acknowledge that I have asked the delegates to address many points.  I thank them for their attendance as it gives members an opportunity to raise these issues which are of importance in our communities.</p></speech>

I am sorry for hopping in and out of the meeting.  I was supposed to be in the D&aacute;il Chamber on two occasions, but I missed out on both.  </p> <p>  I welcome everything that has been said about addressing the needs of patients who have suffered a stroke, have a heart condition or general health issues.  Advertising is hugely important and has been mentioned.  Many people are not reached by certain advertisements.  Where is an advertiser likely to reach the most people in a single room at one time?</p><p>It is the workplace.  There are many institutions with huge numbers of employees and some have their own health awareness programmes, as we used to in Leinster House every two or three years, although it has not happened in the past ten years.  Every staff member was checked on every aspect of his or her health and quite a number of issues turned up, of which people had not been aware.  It brought to our attention the fact that many in the workplace spent their days in schools with large numbers of people who were in a position to spread the word if they had availed of a check-up.  There was dietary advice and advice on stroke and heart conditions.  Those who attended always say how important and informative they were and how easy they were to follow.  Insufficient information is placed in the public arena to warn people of issues, of which they should be aware.  There is no point telling somebody he or she has had a serious heart attack or a stroke or that he or she has diabetes.  They could be controlled to a huge extent if information and check-ups were made available.  The Chairman can organise them for staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They took two weeks and proved immensely effective in identifying issues.</p></speech>

Growing up and growing old is not easy and habits which start when a person is young are very important.  There is a huge public health message in what we are talking about, not just in the workplace but also in schools where the introduction of PE as a subject is welcome.  Healthy Ireland is also doing very important things.  Health promotion and prevention are very important parts in helping wellness in society as a whole and they are everybody's responsibility.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about having one medical officer in nursing homes.  There are the same challenges in hospitals where multiple teams go around multiple wards, but the level of discharge efficiency is improved if there are single teams on wards.  Havomg a single medical officer in nursing homes would be beneficial, rather than having ten or 12 GPs.  It would also provide a direct connection with outreach and inreach services.  A national transfer letter is being looked at in the context of the older persons programme which would ensure decisions made about advance care plans and treatment levels would be documented and communicated when a person went back to a nursing home.  It is a work in progress and there is a lot of work to be done, both from the point of view of contracts and with GPs.</p></speech>

A patient may be admitted to St. Vincent's Univeristy Hospital, for example, discharged and then admitted to Loughlinstown or some other hospital but with no notes or other communication.  The GP often has to be consulted on the patient's background.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ken McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#N00800"><p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh and Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony asked about the hospital service component of the national clinical programme, specifically the deficit in the Cork-Kerry region but also in the midlands.  They asked what the cost would be of rolling out further hospital programmes.  We estimate the cost for a single unit at somewhere in the region of &euro;400,000 which would be recurring because it would be made up predominantly by staff costs.</p> <p>  In developing hospital frameworks we need to take cognisance of the need for integration of care services across primary and secondary care services.  A component is the consultant's cost.  We need to look at having a new model of consultant in the health care system, in which they would not just be a silo in the secondary care system but cross the divide and make the boundaries somewhat fuzzy as they worked closely with GP-led primary services.  I am talking about an integrative care consultant within different specialties.  This is critically important and, as we develop more consultants in the heart failure programme, I would like them to take on that responsibility in order that we can improve communication which has been a common theme of the discussion.</p> <p>  I was asked about the capacity of the health care system to roll out a project as innovative as virtual consultation, VC, given some of the difficulties we might have with information technology.  I do not want to be flippant, but if something can be roadtested by me and it works, anyone can do it because I am not the most competent in using information technology.  I have been very taken by the ease with which we can run a VC clinic with general practitioners.  We do not need to be worried about its complexity, but we do need to be aware of the broadband issue as such consultations are critically dependent on the availability of broadband.  I completely agree that we need to focus on fast-tracking its provision.  We have the capacity to roll it out once we have the budgetary support to do so.</p> <p>  Senator John Dolan asked what were the ingredients of a prevention strategy and how we could layer them properly.  That is critically important as we develop prevention programmes in whatever area, be it heart failure or stroke.  It touches on the point raised by Deputy Billy Kelleher, namely, that there is a component of prevention which is the responsibility of the individual.  We need to ensure everyone is aware of what he or she needs to do to keep healthy.  We should not expect the Health Service Executive to provide everything.  However, we also need to drill down into the population and find who is at super risk of developing immediate problems, whether heart failure or a stroke or whatever else.  We can do this more effectively now than we could have five or ten years ago.  It is the basis of the StopHF project to which I referred.  The name suggests it is about stopping heart failure, but it also stops other cardiovascular diseases and prevents more cases of stroke than heart failure.  It does this by taking people at risk and defining whether they are at super risk by a simple, straightforward diagnostic blood test.  It should be universally available across the country.  At a cost of between &euro;15 and &euro;20, it is remarkably powerful.</p> <p>  The prevention of heart failure strategy which is actually a prevention strategy for cardiovascular disease has been roadtested by Dr. Michael Barry and if something can get over the cost-effectiveness hurdle put in front of it, we know that it is robust.  He has looked at and signed off on it.</p><p>He has stated it is a cost-effective strategy.  Again, I encourage all of us to examine this thoroughly, not simply in respect of the national clinical programme for heart failure but also the chronic cardiovascular disease programmes in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.413" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#O00200"><p>The committee is hearing many common themes from us.  It is not that we sat across the road in Buswells this morning and planned this.  We have many views in common on the importance of prevention, working together in primary and secondary care and through the integrated models and using technology to assist us.  I agree with Professor Ken McDonald.  I am waiting for our own subgroup to report but believe that what we really need is a national preventive strategy on cardiovascular disease that will serve everyone, not just those affected by stroke, heart attacks and heart failure but also those affected by dementia, falls and even incontinence in later life.  Much of the latter is due to subtle brain damage over time from vascular disease.  There is a significant reason to invest in this area over time.<br/><br/>I had a vision of Deputy Durkan and me doing memory tests like US President Donald Trump did recently in his health check.  It would be humorous.  The Deputy made a point on where one should advertise.  I do not claim to be the expert on this.  We certainly live in a time in which there are changes in the media by which we reach people.  It is likely that we reach people in different age brackets in different ways, but we also need to make the message effective.  There is no point in telling a young man he might get lung cancer because it is so far removed from where he is now and it might not be immediately relevant to him.  If he is shown a picture of sexual dysfunction or impotence, he might be much more likely to hone in on it and say it could happen to him if he smoked.  It is not just a matter of the message; we must fine-tune it so it is meaningful to people depending on their time of life.  A message stating smoking causes premature wrinkling is much more likely to attract the attention of a woman than a message referring to something that might happen in the distant future.  There is a mixture of messages involved, and there is probably a mixture of media.  There needs to be a panel of experts to consider where we advertise.<br/><br/>Senator Dolan made important points on stroke survival and the impact of clinical nurse specialists' leave.  He is right about the rule of thirds.  That generally was the rule.  I am very happy to say that our stroke mortality rate is now good in this country.  It is down to approximately 12%.  It has improved dramatically in recent times.  It was 19% in 2008 and it is now down to 12%.  As far as we can assess, this is not occurring at the expense of excess disability, in that nursing home discharge rates have remained constant.  Therefore, not only are more people surviving stroke but more are going back home.<br/><br/>The point made on the impact of clinical nurse specialist leave was absolutely right.  There is a danger with isolated positions.  Someone will always have to go on leave, and someone will always have to attend to other aspects of life.  Therefore, there is always a danger in trying to get a quick backfill.  Perhaps we should be considering a model in which people are not working in specialist roles completely on their own.  It does have an impact.  At times in my hospital when a key member of staff goes, a memory clinic may fall or a falls clinic may fall.  It can be challenging in terms of backfill where there are specialised roles.<br/><br/>Reference was made to a subject that is very dear to my heart, namely, soft assets and barriers in the area of disability.  It relates to what Dr. O'Shea said about cultural change.  In this regard, Professor Bernard Isaacs said that if one designs for older people, one will include everybody.  He was the father of modern geriatric medicine and gerontological thinking.  The problem with our society is that we are not designing for older people.  In fact, we are very much designing, even in the corporate world, around hyper-cognitive people.  This is a problem.  Anyone who bought a software package could see how difficult and non-intuitive it was for a healthy adult to use.  Imagine what that world is like for older people.  Technology is forcing them out of our society when it should be including them.  If I had my way, I would have a CE mark for technology and ensure it was road-tested for and accessible to older people in addition to younger people.  We need to be doing this in society.  It goes beyond software and technology.  It also applies to building design, signage and all areas of life.  These are soft assets, as the Senator said, but they are also barriers that we can easily surmount.<br/><br/>I was very interested in Senator Conway-Walsh's questions.  Clearly, she has thought a lot about this.  I will throw a grenade in her direction by saying that if one lives up the dales, one lives up the dales.  When I worked in Yorkshire, that was the attitude taken to some of the high-technology medicine.  It was said it could not be delivered to the deep rural areas.  That is not our attitude but it does reflect the fact that there are challenges, as the Senator has identified.<br/><br/>The Senator alluded to a two-centre approach and asked whether it would disenfranchise people in terms of thrombectomy, which is mechanical clot retrieval.  Clearly, we cannot do everything straight away.  First, we do not have the specialists.  Even if we had all the money in the world, we would not have the specialists.  Second, there is a need for high-volume centres when carrying out very tricky and dangerous procedures.  Our initial approach in the national stroke programme is to get two centres up and running vibrantly.  I reassure the Senator that the centre in Dublin is regularly taking patients from the west, including Mayo, Galway and Letterkenny.  Therefore, we are trying.  It will not be the longer-term model forever.  There will probably need to be a centre in the west and there may need to be two in Dublin, depending on how the city grows, but in the shorter term, we need to establish that we can do this well rather than diffusely and badly.  Our initial strategy is to try to make sure the majority of the population has access to this really important treatment for stroke.  We need to treat only three people with a thrombectomy to achieve one better, independent outcome than would obtain without the facility.  This is a game-changer by any stretch of the imagination but it is a huge infrastructural challenge to get people to centres and find the staff who have the skills to do this.  It is a challenge to get the radiography staff to work around the clock.  The Senator referred to 24-7 care so we can do this.  There are challenges but we are meeting them.  We grew the thrombectomy service from nothing to one dealing with 120 or 130 cases in 2015.  There were approximately 180 cases last year.  There have been over 250 already this year.  That is a huge increase without a massive investment necessarily.  We do need some investment.  I reassure the Senator that, as she can probably hear from my accent, I am not originally from an urban area.  As with most people, I have family who live in rural areas.  We are concerned to make sure people are served.<br/><br/>We have done several modelling exercises.  We published a paper recently in the <i>European Stroke Journal</i>on what a drip-and-ship arrangement entails, given various logistical models.  I am happy to give the Senator a copy of that paper because it makes interesting reading on the subject of whether one is better off going to the nearby hospital or bypassing it.<br/><br/>With regard to rehabilitation services in rural areas, as mentioned by Deputy O'Mahony, we are very anxious in the stroke programme to ensure everybody has equal access and what he or she needs to return to living.  The second pillar of our strategy is restoration to living.  There are challenges in this regard.  For example, one of our models is to get people home quicker.  It is psychologically better to go home.  One can imagine the trauma of having had a stroke.  One may be in a hospital environment that is frightening and noisy and one might be afraid about what life will be like and what one's relationship with one's family will be like.  The sooner people can go back to the home setting, the better.  Clearly, however, we have to have a radius around the hospital in which teams can work in order to be efficient.  We need a different model for rural areas, perhaps working in conjunction with geriatric medical services and the national rehabilitation service whereby we could have satellite services centred in rural areas through which people with various problems could perhaps gain access to appropriate rehabilitation services.  We certainly can do that.<br/><br/>To return to the comment on stroke unit access, we must recognise that although we had difficult times and but one stroke unit in 2008, 85% of our acute hospitals now have one.  The national stroke programme is absolutely committed.  An acute hospital accepting acute stroke patients should have an acute stroke unit by the end of this year or a bypass arrangement in place.  I speak for the programme and personally in saying we cannot condone any longer a system in which patients with an acute stroke cannot get into an acute stroke unit in hospital.<br/><br/>To return to the comment on how many people access an acute stroke unit, it is correct that the rate used to be very poor.  I am happy to say we have improved on the rate of many years ago, which was 29%.  At present, 65% of our patients get into an acute stroke unit and that is still not good enough.<br/><br/>On our key performance indicators and the questions on whether we have targets, we do have targets.  Our target or minimum acceptable standard is 90%.  We are a bit away from that.  The problem is that it relates to demography also.  It is fine to have a stroke unit but the demographic make-up is changing.  The Stroke Alliance for Europe is telling us we will have an 58% increase in the absolute number of stroke patients.</p><p>Clearly not only must one have a stroke unit, but we need to build in a review system to ensure that the stroke unit one has meets the number of admissions year on year.  That is a challenge but in our five-year strategy, we are working to meet that challenge and we will try to model it on a population basis.</p></speech>

Dr. Collins tells me he is going to throw a grenade and I have worked with him long enough to be able to hold the pin and go over and put it back in.  I had not used the term "rural-proof" but one might consider what has been done with the frailty education programme, which is located in 26 sites around the country, one of which is in County Mayo, and the integrated care programme, which is also in County Mayo and is among the sites that has a local governance group established.  The establishment of that local governance group, which is the first step in the ten-step framework, speaks to the value of clinical programmes that are clinically-led.  We get a significant input from colleagues on the clinical advisory groups in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and from the inter-professionals.  We will see the benefit in terms of delivering improved care around the country.  If one takes stroke as an example, one will want the thrombectomy care done on a particular site but one will want to be back in one's own locality getting rehabilitation services in an appropriately-staffed rehabilitation unit.  That is what the model of care is clearly showing.</p> <p>  The models of care, such as the integrated care framework and the local governance group and learning from the frailty education programme sites that are effectively integration ready when they are in place, will make a significant difference.</p> <p>  In response to the question on Versatis, to be fair, I think Professor McDonald gave a very good answer about the importance of cost effectiveness and it is probably not within our remit to give an answer to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#P00600"><p>That is part of the problem.  Obviously the management of chronic disease links with chronic pain and chronic pain management.  It is quite astounding that medical personnel would not be consulted about that decision that has affected so many people.  I refer to how "patient-centred" care means the patient being the centre of all decision making and how person-centred co-ordinated care provides one with the services one needs when and where one needs them.  It is based on a full understanding of one's life and world, combined with the information and support one needs.  It demonstrates respect for one's preferences, building care around one and those involved in one's care.  That is wonderful statement and is what we want to achieve but I cannot reconcile that with the withdrawal of Versatis without giving a clinical plan to the GPs, thereby undermining the GP-consultant-patient relationship and just leaving people in abeyance.  When decisions like that are made, it serves to undermine what the witnesses are saying to us about other areas.  I ask the witnesses to do anything within their gift to request a review of the decision on Versatis, so that medical personnel listen to the people who are telling them about the impact that the withdrawal of Versatis medicated plasters has had on them.</p></speech>

Nobody disputes that.  I think there is probably a feeling in the medical community that we need to invest more in our pain services in general.  The model for what pain services should look like is probably a multidisciplinary service.  The solution to all pain is neither a pill nor a patch but there are other aspects as well.  The problem with having limited finance, and I am not speaking on behalf of Professor Michael Barry from the medicines management programme, who is very well able to speak on his own behalf, is that the resource is finite.  Looking at the use of this patch as a medic, there is a significant gap in the evidence as to how this patch is working.  It has a licence for one treatment but it has been used, and seemingly, I am not doubting the testimonials of patients, it is working in other areas as well.  That always poses a problem in medicine in terms of prescribing something, when one does not have a clear licence to use it for that condition.  Should it be withdrawn from patients who clearly benefit from it?  Definitely not but to be fair, I do not think Professor Barry suggested that either.  I think he is suggesting that he needs to have some sort of control over it in terms of how it is prescribed.  My personal view is that the issue may have been possibly handled in a hard way but if there was not consultation with general practice, and I am not aware whether there was - that is not an ideal way to conduct business.  In general terms, we are a small country with finite resources.  I acknowledge the Minister has made an important move to get us involved with other smaller countries in Europe in order that we have better bargaining power for purchasing drugs.  That is a very important issue but with resources that are finite, one must conduct some sort of analysis if there is a significant overspend in a particular area.</p></speech>

The cost-benefit analysis needs to take account of the alternative medication, the hospitalisation and all other services that will be required by the individual.  The very first thing that anyone needs to do is to go to the drug company and negotiate a discount based on the increased volume.  That was not done.  That does not speak to me as a service that is patient-centred.</p> <p>  I acknowledge this is not the area for which the witnesses are responsible but it is connected to their areas.  They should please ask that another look be taken at Versatis medicated plasters.  The position should be reviewed and in the meantime, the Versatis patches should be reinstated.  It should be left to the GPs and the consultants to make that decision.</p></speech>

Are there structural problems that need to be overcome in how the HSE and the Department of Health are structured and managed or are there other softer barriers apart from the infrastructural and staffing barriers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ken McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#P01000"><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare report has provided a very good routeway for chronic disease in general.  If we can work on implementing its recommendations that certainly would be going in the right direction.  The barriers are the need to break down the silos of historical health care, which the Chairman knows about from working in the area.  I think we need to go on the route of making sure that we stop the divide between primary and secondary care and that we realise that chronic disease management requires not just the physician, be it the general practitioner or the specialist in the hospital, but also requires a very strong input of allied health care professionals.  Moreover, none of these chronic illnesses about which we are speaking will be managed properly unless the patient and his or her family are actively involved in care.  That is clearly demonstrated for example in heart failure care where, prior to admission to hospital or to an emergency room, there is a signal available for the patient to act on - if the patient or his or her family is aware of it - that could result in that deterioration being aborted before it got to the stage that it would need emergency care.  Breaking down the historical way that we deliver health care is critical, whether we do that through the rolling out of the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations or medics trying to reshape the way we deliver care in their own individual areas.</p></speech>

Does it come from the hospital sector or from general practice or do the groups come together and decide to do it?</p></speech>

We are saying there should be local governance groups in place that are cross-community and hospital and that they can influence and drive change and they should comprise health care professionals, patient representatives and primary care.  The answer to the Chairman's question is that is the value of evolving integrated care sites and frailty education programme sites because they have governance groups that are mandated in the programme.  When we went to some of the hospitals and community health care organisations about these programmes, they already had version of those groups in place.  Where they are not in place, they effectively should be making themselves integration-ready by having these governance groups in place.  I would go back to something a Senator of yore said, when Senator William Butler Yeats wrote in a poem:</p><blockquote>We thread the needles' eyes, and all we do.  All must together do.</blockquote> <p>If we are not all on the same page clinically, it serves the purpose to have us fighting internally, if we break down these silos.  I am a firm believer that education is a real tool to break down barriers and it is important to have that in place.</p><p>We see that continually in the context of the growing number of integrated care sites and frailty education programme sites.  In this way, we harness the enthusiasm of the health care professionals who are working there.</p></speech>

Is the mixture of private care in public hospitals a barrier to change?  Perhaps they might comment on that before we conclude.  I call Deputy O'Connell to be followed by Deputy O'Reilly.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being present for part of the meeting.  I have looked back at their evidence and have read most of their documents for today.  They spoke about a GP-led heart failure service and also about clinical nurse specialists in the community having a role.  I am a community pharmacist and I wonder if they would see community pharmacists having a role in the prevention of stroke and the treatment of cardiovascular disease.  In Canada, some very interesting work has been done in this area.  This committee has heard <i>ad infinitum</i>about he ageing population but also the ageing GP population and about how many of them are due to retire, as well as the huge HR issues we have within the health service.  It is all fine and dandy to say that we want a GP-led service but it will not work if we do not have the GPs and cannot get them from somewhere.  In the context of Sl&aacute;intecare, we spoke about ramping up entry level into medicine to try to have more graduates because we need to have the GPs to lead this.</p><p>I am of the view that there is a huge role for community pharmacists, especially in light of the new masters in pharmacy courses through the schools of pharmacy.  When the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was Minister for Health, the whole point was to expand the role of community pharmacists.  I did the masters in pharmacy course in the UK some years ago and it would always have been considered as more clinically-based in nature.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views.  Obviously, my view is that there is a huge role for community pharmacists in rationalising medication but also in the management of people when they go home and into the community.</p><p>The news on virtual consultation is very positive.  Innovation is key to how we move forward in our health service and if we continue doing things the same way, we are not going to get anywhere.</p><p>With regard to the FAST campaign for stroke, when was that last rolled out?  I felt the campaign was still on the television but the witnesses have suggested people are not acting on the basis of FAST, when we all know that is the key to ensuring less damage and better outcomes.</p><p>The witnesses referred to 85% cover in our units and, in particular, to a unit that deals with the Domestos aspect and with the pipe cleaning aspect.  Is this a very specialised procedure and can it happen in every hospital?  We are talking about trauma centres, orthopaedic centres and maternity centres.  However, in a general run-of-the-mill hospital in Tullamore, Mullingar, Carlow or Kilkenny, is it economically viable to have these units <i>in situ</i>?  Do the outcomes make it worth the investment?  Logically, we cannot just have four centres because travel time will negate the positive side of that.</p><p>The time from door to needle has gone down from three hours to one hour and 40 minutes.  Have we figures on how this has improved outcomes?  Are there figures that apply to the period before reaching the door of the hospital, such as ambulance response times?  Have we improved outcomes in these two areas and where can we target to improve them further?</p><p>I am conscious we are focusing on the witnesses' areas of speciality.  Although I am not sure if diabetes was mentioned, I am sure it is a huge part of this and the obesity epidemic on our doorsteps obviously has a major impact.  Healthy Ireland was a positive document.  The witnesses might comment on whether it needs to be looked at again and refreshed, or whether it is fine as it is.</p></speech>

I saw some of the evidence on the monitor and I will have a chance to look back on the rest.  If I ask a question the witnesses have already answered, they should feel free to refer me to their earlier statements.</p> <p>  The area of stroke and neurorehabilitation is one I am particularly interested in and one on which we have been doing research in my office for some time.  In the context of the link between stroke services and neurorehabilitation strategy, can the witnesses give details on what collaboration has taken place between the HSE national steering group for the national policy and strategy for the provision of neurorehabilitation services and the national stroke programme?  How are stroke services going to fit in or feature?  I understand, from replies to parliamentary questions, that the neurorehabilitation committee has only spoken to the stroke lead in respect of the mapping of services and not in regard to the clinical care pathway.  However, I am also conscious that the deadline is June, which seems a long way away until we realise that it is now March and we see how fast time is moving.  The witnesses might comment on the level of collaboration, how it is going to improve and how stroke services are going to feature in the neurorehabilitation strategy?  How is it proposed to ensure they are front and centre?</p> <p>  I am also looking at figures in regard to discharges to long-term care.  Between 2009 and 2014, there was a 22% reduction, which is obviously a good thing, but the figures suggest this is now starting to creep back up.  Will the witnesses comment on the reasons for this?  More importantly, given that, as I assume, they know the reasons for this increase, what is being done to ensure that the figures start going in the right direction again?  Clearly, they are not going in the right direction.  It might be that it has been identified there is a geographic element to this.  How is it happening and how does the HSE intend to reverse it?</p></speech>

Before I pass to Professor McDonald, I want to address Deputy O'Connell's question in regard to polypharmacy and medication from pharmacists on these programmes.  There is a pharmacist representative on the clinical programme for older people working group, which is very important from the point of view of all of the programmes.  Polypharmacy, medication realisation and de-prescribing as much as prescribing are hugely important parts of this.  What the Deputy's question speaks to is the critical importance of getting the constitution of the different clinical advisory and working advisory groups correct.  It is about all the breadth of health care professionals working together.</p> <p>  On the question on obesity, diabetes and dementia, a new lead has recently been appointed for the national dementia strategy, Dr. Suzanne Timmons, and there is a specific diabetes lead and a clinical lead for the obesity programme.  It might be appropriate for them to attend the committee at some stage to answer questions around those programmes.  Professor McDonald had a specific comment to make on diabetes and heart failure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ken McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#Q00600"><p>I will try to roll that in with answers to some of the questions Deputy O'Connell asked.  In answering, I am simply going to be agreeing strongly with a couple of her sentiments.  First, I think the pharmacist is a completely under-used strength of the health care system that we need to start using far more than simply as a drug dispensing outlet.  At present it is a leg on the stool of health care delivery that we are simply not using effectively, given the fact that, as the Deputy knows better than I, the pharmacist involved sees the patient probably more frequently than any one other individual involved in health care.</p><p>The pharmacist has an opportunity not simply to look at reconciliation of medicines but also to be involved in increasing medicine under appropriate guidelines, linked in very securely with the general practitioner.  I am in complete agreement with the Deputy that we need to do something to bring more pharmacists front and central in health care delivery.</p><p> On the diabetes issue, the national clinical programme on heart failure has looked at the prevention strategy about which we talked this morning, the Stop HF strategy, as a pilot within the diabetic programme in the midlands.  I think the committee has already heard from Dr. Velma Harkins on this.  She is the GP who is leading up this effort.  The prevention service that I referred to earlier has now been parachuted in on top of the care processes in the midlands to try to accentuate our efforts to prevent cardiovascular disease - heart failure being one aspect of that - within the population most at risk.  Obviously, as we all know, diabetics are particularly at risk for cardiovascular disease.</p><p> Finally, to come back to the initial point about the pharmacists, as we roll out a prevention strategy for cardiovascular disease, we envisage that an aspect of that strategy can be provided by pharmacists in pharmacies.  Some of the initial screening tests should be done there, with patients then triaged based on results.</p></speech>

It is about the person who has multiple co-morbidities and who is regularly meeting the pharmacist and about making better use of that expertise.  However, that has implications for pharmacists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#R00300"><p>Very briefly, I agree with Deputy O'Connell.  It may interest her to know that the Australians carried out a large atrial fibrillation screening study using pharmacists as the screening interventionists.  They came up with a very acceptable result of about $3,400 per stroke saved in terms of using the pharmacist.  However, there are national issues about indemnity.  Our pharmacists are very integrated into our atrial fibrillation clinic in our hospital.  They have done the MSc in cardiovascular prescribing so there are extended roles there.  Those roles are changing.  As the committee has heard from every witness here, we are into multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches.  We see roles for people but obviously there are issues regarding contracts, indemnity and so forth that would need to be teased out.</p> <p>  Specifically with regard to thrombectomy and thrombolysis, we have modelled this recently in Ireland.  The important thing is to get the Domestos in as quickly as possible while also trying to carry out thrombectomy, which is the mechanical removal.  There will be different models depending on where one lives.  We certainly want to get the drug in quickly because most of the thrombectomy trials occurred on top of the fact that patients already had the blood thinner on board, preventing further sludging.  It is key to get the drug in quickly but if the door-to-needle time is going to be prolonged in an individual hospital, then maybe one is better bypassing that.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell spoke about Mullingar and Tullamore.  I do not know if she is from-----</p></speech>

When it came to accessing care, for example, that area was in our first tele medicine network, which greatly improved the provision of the clot-busting treatment.<br/><br/>Going back to thrombectomy, it is very specific and a lot of interventionist skill is required.  There is a significant risk of bleeding and that can lead to fatal situations.  That part of it needs to be done in supra-specialised centres.  We are modelling the pathways around that to determine whether patients should stop off in the nearest hospital first to get the clot-busting drug before moving on.  We have actually just produced a paper on that for the <i>European Stroke Journal</i>and I would be happy to send that on to the Deputy.  That paper illustrates some of the mathematical modelling we have just done in the greater Leinster area.  <br/><br/>In terms of the door-to-needle time, things are improving although more work needs to be done.  We have started a quality improvement initiative with the Royal College of Physicians for all of our stroke teams and we hope that every hospital stroke team will have completed a quality improvement programme on door-to-needle time by the end of next year.<br/><br/>Going back to Deputy O'Reilly's comments about the neurorehabilitation strategy, that strategy started life as far back as 2010, became more focused in 2012, with the development of the model of care finalised in 2015.  It is now at the level of implementation and this is the point where we actually engage.  The model of care is generic - it is for everybody with neurological disabilities.  Obviously, we need to explore the Venn diagram in terms of where strokes, as well as other neurological disabilities, will fit into the commonality of that.  I would reiterate that the national stroke programme wants to ensure - as per the second pillar of our strategy on restoration to living - that everybody, irrespective of age gets the necessary rehabilitation that they require and not just to go home but also to get back to living.<br/><br/>In terms of the figures for discharge to nursing homes-----</p></speech>

I referenced the fact that I did not think that the collaboration was at a very deep or advanced stage.  Given that June is the date for publication, what level of engagement is planned between now and then on the clinical pathways?  This will not happen organically.  It has to be driven by both sides but the responses to parliamentary questions that I have submitted would indicate that there is not much of a sense of urgency around this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#R00700"><p>I accept that is the Deputy's impression.  I have only been in this job for a couple of months.  To date, there have been informal discussions but there will be fairly focused meetings between now and June about where we fit into the neurorehabilitation strategy.  There are elements of the national care programme for older people that fit into this as well.  Indeed, the three programmes need to have a discussion because neurorehabilitation is not just a specific entity on its own.  It is a model of care that transcends several different care programmes.  A pretty intensive level of work will be done on this over the next couple of months.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly is right to point out the importance of ensuring that more people do not survive stroke at the expense of disability.  The mortality figures have dropped from 19% in 2008 to 12% now, which is a huge shift in the stroke survival rates.  We have made a lot of progress in that regard.  Our nursing home figures have stayed relatively stable over the past three years.  They stood at approximately 15.2% in 2015 and are now around 15.9%.  They are running a little bit in the wrong direction but people must understand that we are going to have an increase in absolute numbers in the next couple of years.  There will be regional variations on which I cannot give answers to the Deputy because I do not have the data here.  Some of it can be home-care package dependent, in terms of whether people can get home in certain circumstances.  Those admitted to nursing homes tend be people in the moderate to severe disability category but I can assure the Deputy that we are watching it closely.  One of our key performance indicators is whether people are being discharged home.  Next year we plan to use an indicator of disability as a publishable criteria in our stroke register.  We are going to start using the modified rank and scale as an analysis going forward so that the level of disability after stroke will be clearly visible.  Up until now, it has been a surrogate in terms of going home or going to a nursing home, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates.</p></speech>

There is a cost for discharging people into long term care.  I fully appreciate that it is creeping up at a slow rate but it is creeping up nonetheless.  It needs to be reversed.  Significant money is being spent because it is not going in the right direction; it is actually costing us.</p></speech>

He spoke about indemnity, which is often mentioned when roles are being expanded.  If we cast our minds back to the expansion of the vaccination programme into community pharmacies, the argument was made that people would be having anaphylactic reactions to flu vaccines left, right and centre.  People asked what the pharmacists would do when that happened.  When I was training, the chance of that happening was one in 1 million and now it is one in 2 million.  I had many arguments with medic members of my family as to how we would manage and we all got through it fine.  My understanding is that nobody has "croaked it" on a pharmacy floor from having a flu vaccine administered.  In that context, the expansion of roles should be governed by the undergraduate course and the issue of indemnity dealt with by the governing and regulatory bodies.  I would not like to see the issue of indemnity preventing any expansion of roles.</p> <p>  There has been a call from some quarters for an increase in the availability of defibrillator machines in various settings.</p><p>I scanned a study last weekend which said this was not good value for money.  A nurse who featured on "The Late Late Show" or "The Ray D'Arcy Show" recently outlined how she gave her husband CPR for half an hour and he survived.  In Denmark, children are taught first aid, recognition of the symptoms of stroke and chest compressions.  Nobody dies on the street anymore there because most people are able to keep those with heart failure going until the paramedics arrive.  It might be popular to suggest defibrillators should be put in every village in the country but they must be used correctly.  Perhaps Dr. McDonald could elaborate on what would happen if a defibrillator was used for somebody having a stroke and on the inappropriate use of such devices.</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out, having a defibrillator at every crossroads would not be practical or effective and I wonder whether it would even be safe.  There are figures, which I do have with me, for the critical accumulation of people in a zone where a defibrillator would be of practical use to the population.  Beyond the defibrillator, we need to make sure that primary resuscitation skills are more readily available and taught to us all.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.445" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid O'Shea" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018030700002#S00400"><p>The questions have been informative and instructive for us but having listened to us for the past two hours, that question on its own could take an entire committee session and more.  To be brief but not glib, there is a co-dependency.  When I talk about age attuning and being age accommodating and age friendly, there is a need for the private healthcare sector to recognise that it is encountering a larger and increasing cohort of frail older people and its staff needs to be upskilled and geared to deal with that.  Generally, from a societal point of view and from a financing point of view, we need to understand that there is co-dependency.  If the private sector no longer lowers costs or drives an expectation that people will not sign for private healthcare cover when they are in a public hospital, that will result a huge amount coming out of the public purse.  This is probably a question for another meeting but we need to recognise the co-dependency and understand how to work better.  This goes back to the benefits of the clinical programmes, clinical advisory groups, working advisory groups and the HSE breaking down the silos and barriers that exist.</p> <p>  One of the great experiences that I have had recently is looking at the provision of education for interdisciplinary staff in nursing homes.  When everybody is in the same room, one can experience the informed discussion and the learning from each other that goes on.  That is as much about networking and breaking down barriers and we need to do more of that.</p> <p>  I refer to the discussion between Deputy O'Reilly and Dr. Collins and the deadline in June.  I have been working as clinical lead since the clinical programme started and something I have learned is that things have to be progressed slowly in certain circumstances.  I regard launch dates and other dates for documents as iterative.  The fact is that we will be in discussions on that and will influence initially a document; it will not just happen on the basis of one launch in June.  It will be an ongoing, iterative process. Once we are sitting in the same room, we are making progress.</p></speech>

He has landed a fly in front of me knowing I might potentially snap at it.  It is a difficult area and aspects of it need to be teased out.  I will give a vignette to describe what happens.  Last week, we experienced a severe weather event and people whose operations had been done in the private sector turned up at our hospital with post-operative issues.  They turn up because we are open 24-7 and we deal with all-comers and cases of every complexity.  I object to them being told by their insurance companies not to sign in a public hospital.  I acknowledge in my area of medicine the fee from insurance companies is small but substantial money accrues to the public, not-for-profit, common good system from these fees.  This needs regulation.  As Dr. O'Shea alluded to, there is a co-dependency but we want to make sure that, however the model evolves, the public system can stay abreast of technology and that we have sufficient resources to buy the latest PET scanner, for example, in order that everybody can avail of it, otherwise, the public system will be driven into the ground like the veterans health administration system in the US, which became under-resourced and demoralised and nobody would work in it.  We want to avoid that.  Our public system is vibrant and we want to attract, in an appropriate way, investment and business that is regulated.  However, there is a co-dependency and both sectors should not be mutually exclusive in delivering a proper health service.</p></speech>

That is why it is crucial that enhanced roles are provided for them.  Deputy Kelleher asked about workforce planning.  It is important that good career pathways and enhanced roles are provided for staff to retain them because that will motivate people to come back into our system and bring back the innovations that we want to develop.  I was abroad for some training.  One can only be heartened by what happened last week in the middle of the red alert nationally, politically and in health care.  The building blocks have been put in place by the clinical strategy and programmes division of the HSE in conjunction with colleges, clinicians, healthcare programme managers and health care professionals and we have a roadmap in the Sl&aacute;intecare report to move forward but clear support is needed with all of us working together to drive that.  That cannot happen with just the clinicians or just the politicians.  There are difficult decisions to be made on funding but we are better off making them together rather than fighting about them.</p></speech>

In this session we will discuss the following draft regulations referred to the committee by an order passed by the D&aacute;il on 20 February and the Seanad on 27 February: the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 4(2)) (Designation of professions: counsellors and psychotherapists and establishment of registration board) Regulations 2017 and the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 4(7)) (Membership of Council) Regulations 2017.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

The Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to approve two sets of regulations.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 4(2)) (Designation of professions: counsellors and psychotherapists and establishment of registration board) Regulations 2017 will designate the new professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act and establish one registration board for both professions, each with its own register.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 4(7)) (Membership of Council) Regulations 2017 are consequential to the first set of regulations.  The designation of two new professions will create two new professional positions for the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist on the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  The regulations will increase by two the number of lay positions on the council to ensure a continuing lay majority.  <br/><br/>I will comment briefly on the background to the regulations.  They represent an important step in implementing the decisions of the Minister for Health that the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist be regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and that each profession have its own register under one registration board.  These decisions were taken on foot of an initial consultation with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, followed by a wider public consultation process which generated over 80 submissions.  <br/><br/>The Act provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of designated health and social care professionals.  There are 14 and the addition of counsellor and psychotherapist will bring the number to 16.  Under the Act regulation is primarily by way of registration of practitioners and the statutory protection of professional titles.  The use of protected titles is restricted to practitioners granted registration under the Act.  Registrants must comply with a code of professional conduct and ethics and are subject to fitness to practice rules similar to those which apply to nurses, midwives, doctors, dentists and pharmacists.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for each profession, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council which has overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU.  <br/><br/>Registers have been established and titles protected for seven of the ten registration boards appointed.  This represents 13,000 registrants of a potential 25,000 and more likely 30,000 registrants when all designated professions are registered.  The remaining three boards of the ten appointed are actively working towards establishing their registers as soon as possible.  They include social care workers, medical scientists and psychologists.  It is intended to have two more registration boards established in the second quarter of this year, one being the podiatrists registration board and, subject to obtaining the approval by the Oireachtas of the regulations before the committee, the other the counsellors and psychotherapists registration board. This will leave the remaining designated professions of orthoptist and clinical biochemist to be progressed before work concludes in the regulation of all professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  <br/><br/>Counsellors and psychotherapists are not designated under the Act.  They assist people with psychological, emotional and-or mental health issues.  There is concern that, in many cases, there is no statutory oversight of their competence and conduct and that some practitioners lack the qualifications and professional training needed to work with such vulnerable clients.  The regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists under the Act will ensure those registered will have minimum qualifications, that only registrants will be entitled to use the title or titles protected under the Act and that registrants will be subject to a range of sanctions, including suspension or cancellation of registration, in the case of a substantiated complaint of professional misconduct or poor professional performance.  <br/><br/>The legal position is that section 4(2) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Health, after consulting the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and having given other interested parties an opportunity to make representations to him or her, may designate a health or social care profession that has not already been designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.  Section 4(8) of the Act provides that regulations may be made under section 4 only if:  </p><blockquote>(a) a draft of the proposed regulations has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and<br /><br />(b) a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</blockquote> <p>Subject to the approval of the Houses, the next steps will be to make the regulations to designate the professions and appoint the 13 members of the registration board following the submission of suitable candidates for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration by the Public Appointments Service.  Once the counsellors and psychotherapists registration board has been established and its members appointed, the board will be asked to advise the Health and Social Care Professional Council and the Minister on some of the outstanding issues to be decided.  They include the professional titles to be protected by regulations under the Act and the qualifications that ought to be required of existing practitioners in order to register.  <br/><br/>The registration board will also commence drafting the various by-laws to allow it to establish its registers.  They will include by-laws relating to the approved qualifications that will be required of future graduates.  Following the opening of the register, there will be a two-year transitional period to allow existing practitioners time to apply for registration and satisfy the registration board that they meet the requirements for the profession.</p></speech>

Following approval of the regulations, it will be an offence - down the line, obviously, not the following morning - for someone to represent himself or herself as a counsellor if he or she does not fulfil the minimum requirements and is not appropriately registered.  Will the witnesses confirm this and confirm what powers there are in this regard, if any?  There are very specific incidents in which people represent themselves as counsellors.  In some circumstances they deal with women, in particular women in crisis, and they call themselves counsellors when they are very clearly not and they could really damage women, certainly women in desperate situations.  What penalties are available if someone misrepresents himself or herself as a counsellor, or is this something for the future?  Now that the title is protected, which obviously is a very good thing, what penalties exist?  Are they similar to those that exist for those who pretend to be nurses or members of other protected professions?</p></speech>

I suppose it is, in this context, advice.  Who is ultimately the person or entity that makes final decisions?  Ms Walsh said the board will be asked "to advise ... on ... the outstanding issues [including] professional titles to be protected by regulation under the Act and the qualifications that ought to be required of existing practitioners in order to register".  I am rereading her words to point out what I am trying to establish.  She also said the board will draft various by-laws.  This goes back to the original question about advice.  Who, ultimately, makes the final decisions on who can be registered, the training programmes and so on?  Is it the health and social care professionals, the Minister or the board?</p></speech>

An area that has not been brought up previously is people who provide scanning services.  There does not appear to be any regulation of this.  I have come across a number of cases recently, in particular outside of Dublin, in which scanning services were provided.  I heard of one case recently in which a scanning service was provided on a Saturday and fairly negative news given to the patient and then that person had no medical practitioner to whom to turn for help or advice on a Saturday.  When the person who provided the scan was questioned on it, they said it was not their job.  Is this in any way on the list of areas that need to be regulated?  Many people are popping up providing scanning services with no backup medical support, and I am concerned about it.</p></speech>

She touched on crisis pregnancy counselling and protection of title.  The regulations are in effect already drafted, so once we get the approval, the Minister will sign them.  Then we will go to the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to appoint the board.  The appointment of the board starts a very extensive work programme.  Generally speaking, for most professionals, the pattern to date has been that the work takes about two years between a board being appointed and it actually opening its register.  Going back to Deputy Kelleher's point, it is a 13 person board on which sit six practitioners of the profession and a seven-person lay majority.  The first element this board will look at is people's present qualifications and how they are registered.  In effect, this is what is called grandparenting.  We call it a transition period under the Act.  The board, for each profession, will do work.  It has the practitioners and the lay majority on board but will often commission work, talk to professional bodies and carry out research.  It then comes to a point where it makes solid advice.  On the issue of grandparenting, it comes back to the Minister via the council.  The council may also have input into it.  It comes back to the Minister with advice on the qualifications that would be set for grandparenting - this is for existing practitioners - but it is the Minister who then makes that element of the process.  He decides, based on the board's advice.  He can also input his own advice, obviously.</p></speech>

Nonetheless, it is the Minister who makes that point.</p> <p>  The second piece on which the board advises the Minister is protection of title.  The process is the same, and the same 13 person board is involved.  The board may commission research, talk to professional bodies or get additional advice.  It regularly sets up sub-committees and can draw on the expertise of those who may not be members of the board.  Again, the board will advise the Minister, and it is the Minister who makes the regulations on protection of title.</p> <p>  Then there is a third piece, namely, the desirable qualifications for new graduates into the future.  These people will not be grandparented, as it were.  These are future qualifications.  It is the registration board that makes these regulations.  Those are the three processes.</p> <p>  This links back to Deputy O'Reilly's point.  Nothing will happen overnight when these regulations are signed.  The board is appointed, it starts this period of work and then, at the end of the transition period, which might be 18 months or two years, it establishes its register.  It is then open to receive registrants, and there is a two-year period within which people can register.  Once someone registers, if he or she decides to register on week one as opposed to six months later, he or she is subject to full fitness-to-practise, as applies to doctors, nurses and so on.  It could be that someone has a complaint about someone using the title which is now protected or someone is accused of professional misconduct or poor professional performance, the same as other bodies.  It is the same fitness-to-practise process.  Preliminary proceedings are held, the committee investigates and the cases go to fitness-to-practise if substantiated.</p> <p>  Going back to the point on-----</p></speech>

It might be that I did not make my question clear or perhaps that Ms Walsh will come to it.  Obviously, the people who want to do it right will get all the paperwork and so on to ensure they have the qualifications and register.  I am talking about, for want of a better word, chancers who will not go through the process of registering.  Will they face a penalty if they set up ABC counselling services or whatever they want to call it and try to misrepresent themselves?

It depends what titles are protected.  Obviously, the word "counsellor" and variants of titles will be protected.  However, there is an issue, and it relates to all professions registered, whether dietician, speech and language therapist or whatever else, that a person could operate using a title other than the protected title.  If a person is holding oneself out to be performing the role of a counsellor, a complaint can be followed through on that basis.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, when before the committee previously on a related topic, made the point that the ultimate aim in registering counsellors and psychotherapists, particularly in respect of crisis pregnancy counselling, is that once the register is open and populated, titles protected and qualifications set, other legislation, such as the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995, which is being reviewed as part of a wider exercise on the eighth amendment and related work, would be amended to ensure that anyone providing such information services must be registered with CORU.  It is a matter of closing the loop on that.</p> <p>  Senator Burke asked a question about scanning.  I am sorry but I am not sure what kinds of scans he referred to.

Provision is also made for enforcement and inspection powers.  It is a wide-ranging process but it does not happen until such time as a person is registered.</p></speech>

I draw the attention of witnesses to the situation in respect of privilege.  I ask them to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Without any further ado, I invite Ms West to make her opening statement,  At its conclusion, we will go directly to Ms Galligan.</p></speech>

As part of the GSAS management team, I have been integral to the introduction and establishment of the analysis service in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Not only has this involved recruitment, structuring, training, the development of systems and processes, progression planning and budgeting, but also gaining acceptance for the use of analysis in the wider organisation.  I have responsibility for crime and policing analysts within headquarters units and special crime operations.  My remit is very broad, ranging from oversight of national assessments of volume crime, such as burglary and assault, through serious and organised crime, for example, homicide, drugs and immigration, to matters concerning national security.  I have insights into the organisation across the spectrum of policing functions and have experience of interacting with personnel at all grades and ranks.</p> <p>  Prior to August 2007, I worked as an analyst in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, for nearly six years.  During this time, I supported a multitude of investigations into serious and organised crime and delivered many reports containing operational recommendations, which were used to set organisational priorities and guide significant strategic decisions by senior officers.</p> <p>  In July 2016, I received a direct request for analytical assistance from the Garda national protective services bureau, GNPSB.  The request was for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service to conduct a ten-year review of domestic homicide from 2007 to 2016.  The chief superintendent who made this request did so to satisfy particular obligations the GNPSB has with respect to: the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence from 2016 to 2021; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s domestic abuse intervention policy of 2016; the development of a risk assessment tool in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the development of divisional protective services units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet commitments made in the 2016 policing plan and made to the Policing Authority; the EU victims directive of 2015; the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017; and the Istanbul Convention, which is the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  I personally tasked senior crime and policing analyst, Ms Laura Galligan, with this review.</p><p>Ms Galligan had significant, relevant experience from her previous role as senior scientist with the Office of the State Pathologist.  I believed this expertise would add great value to the review of domestic homicide.<br/><br/>Having been deputy head of analysis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for nearly 11 years, I have been uniquely placed to understand the organisation and identify areas of concern or weakness which require prioritisation, particularly if the transformation agenda is to succeed.  Throughout my tenure with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, recurrent areas of concern identified by the analysis service have been PULSE recording and data quality.  Although there is no clearly defined process for GSAS to raise issues identified with regard to data quality, we have always escalated our concerns, whether to crime, policy and administration - latterly known as the policy development, implementation and monitoring unit - or the Garda information services centre in Castlebar and frequently to senior Garda management in analytical reports and at management meetings and conferences.<br/><br/>Data quality is of fundamental importance to analysis.  A dearth of good data seriously limits the ability of an analyst to conduct complete and robust analysis in any sector.  I voiced my concerns about data quality to Ms Galligan as she embarked on the ten-year review of domestic homicide.  Within a short time, it became clear there was a deficit of information on the PULSE system to enable Ms Galligan to determine whether a homicide was of a domestic nature or otherwise.  Ms Galligan therefore requested permission to liaise with the Office of the State Pathologist in order that she would have independent and verifiable supplementary information to ensure data quality.  I take this opportunity to thank Professor Marie Cassidy and her team for engaging in this collaboration with the analysis service.<br/><br/>When Ms Galligan analysed and cross-checked the files held in the Office of the State Pathologist, information held on PULSE and homicide spreadsheets previously produced internally by the analysis service on a monthly basis, she identified inconsistencies which she deemed to be significant.  When she brought this to my notice, I concurred with her views.  I immediately recognised the gravity of the matters raised and the many possible ramifications.  In my view, the issues raised went right to the heart of policing and the ability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to protect and serve the public.<br/><br/>While there were concerns regarding the accurate provision of crime data to the Central Statistics Office, the primary concern was with regard to the victims, their families and loved ones.  I could immediately see the very serious organisational risks for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of reputational damage and public confidence.  I asked Ms Galligan to specifically consider a sample period from 2013 to 2015 to expeditiously highlight the main concerns.  I believed it was critical that we establish an evidence base to clearly illustrate the various issues arising.  Ms Galligan undertook this work on the sample period as I had directed.  On 24 November 2016, she emailed me a draft of her report entitled, Comparative Analysis of the Recording and Reporting of Homicide Incidents in the PULSE Database and the Office of the State Pathologist.  Following a specially convened meeting on 28 November 2016, I recommended to management that the Garda executive be briefed immediately.  I am aware that this briefing occurred on 29 November 2016.  We understood at this time that the professional standards unit would be asked to conduct reviews of the cases highlighted.  I had this impression from communications with my management.  The role of the professional standards unit is to examine and review, as directed by the Garda Commissioner, the operational, administrative and management performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels; propose measures to the Commissioner to improve that performance; and promote the highest standards of practice, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services, in operational, administrative and management matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>Subsequent to the briefing of the Garda executive on 29 November 2016, I asked on several occasions whether anyone had been in contact to address the matters raised.  I was concerned that there did not appear to be a sense of urgency to initiate a full review on the basis of Ms Galligan's report.  In mid-January 2017, officers from policy development, implementation and monitoring, or PDIM, commenced a review of 41 cases which had been referenced in Ms Galligan's draft report.  The report had been escalated to management in draft format due to the urgency with which I perceived the need to raise the issues identified.  It had remained in draft format as priority was given to beginning to look at other years.  I did not deem it a time for worrying about perfection in report writing.  For me, the emphasis was on identifying the issues and raising them as quickly as possible.  Issues identified by Ms Galligan ranged from potential misclassification to data quality issues of varying degrees of severity.  Ms Galligan will shortly go through the findings of her analysis.<br/><br/>Ms Galligan and I attended meetings with representatives from PDIM on the following dates in 2017: 17, 19 and 24 January; 7, 13, 20 and 21 February; and 2 and 30 March.  We specifically requested the meeting of 30 March.  After the first meeting on 17 January 2017, all relevant reports were forwarded by me to PDIM electronically with the following email:</p><blockquote>... As a result of reviewing case files held within OSP a number of potentially serious anomalies were identified which raised the question of whether PULSE had a complete record of all homicides (not exclusively domestic).  As the numbers recorded as homicide in OSP were higher, the systems had to be manually cross-referenced.  This has raised the possibility that certain cases on PULSE may be incorrectly classified.  In addition, a series of other data quality issues were identified.<br /><br />The documents above outline the variety of issues identified.  It is recommended that a review is carried out of each case noted to determine whether there is a consensus that there are matters of concern.  GSAS will happily assist in any way we can.  We would appreciate being kept abreast of developments as this will determine how we proceed with the review of additional years.  2012 is nearly complete and will be disseminated to you shortly.  It is then intended to research 2016 as we now have a complete year of data.  This will give 5 years which have been reviewed.  A decision will then have to be taken as to whether we continue to work back from 2012.  The original domestic homicide review was intended to cover a period of 10 years ...</blockquote><p>During the nine aforementioned meetings, cases highlighted between the years 2013 and 2015 were discussed.  These were very robust discussions, not only about each individual case but also high-level issues such as consistency in recording practice across crime types.  We entered into these meetings in good faith and genuinely believed the intention was to fully and independently review each of the cases.  However, as it transpired, there was an apparent reluctance to countenance many of the issues we tried to raise.  We made many attempts to highlight the potential organisational risks, the inconsistencies we were identifying and the absolute need to review the approach to death classification and investigation, not only within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also in collaboration with partner agencies.  We made it very clear at these review team meetings that agreement had not been reached between the parties involved on many of the key matters raised.<br/><br/>Although a review of 2012 had already been carried out, we were instructed not to send the related executive summary to PDIM.  We were not permitted to reference cases from outside the sample review period - 2013 to 2015 - even though they were pertinent to highlighting crucial facts.  Every case will have particular nuances to be referenced, some of which may ultimately impact on policy decisions.<br/><br/>It was my full expectation that, as Ms Galligan and I had attended all meetings of the review team, we would, in spite of the often tense and quarrelsome debates, be involved in or at least consulted on the drafting of any report concluding the findings of the meetings and putting forward any recommendations.  It was our understanding that our input was necessary given our central role in raising the issue and highlighting the problems.  However, instead of being consulted or involved, Ms. Galligan and I were excluded from the preparation of any report or review document.  We were not consulted regarding our views on how to ensure good data quality that would enable the work of GSAS.<br/><br/>On Monday, 8 May 2017, I was handed a 59-page, hard-copy document entitled, Review of specific Sudden Death/Homicide Incidents recorded during the period 2013 to 2015.  This was a report produced by PDIM officers from the review team.  I had inquired as to the status of such a report on 28 and 30 March and I am aware Dr. Singh, the head of GSAS, had requested on several occasions during April 2017 to be furnished with any such report.  When this report was provided to me by Dr. Singh at 12.20 on the afternoon of 8 May 2017, I was informed that views on it were required by the close of business that day.  This was not possible.<br/><br/>In this report, Ms Galligan's methodology was deemed to be &quot;inherently weak&quot;, &quot;confined&quot; and &quot;restricted&quot; and there were repeated attempts to undermine and erode confidence in the findings of the initial sample review.  This was of huge concern to me.  I felt that my integrity and the integrity of my colleague, for whom I have the utmost respect, was under attack.  Our concern was of a professional nature.  We had been tasked with generating a report, as required by a chief superintendent.</p><p>In order to undertake the task and provide the report requested of us, we had to adhere to professional standards and norms.  The fundamental and key component part of this, as any data analyst will confirm in any industry, is the underlying data quality as it underpins the analysis.  Bad data will lead to bad analysis.  We were concerned about the accuracy and quality of the data, and to have ignored our concerns would have been to ignore our ethics and professional standards.  No engagement with the review team gave us any assurance regarding the data quality.<br/><br/>Over the course of 8, 9 and 10 May 2017, I believe that very significant pressures were brought to bear on Ms Galligan and me, to persuade us to sign off on the PDIM report.  I felt very pressurised in heated meetings which occurred on 9 and 10 May 2017.  I also received a<b><i></i></b>series of telephone calls on the afternoon of 9 May during which significant pressures were brought to bear.  Professionally, I could not sign off on the PDIM report and made it clear to all concerned that I would not bow to pressure.  On 11 May 2017, I felt compelled personally to transmit my views about it in a five-page letter to several members of senior Garda management.  Within this correspondence I noted:</p><blockquote>My position has been very clearly stated on multiple occasions throughout this process, and remains unchanged.  During the meetings between PDIM, Ms Galligan and I, no agreement was reached, either with regard to the classification of individual cases discussed, or in regard to the more strategic issues relating to homicide investigation and death classification.<br /><br />To make sure there is 100% clarity, the report entitled, Review of specific Sudden Death/Homicide Incidents recorded during the period 2013 to 2015 is, in my opinion, a one sided view of what occurred within the meetings between PDIM, Ms Galligan and I.  I do not agree with many aspects of the report and I therefore cannot and will not be signing off on recommendations contained therein.</blockquote><p>At 8.50 a.m. on 12 May 2017, as a direct consequence of the letter I had sent internally the day before, I received a telephone call.  In line with the requirement of the committee that persons are not named or referenced in such a way as to be identifiable, I am unable to say who made this call.  During this call, I was made aware that a report, which I had submitted on 11 April 2017 for onward transmission to the Policing Authority - request 210 relating to the homicide review, had never been sent to it.  I was informed that this report had been discussed among senior Garda personnel prior to a private Policing Authority meeting on 13 April 2017.  If this was the case, then it was known at that time that agreement had not been reached during the meetings of the review team.  This makes it difficult to understand how certain comments were made and assurances given during the public Policing Authority meeting on 27 April 2017.  Several other things were said to me in this conversation, for which I have contemporaneous notes and which I can make available if the committee requires.<br/><br/>On the afternoon of 12 May 2017, Ms Galligan and I met with members of senior Garda management.  We were very honest about our views during this meeting.  It was made clear that there had been difficulties during the review team meetings and that we felt we had not been listened to or well treated.  Following this discussion, it was agreed that there still needed to be a firm decision taken on the classification of a number of cases highlighted in Ms Galligan&rsquo;s original report.  During this meeting, and in a subsequent email I sent on 13 May 2017, there was agreement that Ms Galligan and I would be given sufficient time to go through the PDIM report, review the conclusions of this report <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our own conclusions relating to the 41 referenced cases and provide a response to the report.  There was also to be a meeting convened immediately to address the difficulties which had arisen at the review team meetings.  This meeting eventually took place on 26 June 2017 but unfortunately resolved nothing.<br/><br/>On 26 May 2017, a draft response was provided to senior Garda management, which included the agreed review of the 41 cases.  A 123 page final report was submitted to senior Garda management on 7 June 2017.  This final version of the report included 20 pages of recommendations, made on the basis of the findings of the 2013 to 2015 review.  On 30 June 2017, another member of senior Garda management was also briefed by Ms Galligan and me, as the member was to set up a multi-agency working group to deal with policy and governance issues arising.<b><i></i></b>This group was to include representatives from the Central Statistics Office, the Policing Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality, among others.<br/><br/>In the weeks that followed, Ms Galligan continued to produce reports identifying cases of concern for 2017.  These reports were escalated to senior Garda management.  Again, these concerns related to potential misclassification of incidents and broader data quality issues.  Ms Galligan also continued to provide assistance with rectifying issues uncovered with regard to fatal collisions and incidents of dangerous driving causing death.  Ms Galligan also continued to refer cases to the protective services bureau, where we had very genuine concerns that a person may be living in a vulnerable situation.  For example, we made the decision to escalate cases where we felt that a new partner may be at risk.  These were identified as Ms Galligan did her utmost to piece together histories where escalation in the number and severity of incidents pointed to significant risk indicators.  At times this was like stitching together a patchwork quilt, as there were incidents that were correctly classified and then there were those found languishing in inappropriate categories, such as attention and complaints.  I strongly believed that we would never regret referring such instances to the protective services bureau, but we might regret not doing so.<br/><br/>I continued to pursue senior Garda management for responses and guidance as to how we should proceed with the review of other years.  I was concerned that GSAS had been tasked with reviewing a ten year period and only four years had been initially reviewed, with much more work required.  Between May and mid-September 2017, we continued to come under pressure to come to agreement regarding the 41 cases.  However, even following adjudication by a member of senior Garda management, agreement could not be reached because the stance was still to insist there was nothing wrong.  In mid-September 2017, Ms Galligan and I were informed that we had indeed been correct all along and that there were cases which had been misclassified.  This gave us an immense sense of relief and confirmed that we had been correct in standing our ground.  However, we have yet to receive any formal guidance as to what is required of us.<br/><br/>In particular, the stress and pressure we had been subjected to on a continuous basis from our first raising these issues have not been satisfactorily acknowledged or adequately addressed.  It is my view that we were subjected to severe pressure to withdraw our concerns, to ignore our professional standards and to agree with the views of the sworn members of the review team.  Our integrity, both personal and professional, was undermined and attacked.  We do not know what the motivation of the review team was in disregarding our views, seeking to minimise the importance of the issues and then seeking to force its report on us and have us sign off on same, inclusive of the scant and inadequate recommendations contained therein.<br/><br/>On 11 December 2017, Ms Galligan and I requested, by email, a private meeting with senior Garda management due to our ongoing concerns about the lack of progress.  This email seemed to set in motion the appointment of another member of senior Garda management to lead on the homicide review.  Our private meeting with senior Garda management occurred on 10 January 2018.  Ms Galligan and I also wrote to senior Garda management again on 12 January 2018.  While this seemed to promote some further activity, it would seem that recent media coverage of the homicide review and the intervention of the justice committee have led to the most significant progress to date.<br/><br/>Such was our level of concern at certain points of the process that we made attempts to engage with the Policing Authority by telephone or in writing on the following dates in 2017: 3 April; 16 May; 30 June; and 19 July.  As outlined earlier, a report was also prepared on 11 April 2017 for onward transmission to the Policing Authority, but I subsequently discovered on 12 May 2017 that this report had never been sent to the authority.  I do not understand the rationale for this, as there was no sensitive, case specific information included.  On 1 August 2017, I was told by a member of management that the member had been informed by a member of the Policing Authority, over the telephone, about the approaches I had made to the authority.  This was raised with me in the context of management trying to ascertain what my thinking was when I did this.  To date, we have met no one from the Policing Authority regarding the homicide review.<br/><br/>Ms Galligan and I are fully committed to doing everything possible to brief and support the newly established working group, which met properly for the first time on 19 February 2018.  We may be about to achieve the full and independent review of death classification and investigation that we have been consistently seeking since November 2016.  However, we still have no formal written direction as to what is required of us into the future or clarity as to how this will be balanced with existing demands.  Most notably, Ms Galligan&rsquo;s original methodology, which was the subject of particular attack, will form the cornerstone of the new working group.</p><p>We hope that a multi-agency group will soon be established to address the policy, governance and education aspects of the review as raised in our report of 7 June 2017.  We continue to have serious concerns about what will be done to address misclassification and data quality into 2018.  We are unaware of any current monitoring of the issue and, to our knowledge, no process has yet been agreed in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Galligan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018030700002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee and discuss current issues relating to the recording and classification of Garda homicide figures.  I am a senior crime and policing analyst in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I work within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service, GSAS, and have been attached to special crime operations since June 2016.  From 2012 to 2016, I worked in the position of the senior scientist in the Office of the State Pathologist and had sole responsibility for the management and running of the laboratory, where I performed all histopathological tests on samples from State post mortems performed by the State pathologists.  I also accompanied the forensic pathologists to crime scenes and assisted them in post mortem examinations.  My educational background includes a five-year honours degree in biomedical science and a postgraduate qualification in forensic medicine.  I am currently undertaking a professional certificate in governance.</p> <p>  In July 2016, my line manager, Ms West, assigned me responsibility for a ten-year domestic homicide review from 2007 to 2016 as requested by the Garda national protective services bureau.  Ms West had from the outset expressed general concerns about the data quality on the PULSE system.  To prepare for the assessment of how the ten-year review could be undertaken, I carried out an initial overview analysis of information contained on PULSE in regard to the homicide categories.  This involved assessing how easy it would be to recognise a homicide with a domestic element.</p> <p>  In September 2016, a meeting was held with the chief superintendent of the Garda national protective services bureau to discuss the action plan of the task.  With prior permission from Ms West, I suggested working in collaboration with the Office of the State Pathologist as, from my previous experience, I was aware the records of that office may contain more information on whether there was a domestic element to the death, which would greatly assist me in undertaking the ten-year review.  The suggestion was very much welcomed by the chief superintendent and other members of the Garda national protective services bureau.</p> <p>  I had met the State pathologist, Professor Marie Cassidy, to ascertain her interest in the work and wrote to her on 8 September 2016 requesting an agreement to collaborate data and information to carry out the review between the Office of the State Pathologist and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service.  On 14 September 2016, Professor Cassidy wrote to me to confirm her agreement to the collaboration.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Marie Cassidy, Dr. Linda Mulligan, Dr. Michael Curtis, Dr. Margot Bolster and all staff in the Office of the State Pathologist for accommodating the review as well as the professional support and advice they have continually offered me.</p> <p>  I compiled a domestic homicide review proposal which was sent to Ms West and the chief superintendent in the Garda national protective services bureau.  I set out the methodology I would utilise to conduct as comprehensive an analysis as possible and designed a template qualitative data sheet.</p> <p>  GSAS produces an internal homicide spreadsheet every month.  I was the analyst responsible for the spreadsheet in September to December, inclusive, in 2016.  In the four months I produced the spreadsheet, I noted the absence of a number of homicides from 2016 which were recorded as non-crime incidents of sudden death.</p> <p>  I commenced my analysis at the beginning of October 2016, utilising records from the Office of the State Pathologist, information on PULSE and the homicide spreadsheets produced monthly by GSAS for internal use.  When I reviewed the post mortem report and the circumstances surrounding the death, with consultation with the relevant forensic pathologist if required, I scrutinised PULSE for the recording of the death and other data quality parameters.  For no particular reason, I began with the year 2014 but quickly realised that there were inconsistencies evident with homicide and death classification as well as many data quality issues.  I immediately raised my concerns with my line manager, Ms West.</p> <p>  Following a period of three weeks in October 2016 when I was abroad on training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I resumed the homicide review in November 2016.  Ms West asked me specifically to consider a period of three years to ascertain any inconsistencies and the varying issues I had identified.  We decided to conclude with a sample of three years as it was pertinent that the issue be raised with Garda management as soon as possible.   On 24 November 2016, I emailed to GSAS management an 87 page report entitled Comparative Analysis of the Recording and Reporting of Homicide Incidents in the PULSE Database and the Office of the State Pathologist.  It regarded 43 cases I identified within the time period of 2013 to 2015, not all of which were potential homicides.  There were many areas of concern in regard to misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues.  I reviewed 524 deaths in total for that period.</p> <p>  There were four main areas of concern: deaths that were pathologically considered to be a homicide but recorded in the incorrect crime category and-or a non-crime category; deaths that were recorded at a later date as a homicide and-or recorded as occurring in the incorrect year; deaths deemed suspicious by virtue of cause of death and in which criminal involvement would be determined by Garda investigation but which were recorded in a non-crime category or no category; and deaths that had varying data quality issues such as the deceased not being marked as such on PULSE, an incorrect "weapon used" or date of birth being recorded for the deceased, or the incorrect Garda district or division being recorded for the death.</p> <p>  In mid-January 2017, a review group comprising myself, Ms West and officers from policy development, implementation and monitoring, PDIM, was created.  PDIM stated that two of the 43 deaths with which I had raised issue in the report from 2013 to 2015 would not be considered in the review for reasons that cannot be publicly disclosed due to legislative frameworks, and 41 cases were, therefore, the subject of review between PDIM and GSAS.  As mentioned by Ms West, nine meetings were held between January and March 2017 attended by individuals from PDIM, Ms West and me.  Robust discussions were had at the meetings and Ms West and I voiced our concerns at what we deemed a very serious issue of the recording and classification of deaths within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, we were not given the professional respect we deserved and, at times, I felt we were belittled and treated very poorly.  At no stage during the nine meetings was the methodology I utilised questioned by members of PDIM or referred to as weak.</p> <p>  During those months, I began interrogating the PULSE database to try to determine a little more background on how deaths can be and are recorded in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I identified that there are 16 incident categories on PULSE under which a death could potentially be recorded.  I considered this a significant number of ways to record a death and the categories were extremely varied in their descriptions according to the PULSE creation manual.  I continued to analyse the PULSE database and discovered that there are no identifiable parameters on PULSE for fatal or non-fatal hit-and-run incidents.  On inspection of some fatal hit-and-run incidents, I discovered they were all recorded as traffic collision fatal incidents, which is a non-crime category, but a criminal investigation is initiated from the time of such incident occurring.  I raised these issues among many others during the nine meetings with PDIM but we were quickly told they were not up for discussion and only the 41 cases were to be reviewed.  We felt that the various issues I was identifying were critical to highlighting the facts of misclassification in the recording of all types of deaths.</p> <p>  In January 2017, having continued the analysis of deaths in 2012, I wrote an 81 page report on various cases with serious anomalies and sent it to Ms West.  Areas of concern were consistent with the previous report and others identified were: deaths recorded in non-death categories such as missing persons, public order offences and attention and complaints; deaths being counted twice; and deaths not recorded for significant periods of time after they had occurred.  Although this report was completed, PDIM gave strict instructions not to be sent the report as it was not reviewing any more than the 41 cases from the three-year period.</p> <p>  Within this timeframe, I identified other issues that I immediately raised to various individuals in management.  I raised an incident of serious concern to the Garda national protective services bureau upon discovering that the partner of a deceased person was in a new domestic violent relationship.  I have since highlighted several such cases to the Garda national protective services bureau and that led to the establishment of Operation Devise, in which I have been involved.  I highlighted an incident that I had discussed with the chief superintendent in the Garda national protective services bureau which was recorded as a non-crime incident but was a domestic murder-suicide incident.  Following inquiries with the relevant division by the chief superintendent, the incident was appropriately reclassified that evening.</p> <p>  In February, I had a routine meeting with my manager, Ms West, during which I expressed my concerns at GSAS continuing to produce the monthly homicide spreadsheet in view of our being unable to guarantee the accuracy of PULSE.  It was agreed with Ms West that I would review January 2017, in collaboration with Professor Marie Cassidy and the Office of the State Pathologist, to compare the cases carried out and the corresponding PULSE incident recorded.  In March 2017, I wrote a report entitled Data Quality Issues with Death Classification 2017 which was sent to management.  There were many areas of concern in terms of misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues.</p><p>There were three unrecorded homicides as of the end of February 2017.  One of the unrecorded homicides was raised at a senior leadership meeting the next day.  It still remained recorded incorrectly for a further six months, despite being highlighted numerous times.  There were cases with the following concerns: homicides misclassified; suicides misclassified; hit-and-run incidents recorded as non-crime traffic fatal incidents; suspicious deaths under sudden death classification; and natural deaths containing PULSE data quality issue.<br/><br/>At the end of April 2017, I was extremely surprised when it was announced in the media that the review into homicides was complete, and the conclusion was that there were only &quot;minor misclassifications&quot;.  It was at the public Policing Authority meeting on 27 April that we became aware that the review team had written a report.  Neither Ms West nor I, as part of the review team, had any input nor were our views taken into consideration in the drafting of the report.  On receipt of the report on 8 May, it became immediately clear why the report was not shared with us.  On reading of the report, I felt very personally insulted by the commentary regarding my work and my methodology.  As previously mentioned, at no stage during the nine meetings was any criticism voiced regarding the inappropriateness of my methodology.  It had now been concluded that the methodology I had utilised in comparing the records of the OSP and the PULSE system was &quot;inherently weak&quot;, &quot;inappropriate&quot;, &quot;confined&quot; and &quot;restricted&quot;.  The days between 8 and 10 May were troublesome, in that PDIM brought significant pressures to sign off on the report that we had only just received.  Like Ms West, I professionally and ethically could not agree to a report I knew was completely inaccurate and misleading.  I remained assured that there were homicides misclassified and incorrectly recorded.<br/><br/>In May 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017: PULSE Categorisation &amp;amp; Office of the State Pathologist Categorisation, which was sent to management.  There were many areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, such as 33 homicides recorded as of May 2017, three of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; six unrecorded homicides recorded as follows: non-crime incidents of person misadventure - sudden death; non-fatal incidents of assault causing harm; and non-fatal incidents of discharging a firearm.  There were a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017, all of which are unidentifiable in the recording on PULSE.  These incidents are routinely recorded as a non-crime incident of traffic - traffic collision FATAL when a criminal investigation is ongoing.  In the email sending this report, I stated:</p><blockquote>There are many victims going unnoticed by this organisation the longer this goes on.  When these cases are being recorded as a non-crime category of Sudden Death or even Discharging a Firearm, is there any follow up with the victim&rsquo;s family or liaison with a FLO.  Is there even a FLO being assigned?  The deceased victims have not been given the respect and duty of investigation into their deaths that they deserve.  Sadly, the majority of 2017 homicides are of a domestic nature, again going unreported. <br /><br />This is 2017 in four months 2013 to 2015 we are now satisfied that PDIM have reviewed, but see nothing but &lsquo;minor inaccuracies&rsquo;, which is completely incorrect.  I am not going to lose my work ethic or determination over this, and one didn&rsquo;t build Rome in a day.  However, I cannot continue to identify incidents of homicide as we continue in 2017 that are not recorded correctly or not knowing whether there is an adequate investigation being carried out into that person&rsquo;s death.</blockquote><p>In June 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending May 2017, which was sent directly to senior Garda management.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues, such as 18 homicides recorded as of May 2017, three of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; six unrecorded homicides, still unchanged from previous report; ten suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime classification, although a criminal investigation was initiated; and a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017, all of which were recorded as a non-crime incident of traffic - traffic collision FATAL.<br/><br/>In July 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending June 2017, which was sent directly to senior Garda management again.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues, such as 20 homicides recorded as of May 2017, three of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; nine unrecorded homicides recorded in non-crime or a non-fatal crime incident type; ten suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime classification, although a criminal investigation was initiated; and a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017 recorded as a non-crime incident of traffic collision FATAL, when a criminal investigation was ongoing.<br/><br/>In August 2017, I wrote a report entitled Traffic: Dangerous Driving Causing Death Incidents: PULSE Categorisation analysis 2003-2017, which was sent to management.  There were many areas of concern in the recording of the dangerous driving death incident type over the years 2003 to 2017.<br/><br/>I also wrote a report in August 2017 entitled Review of 2006 Homicides &ndash; Murder and Manslaughter: PULSE Categorisation Analysis, and sent this to GSAS management for onward transmission.  This was an overview document regarding the adherence to crime counting rule 3.1 in 2006.  As per headquarters directive 139/03, section 3.1 states, &quot;A reclassification within homicide occurs where a murder is reclassified to manslaughter when a charge of manslaughter commences or when a murder charge results in a conviction for manslaughter&quot;.  This review analysed conviction records and detection status for all homicide incidents as well.<br/><br/>In October 2017, I wrote two reports entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending September 2017, and An Analysis of Death Incidents &ndash; September 2017, which were sent directly to senior management.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues such as 37 homicides recorded as of May 2017, seven of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; six unrecorded homicides recorded in non-crime or a non-fatal crime incident type - a number of the previous highlighted misclassified homicides had been reclassified to a homicide so there were new homicides; 11 suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime classification although a criminal investigation was initiated; and six fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents recorded in 2017 as a non-crime incident of traffic collision FATAL.  I also had queries as to why in some deaths with concerning details the State Pathologist was not requested when a crime scene was held at the death.  There were deaths that should be classified as suicide or that had a suicide incident recorded which resulted in double counting of the death, according to the detail in the narrative.  There were varying data quality issues.<br/><br/>In November 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending October 2017, which was sent to management.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues, such as 40 homicides recorded as of October 2017, seven of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; five unrecorded homicides, recorded in non-crime or a non-fatal crime incident type; 13 suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime incident, although a criminal investigation was initiated; a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017 recorded as the non-crime incident of traffic collision FATAL; 18 dangerous driving causing death incidents recorded for 2017, four of which did not occur in 2017, one had been invalidated, and one had three fatalities but only one crime incident when there should have been one for each victim; and 95 deaths in October with varying types of data quality issues.<br/><br/>I have continued to highlight to the current day cases that I believe are of concern in areas of homicide, traffic fatal incidents, suicide, sudden death and, indeed, homicide attempts.  The classification of death incidents on PULSE requires an urgent review and needs to be simplified.  The review of the classification comparing PULSE and the OSP is based on the pathological classification, but the ultimate arbitrator of the classification of death is the coroner.  Unfortunately, coroners do not publish statistics.  I have been directed to complete a review of all files in the OSP between 2003 and 2017, totalling more than 3,000 deaths, for classification purposes and investigation review using the methodology from the initial review.I will endeavour to complete this as quickly as is possible and also to complete the requested domestic homicide review that was initially requested by the Garda national protective services bureau.  I will continually strive as an analyst in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure every death is recorded correctly, not just for statistical purposes but mainly for the victims and their families.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before committee to provide clarity and context to the work that we do.</p></speech>

Their presentations illustrate very concerning levels of dysfunction at an organisational level where there is a clear mismatch between what is being pronounced publicly or to us as committee members and what is happening behind closed doors.  It is a case of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>with respect to data and the PULSE system.  Clearly, there are systemic problems.  Ms West and Ms Galligan commenced a review and were part of the group which held nine meetings.  Ms West has mentioned that she was instructed not to send the summary to the policy development, implementation and monitoring, PDIM, group.  What does she believe was the motivation behind stopping the summary being sent to that group?</p></speech>

When we inquired, the rationale we were given was the particular group had been given a very narrow brief, that it had only been asked to look at the particular sample period between 2013 and 2015, whereas Ms Galligan and I had entered into the project on the understanding it was a much bigger, broader piece of work.</p></speech>

As Ms Galligan said in her presentation, it was during the course of the public meeting of the Policing Authority on 27 April 2017 that we learned of the existence of such a report.  To this day, I am not clear if that report or a very refined version of it was sent to the Policing Authority.  Ms Galligan's expertise and background are clear from her presentation and I felt it was an insult to the work she had done.  Also, as her line manager, I have a duty of care towards her and felt that it was incumbent on me to give a full and robust response to the report.  As I said, we only came into possession of it on 8 May 2017 and at the time we asked that we be given additional time to go through it in detail.  We also needed to revisit the original 87 page report Ms Galligan had submitted in November 2016 and compare and contrast the findings on the 41 cases.</p></speech>

We understood there was to be a meeting on 10 May.  Our management was to be present, plus members of the PDIM group who had been part of the review team with us.  They were very tense meetings at which there were raised voices and it got was very heated.  We are not sure from where the ultimate pressure was coming to sign off on the 41 cases.  In particular, within the PDIM group's report there were four or five very basic recommendations which we did not believe went any of the way towards addressing the issues that had been raised, but there certainly seemed to be pressure coming from somewhere to sign off on the recommendations.  I am not sure if it was to satisfy a requirement for the Policing Authority or something else, but we certainly felt significant pressure was being brought to bear at those meetings.  As I said in my statement, I also received telephone calls.</p></speech>

Both delegates have mentioned in their evidence that there had been no disagreement at the nine previous meetings and that there had been a collaborative approach to trying to address the issues involved.  Was it purely pressure to sign off on the report or was there the crux of a disagreement on the backdrop to the data analysis?</p></speech>

It only became clear when we saw the report coming through.  It had not really been discussed at the meetings.  To us, it felt more as if there was pressure from somewhere to get the report across the line and to have something delivered, but, as we said, we could not agree with it.  We stood firm and did not agree to sign off on it.</p></speech>

Contact was made by someone within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Was she concerned that the Policing Authority had made no contact with her or Ms Galligan?</p></speech>

Earlier I noted the dates on which we had tried to make contact.  On the first two occasions it was an attempt to make contact by telephone.  On the third occasion, on 30 June 2017, we wrote in quite some detail because we were very concerned about statements that had been made during the public meeting of the Policing Authority on 29 June 2017.  When we wrote again on 19 July, it was in response to a letter we had received from the Policing Authority asking if it would be possible to share the letter with Garda colleagues to obtain their responses.  Unfortunately, at the time we felt it would not be pertinent to do so as we were already facing certain adversity.  The workplace has not been particularly pleasant for either of us for the past 15 months and at the time we felt it would be too inflammatory.</p></speech>

There are four sets of data - four reports - for the homicide and suspicious death incidents.  There appears to be a growing number in each of the metrics used for homicides, the unrecorded numbers, deaths where there was no crime, where there was suspicion regarding a death and fatal hit and runs.  It is clear that there is a rolling discovery that occurred last year.  Has the matter been rectified or does Ms Galligan believe there are still problems with the core pillars she has outlined in the submission?</p></speech>

However, on the morning of 14 September 2017, I became aware 41 Excel spreadsheets had been disseminated down, albeit not to us.  When the person who brought these to my attention opened the first one, I was shocked to discover that it was actually now noted as one that needed to be reclassified and that continued.

That would be one of the issues we identified in the course of this work.  It definitely appears as though there have been slightly different interpretations of the crime counting rules.  To us it was very clear that if, for example, a person was the victim of an assault and some time subsequent to that assault he or she passed away as a result, that would immediately warrant that incident being upgraded to a homicide.</p> <p>  In reality, what was happening in a lot of cases was that a sudden death incident was being created to reflect the fact that the person had died.  That may have happened because he or she had passed away in a hospital in another district.  However, there did not seem to be this correct interpretation of the crime counting rules that when a person passed away as the result of an assault, it was immediately to be upgraded to a homicide on the PULSE system. </p></speech>

A small data quality unit has been established within the information services centre in Castlebar.  I am sure that is making a difference in respect of data quality.  However, we have also raised concerns about the limitations of that.  A data quality group can only make an assessment on the basis of the information that is on PULSE.<br/><br/>As an example, if an incident is created as an assault but there was actually a fatality, that would not be apparent to the information services centre.  It would make the presumption that the incident was classified correctly when indeed it is not.  It should be a homicide.  Yes, I have ongoing data quality concerns.  I do not necessarily feel it would be pertinent to get into the specifics of other issues today<b></b>but it is an ongoing problem and something with which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does struggle.  </p></speech>

There are a number of discriminatory or motivating factors for an incident.  Domestic abuse is one, there also is one for hate crime and there are a number of others.  There is a lack of consistency in completing those fields.  In a majority of cases they are just not filled out at all.  As analysts, we are scientists who use data and these are the fields we would use to try to aggregate data to be able to look at particular trends.</p> <p>  It has always been difficult for us to do any kind of quality reporting in respect of hate crime and domestic incidents for that reason.  It becomes a very manual process where an analyst actually has to go in and trawl through what is called the PULSE narrative.  A small amount of information is entered into the PULSE narrative about the incident.  Sometimes it might say in there that it is a domestic incident, for example, a husband and a wife.  However, that does not translate into the motivating factor being ticked for domestic and that is really the way the figures are compiled.  That is a big problem.</p></speech>

It is an area on which the committee is working and members had other witnesses before them a number of weeks ago.  Hearing the witnesses' evidence is very helpful to the committee.  I will ask Ms West a number of questions to get a broad summary of what I think are some of the crucial aspects that have been identified.  In July 2016, her bureau was requested to conduct a review of domestic homicides for ten years, that is, from 2007 to 2016.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It spans very many different areas, from being able to ascertain our crime levels to the deployment of resources, for example.  In this particular work, we were concerned whether, if the incidents were not being captured correctly on the PULSE system as homicide, there were other issues.  Certainly with regard to some incidents, we did begin to raise some concerns that the investigations perhaps needed to be reviewed, just to be on the safe side.</p> <p>  As I said to Deputy Chambers, there is a very significant issue when complete and accurate data are not entered on the PULSE system.  We, as analysts trying to use the data at the other end, cannot give a robust and complete analysis if we do not have accurate and complete data.  It becomes very concerning for me in regard to areas such as domestic abuse.  Deputy Clare Daly raised this a couple of weeks ago.  Any research done on domestic abuse points to there being an escalation in incidents in the types of scenarios in question.  Therefore, it is essential to capture even the smallest of incidents where garda&iacute; are called out to a property and where there may be nothing to see there at the time.  It may, however, be the beginning of a pattern or escalation.  In order to be able to protect vulnerable citizens in their own homes across this country, we need to be able to identify where there is an escalation with regard to this type of incident.</p></speech>

There is also an element in regard to vetting if incidents are not recorded on the PULSE system correctly and if suspected offenders are not correctly linked to incidents, for example.  I am concerned that when we are vetting people for positions in which they might be interacting with vulnerable people, we could be missing things.</p></speech>

I have concerns about trying to set timeframes for this and I absolutely understand the public concern.  That is why Ms Galligan and I have been pushing for the past 15 months to get this work done but Ms Galligan has a particular expertise.  She is the only person who can do certain elements of this work and she will also be required to sit as part of the review team to debate the classifications of these cases.  We are committed to being part of the peer review and to the investigations.  There is only so much that one person can do in the working day, regardless of how diligent and conscientious he or she is.  It will take time.</p> <p>  As Dr. Singh alluded to a few weeks ago, we are not necessarily in control of everything ourselves.  We are dependent on availability within the OSP for a workspace for Ms Galligan in order that she does not impact on its day-to-day work.

In her statement, she raised an incident of serious concern upon discovering the partner of a deceased person was in a new domestic violent relationship.

If the incident is not recorded correctly, there is no way that we can analyse or predict any escalation of a domestic violent relationship.  One of the reasons for the domestic homicide review was to identify whether there are trends in the escalation or whether they are lone events.  However, if it not recorded correctly on PULSE, there is no way for us to analyse other than to go through everything incident by incident.  That is what I was doing.  I would go in, look at an incident and keep going back manually.  It is a time-consuming exercise.</p></speech>

Everything connected with this is of enormous public interest, whether it relates to the seriousness of the crime, the ability of the public to have full faith in reporting such serious crime and how this has been managed.  Another is how it has been presented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is something about which I continue to be concerned.  I want to pay particular tribute to our witnesses, as clearly enormous pressure and stress was placed on them and I am grateful to them for coming before the committee.</p><p>Ms West's statement referred to a phone call on 12 May.  At this committee's last meeting which discussed this issue with Garda management, there was much discussion about the April meeting of the Policing Authority.  That is significant because it was the first time that this was properly discussed in a public forum.  On that occasion the impression was falsely given that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a whole was satisfied with the report, as was the review group.  Ms West has since put on the record that that was not the case, as did Dr. Singh some weeks ago.  However, the explanation given to the committee at that meeting three weeks ago was very much to the effect that it was something of an oversight.  In this regard, Mr. Michael Finn remarked:</p><blockquote>I accept that concerns were raised about this.  In the report presented to the Policing Authority in April somebody had reviewed the investigations and clarified that an investigation had been carried out in each of the 41 incidents.  The error, however, was made in that we did not sit down with the analysts and raise or surface the issue of whether the investigations had all been properly classified.</blockquote> <p>To a great extent it was presented as an error or oversight.  In the context of this phone call, it is quite clear that the concerns which Ms West and Ms Galligan raised in their report had been discussed among senior garda personnel at a meeting on 13 April, prior to that meeting.  In that context, do the witnesses think it is credible that it was simply an oversight that they themselves were not consulted prior to the report being presented to the policing authority?  </p></speech>

I can only go by what I have been told and looking at it through my lens, but I would find it difficult to believe that.</p></speech>

It followed on from some media coverage on 1 April which had created an interest in the review.  Ms Galligan was in a meeting that morning, so I pulled together some of the documentation we already had.  It was all at a very high level with no case-sensitive information; we never would have discussed case-sensitive information outside of the appropriate forums.  I included some more up-to-date information about where we were in the review and did a synopsis of the very high-level data quality issues we were finding.  The Policing Authority had requested that report by return on 11 April so I dutifully did the report and sent it up through the chain of command.  The next day I queried whether the report had gone and was told that it had not gone yet but it would go now.  There is a Policing Authority liaison office through which everything destined for the authority goes.  That is for the necessary protections in relation to data, freedom of information and so on.  I had no real reason subsequent to that to think that the report would not have gone to the Policing Authority.</p> <p>  There seemed to be some concern over that report.  I am not sure what the concerns were.  My understanding would be that there was perhaps a pre-meeting on 12 April to a private Policing Authority meeting that was due on 13 April.  My understanding was that both of the reports were discussed at that pre-meeting.  However, I was not present and could not say anything further about what decisions were taken or why.  </p></speech>

At that stage, it was informed that the report was close to conclusion, and once again, gave no impression that there was anything untoward and that everything was progressing.

The 87 page report from November 2016 outlined four areas for concern, of which one stands out.  As Ms Galligan put it in her statement there were &quot;deaths that the cause of death deemed it suspicious and the Garda investigation would ascertain whether criminality was involved or not, yet these were recorded in a non-crime category or no category at all&quot;.  Later in her statement, Ms Galligan referred to an email relating to her May 2017 report in which she wrote:</p><blockquote>The deceased victims have not been given the respect and duty of investigation into their deaths that they deserve. </blockquote> <p>Later on, she wrote:</p><blockquote>However, I cannot continue to identify incidents of homicide as we continue in 2017 that are not recorded correctly or not knowing whether there is an adequate investigation being carried out into that person&rsquo;s death.</blockquote> <p>One of the biggest areas of concern is whether among all the potentially misclassified cases are a number of homicides that were not properly investigated.  That would be the biggest concern for any member of the public listening to this today.  In Ms Galligan's statement, that possibility is raised twice.  Is there a possibility in Ms Galligan's mind that there are families who have lost a loved one who may have died through homicide, who may not be aware of that?</p></speech>

When I look at the classification and see that homicides are misclassified as non-crime or non-fatal incidents, I question why they are classified as such.  An interpretation of the crime counting rules would say that if investigators have a reasonable probability that they have a homicide, then a homicide investigation is usually initiated and should be recorded as a homicide.</p><p>Obviously, we have not seen the investigation files in any of the 41 cases, although going forward we will be part of the review team, but it is important that we see the files from an analytical point of view in order that we can give our expert view on them.  We never claim to be investigators.  We raised the issue because the issue was there with the classification, which would also raise concerns as regards the investigation.</p></speech>

She said: "As it transpired, there was an apparent reluctance to countenance many of the issues we tried to raise and we made many attempts to highlight the potential organisational risks, the inconsistencies we were identifying and the absolute need to review the approach to death classification and investigation, not only within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but in collaboration with partner agencies".

However, regarding why we felt there was a reluctance, every time we tried to introduce a reference to a particular case from outside of the three-year sample period, we were shouted down and we were not permitted to bring those cases into consideration.  I do not want to go into the specifics because I do not want to allude to particular cases but there were certain conversations around policy matters, for example.  A policy cannot be written on the basis of a sample review.  That would be short-sighted because there are nuances in each investigation and there can be differences.  If one writes a policy that suits a particular group of incidents, it may not suit others.  When one is doing something as important as writing policy, it is important that one is cognisant of all the variables when doing that.  It felt at times that there was pressure to rewrite policy there and then as if Ms Galligan and I were the people who had the difficulty with the policy and, therefore, it was incumbent on us to say how we wanted it worded.  This was never about Ms Galligan and I; this was about the concerns we had in relation to public confidence and reputational damage.  We never at any stage wanted any of it to be personal; we just wanted to try to resolve the issues.  It was of concern of us when we felt that we were not being allowed to raise pertinent issues.</p></speech>

However, Ms West has detailed clearly in what is the same report essentially that between 8 and 10 May, she felt significant pressure was brought to bear on her to sign off on the report.  She stated that professionally she could not sign off on the report and that she made that clear.  It seems there is something here, which might not quite be a discrepancy.  If pressure was brought to bear on her, it is difficult to imagine that pressure was not brought to bear on Dr. Singh.  In what way did the pressure manifest itself?  Was it a series of phone calls and emails saying that the report needs to be signed off by a certain time and that needs to be the end of it?</p></speech>

There seemed to be meetings ongoing that neither Ms Galligan or I were present at, yet other members of the review team were.  I took a little umbrage at that because I did not feel that that was equitable or that we were being given the opportunity to properly represent our views.  Whether pressure was brought to bear during those meetings at which I was not present, I can only go by what I have been told or comments that have been made to me.  Other people were present at the meetings on 9 and 10 May and pressure was certainly brought to bear on us.  It is for others to answer whether they felt that.  We were the key actors in the homicide review.  It was critical that the understanding of the Policing Authority was that it had to come back as joint sign-off and, therefore, it was of particular import that Ms Galligan and I agreed to sign off.</p></speech>

The fact that Ms Galligan and I are sitting here today was not a decision that we took lightly but we felt that throughout the past 15 months, our views were not taken seriously enough.  When we made particular personal representations because of a concern about lack of progress, we would see a small period of activity thereafter, including a number of meetings and so on, but that never tended to last.  They still did not get traction which was of great concern to me and that is why at certain times we tried to bring others into the equation to give us that little bit of support that we felt we required to get the key messages across, understood and dealt with.</p></speech>

Since that date, has there been an improvement in her experience or does she still feel insufficient priority is being given to the review and that she and her work have been treated with adequate respect and importance?</p></speech>

We sent an email on 11 December seeking a meeting with senior Garda management because of our ongoing concerns about the lack of progress.  We again saw a small flurry of activity afterwards and it was possibly on foot of this that another senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was appointed to lead a new working group.  With Christmas and so on, it was 5 January before the group first met.  We raised concerns after that meeting.  We still felt that there was no clear direction.  We always recognised how expansive an issue it was, that there were various elements to the work that needed to occur, and that it was important that the work was sequenced in such a fashion that certain parts did not cut across others.</p><p>We were aware that a multi-agency working group was to be set up, but it still has not been set up.  My concern would be how the two groups would interrelate so that one would not overlap on the other and if there were to be any impacts from one to the other, we would need to have very clear terms of reference for both.</p><p> We met properly with the new review team on 19 February 2018.  I feel much more reassured.  I feel there is a genuine appetite to involve us at every stage and that matters will not be signed off on, unless we have said that we are happy also.  Perhaps we are about to get what we have been asking for from day one, which was a full and independent review of death and homicide classifications. </p></speech>

Obviously we do not have the clout the Policing Authority would have, but I would have a concern that when people who have particular expertise and professional backgrounds who have been recruited into the organisation and are paid from the public purse have pointed at and have evidence that others in the organisation have issues that need to be addressed, they are not listened to.</p></speech>

An independent peer review is absolutely crucial because one of the flaws the Policing Authority identified in the investigative side of the review was that the same people who were involved in the initial investigation were asked to review it again.  That is far from ideal in terms of a process.  My understanding is that this review will be carried out independently.</p> <p>  Is it the case that the overall review will continue under the auspices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but with the peer review to be conducted independently or is the entire process to be steered by an independent person?</p></speech>

What we were always dissatisfied with was exactly what the Deputy has stated, that the original people involved in the investigations were initially contacted by phone and asked if everything was OK with the investigation.  When the second attempt at a review was undertaken, I understand that they were written to and that the chief in the division had to sign off on the response that was coming back.  That did not satisfy us because we would have the same concerns as the committee and others that Garda were looking at other Garda members' investigations and not actually reviewing the investigation files.  Yes, there was certain information that was collected and looked at, which we did not see, so we cannot comment on that.  From our point of view we always felt that it had to be a full and independent review.  Ideally I would have liked external senior investigating officers from another force or from somewhere else that would do that job, but we do not have that easily at our disposal.</p> <p>  We have met the new review team and they are in regular contact and are engaging with us.  I have no reason to lack confidence in that.  Ms Galligan and I have entered into every single one of these review processes enthusiastically and in good faith.  We will absolutely do the same on this occasion.  My main concern would be how we take on the level of work that will be required in respect of other demands and in particular the amount of work Ms Galligan will be required to do because of her expertise.  I think we have to manage the timeframes and the expectations realistically.</p></speech>

Is it possible to quantify the misclassification of the data that can be put down to weaknesses with PULSE, human error or other factors?  Could Ms West give an indication as to the origin of the misclassification?</p> <p>  We need to focus on how we move on from this point.  In addition to the review continuing and reaching a conclusion, what should the committee, the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be doing to rectify the matter and to ensure it is not repeated?</p></speech>

That will be part of it.  It will be in the end report of every single death that will be reviewed the reason that it was misclassified incorrectly - whether it was human error, the limitation of PULSE, or whatever reason.</p></speech>

One can see where there would be debates about the classification of an incident, some would be more in a grey area and could be difficulty to determine straight away.  I think part of the difficulty has been that PULSE is seen as optional at times, or it is one of the last things to be considered.</p> <p>  As an investigation progresses, obviously everybody involved in that investigation is extremely busy and it has been felt at times, there has been more of a slack attitude towards updating PULSE, that it has been seen as less important than other aspects.  There certainly seems to be that misunderstanding around the crime classification.  Ms Galligan and I did work in September with members of PDIM, the policy development, implementation and monitoring, group to put together a more comprehensive clarification of the crime counting rules to try to make the interpretation of them much clearer and easier to follow, so that everybody would be consistently applying the same logic.  There are very many elements to it.  As Ms Galligan said they will be looked at in the round as part of the new review.</p> <p>  In terms of moving it forward, we will fully support it.  There is quite a significant team that has been put together.  We have high hopes for that team but one of the things that would be important for me is to address the fact that sometimes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feels that it has to resolve all the issues on its own and is not very good at asking for help or saying when it does not have adequate resources.  There is a culture of making do.  There is a great can do attitude.  Fantastic work goes on in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a lot of that is down to the goodwill of the people who work there and their determination to work very hard to serve the public and to do the best they can, but at times we need to ask for help, whether that is money, external expertise or assistance from other agencies, even others within the Department of Justice and Equality.  It can take more than just one body to resolve a particular issue.</p></speech>

I know they have covered a lot of ground with my colleagues so far.  I have a couple of points I wish to touch on, and I will try not to go over issues that have been dealt with already.</p> <p>  My first question is more relevant to Ms West who has been working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for ten years.</p><p>What the witnesses have described of this sequence of events to us is very disturbing.  Is this a completely isolated incident in Ms West's ten years working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or is it part of any pattern or any previous incidents of a similar nature with which she is familiar?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-07a.653" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lois West" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018030700002#Q00200"><p>I have been working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for nearly 11 years.  When we had the first analysts in in 2008 we hit the ground running.  We have done some exceptional work right from the beginning.  The analysts and the management team in GSAS have always raised a concern about the quality of the data with which we had to work.  When analysts produced a report, they tended to put a section into it outlining the particular data quality issues that were hampering their ability to do a complete and robust analysis.  We have also found that the analysts frequently have to do quite a lot of data cleansing to make the data as workable as possible, which is far from ideal because it is very time-consuming and takes away from the ability to actually do the work.  These concerns have always been raised in these reports, many of which ultimately ended up with senior Garda management, and this issue has been discussed along the way.  I feel there have been many occasions on which we have escalated reports and they may not have got the requisite attention.  That said, I would make a qualification.  We have an exceptionally good working relationship for the most part with the officers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Exceptional support is given to operational work and particular investigations, and we do a lot of work to feed into the formulation of strategies and so on in so far as we can.  For me, this has polarised things quite a lot.  What has happened in this instance is fairly exceptional.  Previous to this, it was perhaps a failure to fully address issues that was raised in reports.  This, to me, feels like probably a little more than that.</p></speech>

I appreciate and echo her sentiments that there are many excellent officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who work above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the Garda delivers on solving crime and in its day-to-day work.  However, I want to go back to the other part of what Ms West said.  It strikes me, listening to the answer she gave - and I do not want to put words into her mouth - that there was effectively a systematic way of disregarding information on the part of management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over these years in that it escalated a matter if it did not like it.  Unfortunately for these members, they got caught this time around in that there are new structures in place - the Policing Authority, etc. - which meant it was not possible for them just to take the stuff and ignore what the analysts were saying.  This incident escalated out of that.  They had to effectively cut the witnesses out of the reporting loop.  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

I do not really want to be drawn to comment that far.  Analysis was new to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ten years ago.  There probably was a lack of familiarity with analytical product and what should be done with it on receipt of it.  Therefore, there has been a learning curve over that ten year period, during which officers have become very familiar with our analytical reports and monthly reporting and the various ways in which we can support investigations.  We have also supported the senior investigating officer and detective sergeant training courses.  I think there is a better understanding of what analysts can bring, but at the same time it has felt like an uphill battle at times when one is trying to draw to the attention of senior Garda management that there are particular issues and one does not seem to gain the traction one would hope for.</p></speech>

I want to link the witnesses to this to bring the meeting up to this particular sequence of meetings we are going through.  There seems to me to be a problem with the civilian interaction with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When Ms West talks about the fact that in this sequence of events there were meetings to review that she was not at, would it be fair to say that all the other people present in those meetings were probably serving Garda officers?</p></speech>

I raised it at our last meeting.  If the meeting of the Policing Authority took place on 27 April, how did it take until 8 May for a request that this unsatisfactory report be commented on?  Dr. Singh said to me, when I asked him about this, that he tried to get the report.  I am totally confused as to how something can be given to the Policing Authority at a meeting at which the witnesses were present and it takes from 27 April until 8 May for a copy of it to be made available.  Do the witnesses have any indication as to why they were not furnished, on the day of 27 April or on any immediate subsequent day, with the full report?</p></speech>

It was a surprise to us when we heard on 27 April that such a report existed.  I know that Dr. Singh asked for it, I believe on 12 April and again on the morning of the Policing Authority meeting of 27 April.  I am not sure why it was not forthcoming to us until 8 May, but certainly when we first looked at it I could imagine that there may not have been an appetite to share it with us.</p></speech>

I am not sure if it was given the full report as we got it on 8 May or if it was just a redacted, sanitised table of incidents, so I am not clear if this report actually went to the authority.  Certainly the report that was presented to us on 8 May was deeply concerning to us.</p></speech>

The witnesses have raised a very interesting new area today.  The Policing Authority's actions in this case seem to me to be very interesting.  There was a meeting on 27 April.  My understanding and calculations of the various dates - if I am wrong, I ask the witnesses to correct me - is that Ms West made one direct appeal to the Policing Authority prior to that meeting of 27 April to discuss this issue with her or to take a phone call about it.  Did Ms West actually speak to anyone?  Was her call not returned?  I am not being smart, but did she leave a voicemail message?  How did that call go, and what did the Policing Authority do about that call prior to this meeting of 27 April?</p></speech>

I spoke to a lady; I am not sure exactly who she was.  I believe that a message was to be conveyed to a member of the Policing Authority that we were seeking to have a conversation about the homicide review.  My understanding is that the request to meet was declined.</p></speech>

Reservations were expressed quite openly to that meeting by Dr. Singh, etc.  The witnesses then made subsequent efforts to contact the Policing Authority; it had subsequent meetings before we got to the point of resolution in September.  What was the tone of the contact by the Policing Authority to the witnesses or its attitude to them during that period regarding their effort to communicate with it?</p></speech>

It was very much the same as the first liaison, which was that I spoke to a lady.  I believe there was a message conveyed and no meeting resulted.  I had made contact at that stage because of my deep concerns over what had played out in the week to two weeks prior to that.  As I noted in my statement, I had written a lengthy letter internally within the organisation on 11 May 2017.  When I made that call on 16 May, I was quite surprised to hear that the letter had been seen by the authority.  I could only conclude that it was my letter of 11 May, which I had not shared with the Policing Authority.  That was an internal document, so I am not sure how it came into possession of that.</p> <p>  We then wrote a letter to the Policing Authority on 30 June, which was obviously the day after the 29 June public Policing Authority meeting.  I suppose our frustration was escalating at that stage.  We had ongoing concerns.  We were not happy about how the meeting had played out on 29 June.  We received a response to that letter on 12 July, which was really asking if the letter could be shared with Garda colleagues for their response.  I understand, of course, everybody has to be able to give their explanation or reasons they said certain things.  However, because we felt under pressure and that the workplace was not the best place to be, we did not want to complicate matters further for ourselves at that time.  We then received an acknowledgement of the letter we sent on 19 July, declining at that time to share that letter.  We offered to help the authority in any way we could.  I suppose at that stage we probably felt that some protections would have to be offered to us if we were going to be exposed to Garda colleagues as it were.  The acknowledgement we got back from 19 July was maybe a bit dismissive.  The content was that it was noted with thanks.</p></speech>

This relates more to Ms Galligan's area.  A layperson listening to anything like this would be knocking their head against a wall wondering how a garda cannot know when a homicide is a homicide and how a classification can be so wrong.  I appreciate Ms Galligan gave us some very detailed information and alluded to the fact that there can be certain grey ones.  However, we seem to be way beyond the area of certain individual grey cases into just people not recording.  In light of other ways in which the Garda has recorded figures, we get to this.</p><p>I know there is a review and the changes the witnesses have outlined.  Is it fair to say that either the current PULSE system is structurally completely unsound for recording data or, as Ms Galligan also made reference to at one point, garda&iacute; are not filling in fields - maybe choosing to leave them blank?  What is at the heart of the mis-recording at an input level?  Is it structurally completely inept and not working or is there just a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude to actually inputting information or is it a combination?</p></speech>

Culturally it has been that it was okay to record a suspicious death under a "sudden death" category, which is non-crime, until the investigation was well advanced.  They may be awaiting the DPP to return either a homicide direction.  They may then reclassify or they may forget to or whatever the case may be.  I do not know why.  There are grey areas where it is not as clear-cut at the beginning that a certain case is a homicide.  There are some very grey areas.  For example, if somebody has blunt-force trauma it could be accidental or it could be caused by a third party and an investigation will ascertain that.  As regards why they do not fill in the fields, I cannot comment as to the reason.</p></speech>

We documented this in our 17 June report in the recommendations section.  It is hard to understand why there would be 16 different ways to classify a death in PULSE.  That will only add to confusion that members feel.  For example, there is a "sudden death" category and a "dead body, no offence disclosed" category.  That could nearly be seen as an optional choice.  What is the difference?  I am sure when they were devised and added to the system, there was a rationale.  Over time the person who asked for that to be added is no longer there and others do not understand why it was added or what it was for.</p> <p>  A pattern can be seen where a particular division will be recording in a particular category that no other division really uses.  Again that confuses the issue.  From our point of view, one of the first things that needed to happen was an overhaul of PULSE - to refine that, to simplify and bring down the number of ways a death can be recorded.  As Ms Galligan would say from her professional background, there should really only be four to five categories available for a member or someone in the information services centre to choose from.  As I said earlier, there is a multitude of different reasons these things-----</p></speech>

It is not that there was necessarily a systematic attempt to somehow do it wrong.  I would not like to define it as a mess, but it was effectively a mess in the way a senior guy was saying that this is the way it has been logged in here, so log it in that way.  The whole process shows a complete lack of training and the structures that should be in place to run a proper system if people are going to rely on the data.</p> <p>  I will finish on the data.  I am conscious that the witnesses have been here a long time and other colleagues want to come in.  I wish to return to another aspect of those Policing Authority meetings.  Allowing for what we know now and the sequence the witnesses have outlined, based on the evidence supplied about the reports to the Policing Authority - irrespective of whether there was an actual report - how would the witnesses define that evidence being given?  Was it truthful evidence?  Were the people supplying that information effectively misleading the Policing Authority either by accident or deliberately?</p></speech>

I would not like to comment on whether that was intentional or accidental.  There certainly were robust debates.  One of the ongoing debates was over whether it was acceptable to record something as a sudden death in the first instance until the Garda had conducted some kind of investigation to determine whether there were suspicious circumstances.  To our mind there were clear instances where that simply could not be justified.  There was a difference of opinion.  I suggest that some of it may come down to a legacy issue - the way that people traditionally did something.  That does not make it right.  From our point of view it certainly would not be in adherence to the crime-counting rules.</p> <p>  The Deputy makes a very important about education and communication within the organisation.  I have always expressed concern over headquarters directives, for example, where a new policy is pushed out through a headquarters directive or a particular instruction because it is not clear to me that there is enough support to ensure that every member or person who needs to be aware of that has read it, interpreted it correctly understood it and is then adhering to and applying it in the course of their duties.</p><p>I certainly would have a concern regarding the education piece.</p></speech>

I know they must be worn out at this stage so I will try not to repeat what others have said.  From the point of view of our job here, we have an obligation to oversee issues of Garda accountability and so on.  When we bring people in to ask them questions, we must rely on their answers to a certain degree.  The witnesses' information has been incredibly helpful to us in terms of challenging some answers we were previously given whereby we did not have the supporting information to say that those answers were not really evidence-based.  Our job is to take what the witnesses have given us and bring it to the next stage.  I just want to clarify, and it may be a bit eclectic, some of the background to some of this stuff and how we got here.  The witnesses were basically asked to carry out a ten-year review of domestic homicides.  Was it the witnesses' suggestion that they should start with a sample?</p></speech>

It was just the year I began with.  I immediately started identifying inaccuracies with the Office of the State Pathologist records, PULSE and our spreadsheets.  I suggested working in collaboration with the Office of the State Pathologist because I knew its files are filled with information and background to the case.  Immediately, I identified in 2014 a number of cases.  I told Ms West by telephone.  I was away on training abroad with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When I returned, I began dealing with cases from 2015.  Ms West told me to stop it at three years as a sample period so we could raise this issue quite quickly with the Garda executive.</p></speech>

Around November, Dr. Singh told us that it became apparent it could not produce a comprehensive report unless they saw the investigating files.  He told us he asked in November to see the investigating files on behalf of the unit.  To the best of the witnesses' knowledge, did he ask specifically for the files or in general?  What was the response to that?  Was that done?</p></speech>

We were not there when the senior executive was briefed so we are not quite sure.  We had always been seeking a full and independent review.  Maybe there was a lack of clarity about what exactly we meant by that but it was always our view that just going back to the original district officer or the person in charge of an investigation was not satisfactory and some questions we raised would not be answered through that process.  At that stage, our focus was very much on the classification of the incidents and trying to come to a consensus position.  When we came into this, we were not reticent about raising the issues but we might have been lacking a bit of confidence.  One always has that fear about whether one is right.  We wanted some verification and that was the point of asking to work with others to try to come to that consensus view about whether or not there was an issue here.  We were pretty confident there was an issue but we did not want to overstate the issue until we were sure that our feelings were correct.</p></speech>

Everybody's attention was focusing on that period and the 41 cases but another narrative was running alongside that, which I found particularly frightening.  This related to ongoing concerns the witnesses were attempting to flag.  They said one example involved a deceased person who had been a victim of domestic violence and whose partner was involved in another relationship marked by domestic violence.  They said they subsequently highlighted a number of similar cases.  They described how getting to that stage was like stitching together a patchwork quilt.  From reading that, I conclude that there were people in 2017 who were in danger because of incomplete data.  I put this matter to Assistant Commissioner Finn on the previous occasion on which he was before the committee in terms of that situation and the review that was ongoing.  I specifically asked him whether in the cases of domestic violence death, other incidents of domestic violence on the person's file would be analysed in case there was a missing link so a sign that had been flagged could lead to something being averted.  He told us that a new processes were in place.  I think he said that when Dr. Singh and his team look at the data on domestic violence, they would find that crimes had been classified correctly from the start.  My first question is whether the witnesses found that domestic violence incidents have been correctly classified from the start.  Second, do the witnesses know anything about these new processes Assistant Commissioner Finn told us are in place that will alert the user if the person has been involved in a previous domestic violence incident relating to the person in place?</p></speech>

I assure members that I will go back in any instance with the victim in the lead-up to every domestic homicide I will be reviewing - be it months or years.  I would have questions about whether they have been recorded correctly.  I have come across incidents that I do not believe were recorded correctly, for example, when they were recorded in attention and complaints when they should have been as a domestic incident.  I am not up to date regarding what the up-to-date policy is and whether they informed that a previous incident occurred.</p></speech>

We do not want to cause people panic either but I would suggest that Assistant Commissioner Finn was referring to the victim screen.  A lot of work has been done there in respect of technical fixes to PULSE in order to make the data collection better.  When an incident is recorded now, a victim screen will come up and that will be populated with the detail of the injured party.  I do not think a system exists where it would necessarily flag up when a member or someone in Castlebar went to create an incident.  I do not think any big flag that this has happened before comes up.  We are dependent on the incident being recorded correctly.  We have "attention and complaints" and "domestic dispute with no offence disclosed" categories.  That domestic dispute with no offence disclosed category was very much created to capture where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is asked to respond to a house because there are reports of a disturbance and garda&iacute; get there and do not find anything but can go in and record the fact that they were called out.  I understand that the victim screen becomes active with domestic dispute with no offence disclosed incidents.  Of course, it would become active if it involved an assault or crime incident as well.  Our difficulty is that there has been a tendency, which I believe to be ongoing, to put some of these incidents in the attention and complaints category.  Therefore, a victim screen would not be activated for that incident.  One could understand how a member would still be recording a call-out to a property as an attention and complaints incident if the awareness is not there of domestic dispute with no offence disclosed.  The victim screen is fairly recent so there would not be that history going back for people who have already been victims of domestic abuse or violence.</p> <p>  Again, we come back to the motivating factor as well.  What is supposed to happen if someone is the victim of an assault, be it minor or an assault causing harm?  A box should be ticked to say that this was a domestic incident.  That is the easiest way for us to identify that an incident is of a domestic nature.  Otherwise, we are trawling narratives for many hundreds of assaults in order to try to work out if there is even sufficient detail in the narrative to tell us whether it is a domestic incident.</p><p>I still lack confidence in it.  Over time, there have been technical fixes and attempts to put various fixes in place to assist the process but it is still not a complete process.  It is still not one that lends itself to easily identifying an escalation of incidents or people who may be vulnerable.  Ms Galligan has done the best she can in the work she is doing and has liaised very closely with the Garda national protective services bureau.  We referred any cases that Ms Galligan raised as potentially concerning to it.  We felt this was the way they would get the attention they required because that national unit would be able to contact the region, division or district and ensure there was proper attention given which would assist with the proper supports being in place for the vulnerable person.</p></speech>

They were essentially saying that because of it there were people who were potentially in danger in 2017 and possibly 2018.  It is my understanding that the people in PDIM told the witnesses not to give it to them and that they did not want to read it because it was not their job.  Was it anybody's job?</p></speech>

We will certainly endeavour to do the best we can.  The difficulty we have is we are starting with a domestic homicide and working back to look at the history.  I would not like to sit here and give any guarantees we will be able to pick up on every attention and complaint incident that was potentially a domestic incident.  The system is vast and there are a huge number of records in it.</p> <p>  The point of beginning with a victim and working back is to be able to make certain recommendations and inform intervention strategies.  It will take time to do it.  Part of the reason it has been disappointing that we did not have the traction we wanted sooner is because we have lost time.  Our aim is to try to professionalise and standardise everything and to try to ensure there is consistency.  I will hark back to what I said earlier.  I have concerns about the structure of posts; the education of members and their understanding of the various crime and non-crime classifications; and the ability of the data quality unit within the Garda information services centre, GISC, to be able to identify where something has been misclassified.  In the course of this year it is intended that the Garda information services centre will be responsible for determining the classification of incidents.  We should get away from the issue we have had where there is a debate about what the incident is between the member and the person in the information services centre inputting the incident.  I hope that if a member makes contact with GISC and says he or she wants to record an incident as "attention and complaint" but it is clear to the person taking the call that it is actually a domestic assault, it will go in as a domestic assault.</p></speech>

They are looking at a lot of incident types, the data quality fields and things like that and improvements are being made.  Fatal hit-and-runs are referred to the Office of the State Pathologist so I was picking up on them and saying it is a crime if one leaves a scene or if it is a case of dangerous driving causing death.  From the moment the person is found, a crime investigation is initiated but it is being recorded under a non-crime incident type of "traffic-fatal" and there is no identifiable parameter to say it was a hit-and-run unless it was recorded in the narrative.  I was concerned by that.</p></speech>

Despite the missing report, which the Garda never gave to the Policing Authority or which something happened to so it never went to the Policing Authority, the Policing Authority was aware in advance of the April meeting that when the garda&iacute; publicly gave information to it that the report was from the team in the analysis service and the ordinary garda&iacute; in it, it was in direct possession of knowledge that it was not the case.</p></speech>

We put it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it gave information to the Policing Authority that was probably not correct.  It is also true to say that the Policing Authority knew that when the information was given.  That is something we will take up with it when it comes back to us after the recess.

I absolutely understand that there are governance structures and that people are very wary of sharing data, as are we.  We have been the souls of discretion in protecting data and case-specific information.  I felt it was a breach of trust and a compromise.  Where we had been trying to raise the issues and do what we felt was right to try to get the truthful message to enable the authority to be able to craft and ask pertinent questions at meetings, not only was our voice not being heard, they kind of told tales on us.</p></speech>

Someone in the Policing Authority had taken it upon themselves to not telephone Ms West - she has never received any telephone calls from the Policing Authority - but to telephone someone in Garda management to tell tales on Ms West along the lines "Do you know that your assistant head of analysis has been on to us giving out about the Garda management and the report?".  That is the first problem.

She discovered then that the information had not been passed on to the Policing Authority.  The report had not been given.  Nearly a month after Ms West had produced the report for the Policing Authority Ms West was told by telephone that the authority had not received it.  Ms West offered that the committee could have the reports of that meeting.  It would be helpful to have Ms West's notes of this conversation.  This gets to the heart of this relationship between the Policing Authority and senior Garda management, which seems to be unravelling in a manner that the public would not expect.  If it was possible then the notes would be very helpful.</p> <p>  My last point, for the record is-----</p></speech>

We know the organisation had that information when it went to the Policing Authority.  Can Ms West say with certainty that the individuals who imparted that information publicly, at the Policing Authority in April and in June, had direct, personal knowledge of Ms West's disagreement?  Does Ms West know the point I am making?  Am I making it clear?  We know that Ms West furnished reports where she could not say it any clearer: "I do not agree and I cannot sign off on this."  Would the people who gave that information at the Policing Authority have been privy to that information directly?  Ms West may or may not know this.</p></speech>

The practice of civilian people coming in with particular expertise is a very new thing.  The policing culture is a very strange one.  It is like a family and anybody coming in as the in-law or whatever takes a little time to gain acceptance.  There were difficulties there too but for the most part the analysts have been embraced and there has been a very good working relationship, even where we are considering very sensitive information.  There are, certainly, occasions where there really is a difference, and this is highlighted.  I will not go off on another tangent but it is particularly to be seen in industrial relations issues and different terms and conditions.  None of these things helps.  People need to feel that they are equally valued, not just in having their voices heard but also in the recognition and compensation for the work they do.  It does not help and it creates a little bit of a them and us scenario when people do not feel they are on a level playing field.</p></speech>

The two submissions are very powerful and they speak for themselves.  The committee has learned a lot from them.  It does not do much to allay many of the fears we have around how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates.  When Dr. Singh was before the committee he was at pains to talk about some wonderful co-operation and work at operational level from garda&iacute;.</p><p>He refrained from adding the same to dealing with the hierarchy.</p><p> Ms West has been with the organisation for ten years.  She made the point that there has been a learning curve and that everyone has taken time to adjust to certain ways of doing things, and that applies to how the analysts operate as well.  However, Ms Galligan made the following point in her submission.  She said that despite the nine meetings ""It was now concluded that the methodology I had utilised in comparing the records of the Office of the State Pathologist and the PULSE system were &ldquo;inherently weak&rdquo;, &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;, &ldquo;confined&rdquo; and &ldquo;restricted&rdquo;.  Given that Ms Galligan had nine meetings that included what were described as "robust discussions", surely they would have been aware of her methodology during those meetings.  She has said that these aspects were not raised at any of the nine meetings.  Were they aware of the methodology used that they ended up describing as inherently weak, inappropriate, confined and restricted? </p></speech>

At the beginning of the 87-page report that I wrote in November 2016, the opening introduction is on the methodology and the method used.  At the first meeting at which we met PDIM, I described in detail both my methodology and how I went about it as regards the Office of the State Pathologist and then back to PULSE.  They were completely aware yet they never raised any concerns about the weakness or flaws in my methodology until we seen sight of the report on 8 May.</p></speech>

We were looking for others to come on board with us to get that consensus view as to whether there were issues.  I have a difficulty in that whenever there is a homicide in this country now, we always get a phone call.  Myself and my colleague will get a phone call asking for analytical support for the investigation.  We have become nearly indispensable to supporting those investigations.  From that point of view, it is clearly recognised that analysts add value to investigations.  It is irrelevant that one is not actually an investigator because everybody has a different expertise and value to bring to an investigation.  My concern with this was as follows.  We recognised early on that we did not have access to the investigation files, and we never claimed to have had that access.  We were concerned, when we saw report on 8 May, that it, perhaps, was not representative of the fact that we had always said, "Look, we have this and this but we do not have the investigations files."  The report was also misleading in that it kind of focused on those being the two solo sources of information that Ms Galligan had when she compiled her report.  In effect, she had access to other information such as coroners' findings and so on either because they were recorded on PULSE or she did a lot of open-source research around these to try to  ascertain information that she could not glean from the PULSE system.</p> <p>  I am concerned that 15 months have elapsed since Ms Galligan produced the first report in November 2016 and we still have not seen the investigation files, nor have the members of PDIM  seen all of the files.  There may have some requested to clarify particular information.  As of this point, there has not been an independent review of those investigation files.  For my part, I cannot understand how PDIM could produce a report, and how certain assurances could be given on the basis of that, when those investigation files had not been reviewed by us or anyone else, as far as I could tell.</p></speech>

In the original report on the particular cases, I would have raised questions regarding the circumstances of the death and the cause of death.  I was posing questions to the investigation and these were subsequently sent out to the investigation team as part of the review.  The April report that we saw on 8 May did not address any of my concerns that were in my original report in November, so they were overlooked.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses not think that this amounts to nothing short of a cover-up by senior management?</p></speech>

I certainly would have concerns.  We have four box files of records on the homicide review, so the Deputy will appreciate that it is quite difficult to synopsise that down, as best we can, into statements that can assist the committee.  This matter has been ongoing for 15 months.  There is a huge volume of records in the form of reports, emails and contemporaneous notes on this one issue.  We feel that, in addition to our other responsibilities, we have done two full-time jobs for the past 15 months in terms of trying to get these issues raised and addressed.</p></speech>

I am unable to say who made this call.  During this call, I was made aware that a report, which I had submitted on 11 April 2017 for onward transmission to the Policing Authority ... had never been sent to it.  I was informed that this report had been discussed amongst senior Garda personnel prior to a private Policing Authority meeting on 13 April 2017.</blockquote> <p>Given that Ms West has worked in the place for ten years, and in light of her level of authority and expertise, how in God's name can that situation be explained?  Can anyone be held to account?</p></speech>

I would share such concerns.  It does not feel right.  I think we can all see that something is not right about the situation.  It is our frustration about the way we have been treated and the 15 months of torment we endured while trying to raise these issues and have them addressed that brings us here today.</p></speech>

Since 2012, this committee has dealt with many different policing issues.  We, as committee members, have found it mind-boggling that nobody has been held to account for what they did.  People just say, "We will learn from that and now we will move on."  It is incredibly worrying that there is no accountability.  Let us say that the witnesses had the authority to hold people to account for some of the poor decision-making that has taken place at a higher level.  In terms of dealing with all of the issues that they have raised, how can we hold people to account for their actions?</p></speech>

Yes, I think this matter warrants investigation and needs an external eye to examine what has happened in the past 15 months.  We may have our own views on the matter, and we have our own records.  We certainly know how we have personally felt for the past 15 months.  I guess the reason that we are here is because for the past 15 months it has felt like we have been holding senior Garda management to account but that is not our job.  I am not exactly sure whose job it is.  We are here today because we hope that something will happen.</p><p>As I stated, there will always be expertise within lower ranks and grades, on the Garda as well as the civilian side of the organisation.  There are trained barristers and members with various experience within the Garda ranks.  However, there is a tension between expertise and rank structure.  It is very much a rank-driven organisation, and when an instruction is given by someone in authority , it is followed.  The difference in this scenario is that we did not follow such instruction but, rather, stood firm because we so strongly believed in what we were fighting for.  By virtue of the value systems with which we were raised, we know how to behave ethically, which is what we have done throughout this process.  People may question the process we have followed, how we have come to be before the committee or the things we have said today, but that has all been done with truth, conviction and a determination to do right in terms of public service and ensure the right things are done.  However, we need help to do that.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the phenomenal and amazing work they have done.  They are a breath of fresh air in terms of their ethics, values and integrity knowing no bounds.  It is great to know that there are people doing such great work, in particular in the environment in which the witnesses work.</p> <p>  I have many questions but I will heed the advice of the Chair to keep my contribution short.  Deputy Clare Daly spoke about victims of domestic violence, which struck a chord with me.  Did the witnesses mention that information in regard to domestic violence and hate related crimes has been misclassified?</p></speech>

It would be completely unrealistic to say An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could prevent every incident from happening, even if it were in possession of a perfect dataset.  However, as people who deal with data, we know the importance of good data in terms of being able to reach good and satisfactory conclusions.  It is critical that the data are sufficiently robust and accurate for us to have a chance to track an escalation of incidence.  As Ms Galligan stated, Operation Devise was set up within the national protective services bureau, which is very enthusiastic to be referred cases where concern is raised.  My concern is that that is currently being done in an <i>ad hoc</i>and piecemeal way and there are limiting factors to what we can do because of PULSE.</p></speech>

We were striving for consistency in the approach to recording certain groups of incidents and also to ensure that at least some recording of certain incidents to reflect activity that would have taken place even though a direct investigation might not be conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is difficult to explain without going into it any further but there are certain legislative bounds that determine how certain incidents are dealt with.</p></speech>

I will cut half of my questions and will not overlap.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  They are the two best witnesses I have seen at a committee in my time flitting in and out of here over the past decade.  I have seen all of their evidence, having watched the beginning in my office and been in attendance for the second half.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and so cannot also be a member of this committee but I am a regular guest, and I thank the Chair in that regard.  The courage shown by the witnesses in the face of great difficulty is exemplary, while the knowledge, clarity and professionalism they have brought to giving their evidence is the best I have seen.  In terms of their knowledge of the subject matter, they have recorded and documented everything to a very high level and gone through everything in an incredibly impressive manner.</p><p> I will ask these questions quickly.  In a response to a question from Deputy Wallace earlier, I felt like giving Ms West a round of applause when she spoke about the tension between expertise and rank structure.  That summed up the situation we have all seen in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for some time.  With great clarity, Ms West spoke about ethics, truth and conviction and that she had to stand by what she was doing for the past 15 months.  Has the culture changed in any way in recent months?  When Ms West was asked earlier, she was correct not to discuss individuals because this is not personal, but she obviously feels let down.  That is my first question about the culture.  Has anything changed in recent months?</p><p> Ms West spoke earlier about the pressures and other matters.  I was very much taken by the way Ms West stated how she personally had a duty of care to Ms Galligan.  The second part of my question in relation to culture is as follows.  Did Ms West's superiors from a reporting point of view maintain their duty of care to her professionally in her workplace?</p></speech>

I would certainly hope that this would be one of those, that there would be a recognition that there are people within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether sworn members, civilian or whatever, who have valuable things to say, that is, expertise that is exceptional, and we should be making full and proper use of that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the culture has changed in recent months.  If it has, it has not changed enough.  I would certainly hope that there are some people who are taking some serious learning from what has gone on.</p></speech>

The methodology is the same methodology that is being used now.  I had the privilege of working on databases for years in a previous life and I know what a single point of failure is.  In fairness, everything is wrapped around Ms Galligan's knowledge.  Is Ms Galligan confident she has the resources going forward?  Being honest with her, in my opinion, they do not have the resources to be able to conclude the work.  She cannot give a date.  I understand that.  There are many different arrows out of this work that go into many different pies.  Has Ms Galligan the resources?  Would she welcome more resources?</p></speech>

They offer a huge resource and assistance to me in completing this report.  A formal communication needs to be established between both agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the  Office of the State Pathologist, and the coroners so that there is a kind of communication between us all in sharing data, especially in regard to the recording of deaths to ensure that we are getting it right.</p></speech>

In addition, what has come across clearly to me is that, because of the consequences of the 15 month delay and the fact that this has not been done properly, we have a situation where garda&iacute; are not provided with the level of information that would link up ongoing investigations and that causes investigative risk every day.  Would it be fair to say that is a serious concern?  Second, the vetting office for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is based in my county.  This has a domino effect when it comes to vetting people because the information is not cross-checked and co-related.  Third, when it comes to compiling data which has influence on policy which is directed in these Houses, that cannot be accurate either.  Is it true that the original data inaccuracy, the investigative process in relation to homicide and those three items which I have outlined all involve serious risks?</p></speech>

Ms West might outline, obviously not publicly here, where there were changes over the past couple of years, particularly in those 15 months.  Somebody could co-relate decision-making with changes and see whether there is anything tangible that we can take from that.  I thank Ms West and Ms Galligan.</p></speech>

Their testimony has been powerful.  The most important aspect of all is that it is from the highest motivation of public service, and we acknowledge that.  Certainly, Deputy Clare Daly and Senator Black will concur with me that, on the eve on International Women's Day, Ms West and Ms Galligan are a powerful duo and a credit to their gender and an example to us all, men and women alike, in public service.</p><p>I am delighted that we had the opportunity to host the delegates today.  The picture I see is one where denial and obstruction have come into play.  We see a culture that does not want to expose the fault lines at any cost and attention to this or that must be suppressed.  When we had the senior garda&iacute; with us, three weeks back I think, we were assured all 41 cases - I note the figure of 43, but 41 had specifically been pointed to between 2013 and 2015 - had been investigated.  Those who presented were at pains to emphasise that point.  It is a reasonable question to ask whether these cases, or even some of them - even one would be one too many - were appropriately investigated.  It is the key question.  We do not doubt that they have been investigated.  However, the word "appropriate" is very important.  We have all noted different reports where a suspicious death, or whatever else, has been reported on the news.  RT&Eacute; and other broadcast and print media will then report that the investigation has been upgraded to a murder investigation.  The word "upgraded" has always stuck in my memory and it is the language used.  I have always taken and believe I am right in saying the word "upgrading" not only as underscoring the tragedy of what has happened but also as reflective of the upgrading of the process of investigation to meet the needs of the particular case.  Do Ms West concur that that is the key focus?</p></speech>

It is one of the fundamental issues on which Ms Galligan and I have been arguing.  Our view is that if a scene is attended to and there is any possibility a person has met with foul play or there are suspicious circumstances, it should, first and foremost, be entered on the PULSE system as a homicide.  I am not sure if there are particular difficulties of which I am not aware that would lead to this not happening.  However, it seems logical to me that the investigation start high and work back.  That would also give confidence to families and the public that absolutely everything was being done within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate such cases.  I agree that there is an absolute difference between an investigation and a full, proper and complete investigation.  I know that the media have picked up on this and want to clarify the position because we do not want scaremongering and the causing of unnecessary concern.  What we always asked for was a full and independent review in order that we would be able to give confirmed assurance that everything was as it should be.  There is no doubt that in the course of our work we did raise questions.  Some have been answered and I am sure some will be as the review process moves into the next phase.  However, I want to get away from the idea of crimes not being fully investigated.  We want to get to a position where we can give assurance that we are satisfied everything is exactly as it should be.</p></speech>

When they make reference to a full and independent review, is it an external examination in tandem or are they happy that the current signalled work programme, under the newly established and newly led internal body, is sufficient?  Will they clarify the matter because, as a committee, we will be discussing all of these issues at the conclusion of our engagements?  We will have representatives of the Policing Authority before us next week.  We will also have representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na back and these matters will be discussed with them.  Will the delegates give us a sense of what they would like to see happen now?</p></speech>

There is nothing about the new review team, as things are running, that gives me a lack of confidence.  It gives me greater confidence that Ms Galligan and I will be fully and completely involved in the process.  As we have done up to this point, if we continue to have questions or are not satisfied, we will say so.  We are working hand in glove with the new review team to identify the cases we believe need to be subject to a full and independent review.  As I sit here, I have every confidence that that is what will happen, probably with the impetus of what has gone before in the past 15 months.  Perhaps some lessons have been learned.</p></speech>

That should be looked at immediately.  There is no point in reviewing from 2017 backwards and then in a couple of years having to do the whole thing again because nothing has changed.</p></speech>

I want them to know that, if things do not unfold in the way they would wish, the door to the committee will always be open to them in the future.  If matters do not progress in the way they should, we will be very happy as a committee to play our part.  I hope that will be some assistance to the delegates as the process takes it time in the period ahead.  We will be delighted to engage with them again.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I had to leave.  However, I was horrified last night to read the opening statements and to hear them being articulated again this morning at the committee.  I do not have questions, but I just want to commend Ms Galligan and Ms West.  It is the type of steely approach to do the right thing, stand by one's convictions and do what one believes is right and what has transpired to be right that the country needs.  I salute the delegates as public servants and thank them for the work they have done.  I concur with the Chairman that we will, as Oireachtas Members and as members the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, play our role in supporting them, if need be.  I say "Well done" to the delegates for their contributions.</p></speech>
