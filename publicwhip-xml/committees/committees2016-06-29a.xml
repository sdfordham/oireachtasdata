    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#D00300"><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Television coverage and web streaming can also be adversely affected.  Members are reminded of the  long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I welcome all members and witnesses, especially any newly elected members, to the first public meeting of this select committee in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  It is a great honour for me to chair this Oireachtas committee and I look forward to working with all members in a positive and constructive manner.</p><p>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs and natural resources, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne.  On behalf of the committee, I congratulate both on their appointments, and we look forward to working with them.</p><p>I also welcome the officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in attendance today: Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General; Mr. Martin Finucane, principal officer; Ms Finola Rossi, principal officer; Mr. Denis Maher, principal officer; Mr. Kenneth Cleary, assistant principal; and Mr. Jim Whelan, assistant principal.  I thank the officials for providing the briefing material for the committee today.</p><p>As members are aware, we are meeting this morning to consider the 2016 Revised Estimate for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2016, Vote 29 - Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, referred by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the committee on 26 June 2016.</p><p>The OECD report Review of Budget Oversight by Parliament: Ireland sets out a roadmap for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of spending by Departments throughout the budget cycle, which will have the following elements: <i>ex-ante</i>, budget year and <i>ex-post</i>.  It is essential that the Department supply high-quality information in a timely manner to the committee.  The committee intends to engage further with the Minister in September 2016, with a focus on impacts on expenditure in 2017.</p><p>As agreed in private session yesterday, the meeting will adopt the following structure.  A fixed time will be allocated to each programme, A to E, with the option of returning to particular programmes after each has been gone through if issues remain outstanding.  A timetable for the meeting has been circulated as agreed.  At the outset of the consideration of each programme, I will ask the Minister to give a brief overview of the programme, including pressures that are likely to have an impact on the Department's performance or expenditure on the programme in 2016.  This will be followed by a question and answer session for members.</p><p>When programmes A, B, C, D and E have been considered, the committee may consider the appropriations-in-aid information presented and programme F, administrative expenditure generally, with subheads A1 and A2 of each programme taken together.  The committee also agreed that we should consider all the budget allocations across the programme subheadings together.  This will allow members who have an interest in a particular programme to schedule their time and ensure the committee gives consideration to all programmes.  The emphasis of questions should be on how effectively financial resources are being managed and the performance achieved relevant to that programme.  I ask members putting questions or raising issues to indicate the subhead to which the question relates and the page number in the Department's briefing to which they are referring.</p><p> I wish to ask the Minister a question about the title of his Department.  The existing Department is the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and it will be renamed the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources, though the Minister told the D&aacute;il it would be renamed the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Can he elaborate on the transfer of functions from the old Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and when the transfer of functions will take place?  When will the name of the Department and the title of the Minister be changed and how will that affect the 2016 Estimates?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and congratulate her on her selection as Chair of this committee.  I congratulate and welcome each of the members of the committee.  This is the first committee of this D&aacute;il and some members are old hands, such as Deputies Eamon Ryan and Timmy Dooley, but I particularly welcome Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith on her first time in a select committee.  I look forward to working with all the members.  As I said to my officials shortly after my appointment, I would like this Department to be a facilitating Department, facilitating change that is necessary across society and Government.  Key to that is the national broadband plan which will bring about radical change the likes of which we have not seen since rural electrification.  Climate action will also drive change across society and in every community across this country, particularly in the public sector, at least in the short term.</p> <p>  At the moment the Department is officially the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and we will retain all those functions except for responsibility for the delivery of the Kerr report on the post offices and the renewal of our post office network.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, will take over responsibility for the roll-out of the national broadband plan subsequent to the signing of the contract in the middle of next year.  We have already transferred officials from the Department on secondment to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to assist with the project.  The Minister's role in broadband is to ensure that once the contracts are signed, the contractors will not have any impediments in physically rolling out the infrastructure.  She will remove bottlenecks and deal with access to wayleaves, as well as ducting, permissions and authorisations.  She will see to it that an individual is responsible in each of the local authorities and will also determine what communities should be given priority in the roll-out of the plan.  She will look at whether 1,500 primary schools should get priority or whether community centres or businesses should get it, all the time ensuring this does not inhibit the speedy roll-out of broadband.  She will engage with local authorities and with communities through the Leader programmes.</p> <p>  The new title of the Department will be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The climate action section will incorporate the existing functions of the energy division within my Department and the environment functions within the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will transfer to my Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.9" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Some 55 staff will transfer and I understand a memo has been approved by the Attorney General.  This memo is 15 or 16 pages long and deals with the responsibilities travelling over including waste, air quality, climate action and radiological protection.  We will also have overall responsibility for the Environmental Protection Agency.  A budget of some &euro;44 million will transfer.  The intention is that the new Estimate, with which we will deal later this year, will deal with all aspects of the new Department.  At the moment we are discussing the Estimate that was approved during the budget process of last year, at which stage it was under the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>I believe the Chairman, committee members, my staff and I can all work in a very co-operative manner.  I want my Department to be a facilitating Department but I also want to be a facilitating Minister.  I have spent 19 years on the Opposition benches in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and I know what it is like and how frustrating it can be.  If someone is prepared to come up with a constructive idea or suggestion, I will try to facilitate it as far as I can, no matter who it comes from or what side of the House they are on.  I am prepared to work with anyone and everyone with that objective.  I am accompanied by my Secretary General, Mark Griffin, principal officers Martin Finucane, Finola Rossi and Denis Maher, and assistant principals Kenneth Cleary and Jim Whelan.</p><p>In 2015, the Department had a capital budget of some &euro;93.6 million of which some &euro;84.5 million, approximately 90%, was spent on the programmes and &euro;5.2 million was carried over to the 2016 account.  In 2015, the Department had a current budget of &euro;329.5 million, of which &euro;315.4 million, some 96%, was spent.  The Department undertook a technical Supplementary Estimate in 2015 which reallocated approximately &euro;2.5 million which was already within the Vote to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and a once-off amount of &euro;4 million arising from additional offshore data sales from the petroleum affairs division.  To the end of May 2016, the Department had spent &euro;128 million on the current side, some 95% of the profile to the end of May, and &euro;24 million, some 79%, on the capital side.</p><p>The Department cannot undertake a Supplementary Estimate in 2016.  I am happy to go through the various programmes and answer questions from members.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to make his opening comments on the first programme, which is programme A on communications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#F00300"><p>The focus of programme A is to support economic growth, jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion through a range of policies and regulations designed to facilitate a more digitally connected society.  This includes promoting timely investment in next generation broadband networks, the use of digital technologies by citizens and businesses and support for digital entrepreneurship.  The Estimates for programme A include an initial funding of &euro;10 million for the national broadband plan to bring high-speed broadband connectivity to all parts of Ireland through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention.  In this regard, approximately &euro;2 billion has been spent by commercial operators over the past four years.  The programme also includes the State-owned metropolitan area networks, which play an important role in driving competition in the regions and facilitating telecommunications operators, large and small, in providing high-speed broadband services without having to build out their own networks.</p><p>Programme A supports Ireland's national digital strategy, which aims to realise the full benefit of a digitally enabled society through measures such as the trading online voucher scheme, the school digital champion programme and the BenefIT 4 programme, which are all aimed at encouraging citizens, businesses and communities to engage with the Internet.  I would like the assistance of members of the committee in their constituencies to promote the value of the trading online voucher scheme.  We have analysed the 2,000 vouchers that have been issued to date.  About 800 businesses were surveyed.  Those businesses have increased sales by one fifth and employment by a third.  Two thirds of them are now trading internationally.  I actively encourage businesses with fewer than ten employees to contact their local enterprise office to avail themselves of support.  There is a 50:50 grant of up to &euro;2,500 available per business to allow them to start trading online.  Interestingly, about 50% of those who apply for it do not draw down the grant because a training programme is tied in to it.  A lot of businesses have found the training programme extremely useful in maximising their existing online presence.  I encourage any business that is not trading online at the moment to do so, because there is potential to maintain existing employment, increase sales and potentially grow market share.</p><p> Programme A also promotes digital entrepreneurship in Ireland through the National Digital Research Centre and the Digital Hub Development Agency.  The 2016 Estimates include &euro;750,000 operational funding for the National Cyber Security Centre for the protection of critical infrastructure and Government networks.  Finally, on the communications Vote, I ask the committee if it could at the first available opportunity facilitate a presentation from the chairman designate of An Post, Dermot Divilly.  I know he is anxious to come before the committee.  It was scheduled to take place last February under the chairmanship of the previous committee.  I would appreciate if that could be facilitated as soon as possible.</p><p> On the telecommunications impact of Brexit, the real issue is roaming.  However, roaming charges in the EU and the EEA are to be abolished by 2017.  We do not see any difficulty from a roaming perspective unless the existing directives are specifically replaced.  I do not see the benefit in replacing those directives from either our or a European Union perspective.  We do not foresee any issues arising on communications at present.  The cyber security NIS directive is a work in progress.  It is timetabled for transposition in 2018.  We expect discussions will continue on that with member states, including the UK.  From that perspective we do not see an issue.  The more detailed issues will come up in some of the other aspects of the Vote that we will deal with later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#G00200"><p>Thank you Minister.  Deputy Ryan, did you want to come in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#G00300"><p>First, Chairman, I wish you the very best of luck in your role.  I look forward to working with you.  I apologise for not being able to make the meeting yesterday afternoon.  The Select Committee on Arrangements for Budgetary Scrutiny was meeting at the same time.  There is also a meeting later this morning, so apologies if I have to head to that.  It is looking at a similar Estimates process, so I feel on this occasion I have to attend it.</p> <p>  I also wish the Minister the very best of luck.  His is a hugely important Department, dealing with critical economic and social development issues of our time.  Even though the budget allocation is very small relative to other Departments, the policy implications are huge.  At the end of the Minister's five years in office we should be looking at tripling or quintupling the budget because the climate change challenge we face requires that sort of ambition.  That is what we should be thinking of.</p><p>We should be thinking big and ambitiously.  Similarly, in regard to digital communications I look forward to hearing details on An Post and other programmes.  </p><p> In regard to Brexit, I agree with the Minister and I do not think roaming will present difficulties.  I imagine there will be arrangements where companies such as Vodafone and Telefonica will apply the same rules.  The more major issue - let me flag it - is trade and services.  The United Kingdom is very capable and efficient at trading on the Internet.  It is probably one of the best trading countries on the Internet.  Could Britain be disadvantaged by Brexit as they are no longer in the Single Market?  Will leaving the European Union free Great Britain up to apply other rules?  The Minister mentioned the small companies that are and should be trading online.  Are there consequences?  This is not an issue to be decided on now.  It is not in the Estimate.  I imagine we will have to look at this issue in real detail because it is complex.  Nobody knows what will happen in regard to traded services.  There are international as well as EU rules around Internet governance.  I image we would have to concentrate on them.</p><p> A difficultly in that regard is that the Data Protection Commissioner is under the Department of Justice and Equality, whereas the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looks after Government information technology.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation also has an interest in it.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has responsibility for cyber security, which is the correct place to have it.  How will the co-ordination take place, in particular with the Data Protection Commissioner and the Cyber Security Office that will be set up?  I would be interested to know how it works on cross party basis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#H00500"><p>In response to Deputy Ryan's suggestion on tripling the budget, naturally enough I would love to see that happen.  At European level in relation to the financial constraints that we are under, even if we have money to try to invest it in capital projects, there are limiting conditions in regard to the financial structures.  I know that Commissioner Ca&ntilde;ete and some of the other Commissioners are pushing this agenda quite strongly.  I have spoken to Commissioner Ca&ntilde;ete on three or four occasions in this regard.  We have very demanding targets to reach and even if we have the resources available to us, we are trying to fight this challenge with one hand tied behind our back.  I hope that if we can make progress on that aspect, it will allow the Government far more flexibility in putting the investment that is required for getting to a decarbonised society by 2050 and being a long way along that road by 2030.</p> <p>  In respect of the impact of Brexit on trade and services, we have a major challenge to try to ensure that we can capture the digital market here in Ireland.  Every minute, Irish consumers are spending about &euro;14,000 online but only about &euro;4,000 a minute is used to purchase products and services in this country.  There is a great opportunity to develop our own sector to meet our market needs.  Second, many of the issues the Deputy raised will come in under the digital single market negotiations.  He is quite correct that issues arising from Brexit and the UK will have to form part of those discussions.  It will be a challenge not just for us, but for many other member states to deal with it.  We have started the process.  A number of Departments are involved and that is why the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, has a co-ordinating role between the various Departments.</p><p>The Cabinet sub-comittees may have a co-ordinating role.  As I said at the outset my Department will be a facilitating Department.  I think we can help to drive some of the change that is required in some of the other Departments.  We are quite willing to work with the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy and other Ministers not just on the Cabinet sub-committees but on a one to one basis to drive the type of change and openness that is needed to make a real difference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#J00200"><p>I have a number of questions on subhead 3, the profile of expenditure at the end of May indicated that he had expected to spend about &euro;4.3 billion, however the actual expenditure at the end of May was just about &euro;1.5 or &euro;1.6 billion.  Was there any particular reason for that?</p> <p>  There were questions in the Chamber on the postcode.  A former journalist in this House is now An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  He had a number of comments about the level of correspondence he has had from various different people about Eircode and the complaints he has received on the use of the Irish Language in that regard.  It is just another indicator of the problems associated with Eircode.  In terms of looking at value for money in the long term use of Eircode, does he have plans or proposals to review Eircode as a suitable system?  Has the Minister proposals for changing the nature of the Eircode to create a hierarchical structure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#J00300"><p>First, there are ongoing discussions with An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in respect of the issues he has raised and we are hoping to progress them.  In regard to Eircode, we have no plans whatsoever to change it, in fact I was one of the earliest people to take up Eircode.  As I said in the D&aacute;il, I have had the same reservations on Eircode, in particular the annexation of large parts of my own county, something I am not one bit happy about.  I think those in counties that have large conurbations close to them have that issue.  Eircode has the potential to save lives.  I sent out 53,000 pieces of literature encouraging people to record their Eircode so that they could pass it on to the ambulance service if they so required.  This was because of particular problems I have had in my constituency with ambulance delays, a problem experienced right across rural Ireland.  I think there would always be a long lead-in time in respect of Eircode and it will take a number of years for people to know their Eircode and to use it openly but even within the next 12 to 18 months, I think there will be a far greater uptake .</p> <p>  It is roughly 12 months since it was launched.  I think it is a very positive development that the ambulance service has taken it up.  I think other emergency services will take it up and members will see other providers roll out the use of it in the next period of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#J00400"><p>If it was just about the guidance to a location, we could have dealt with that through getting an education system in place that would encourage people to record their co-ordinates.  There is already a grid system in place that identifies one's co-ordinates, which is guided through the GPS system.</p><p>Throughout the world, the real purpose of a postcode - we call it an Eircode postcode - is to facilitate, in the first instance, the distribution of post and now, more particularly, packages.  People knew and understood the old system of the posting and arrival of a letter; the postman knew his way around.  The marketplace has changed very significantly, which is good.  It is good competition and business for An Post.  Other providers seek, however, to use a clustering methodology for efficient distribution.  We talk about online trading, online vouchers and encouraging more people to get into the business of trading online.  While online trading is carried out in an electronic environment, the flip side of it is a physical edifice which requires somebody to take the package and deliver it to the door.  If one deals with and talks to logistics companies, they must have a method of aggregating packages to locations and then breaking them down further in order that their transportation is used efficiently.  The Minister will be aware from our renewables targets of a necessity to reduce transport emissions.  This requires good IT systems but, unfortunately, Eircode's IT system does not provide that level of usability.  I encourage Deputy Naughten, as Minister, to reconsider what Eircode needs to do, what its full purpose is and whether it is fit for that purpose.  There is a need for a hierarchical dimension to it.</p><p> I understand the notion of fill-in addresses and houses built along the way but when Deputy Ryan was Minister, his expert group recommended a hierarchical dimension to the Eircode postcode.  This was dropped along the way for whatever reason, and we all have our own views as to why that might have happened, but I think it has contributed to the lack of take-up.  I understand that not everybody will know their Eircode postcode by heart but, over time, when the demand increases, when people start looking for it and when one purchases something online, if it is a requirement to enter one's Eircode, if it is being used by the ultimate distributor, then there will be greater uptake of it.  This will have a knock-on effect of people memorising it more and it being more beneficial in the event of an emergency.  This is just a request to the Minister.  I do not expect him to have the solution at once.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#K00200"><p>Eircode had particular challenges to deal with in Ireland, compared to anywhere else in Europe.  We have 35% non-unique addresses in Ireland.  The country nearest to us in this regard is Portugal, with 2%, so we had a very difficult problem.  In the D&aacute;il, I used the example of Milltown.  There are probably about 30 Milltowns in my constituency.  I think pretty much every other rural constituency would have the same number, which causes problems.  First, the same names and similar addresses in rural areas needed to be overcome and, second, locations had multiple forms of address, which needed to be addressed.  These were the basic problems for Eircode.  Using geo-co-ordinates does not deal with the issue of multi-unit developments, so the Eircode postcode provides a specific code for a specific premises.  I have heard the argument about the hierarchical use of Eircode postcodes but what is to be done in the case of a one-off house in a rural area?  I know Deputy Ryan may not be as sympathetic as some of us to these issues but they must be dealt with.</p><p>More important, from Deputy Ryan's point of view, is that we need to develop a significant number of brownfield sites in Dublin.  How many Eircodes does one allocate to an existing vacant brownfield site?  Does that allocation then restrict the number of units one develops on that site?  If one develops additional units on that site, because of changes in designation or whatever the case may be, how would one decide on the Eircode numbers?  That then adds another level of confusion.  I have seen housing developments, particularly in the Chairman's constituency, where the site has had phased development.  The first phase of the development is numbers one to five, the second phase of the development, which was to be the third phase, is numbers 15 to 20, and the next phase is numbers five to ten.  Trying to find the next house number in some housing estates can be very confusing.  Therefore, when we cannot get that right, how will a hierarchical system work?</p><p> I think the model that has been used for Eircode is a good model.  I think it needs to be given the opportunity to prove itself but I think it will prove itself.  Anywhere in the world where postcodes have been introduced, it takes a period of time for people to become accustomed to them and to adopt them.  We spent a significant amount of money on rolling out the Eircode.  If it dealt solely with ensuring that ambulances got to the scene of an incident quicker, it would prove its worth.  I think it will prove itself in the medium term.  It is not going to happen overnight.</p><p> Deputy Dooley asked me about the underspend in the subhead.  The underspend is in respect of the national broadband plan.  We have allocated &euro;10 million for that.  As members know, it is a very complex contract.  It may be the case that we will not spend the full &euro;10 million.  We only bring in outside expertise as and when we require it.  It is my intention, if funding is available, to invest in energy efficiency later on in the year.  The SEAI better energy communities scheme has been over-subscribed.  The SEAI announced funding in respect of it last week.  I would like to drive more investment into the area of energy efficiency and insulation.  That is my intention, if funding is available.</p></speech>

I am conscious of time.  I will ask Deputy Lawless to ask questions on this programme before we move on to the next one.</p></speech>

I look forward to working on this committee.  I welcome the Minister and acknowledge his remarks on working with all groups and parties in the House.  That has been my experience of the Minister to date.</p> <p>  I have a specific question on subhead A3, the roll out of the national broadband.  The total for subhead A3 is &euro;16.2 million and the single largest line item of expenditure is the &euro;10 million allocation for the national broadband plan.  A sum of &euro;10 million is a nice round figure but I wonder how it will be spent.  In earlier remarks, the Minister alluded to the fact that some of it will be spent on consultancy and external expertise.  Given the highly technical nature of the roll-out plan, external expertise in engineering, technology and IT will be required.  The nature of consultancy projects are intangible.  It can be hard to quantify the deliverables and outputs.  My query relates to the tracking to be put in place on the engagement with external consultants and the kind of reporting structure that will be in place.  There is a project management adage - an IT project that NASA was running was one year overdue.  One of the programme managers asked how a project could be delivered one year late, the answer was one day at a time.</p><p>It is very apt.  It is a reminder to all of us involved in governance and oversight to ensure at the outset before the expenditure is approved that the checks and balances are in place.  It is in a consultant's interest to perpetuate the job and it is in the client's interest to achieve the deliverable in the shortest timeframe.  My question for the Minister and his officials is what kind of checks and balances are in place around the consultancy spend to ensure that the State is getting value for money and that the deliverables are produced and delivered in a timely fashion.  The briefing note refers to the intention to award the contract in 2017.  This is welcome but we need to ensure we are on track.</p></speech>

I am on top of the project.  We have an external procurement evaluation committee of outside expertise that has an overall supervisory role in respect of the overall project and in respect of the requests for any contracts.  All contracts go through the current public procurement process and would be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Secretary General of my Department is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the plan.</p> <p>  Let me explain what is involved.  Technical expertise is required on technical issues and economic modelling.  One of the consultant reports is on my desk and I am going through it with a finetooth comb.  Members will be hearing more about that in the next few weeks.  This expertise is a resource not just on the technical side, but helps me to make some of the decisions I must make on this project.  </p> <p>  All the consultancy contracts are being awarded after going through the public procurement process.  The information in online.  There is a very stringent assessment done of what is required and there are specific terms and conditions in respect of what we require.  We would not have this expertise in the technical area or in the economic modelling across the public sector.  We have seconded staff from other Departments and agencies with expertise in this area.  Some of the key staff on this project are not direct employees of the Department but have been seconded from other Departments and agencies to assist us with this project.</p></speech>

Public service broadcasters such as RTE and TG4 are funded through a mix of commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising, Exchequer grant payments and licence fee revenues.  Broadcasting licence fee receipts are estimated to be &euro;222 million in 2016.  The broadcasting programme provides &euro;185 million in television licence fee receipts to RTE to enable it to meet its statutory obligations as the national public service broadcaster.  In addition, the programme provides &euro;9.4 million in television licence fee receipts and &euro;25.4 million in grant payments to TG4 to produce a comprehensive range of programming in the Irish language.  Programme B also funds new Irish television and radio programmes through the broadcasting fund operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The fund receives 7% of net television licence fee receipts, which amounts to &euro;14.7 million in 2016.</p> <p>  There is a vacancy on the board of RTE.  I can make that appointment following a nomination by the committee.</p><p>I ask the committee to deal with that when it has the opportunity because we would like to have the full board in place, particularly with Dee Forbes coming in as the new director general.  It would be of assistance to her if we had a full board in place.</p></speech>

To come back to his earlier point on engagement with the chairman designate of An Post, we had a discussion with members yesterday.  We feel it would be better to wait until the joint Oireachtas committee is in place.  We are waiting on four senators to be appointed.  At that point, we will be able to progress.</p></speech>

We have heard different views on funding models.  There was a proposal on the initiation of a broadcasting charge, which has been in gestation for some time.  Very early in his tenure, the Minister made a couple of profound statements, for want of a better word, where he ruled out the introduction of any broadcasting charge.  Obviously, that is a policy decision he has taken but it does not get away from the fact that both the commercial and public sectors have funding issues.  When the independent broadcasters come before us, they talk about the public service dimension to their work: the provision of local and regional news, and of information on sporting events.  By its nature, that is expensive to provide and is not covered by the commercial support they receive from advertising.  That is for the smaller independent entities.  In the event of a broadcasting charge and the additional revenues that would flow from it if there was full collection, they hoped that there would have been the potential for them to gain support from it.  I would have been a strong supporter of that.  Likewise, I have read reports from the BAI, representatives of which came before us in the past and clearly made the point that RTE would need additional funding to meet its obligations.  We have had arguments here in the past that I thought were superfluous about thinking we could resolve that issue by paying less to certain stars.  I have always tried to avoid that kind of debate but it often gets popular vent in other media outlets.  The fact is there are funding shortfalls in both the public and private sides that need to be addressed.  There is an inability to collect some &euro;30 million from the licence fee.  There seems to be even a reduction in that because of people moving away from using televisions, as opposed to those who have televisions but are not paying the fee, with the advent of just-in-time delivery of the TV that you want.  We are all using iPads now in addition to televisions.  How does one square the circle to ensure the sector is adequately funded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#N00600"><p>First, to deal with the public service broadcasting charge, the previous Government committed to examining the role and collection of the TV licence fee in the light of the existing and projected convergence of technologies, as Deputy Dooley mentioned.  This proposed public service broadcasting charge was designed to secure a more stable funding stream for broadcasting.</p><p>The Department completed a value for money assessment and engaged in public consultation.  It received about 385 submissions in late 2013 with a view to assessing the scope of a new scheme.  It needs to be remembered that my predecessor, Alex White, indicated in April of last year that it would not be introduced during the term of that Government.  When I was appointed Minister, the position was that the previous Minister had placed the broadcasting charge in limbo.  We could continue to tinker about, use it as an excuse to do nothing or try to drive it through a legislative process which has limited Government time as a result of the new structures.  There are other legislative priorities in the Department.  I had to weigh up how I would achieve the best outcome.  The Energy Bill had a high priority in the previous D&aacute;il but on foot of the vote last Thursday, it is even more important.  There are also other issues.  I could have said we would continue to deal with the broadcasting charge and would work on it for the next 18 months when, in reality, it will not see the light of day in the short term.  I think the Deputy is correct.  We have to acknowledge that technology is changing.  I am not saying the broadcasting charge should be shelved completely but there are opportunities in the short term to bring in additional income into the sector.  There is large scale evasion with many people not paying their television licence fee.  I do not think anywhere in Europe has similar levels of evasion.  It is three times higher than the level in the United Kingdom and in Germany.  It is estimated that the loss could be up to &euro;40 million per annum.  There are other anomalies within the system that limit the collection of the licence fee.  I think we can make far more practical progress in increasing real income by focusing on that in the short term.</p></speech>

I refer to the success of the non-principal private residence tax.  I am sure the Minister's constituency office deals with the backlog as I do when people get to a point where they need to sell a property.  The revenues are still ahead of projected profile even at this stage.  Is there a role for the Revenue Commissioners here?</p></speech>

As Deputy Ryan knows, the solution to every problem is another Bill rather than using the existing structures far more efficiently to deliver.  Deputy Ryan was at the national economic discussion on Monday at which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made the point that it is not just about spending new moneys but it is about whether we are spending our existing moneys wisely.  Can we spend moneys in a better and more efficient way?  There is a structure for collecting money which I do not believe is being delivered in as an efficient a manner as it could be in respect of revenues coming in.  There are many aspects to that.  Deputy Dooley's suggestion in regard to Revenue may very well be something at which we could look.  The number of people who claim they do not have a television is rising rapidly.  I honestly do not believe this is the reality.  There are a number of avenues are open to us in the short term and I believe it is more fruitful to take an avenue that will bring real cash into the broadcasting sector.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of public service broadcasting.  I met the independent broadcasters and addressed their annual conference earlier this month.  I met RTE's representatives.  There has been a benefit from the synergies between RTE and the independent broadcasters.</p><p>The radio app has been a phenomenal success.  We can build on relationships like that.  I do not think the objectives of RTE are as divergent from the objectives of the independent broadcasters as people would like to think.  I think they are willing to work together and I am willing to assist them in that process.</p></speech>

The difficulty for the Minister is that the broadcasting fund is half the allocation.  There is not much other stuff to cut.</p> <p>  Is the &euro;185,724,000 the final outcome for 2015?  If the Minister believes there is an additional &euro;40 million to be collected in licence fees, what approach would he take to try to get it?  For example he could consider taking the collection of fees from An Post, as Deputy Dooley seems to be suggesting a role for the Revenue Commissioners or some other collection mechanism.  I am sure that would raise issues for An Post.  If the Minister does not get the legislative time to introduce an alternative broadcasting charge, what is the process by which he would look to get extra revenue?</p></speech>

In 2015, the total income from licence sales was &euro;1,018,444 and in 2014 it was &euro;1,018,370, a marginal difference.  That was the reason for the marginal difference in the proceeds.</p> <p>  In respect of the comments I made on the national economic dialogue, I inadvertently referred to the comments as those of the Secretary General, Robert Watt, instead of attributing them to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe as it was he who pointed out that we need to look at how we are spending the money rather than cutting left, right and centre.  It is important that we look at how we are spending the money and ensure we are spending it in the best way possible rather than always looking for new money, which I will be looking for.  I believe there is merit in that.</p> <p>  In regard to the collection of the television licence fee, one could look at changing from An Post, but that is not what I am looking at currently.  I had a meeting with An Post last week.  I expressed my concern about the level of evasion.  I know that An Post is coming forward with an initiative in the next couple of months.  I want to see progress on this in the short term.  In tandem with that, we are looking at the existing database.  We have had independent consultants look at the existing database in the context of the local property tax register, the electricity meter register and to look at other ways of identifying people who may be evading the television licence fee.</p><p>There are also issues relating to content charges being explored, so it is not just about the television licence.  There are other avenues for us to pursue in that regard.</p><p> The Chairman asked me earlier about Brexit.  There is potential to develop the film industry in this country on foot of Brexit.  Conditions are being put down at Commission level on the percentage of content that must be generated within the European Union for the likes of Netflix and so forth.  We will be the only English-speaking country left in the European Union and there may be potential for growth in that regard.  There are opportunities for us, particularly in the broadcasting area.  There are implications that may benefit revenue streams for broadcasters as well, and we are actively looking at such issues now.</p></speech>

Irish TV has looked to broadcast on Saorview and we gave authorisation within the last month to Oireachtas TV to broadcast on Saorview.  It is now doing so.  I am sure they are admiring my highlights this morning.  We have approved Irish TV for broadcast but there are some technical issues and documentation that must be clarified.  We hope to have that live on Saorview in the next few months.  We will facilitate that as quickly as possible.  I will revert to the committee on the specific questions.</p></speech>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, spoke about ensuring productivity in what we are doing.  Will the Minister share with members of the committee the latest analysis from RTE's review of its operations?  Is there a departmental review or could we see RTE's own review of its efficiency and productivity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#Q00800"><p>A number of reviews have taken place and some elements, as the Deputy understands, are commercially sensitive.  I will ask my officials to look into what has been done.  There has been a NewERA efficiency review and the key findings were that RTE had demonstrated efficiency and now produces more at less cost than it did in 2003.  In comparison with European peers, RTE experienced the largest decline in revenues between 2008 and 2012 and reduced its operating costs by more.  RTE is in a constrained financial position and its ability to undertake any meaningful capital expenditure in the future will be challenging.  The suggestions made by NewERA included the identification and assessment of potential cost savings via the reduction or elimination of some services and a review of services that are currently or could be provided by the market.  That review is taking place.  It was also suggested there should be a robust analysis of options regarding the use, in part or whole, of the site in Donnybrook, and that analysis has been completed.  I expect a memo on that quite soon.  It was suggested there should be additional public funding for the consideration of in-house production and independent commissioning through a review of the possible introduction of an approach based on the window of creative competition used by the BBC.</p> <p>  Deputy Lawless asked about outside consultants and the great benefit of NewERA is that it has gone to many semi-State bodies under my control and had the ability to do an "in-house" assessment, so to speak, within Government.  It is separate from my Department but it can do an independent evaluation.  This is more open and transparent but we are still talking about Government doing the assessment.</p><p>We found NewERA extremely useful not just in carrying out reviews like that done in RTE, but across the board.  It is involved with a review currently in An Post.  There are projects coming before me for authorisation of investment, in this country or elsewhere, and NewERA can do an independent evaluation and give its views to me on them, which is very beneficial to me in making a final decision on whether to approve an investment by some of the semi-State bodies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#R00200"><p>I have a question on subhead B5, which relates to funding for TG4.  There is an increase of just under 1%, going from &euro;33.16 million to &euro;33.46 million.  My understanding is there is a plan to increase the number of hours, or minutes at least, of Irish language programming.  As the Minister mentioned, we will potentially be the only English-speaking country in the European Union but we are also the only Irish-speaking country in the Union, although we may have some Celtic neighbours.  The Irish language is going through somewhat of a revival, and in the last election campaign in my constituency, Gaelscoileanna and bunscoileanna were, and continue to be, major issues.  There are business interests like Cill Dara le Gaeilge and other groups that have embraced the language locally.  I notice within the EU, 180 jobs are to be created for Irish language linguists and translators by the end of 2021.  All the appearances are that the Irish language has gone through a revival and is strengthening.</p> <p>  In this context, any move towards increasing the Irish language programme is to be welcomed and encouraged.  If my understanding is correct, will the increase be directed towards extra Irish language programming?  Are there any intentions to go further and up the number of hours again?  All the signals point to a revival of the language and this is something we should seek to encourage in the House.  Will the Minister comment on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#R00300"><p>I know it is an issue close to the Chairman's heart.  The funding of TG4 was reduced by &euro;500,000 in 2015 and this reduction, combined with an increased pressure on commercial income due to competition in the broadcasting market, made TG4's budget exceptionally challenging and impacted on the station's ability to deliver on its commitments for 2015.  For example, TG4 was unable to increase its hours of new and original Irish language content in 2015, as originally planned.  An additional &euro;300,000 in current funding has been provided in 2016 to assist TG4 in meeting its obligations and allow it to compete by producing more home-produced content to help distinguish itself from international channels.  The moneys paid to TG4 are key to ensuring the continued access to a comprehensive range of programming in the Irish language.  TG4 will continue to maintain cost efficiency on commissioned programmes and in-house productions and to control its overheads and costs to maintain a lean and cost-effective structure.</p> <p>  Investment in new, innovative Irish language programming and content will help retain and grow TG4's audience for its scheduled and online offering.  The Fios F&iacute;se project is an initiative devised specifically in response to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's five-year review.  It sees the creation of a new audience measurement tool for TG4's core audience, which will furnish weekly quantitative and qualitative audience data and information to TG4 from a panel of 350 viewers using online reporting methods.  TG4 broadcasts 24 hours a day and in 2015 it broadcast an average of 4.8 hours of new original Irish language content output per day.  Total Irish language broadcast hours were 5,021 in 2015, some 57.3% of the total broadcast hours.</p><p>TG4 ensured that 75% of all public funding in 2015 went directly into the production of Irish language programming content, which is above its commitment of 70%.  The remaining 25% is spent on its broadcast and related activities.  TG4 commissioned almost &euro;21.2 million in programming from the independent production section in 2015 and included 680 hours of new Irish language programming in addition to more than 700 hours of re-voiced material and subtitling.</p><p> In fairness to TG4, it has some of the most innovative programming.  Most public representatives do not see a lot of television but some of the programmes I do see are those on TG4 and these do not just relate to sport.  Its programming has been innovative in terms of history and new types of programmes, particularly those for younger people.  It must be remembered that the vast majority of content that younger people are accessing is coming in from and being broadcast by production companies outside the European Union.  It is important that we have good quality content and both TG4 and RTE provide it through their television channels.</p></speech>

In 2013, it was 1.7%.  The national share should be viewed in the context of the decline in the viewing share of the major channels broadcasting in Ireland and increased competition arising from multiple channels offered on cable and satellite.  I must say that I think TG4 has really tried to reach out to those outside of its traditional catchment and outside of Gaeilgeoirs in Gaelscoileanna even.  It has innovatively used sport as a mechanism to do that.  If we are determined to support the Irish language, we should be determined to try to get the language to a farther broader catchment than it does at present.</p></speech>

Would the Minister consider bringing his NewERA team to look at RTE's options in terms of alternative sites for RTE?  Could we look at Moore St. for example?  It is a big development area in the centre of town.  We could put RTE back where it started near Henry St. and the centre of the foundation of the State.  We could launch thousands of new Eircode addresses for homes in the 35 acres in Donnybrook, half of which at the moment is rolling meadow or carpark, which is a ridiculous use of space close to the centre of town.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister's comments.  GAA Beo and some of the sporting programmes, in particular, have broadened TG4's audience.  I am not sure if it is in the budget or technically possible but an option to switch on and off the use of Irish language subtitles would also be a further aid.  People tune in but may struggle with the dialects and the cainteanna can vary.  This is something the team could perhaps take away to talk about.  I think it would aid education on and the take-up of the language.</p></speech>

We still have the old Marconi transmitter in Athlone and are hoping to make a museum and visitor attraction out of it.  I look forward to bringing the committee down to visit it when we get it up and running.  At the moment the objective is to consolidate the Montrose site.  We are examining the possibility of disposing of part of the site and reinvesting the capital.  Currently the focus is on the Montrose site and how best it can be utilised and leveraged in the interests of the company.  In the longer term, however, I am quite happy to bring it to Athlone.</p></speech>

I invite the Minister to give a brief opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#S01500"><p>The focus of programme C is on energy and the delivery of the key elements of the Government's energy policy to ensure a security of supply, competitive energy supply and environmental sustainability.</p><p>The programme provides &euro;7.3 million to cover the operational costs of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and more than &euro;61 million for the better energy grant programmes.  The better energy grant programmes operated by the SEAI include the better energy homes scheme to provide grants towards a range of energy efficiency measures to home owners, the better energy warmer homes scheme to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households and the better energy community programme to encourage community-based partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock and energy-poor homes.</p><p> The three schemes are anticipated to deliver energy savings of 173 GWh in 2016 and provide approximately 9,000 low-income homes with energy efficiency measures - that is 36 homes per day - while continuing to stimulate activity in the retrofit industry, supporting approximately 2,300 jobs.  The energy programme provides for expenditure to fund applied energy research along with demonstration programmes and projects.  When the committee gets up and running, its members might get the opportunity, no more than myself, to travel around the country.  I am hoping to visit the research facilities in Galway and Cork.  It might be useful if the committee were to have a public outreach hearing in both of those venues to see what is going on there.</p><p> On Brexit, the critical issue for my Department is in the area of energy.  We have an all-island electricity market - the single electricity market - in partnership with Northern Ireland.  The agreement between the two Governments - the Irish Government and the UK Government - is working and our intention is to continue to progress it.  We have a single regulatory system and a single owner, Eirgrid, across the island.  It is our intention to work closely with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  This is why the Energy Bill 2016 is of such critical importance.  It is to ensure that we have the most flexible single electricity market on the island of Ireland as is possible.</p><p> There are also issues relating to gas supplies.  The committee is aware that a substantial amount of our gas comes through the UK.  There are emergency provisions within the EU regulations regarding gas supplies and share rationing, which, naturally enough, involve the UK at the moment.  These will remain in place unless specifically replaced.  We will have to see how it works out over the next two to two and a half years in the negotiations.</p><p> The other side of this is the fact that we have a strategic oil reserve.  Under the International Energy Agency rules, member countries, including Ireland, are required to have 90 days of oil in storage.  The EU also mandates that these stocks are held in the European Union.  Approximately 20% of our stocks are in the UK and we will have to reach a satisfactory arrangement in that regard but it is not an issue in the short term.  It is important to remember that this is a condition laid down by the International Energy Agency.  The UK is also a member of the agency and that will not change on foot of the referendum vote.</p><p> While there are energy issues that need to be addressed, from a European point of view it is important to remember that our connectivity to the European gas and electricity grids is through the UK.  The latter is a major supplier of energy not just to Ireland but to continental Europe.  It is in everyone's interests that the energy union being progressed at present include the UK, not just to benefit all member states, particularly Ireland, but also to meet the need for energy security across the European Union so that it will not be dependent on less stable countries - usually those located to the east of the Union.</p></speech>

Connectivity with the UK is obviously of concern.  Under subheads C4 and C5, there is a consider spend on sustainable energy million.  A sum of &euro;58.8 million is the largest line item in the Vote while the energy research programme has a spend of &euro;9.5 million.  We debated the Energy Bill 2016 in the House last night, which will become before the committee shortly.  The regulator will be given further powers to administer sanctions.  The State is investing heavily in sustainable energy as a whole and in research.  Given this investment in sustainable energy and research and the strengthening of the regulator, is the Minister any closer to issuing wind energy guidelines?  Is that covered under the research or energy programmes?  The guidelines were expected three years ago.  Before further spending takes place, are we closer to seeing the guidelines?  In the context of strengthening regulation and providing assurance to communities concerned about development and the lack of up to date guidelines, it would comfort many people if they were in place.</p></speech>

When I was on the other side of the committee room, I grilled my predecessor and the previous Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about why this was not happening.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to have the new guidelines in place within three to six months.  We are working on them at the moment and I have asked committee members to meet me tomorrow to discuss this issue and ascertain what are their objectives.  There have been many public hearings on this.  We have all listened to what communities have to say and we have to try to strike a fair balance in this context.  There are opportunities in respect of renewable energy as a whole and wind energy, in particular.  We need to balance them in the context of the issues that communities have, and how they can have a greater role not just in consultation, which is important, but in respect of the returns that may be generated by these projects.  I will thrash that out in greater detail tomorrow with members of the committee and it is my objective to have the guidelines in place as quickly as possible.  It would be great if it could happen sooner.  There are a number of complexities but our objective is to deliver them within six months.</p></speech>

I would also add energy efficiency to that within the 20% target we had.</p></speech>

They are challenging but I am not taking my foot off the throttle on this, nor is the Department.  I do not intend to throw in the towel on it.  Based on the provisional outturn for 2015, with regard to electricity, for which the target is 40% by 2020, we are at 25.3%; heat, 6.8%, with a target of 12%; and transport, 5.7%, with an target of 10%.  We intend to make an announcement later this year regarding RES-H, which will, hopefully, have a significant impact on the figures.  We will achieve our targets for electricity or be close to them.</p><p>There are a number of issues at the moment that are not directly under my control, which we are trying to resolve to facilitate that happening.  We hope to come close to the overall target of 16%.  There is no doubt we have a great deal of work to do.</p><p> With regard to energy efficiency, the cheapest barrel of oil is the one we do not burn.  Significant progress can be made, which is why I said earlier if funding is available under the national broadband plan and it is released later this year, it will be put into energy efficiency at community and domestic level.  More can be done in this regard and at public sector level.  For example, the largest bill for local authorities is electricity.  That could be reduced by 50% if public lighting throughout the State was changed.  We are actively working on that and that would provide individual local authorities with additional money to invest in their communities rather than damaging our environment.</p></speech>

This relates to renewable targets as well.  I do not have the exact figures but if the State misses the renewable targets, there will be fines of hundreds of millions of euro annually because we are nowhere near them.  We do not have a snowball's chance in hell of achieving them unless the Department changes what it is doing.  Business as usual will not get us there because even that is going into reverse.  Energy efficiency does not have the same implications in respect of fines but the overall energy efficiency figures in the output statement, in 2014, the Government had an output target of 405 GW in energy savings but it only achieved 169 GW.  There was a CO2 equivalent target of 100 kilotonnes but only 41 was achieved, which is less than half.  Across the board, the State is going radically in the wrong direction for all its renewable, energy efficiency and carbon reduction targets and is facing huge costs as well as inefficiencies and so on.</p> <p>  The SEAI pointed out the obvious that if we were to meet our targets and save ourselves the several million euro a year in fines we are facing, we would require a threefold increase in energy efficiency investment and a fivefold increase in our investment in alternative transport systems to take the targets seriously.  We have an amazing urgency in this committee to examine how those increases in spending will be provided for these sectors over the next two to three years if we are to meet the 2020 targets.  There is no reason to fail to do this but political will is required and it will not be easy for a Department that is used to spending approximately &euro;100 million to ramp up its spending to &euro;500 million or &euro;60 million but that needs to be done.  If not, the State will be paying &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million annually in fines.  That is not a small task but that is what must be done in two years.</p></speech>

The Deputy would rightly criticise me if I did not acknowledge the potential risk if we do not reach our targets.  As he will be aware, having sat on this side of the table, if I am going to leverage the investment I require, I need to have a carrot and a stick.</p><p>If we meet bills like this in 2020 I will have far greater leverage to get the investment I require.  There is absolutely no doubt that we need more money for energy efficiency.  There are, however, issues outside my Estimate, such as carbon tax and the energy efficiency fund.  Some good innovative projects are getting off the ground.  There is no point investing in something that will not deliver.  There have been several very successful pilots.  We all read last week or the week before about what Electrical and Pump Services, EPS, has done in Cork, which is effectively a bike to work scheme for energy efficiency among its employees.  Can that be expanded and developed on a large scale?  There are many more projects, such as the warmth and well-being innovation we are now rolling out in Walkinstown and Tallaght, which has an impact on people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, not only improving the comfort of their homes but also potentially reducing admissions to accident and emergency departments, presentations to general practitioners and visits by public health nurses, which has a knock-on impact on the Department of Health.  As I said at the beginning of this meeting, my Department is a facilitative one.  We can drive the change and the benefits can be seen in other Departments, such as the Department of housing, planning and local government in respect of public lighting, the warmth and well-being programme and the Department of Health.  However, we do need more money, particularly in the energy efficiency area.</p><p> There are problems and challenges, not just to get the money but in respect of the financial constraints placed on us by the European Commission.  I was five days into the job when I met with Commissioner Ca&ntilde;ete and one of the first things I raised with him was the fact that even if we do get the money we could be restricted in what we could spend, which is bizarre because if we do not spend it we will face penalties post-2020.  It makes far more sense to spend that money on reducing the amount of carbon that goes into the environment and reducing energy bills for families around the country than on paying fines.</p></speech>

We have only a thousand electric vehicles; that number needs to multiply by a factor of five or ten, which would give us benefits in terms of balancing supply, as would getting rid of the oil-fired central heating systems and replacing them with heat pumps.  We need to tell the public about the radical nature of what we committed to in Paris.  The figures for 2020 are in the ha'penny place compared with our Paris commitment.  The Minister has only just arrived in his post and I am not making him responsible for that, but if we are serious about climate change this Department must multiply its scale, activity and ambition three- or fivefold and the Minister has to convince the rest of the Government to allow him do that.  There will be health and other benefits.</p></speech>

We need someone to certify that it is reliable and sustainable technology.</p><p> One of the big concerns about large-scale biomass has been whether we will get the woodchip needed to run those burners if we put the capital investment in at the start.  The growing of miscanthus around the country was an unmitigated disaster.  There is plenty of elephant grass at the moment.  It is a bit like the Christmas tree market some years ago.  We need to make sure people invest in the right technology.  At the national economic dialogue we said we needed the equivalent of a Teagasc - a respected, State-supported agency that can certify that a particular technology works and will be beneficial to people - for energy efficiency.  That is the first challenge, in tandem with making the capital investment.  While we do need significant capital investment and a radical change in the short term on that, we need to get the basics right to make sure that when we roll something out on a large scale we have the level of uptake required to make that impact.</p></speech>

We now move on to programme D, natural resources.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to give us a brief overview.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#X00300"><p>I congratulate my constituency colleague on her appointment as chair of the committee.</p> <p>  The natural resources section comprises petroleum services, mining services and Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, services.  The Department&rsquo;s role in petroleum services includes developing and maintaining an appropriate policy and regulatory framework to underpin oil and gas exploration and production activities, including engagement at national, EU and wider international level, together with the development of the legislation focused on safety, protection of the environment and fiscal terms.  The International Energy Agency forecasts that oil and natural gas will remain significant in the world&rsquo;s energy supply to 2035, and there are significant and sustained benefits to the State and people of Ireland over an extended period of years for oil and petroleum found here. </p> <p>  Mining is undertaken by private industry either under State mining leases for State-owned minerals or State mining licences for privately owned minerals.  Ireland ranks as Europe&rsquo;s second largest producer of zinc metal in concentrate and the eleventh largest producer in the world.  In addition, Ireland is Europe&rsquo;s fifth largest producer of lead metal in concentrate and sixteenth in the world.  In terms of the challenges in the Department, there is an extensive programme of remediation works at five of the six identified former mining sites, particularly Silvermines in County Tipperary and Avoca. </p> <p>  The GSI is a division of the Department which does excellent work and acts as the State geosites agency.  It manages several nationally strategic initiatives through a few programme budgets which have been amalgamated into a single subhead.  There is the Tellus programme, the geological environmental baseline survey, with aircraft flying at 60 m surveying the Galway west area and providing very important data, and Integrated Mapping for the sustainable development of Ireland's Marine Resource, INFOMAR, which is the national seabed mapping programme.  INFOMAR will commence phase 2 of the mapping of all remaining areas not already mapped in phase 1 to complete 100% coverage of all Irish waters.  There is a significant amount of good work being done, particularly in the GSI&rsquo;s research strategy.</p></speech>

To answer the question put by Robert Watt, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the national economic dialogue, "Where would you save?", one immediate saving we should make is to shut down our petroleum services division.  It would not result in a huge saving but there is no moral way we as a State can continue to look for oil and gas when we know that four-fifths of known fossil fuel resources now have to stay in the ground.  Oil at $100 a barrel will not be viable.</p><p>On a moral and a pure leadership basis, we cannot continue to take oil out of the ground.  There is no case for new exploration and we should shut it down.  We should not award the 2015 Atlantic margin oil and gas licensing rounds.  We should be honest with the developers.  We should set ourselves out as a divestment State.  This divestment movement is growing across the world in universities, churches and social groups.  We have to stop looking for oil and gas, so that is the first saving I would make.  We have fine people in the Department and I have nothing against them at all but purely on moral grounds, the Minister cannot sign the licences.  If he signs them, then we will not divest and will burn our planet.  We cannot do it and we have to stop.</p></speech>

As I said, the International Energy Agency forecasts that oil and gas will remain a significant element of the world's energy supply up to 2035.  Most of the growth for oil and natural gas in the coming decades is forecast to come from Asia.  With the growth in vehicle ownership, it is estimated that Asia will account for two out of every three barrels of crude oil traded internationally, up from fewer than one in two today.  The increased demand for natural gas from industry and power generation is projected to raise global demand by 50% by 2040.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Minister has clear plans for the renewable sector and how to face its challenges.  The world depends on a relatively small number of petroleum provinces that are mainly located in areas of political instability.  Ireland is a stable country which may have oil or gas deposits.  The international figures are quite startling.  Some &euro;900 billion per year is spent on oil and gas development.  If Ireland were to strike significant reserves of oil and gas, as a stable political country, it would add to the overall international supply.  There are international agreements and we cannot control what China and Asia does.  We have responsibilities in Ireland and within the European Union to reduce the use of fossil fuels here.  We must also develop renewable resources and within the Department that is going ahead.  There are still financial benefits to the State accruing from the possibility of oil exploration.</p></speech>

I saw it happen in other areas during the interregnum and I welcome us revisiting that.  Subhead D3 deals with petroleum services.  A sum of &euro;441,000 has been allocated but it is a significant decrease from the previous year's allocation of &euro;4.6 million.  That means the budget has been cut to 10% of the previous year.  At the same time, it appears that the projected number of licences under active regulation has increased from 60 to 75.  We have set a target of 75 licences, which is greater than 60 licences, while at the same time, we have massively decreased the funding allocated to this area from &euro;4.6 million to &euro;441,000.  Why has the allocation been decreased?</p> <p>  My second question is related.  The current budget is &euro;441,000 for petroleum services and active regulation.  What percentage, if any, is geared towards encouraging, engaging with or inviting companies to apply for further licences or leases for gas and oil exploration?</p><p> My next query ties in a little bit with a question asked by Deputy Ryan.  The Minister has said that the State will benefit from these projects and at least one licence has been signed.  What benefits does the State reap from these projects?  This matter has been the subject of controversy in the past.  What happens with royalties?  What are the taxation arrangements?  Is there a payback or return for the State?  Can the State directly access the resources at a preferential rate?  Can the Minister outline the arrangements that are in place?  Is it intended to revisit the arrangements for future contracts?  Where does this matter sit at the moment?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that there has been a lot of discussion over the period.  There have been a number of changes over the years.  The latest change took place in 2014 when there was a replacement of a profit resource rent tax with a petroleum production rent tax in respect of new petroleum authorisations and linked to the profitability of discoveries.  Also, maximum marginal rate rises from 40% to 55%, with a minimum petroleum production tax of 5% of revenues as soon as a field goes into production.  The fiscal terms that apply to production from a petroleum lease are determined by the date of the award of the initial petroleum authorisation.  That was a change from 2007 where there was an additional profit resource rent tax of between 5% and 15% introduced and linked to the profitability of discoveries.  In 1992, corporation tax was reduced to 25% below the general rate of 50%.  There have been changes over the years but the State benefits from oil exploration.</p> <p>  The sum of &euro;4 million was a once-off payment that was received in 2015.  It related to the offshore data sales for companies that bid for the licences on the Atlantic margin.</p></speech>

It provides a grant to Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is responsible for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland's inland fisheries resource.</p> <p>  The inland fisheries programme includes an allocation of just under &euro;15 million towards the staff cost of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  The Loughs Agency is a North-South body and is co-funded on a 50:50 basis by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland.  Also included in the programme is &euro;12 million for non-pay current capital expenditure by the two agencies.</p> <p>  There are a number of programmes.  The eel management plan has caused concern in the past.  The latest scientific advice is that the status of the eel remains critical and that all production and-or escapement of silver eels should be reduced or kept to as close to zero as possible.  There is no change in the perception of the status of the stock as being critically endangered.  </p> <p>  There is also a salmon management regime.  As part of the IFI's budget, money has been earmarked for salmon management initiatives such as river habitat improvement and fish stock rehabilitation.</p> <p>  We are carrying out a comprehensive review of the IFI legislation, including the consolidation of the 13 Inland Fisheries Acts that date back to 1959.  </p> <p>  In terms of challenges facing my Department, one challenge is tackling invasive species.  In this instance the National Parks and Wildlife Service is the lead agency and not Inland Fisheries Ireland but it has a role in co-operating with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in that regard.</p></speech>

Given that there was no difference between the output targets based on the revised Estimates for 2016 when compared with the 2015 Estimates, can the Minister of State explain why there has been an increase of 2.7% in expenditure?

I thank the Minister of State for his overview.  He mentioned conservation and the conservation of salmon stocks, in particular.  There has been conservation of salmon stocks with the imposition of a ban on certain rivers and fisheries.  He mentioned this matter in his opening statement and I him to elaborate a little further on the success of the programme.  Has conservation continued under this programme?

There is a cross-Border dimension to the Loughs Agency and payments are made there in sterling.  Obviously, sterling has changed again since Brexit but there may be savings there.</p> <p>  On the salmon management regime, salmon is a listed species under the habitats directive.  The management of salmon is designed to ensure that stocks are appropriately protected and that adequate spawn survives over the winter to ensure the long-term survival of the genetically individual river stock.  There are 143 salmon rivers and a counting project is carried out every year to ascertain whether there is a surplus of stock such as to permit fishing.  Every year in late autumn to October, there is an assessment and recommendations are given locally as to which rivers are open for fishing.  It is very scientific.  Every salmon returns to the river where it was born, so it is important to be able to assess the status of every river.  That is what has been done.  That said, the stock itself is still under considerable threat in the North Atlantic due to predation, sea lice and different things.  It is an ongoing process to ensure that we have the best scientific data and knowledge available to maintain the salmon species, which is so important to our angling sector.  </p> <p>  The Chairman asked at the outset about Brexit and sterling and we may have a significant reduction in tourism from the English market this year, which affects the country as a whole.  However, that includes a significant revenue derived by the angling sector from British tourists.  That has an impact.  Since 2007, commercial and recreational angling has been restricted to those stocks in rivers which are meeting their conservation limits.  That is important because we do not want to see any area wiped out or overfished in regard to this valuable resource.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCS2016062900002#AA00200"><p>That is good to hear.  I have a supplementary question on salmon stocks and conservation measures.  As the Minister of State said, salmon is endangered and listed in the Habitats Directive.  It is in peril.  There is a focus on recreational angling inspections and restrictions on certain rivers to preserve salmon stocks within them at certain periods, all of which makes a lot of sense.  I ask the Department to consider that angling is only one part of the issue.  On a good day, an angler might catch one salmon.  It might take several days fishing to take one.  Someone can arrive at an estuary with a net and pull out 100 salmon in two hours.  That is where the problem is, that is, illegal netting around the estuaries with people working off boats and some from jetties and piers.  That is the nub of the problem and, as such, I ask the Minister of State whether the Estimate includes inspections and sanctions in that regard.  That is where the focus needs to be to really tackle the problem.  Anglers are one part of it but by their nature, they tend to value the fish and the species.  It is in their interests to perpetuate the stock for themselves and future generations.  Netters have no such scruples.  I put it to the Minister of State that it is an area that needs careful monitoring, inspections and sanctions where people are found in breach.</p></speech>

There are always challenges in regard to resources but the agency has moved towards newer technologies, for example, patrolling rivers by kayak to cover more ground and hidden cameras to catch poachers.  It is very much to the forefront of Inland Fisheries Ireland's mind.  I will be meeting the board of Inland Fisheries tomorrow in Dublin and it is certainly something I will raise with it in terms of resources.  As with any Department, there is a continued need for additional funding and resources.  Certainly, the conservation of fish stocks and preventing illegal fishing and netting are very important to Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p></speech>

The Geological Survey of Ireland has fee income and the petroleum division has income where people access our data.  Historically, income was derived from the emergency call-answering service, but that is not coming in now.  That is why it is zero.  The money paid out in respect of it is listed under programme A.

On 10 May, the CWU advised Conduit, the contractor, that it was seeking the assistance of the advisory service of the Workplace Relations Commission and disengaging from any further industrial action.  We are monitoring that.  It is going to the Workplace Relations Commission where, hopefully, the issues can be resolved.  There are a number of centres and when the one in Navan went offline the last time, the service was picked up by some of the other centres.  From the public's point of view in relation to security, the service has been maintained.  Naturally, whenever there is industrial action, it is concerning.  I encourage all the parties involved to engage with the Workplace Relations Commission to resolve the issue.</p></speech>

At today's meeting, the select committee will consider these Estimates and report back to the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  At the outset, I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, congratulate her on her appointment and wish her every good luck on behalf of the committee during her tenure in charge of that Department.  The committee looks forward to working very closely with her to ensure she achieves our collective goals for the Department during this period.  I also acknowledge her officials who are here, Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Mr. Dermot Ryan, assistant secretary, and Ms Bernie McNally, assistant secretary.</p> <p>  The proposed format of today's meeting is that we will hear brief opening remarks from the Minister before going on to deal with Vote 40 on a programme-by-programme basis.  At the outset of the consideration of each of the programmes, the Minister may give an overview of the programme, including detailing any pressures likely to impact on her Department's performance or expenditure relating to the programme in 2016.  We will then open it up to the floor for questions from members of the committee.  </p> <p>  I remind members and those in the Gallery that their mobile phones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording equipment in committee rooms if in silent mode.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on the Minister to make brief opening remarks on the overall expenditure of the Department before proceeding to Vote 40.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016062900002#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  As members know, this is my first appearance before the committee and I would like to start by wishing the committee and its members well in their deliberations.  I send my good wishes to and congratulate Deputy Jim Daly as he assumes the Chair.  I wish him the best in his leadership role.</p> <p>  I am very happy to be here to discuss my Department's 2016 Revised Estimate.  I remain fully committed to ensuring the full delivery of the programme for Government commitments in delivering real reform for child welfare and protection services; building affordable, high-quality and sustainable early years services for our citizens under the age of six; and enabling the full citizenship participation and engagement of our young people.  I have high hopes for them.</p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for my Department in 2016 provides a gross funding provision of &euro;1.138 billion, which is an increase of &euro;98 million or 9% over the 2015 allocation of &euro;1.04 billion.  As Deputies are aware, there are two major elements to the additional resources in the Vote for 2016.  They are an &euro;85 million package of investment for child care and early years and substantially increased resources for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency so it can meet its obligations to children and be placed on a firm financial footing.  </p> <p>   Affordability, accessibility and quality are at the heart of the &euro;85 million child care and early years package.  The measures provided for include an extension of free preschool provision by extending the age range for children accessing the scheme.  The maximum number of weeks of free preschool education to which a child is entitled will increase.  On average, it is estimated that children will be entitled to avail of 23 additional weeks of free preschool provision under this measure.</p><p>My understanding is that we have all advocated for this change.  This extended free preschool provision will increase current investment in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, which stands at &euro;1.724 million, by &euro;47 million in 2016.  These costs include full restoration of capitation payments to providers to pre-2012 levels from 2016.  The child care package also provides supports to help children with disabilities to fully participate in preschool education under the ECCE programme.  The supports will cost &euro;15 million in 2016.  Full-year costs from 2017 are estimated to be in the region of &euro;33 million, so there will be an additional &euro;18 million for 2017.  The package also provides for extended child care subvention programme places and a move towards consolidating all targeted child care supports.  A total of &euro;16 million has been provided for these additional child care subvention places in 2016.</p><p> Turning to other areas of the Vote, the 2016 allocation to Tusla will be increased by some &euro;38 million over last year's provision.  This will bring the agency's current funding to &euro;662.4 million and there will be a total capital provision of &euro;13.5 million, which is being supplemented by a further &euro;2.5 million carried forward from 2015.  The increased provision for Tusla in 2016 strengthens its overall base funding position.  That is why getting this extra money for 2016 is so strategic.  It ensures that the agency has the capacity to respond to both unmet need and anticipated demand during 2016.  An additional &euro;1.1 million in current funding and &euro;2.25 million in capital funding is provided for youth organisations.  Additional funding of &euro;1.6 million is also provided to the Irish Youth Justice Service in respect of the running costs for the new children's detention centre in Oberstown.</p><p> In conclusion, significant additional resources have been secured for 2016.  It will allow us to build on the very strong and good work by all involved in working with children, families and all the extraordinary people in our communities, centres and cr&egrave;ches to deliver on this Government's commitment to fundamentally reform and increase the scale of the delivery of the services.</p></speech>

The overall objective under this programme is to support and improve the existing service delivery arrangements to protect and support the welfare and well-being of children, young people and families, including oversight of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Two main components of this programme are Tusla and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The funding for subhead A3, Tusla in 2016 amounts to &euro;676.042 million, comprising &euro;662.482 million in current funding and &euro;13.560 million in capital funding.  This capital sum is, as I said earlier, being supplemented by a further &euro;2.5 million, which was made available from the carryover of unspent funds in 2015.</p> <p>  The committee might also note that the baseline allocation to the agency for 2016 includes an additional &euro;15 million that was acquired through the Supplementary Estimate in December 2015.  Current expenditure at the end of May 2016 - because looking at how we are doing is also part of our deliberations on this subhead - amounted to &euro;270.698 million against a profile or estimate of &euro;269.68 million.</p><p>That minor variation of 0.4% is attributable largely to timing issues and is expected to equalise over the remainder of the year with the subhead being on profile at the year end.  It is similarly expected that Tusla will fully utilise its capital funding allocation in 2016.  Monitoring and oversight are vital and my leadership is key in all of that.</p><p> In turning to subhead A4, youth justice - it is on page 5 of the briefing provided to members but it is not subhead A7, it should read A4 - the allocation for 2016 amounts to &euro;22.551 million.  That includes &euro;21.611 million in current and &euro;0.940 million in capital.  Additional funding of &euro;1.6 million is being provided in this subhead in 2016 to support the running costs of the new children&rsquo;s detention facility in Oberstown, which I was very pleased to visit last week, as well as a bail support scheme designed to provide therapy services in the community to assist children in adhering to bail conditions.  The overall objective of the bail support scheme is to reduce demand for detention school places where possible and minimise as far as possible the remand of children in custody so that they are being supported instead within the community.</p><p> It is anticipated that the current provision of &euro;21.611 million for this year will be sufficient to meet costs in 2017.  However, at present the picture in relation to the capital spend in youth justice, all of which is related to the construction project for the new children&rsquo;s detention facility in Oberstown, is less clear.  The project is nearing completion.  However, in 2016 it is expected that a deficit of approximately &euro;1.6 million will surface this year as a result of structural and other design issues.  Discussions are ongoing with the OPW to identify the definitive value of the cost overrun.  Notwithstanding these ongoing discussions, it is hoped that any funding shortfall in this instance can be accommodated within the resources allocated to the Vote in 2016.  I am very happy to take any questions from the committee on this programme.</p></speech>

We are all pleased to be on this committee and we look forward to working constructively together on it.  As agreed, we will concentrate on the first programme, programme A.</p> <p>  The first question relates to the additional resources in terms of child welfare and protection services.  There is a concern about unallocated cases in particular.  Could the Minister give some information on what progress has been made in that regard?  What is the situation with cases that might still not have been allocated the appropriate support?</p> <p>  Could I also ask about Oberstown?  In the output targets there is a reference to completing the transfer of responsibility to the Oberstown campus for the detention of male children who are serving a sentence of detention on foot of recruitment of new care staff.  Is that on target?  The Minister referred to the funding that was required for it.  In 2015, under the subheading, A7, youth justice, children detention schools - perhaps that is A4 although it is listed as A7 in the document I have.</p></speech>

There is some information but all of us would agree that young people transitioning from care are particularly vulnerable and need a variety of supports.  I am not sure whether they all get the support that is intended.  There is a reference to maintaining and improve the percentage of all children and young people in care, engaging with the education service and maintaining and improving the percentage of aftercare assessments offered to young people transitioning from care.  We would have assumed that all children should be offered an assessment when they are transitioning from care because they are vulnerable in so many ways.</p><p>We would have assumed that all children should be offered an assessment when they are transitioning from care because they are vulnerable in so many ways including to homelessness, not having the kind of support young people who grow up in a family will have when they are leaving home.  The Minister might give us information on progress in that area.  It is monitored but in that monitoring has the need to put more resources into that area been identified?</p></speech>

I will overlap slightly on what Deputy O'Sullivan already said.  First, with regard to Oberstown, what is the position on staff training?</p> <p>  Second, with regard to Tusla and social care workers, additional funding was allocated at the end of 2015-early 2016.  How many staff have been recruited into social care work positions and are we still recruiting?  What is the position?  Also, I tabled a parliamentary question last week to which I received a comprehensive answer but it seems a large number of children had unallocated social care workers.  One area comes to mind.  The figure for Waterford was 11%, while Dublin-Wicklow was hitting a rate of 18%.  Where are we going on that in terms of the last quarter of the year?</p> <p>  Third, on the legislation, in 2015 the output target was to enact the Child Care (Amendment) Bill.  Do we have an output target for 2016 in terms of legislation?</p></speech>

We will focus on the fiscal side and the resources today.</p></speech>

I also welcome her officials as this is the first time I have had engagement with many of them.</p> <p>  As a general observation, in terms of the way the figures are presented, until a few months ago all but one of the members would have been members of a local authority.  When local authorities are presented with figures on a regular basis on corporate policy groups and so on, there is a percentage for the level of spending at that point in the year to date.  As a general rule, that would be useful here.  The Minister touched on some of the percentages in her contribution but to be able to read and comprehend those in future presentations would be welcome.</p> <p>  I have some observations which will overlap with the contributions from Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy O'Sullivan.  A concern has been expressed in recent weeks about the number of unallocated cases.  I add my voice to that query raised but following on from the Child Care (Amendment) Bill at the end of 2015, there was a legal right to an aftercare plan.  A substantial number of children are not receiving aftercare plans.  Can that lack of resources be addressed by the end of the year?</p> <p>  I understand that the new Tusla IT system is to be implemented by the end of 2017, and it is Tusla's responsibility to develop that alongside external bodies.  I suppose that programme will not be delivered entirely by the end of this year but is that in line with the expectation in terms of spending and delivery?</p> <p>  On Oberstown, it was remarked that there may be a deficit in spending, and the Minister referenced design issues.  I found that interesting because queries were raised by the staff, and I am aware there are ongoing industrial relations issues in Oberstown, about the design and layout of the building.  Is it the case that some of those concerns were taken on board and the design is being revised on that basis or are there more mundane reasons for any of the design delays?</p> <p>  I have two more questions.  On the youth justice side, I may be mistaken about this but is there any responsibility under that programme for the Garda youth diversion project?</p><p>If so, what is the level of spending on that?  Will consideration be given to increasing it for next year given the spike in crime levels in a number of localities?</p><p> My last point on the school completion programme is one I raised recently during our questions.  Is that budget likely to be used in its totality or will there be a deficit?</p></speech>

If it appeared I was correcting her, I was not.  My remarks were primarily directed at the Minister in terms of her response.  I do not want us to get into too much detail on these subjects because I intend to go into them in detail in due course.  I was asking everyone to focus on the fiscal side.  I call the Minister to respond first to the three questions from Deputy O'Sullivan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016062900002#F00600"><p>Some of Deputy O'Sullivan's questions dovetailed with those from other Deputies, especially in terms of Tusla, child welfare and protection, the concern about unallocated social workers, and the recruitment of social workers to help meet that concern.  Additional funding of &euro;6.1 million has been provided in 2016 to deal with this issue.  Tusla's target is to reduce by 60% the number of cases awaiting allocation.  In terms of reducing the number of cases awaiting allocation, there is a direct link between that and the number of social workers it is recruiting to which I will return shortly.</p> <p>  The reduction of high priority cases to less than 5% of all unallocated cases is a target that is going down.  The target in regard to unallocated cases in general is not going down as quickly as we had hoped at this point but we anticipate that Tusla will continue to move towards that target, particularly in light of the recruitment of its social workers.  It has identified a target of whole-time equivalent social workers working within Tusla of 1,576 by the end of 2016.  That will represent, as many Deputies are aware, a net increase of 168 social workers.  However, Tusla needs to increase the number of its whole-time equivalent social workers by a further 64 by the end of the year to meet its targets.</p> <p>  Many of the Deputies are aware that there is a proactive campaign by Tusla to recruit social workers.  More than 300 applications were received, and those people will be interviewed in July and August.  It is important to say, however, that some of the moneys are focused on having a holistic response in terms of the protection and care of children.  It is not just about social workers; it is a multi-disciplinary approach.  Tusla is looking for clerical and administrative staff as well as social workers.  We are cautiously hopeful that it will make that target but clearly it is dependent on the numbers it recruits.</p> <p>  Deputies may be aware that Tusla has proactively engaged in an audit of retrospective cases.  That is a very good piece of work but it may take away some energy and resources, although we hope it will not impact on the target for reducing the number of unallocated cases.</p><p>I assure Deputies that I am aware of this problem.  I have already had three meetings, in my short term, with the chief executive and the chair.  I have had a meeting with the board of Tusla.  I have identified the area of the recruitment of social workers in terms of the unallocated cases, particularly as a key priority of mine. </p><p> Deputy Rabbitte was helpful in pointing out the spread of concern about where the lower number of the unallocated cases are.  Clearly, I am sure the matter will be taken into account in terms of planning by Tusla once it gets the new folks on board.</p><p> A couple of members mentioned aftercare services, including Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and &Oacute; Laoghaire.  Aftercare services are a particular concern of mine.  Between 450 and 500 18 year olds leave care every year and some of them are very vulnerable.  Some need support to go on to third level education and many of them continue living with their foster carers.  Tusla, since implementing its aftercare policy, there is an aftercare plan for each child or young person prior to leaving in the form of aftercare support, including financial support.  Around 45% of the young people who have left care are in ongoing education and training.</p><p> Concerns were expressed about the implementation and commencement of the aftercare plan.  We are aware of the need to prepare for the commencement of that piece of legislation.  We have indicated that this is a priority in terms of Tusla and hope it will be in a position in order to do this work, as soon as possible.  I ask members to please come back to me if I have not covered their question.</p><p> I was very pleased to visit the Oberstown campus last week.  I was very impressed with the leadership, both the current director and the senior management.  I was impressed by their awareness and willingness to drive change in a transition programme, in light of the huge efforts made over the past couple of years to amalgamate the place into a single campus with a single set of governance.  They have also brought into play a new way of understanding and being with young people in that context.  People are aware that it is a detention school and not a prison.  On my visit I spent a lot of time in the school.  As I said to the young residents, as I gave them their certificates, my wish for them is their freedom, that they were in a school and were in a learning setting within the context of the detention centre.</p><p> I shall now talk more specifically about the questions posed by members.  I feel that the moneys allocated to Oberstown have been used very wisely in terms of staffing, the design and construction of the build and then the governance.  Good progress has been made with staffing and it has been a key issue.  The centre continues to drive the venture by having increased recruitment of staff.  Obviously we are aware of the negotiations taking place at the Workplace Relations Commission.  I am glad that all parties are back at the negotiating table and other offers and suggestions have been made to the staff.</p><p> We plan to open one additional unit shortly and I hope that will happen at the beginning of the school calendar year.  It would mean we would have all 17 year olds in the one place.  The director of the campus told me that he anticipates and hopes the unit will be provided by 1 September, which would be extremely significant.  It would end forever the need to accommodate children in adult prisons, which is a very big deal.  I believe the project is on target.</p><p> Deputy Rabbitte asked about training.  An ongoing training programme is being provided by the staff at Oberstown.  Again, this is part of the industrial relations issues.  A progressive and empowering approach is being utilised and encouraged among staff.  Many of them have provided very committed service for many years.  There is now an emphasis on the de-escalating of difficult situations and on helping staff to deal with children without having to resort to strong physical intervention.</p><p> In terms of the building, one gets a good feeling when one enters the site.  Often I experience an emotional intelligence about an environment.  Once one moves through the building one notices the design, which reflects the extraordinary effort that was put into the consultation process that lasted a number of months.  We had hoped and envisaged that a top class design would result and that has now been implemented.  As people are aware, there are some design issues and I saw some of their impact when I visited the centre.  The design issues are being worked on and will be resolved as soon as possible.  There are some additional expenses.  Again, we are looking at providing money to support the work but it is important and has to be done.  The practical issues are being worked on and one example is the locks and doors.  </p><p> In terms of the Garda youth diversion projects, individuals benefit considerably from early intervention.  I would like to support the scheme further in 2017.  The spending on the projects was &euro;11.5 million in 2014 and we have spent &euro;6.3 million to date in 2016.  </p><p> In terms of transitioning from care, aftercare plans and my political priorities, the concern around children who are homeless is key, particularly the group who leave care and may be faced with difficulties in terms of homelessness.  We are trying to address some of those issues now in preparation for feeding into the plan proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  If more resources are required for this issue, I am willing to look for them.  </p><p> I take the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire about identifying the overall percentage increase in terms of spend midway or at whatever point we are at, and agree with him that it would be helpful.  A question was asked about a national child care information technology system.  That would be part of it where we will have an ICT system to support social work departments to record data utilised in respect of a child known to Tusla.  I think that it is also on target in terms of being rolled out.  The roll-out of the system nationally is scheduled to be completed by the end of quarter two of 2017.  </p><p> As Deputy Rabbitte is aware, the Adoption (Amendment) Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I am open to dealing with all of the other Stages as soon as possible whenever we can get D&aacute;il time.  The adoption (information and tracing) Bill was raised in relation to those questions.  To bring us back to discussing the Estimates, we have the money in 2016 and this is how it is being used.  We hope to publish the adoption (information and tracing) Bill in early autumn.  I would like to be able to take it through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in the autumn.  As I said to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and others, this is a major priority of mine and I accept that it is also a priority for members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.170" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>The budget for the school completion programme is &euro;24.8 million; will this be spent?  Tusla has protected the budget in 2015, given the importance of the programme.  It is particularly important to me personally as a Minister.  I am well aware of the work of the programme over the years and have worked with people to support the quality and scale of what we can do.  The budget should be spent in 2016.  The Deputies will be aware that the programme for Government contains a commitment to a new school completion strategy, as I mentioned yesterday evening, which I believe is critical to advance this extremely important service for children.  That strategy will take into account the extremely helpful review conducted by the ESRI on the level of funding, which Tusla paid for.  Clearly the report recommends that we cannot reduce the funding further.  It would be important to examine whether we can increase funding.  We need to look at how the funding is allocated and spread across the country, particularly which schools get it and how much is invested in light of the review of DEIS schools.  It will be terrific to have that information in moving towards the initiation of a school completion strategy in order to deal with some of those issues.</p></speech>

The programme comprises the ECCE preschool year scheme, the general child care programmes, the child care initiatives, the youth organisations and services, the area-based childhood programme, and intervention programmes for children and young people funded by the dormant accounts scheme.</p> <p>  The combined allocations for the child care programme under subheads B3, B4 and B5 in 2016 amount to &euro;344.122 million.  This includes the ECCE preschool year programme, the general child care programmes and the child care initiatives.  The committee might note that an additional &euro;85 million was provided in the budget in 2016 towards the cost of a suite of measures to support affordability, accessibility and quality in child care.  I acknowledge all the advocates, the political parties and my Department, whose support helped to get that funding.  It is critical to build a sustainable framework, and we are heading towards it but we are not there yet.</p> <p>  Under subhead B3, the current expenditure at the end of May 2016 on ECCE amounted to &euro;95.263 million against a profile of &euro;97.808 million.  The variation in this case is attributable to a number of factors.  These include a below-profile cost of administration, which amounts to &euro;1.38 million, and a lower-than-expected spend of &euro;4.746 million on the disability scheme, which is offset by a higher spend of &euro;3.639 million on ECCE capitation.  The variations are also largely due to timing considerations relating to fund draw downs and it is expected that the position will reverse over the course of the remainder of the year.  My Department has very strong oversight of this.</p> <p>  The current expenditure under subhead B4, relating to general child care programmes, amounted to &euro;33.5 million against a profile of &euro;34.977 million at the end of May 2016.  Similarly, the position on subhead B5, relating to the child care initiative, was marginally below profile, with expenditure of &euro;2.465 million against a profile of &euro;2.593 million.</p><p>The variation on both subheads is largely attributable to timing issues relating to fund drawdowns and the expectation that the resource allocations will be fully utilised.</p><p> Subhead B6, youth organisations and services, is showing an end of May spend of &euro;24.272 million as against a profile of &euro;30.377 million.  The variation of &euro;6.105 million arises because of lower than expected expenditure outlays under both the local youth club grant scheme and payments under the Youth Work Act 2001.  Expenditure will accelerate as the year progresses and, again, the resource allocation will be expended in full.</p><p> The remaining two subheads in programme B relate to the area-based childhood scheme, subhead B7, and the intervention programme for children funded by dormant accounts, subhead B8.  Both programmes are expected to come in on profile at the end of 2016.</p><p> I am happy to take questions in regard to the programmes.</p></speech>

The ABC programme runs from 2013 to 2016.  Is there a plan in place for the future of the programme?  I would really appreciate it if the Minister would expand on that?  I would also really appreciate it if she would comment on the position with regard to family resource centres.</p></speech>

In the context of the question that Deputy Rabbitte asked, will the Minister clarify whether children can start to attend at three different times of the year?  Is that the reason the length of time that children attend varies?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016062900002#K01100"><p>The provision of an additional &euro;85 million is extremely welcome.  I think the Minister will get the support of everybody on the committee to continue to look for more funding for early childhood care and education because it is an area in respect of which Ireland has under-invested historically.  I think the committee would be interested in doing work on how we might support the Minister in obtaining extra funding for this area.  I know we are dealing with the Revised Estimate for 2016 but I think we all have a view on the ECCE programme and are wondering what will happen after the second ECCE year.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the fact that children with disabilities are now included under the programme.  Will the Minister expand on how their involvement is supported?  Are there targets and performance measures or other methods to assess the way providers respond to children with disabilities?</p> <p>  On the ABC programme, the documentation we received states that one of the outputs is to ensure that the emerging learning from the ABC programme will be captured and that work towards mainstreaming it into established services will be engaged in.  I know there is a plan to mainstream it and that part of the reason for so doing relates to the way in which the programme is currently funded.  Will the Minister provide more information on how mainstreaming will work?</p><p>Will it involve one model?  Will it be in the same areas or is it likely to spread to other areas?  I am not sure whether the Minister has fully developed plans yet.  I would appreciate any information she could give us. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016062900002#L00200"><p>Following on from the Minister's comments, did I hear correctly that she believes there will be an underspend in the ECCE allocation for children with disabilities?  If I heard that correctly, I ask her to elaborate on why that may be the case.  I imagine the learner fund falls under one of the headings between B3 and B6, inclusive.  Is the allocation for 2016 likely to be spent by year-end?  The Minister may not have the relevant information, but is it possible to get an understanding of the breakdown between level 5 and level 6 qualifications in terms of the people who are applying and the spend on the scheme?</p> <p>  I support previous comments on ABCs.  I wish to offer a general comment, which does not involve fiscal matters.  I attended a very interesting seminar yesterday in Cork.  Along with tackling area-based poverty, we will have to examine the changing nature of disadvantage and poverty.  I put a lot of it down to a lack of local authority housing.  People with low incomes are increasingly living in rented and insecure accommodation.  There was some evidence given at the seminar that supports the view that in some areas disadvantage is becoming more dispersed.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to a matter I raised with the Minister previously for the benefit of the officials present.  The forthcoming regulations are very welcome and will come into effect at year-end or the start of next year.  They probably should have been considered in the context of last year's budget.  There should have been increased funding to ensure that facilities and community settings, in particular, would be able to meet the new regulations.  I understand a number of facilities are under pressure. </p> <p>  The Minister informed me that 91% of facilities are likely to meet the regulations, but 9% will not.  A number of facilities are now having to make a decision about whether they take on additional staff or cut back on places.  A reduction in places is not something any of us would support.  This issue should have been dealt with last year.  If applications for additional funding are coming in to the Department, I ask the Minister to ensure that services can meet the regulations.  They should be looked upon favourably.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016062900002#L00300"><p>I thank Deputies for their questions, which dovetail quite a bit.</p> <p>  Deputies Rabbitte and O'Sullivan referred to the expansion of the ECCE scheme.  Children will have different start and end dates.  The bottom line is that every child from the age of three years should have a place until he or she starts school should he or she wish to avail of it.  It is anticipated that every child will get a minimum of 51 weeks and some will get as much as 88 weeks.  On average, each child will get 61 weeks in total, depending on his or her date of birth and age at which he or she starts school.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, children will enter in September, January or April when they are three years of age.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to regulations.  In 2016, we will focus our efforts on supporting monetarily almost 5,000 service providers and work towards the sustainability of early years education in general.  We are restoring the capitation rate for the ECCE scheme to the pre-2012 levels of &euro;64.50 and &euro;75 from September this year.  We have lifted the cap on the number of community child care subvention places to allow community services to take as many CCS children for which they have capacity.</p><p>If they are able to take some children, that helps them in their efforts with their cost base and sustainability.</p><p> We have changed the rule on higher capitation in the ECCE scheme to allow services to claim per room.  This was sought by the sector for some time.  Child care committees Ireland is a structural support service we are enabling and supporting to examine services nationally that might be impacted by the new regulations and determine what can be done to support and prepare them for that.  The 30 city and county child care committees will also work closely with services that are experiencing difficulties and help them back onto a substantial footing.  </p><p> What the Department and I want most is that services are able to stay in business.  They may need to make some changes in order to do that.  We have implemented some changes in terms of increasing investment, capitation and regulation, such as staff ratios in rooms and capitation.  At same time, we still need to be vigilant in order to ensure that we can maintain as many services as possible and enable new services to come on board.</p><p> On sustainability, the programme for Government is committed to an independent review of the cost of providing child care.  I am sure Deputies are aware of that, and Deputy O'Sullivan said she wanted to work with me in that regard.  We may be able to work together in the context of that review.  We hope to be in a position to get that moving early in the new academic year.  The review will greatly inform future policy developments.  I am of course aware of the fact that advocates in national organisations are conducting reviews - I understand Early Years Ireland is one such body.</p><p> The learner fund is an issue close to my heart.  In 2015, the focus was on level 5 to enable services to meet the regulatory requirements while 2016 funding focuses on level 6, something to which Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred.  We expect that all of the funding will be utilised.  I will campaign to make sure that it is taken up and available.  If funding remains, we may allow it to be assigned to level 7 and level 8 to enable more services to avail of the higher capitation rate.</p><p> As we continue our exchanges in the committee, if members have suggestions, recommendations or want to table parliamentary questions on how we can fund this area I would welcome them.  It is not just about investing money, although I would love to get more money for the learner fund.  It is also about the accessibility of the learning, training, motivation, encouragement and support for people in the services.</p><p> AIM, the disability model, is a legacy for which I acknowledge Senator James Reilly and the ongoing hard work of the Department.  On whether there will be indicators to determine if the scheme is working, as members probably know, the scheme was launched and is ready to go.  We are looking for enrolment in September.  The model has been greatly welcomed.  We have a strong team in place in the Department, assisted by Pobal, the HSE and county and city child care committees.  The implementation team and steering group will monitor it.</p><p> A member asked about targets.  They will be monitored.  It is expected that it will take probably take two to three years to fully implement them.  One target involves higher education grants for the provision of 900 inclusion co-ordinators throughout different services.</p><p>The funding is expected to be fully spent and, again, because of the previous Government commitment, we must get a significant extra sum of &euro;18 million for 2017 in order to continue the work that has begun.</p><p> I am a strong believer in the approach of the area-based childhood, ABC, programme.  I am also aware that perhaps there are ways in which we can be more effective in an area-based approach.  At the same time, we must examine the process and, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said, perhaps we have not found the best ways to effectively target every young person or child who is disadvantaged.  That is absolutely a concern for me.  As people know, the programme has been very positive for local communities, including Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale, where the movement towards an area-based approach started.  There were 13 sites in the past couple of years.  As Deputies know, this is testing innovative and new approaches in disadvantaged areas to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty.  The results are being evaluated but they are coming on stream.  We need to attend to the results.  We have spent much money on the research and evaluation.  We have some of the best researchers in the area in this country, but they were learning the best ways to evaluate this new testing and innovation.  It will be a challenge for us as we move forward to see how, more specifically, we can place the investment in an area-based approach or a better targeting of children experiencing poverty.  How can we better define the ways in which this will mitigate the impact on children living in poverty with this investment from the Department, while at the same time there are efforts from other Departments to increase the income of low-income or jobless households?</p><p> I am committed to ensuring the three original sites can continue their work up to July 2017, and I am working with the sites accordingly.  For example, I am meeting elected representatives of Young Ballymun today and I am also examining where we will go with ABC after July 2017, as some Deputies have asked.  It is important that we retain what we learned from the 13 sites and mainstream the most effective programmes.  We are developing an approach but it has not yet been completed.  It is very challenging, and one aspect will be that if we have been testing innovative methods in all the sites, how we can encourage the mainstreaming of those approaches?  What does mainstreaming mean?  We will continue to support it and perhaps the Departments dealing with education or health will take up some of the programmes in order to provide support in the different settings.  It is one of the big challenges for us in terms of investment.  I am an advocate for investing in programmes that work but may come from other budgets.  The testing and innovation came from our budget.</p><p> The Department is also preparing proposals for a quality capacity-building initiative, which would help move us from site-specific initiatives to mainstreaming.  As part of that, we will examine the 13 sites, and we are aware of concerns about developing area-based approaches in other settings.  I visited one in County Kildare recently.  I am sure there are other suitable places throughout the country.  The question is how we can continue the area-based approach.  We certainly need to ensure that the lessons we learn are mainstreamed.  I have no doubt my Department will seek investment to do that and other Departments will also be involved.  There is no question of simply stopping the ABC-related work.  Perhaps it will be the biggest challenge for all of us to figure out how to best utilise the lessons we have learned and see what is the most effective investment for next year and subsequent years.  I assure Deputies I am really aware of the challenge.</p></speech>

I have admired the ABC programmes because we do not have them in Galway.  I visited Preparing for Life, which is in Darndale, the other day.  The Minister is dead right in her comments as we must look at other initiatives to bring this to the rest of the country.  What is good about the process is very good and we would love to embrace some of that on the other side of the Shannon.  Currently, the family resource centres do so much for us in the west.</p></speech>

There are two centres in County Kildare.  I was told there are 18 in Kerry.  The Deputy raised the issue and we must consider it.  This is critical in the work of Tusla, which is supporting 109 communities in this regard with the family resource centre programme.  It provides core funding to the established programme, which it has managed since 2014.  This is the largest family support programme, delivering universal services to families in disadvantaged areas across the country.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we have enough of these and that is a another issue.  I accept we must look at that and certainly feed the information back.  There is a significant spend already relating to family resource centres.  At the same time, I know we are developing processes relating to the family, parenting and prevention, particularly with the support of Atlantic Philanthropies.  I am considering if there is a way to engage family resource centres in a more proactive way for children who are homeless or in emergency accommodation.  I accept the Deputy's questions and concerns.  I have explained what we are doing but there is additional scope for the future.</p></speech>

The committee might note that this is a wide-ranging programme which aims to oversee key areas of policy, legislation and inter-sectoral collaboration to improve the lives and well-being of children and young people.  Subhead C3, relating to legal fees and settlements, has incurred no expenditure to date this year.  As legal costs are difficult to estimate it is not possible at this time to forecast what the end-year position will be.  However, the matter will be kept under ongoing review.</p> <p>  Research subhead C4 shows expenditure at the end of May 2016 of &euro;33,000 against a profile of &euro;76,000.  The marginal variation is largely attributable to timing issues on Growing Up in Ireland, the national longitudinal study, and on other research projects that will largely normalise over the remainder of the year.  It is possible an underspend of &euro;485,000 will arise at the end of the year due to delays in start-up on the Growing Up in Ireland survey.  Should this happen, it will necessitate additional funds in 2017.</p> <p>  Subhead C5 contains resource provisions for a wide range of projects and services.  Overall, the spending on this subhead at the end of May amounted to &euro;711,000 against a profile of &euro;2.848 million.</p><p>The variation is largely attributable to timing issues with fund drawdown for a number of the programmes supported under the subhead, which will regularise by the year end.</p><p> Subheads C6 and C7, relating to the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, both show underspends in the region of 30% at the end of May.  Both underspends can be attributed to the timing of costs incurred and both are expected to be fully utilised at the end of the year.</p><p> The position for subhead C8 at the end of May, relating to the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, amounted to &euro;0.776 million against a profile of &euro;0.994 million.  The variation is attributable largely to timing differences, which are expected to reverse somewhat over the coming months as a number of projects commence.  However, it is noted that the work of the commission will be the ultimate determinant of the full-year outturn.  To this extent, the most significant share of the allocation is profiled in the latter part of the year and the true position will become evident only as the year progresses and the work of the commission advances.  I was happy to have the opportunity to meet a couple of members of the commission recently in my offices to look at how things are going there.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions on the programme.</p></speech>

There has been much media commentary on one of the areas, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, in recent weeks, as its remit does not incorporate all of the mother and baby homes.  The Minister might care to comment on that.  Seeing as the Minister met members of the commission fairly recently, her comments would be welcome.  Second, are we on target with the delivery of phase two of the Growing Up in Ireland study?</p></speech>

Can the Minister give us an undertaking that she will keep the committee informed?  We have a duty in that regard.</p> <p>  I am interested in subhead C5.  There are not many other financial questions that we can ask under this subhead.  The Minister has a particular interest in the voice of the child and in children's participation, which are mentioned in the briefing document.  I ask her to elaborate on how that might be improved on.  The Minister mentioned how, for example, in homelessness, the voices of children can be heard and children supported in terms of the services that are provided for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016062900002#P00400"><p>I re-emphasise and support the point made by Deputy Rabbitte.  I would share the view that probably not enough institutions come under the remit of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and, that being the case, the budget would probably need to be bigger if additional institutions were included.</p> <p>  I will pick up on the point of the possibility of an underspend on Growing Up in Ireland.  If there is likely to be an underspend, is it anticipated that the funding would remain for similar research projects, and where might these be?</p> <p>  I presume it is somewhere under this programme as well that the Department's obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003 fall.  I am not sure whether the Department has an extant language plan.  If it does, what is likely to be the spend on that?  Basically, my question is whether the Department is in compliance with the Act.</p> <p>  My final question is geared more towards next year than anything else.  In subhead C5, I note that there was an increase in funding for the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  During the course of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016, I commented that when the Bill was passed - as I anticipate it will be - there would likely be a spike in the number of people looking to regularise their situation and formally adopt.  Surely this will require an increased allocation in 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2016062900002#P00500"><p>On Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, Deputy Rabbitte's primary question has to do with the number and scope of institutions being investigated and whether that is sufficient.</p><p>Obviously, the number was determined by the terms of reference.  This is what the commission is engaged in, that is, reviewing the work to date and discussing some of these issues with us.  What is most important about the work of the commission, at least from my perspective, has to do with the results of what it is currently undertaking, particularly in terms of the confidential committee that was established as well as the development of a social history for the period of 1922 to 1998.  There is much more work going on there than was originally anticipated in both of those contexts because more individuals have come forward.  There has been an active campaign to invite persons, whether adults who were babies in these institutions or staff who worked there, to come forward to give their confidential evidence to the committee and for it to understand and interpret what was going on.</p><p> In terms of the social history module, what was found was that the social history of that time was not comprehensive and there were many inaccuracies.  Therefore, more unanticipated archival work is being done in order to bring together what will, hopefully, be an extremely significant contribution to our understanding of what happened and why.  That work will, therefore, presented to us, the Government and the State, to determine the most appropriate response.  Prior to making a decision about whether there would be a need for the commission do additional work, in terms of extending its scope or scale, it is rational and appropriate to first hear from and see what the commission uncovers, particularly in regard to those two key aspects of its work.  I can also assure members, in terms of my own personal commitment to women in the past and the children of these women, that given the extreme and terrible difficulties and challenges and wrong that they no doubt faced, it is another top priority of mine to examine what comes out of the commission and whether or not it is important to extend it.</p><p> The Growing Up in Ireland survey is mostly on target and the cross-departmental group that overseas it with my Department is satisfied with the progress.  Phase one was completed and phase two has commenced.  The field work was slightly delayed but we will get back on track.</p><p> It is good that Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about the voice of the child and young person.  Obviously, it is central to the role of my Department to ensure that the voice is heard and, more importantly, influences the policy.  A number of works and products that came out of that part of the work of the Department and the voices of children coming forward finished in 2015.  These are on my desk and I am trying to go through them to ensure that they influence policy and that it is not merely a report on a shelf.</p><p> We lead in many consultations in our own policy areas but we also support the consultations with respect to other Departments.  There are a few pieces of work, which await completion and which we want to publish as soon as possible.</p><p>We will be building on this further by establishing a participation hub which will be a central, accessible resource to Government Departments, State agencies and  NGOs where it can be administered and receive indications of interest on what needs to be done as well as moving that forward.  I am delighted that Ireland was the first country in Europe to publish a participative strategy across Government.</p><p> I will now turn to the Official Languages Act.  The Department is compliant, the scheme is in place in it and we are conscious of the needs regarding the child care resources.  There is no specific requirement for an Irish language qualified person on the staff of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but staff are supported to develop Irish language skills through training.  The Department is recruiting one staff member from the Irish qualified panel to assist us with the work of the child care elements.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and her officials for their attendance and for dealing so comprehensively with members' questions and observations.  The committee has agreed to invite the Minister to attend the Joint Committee for Children and Youth Affairs in the autumn to examine the proposed allocations to her Department for 2017.  It is hoped that this meeting will be scheduled in advance of the 2017 budget allocations.  The committee secretariat will correspond with the Department with a view to having documentation submitted to the joint committee before the end of July 2016.</p></speech>

As the Chairman proposed, I will make some opening remarks to introduce each of the five programmes in the Department's Vote.  I will also take the opportunity to make some general remarks which are relevant to all the programmes to avoid having to repeat myself throughout the presentation.</p> <p>  As we know, the budget allocation was agreed and published by the previous Administration as part of the budget last year.  The Revised Estimate for all Departments was published after the Government agreed it in December.</p><p>As the general election was called, we are only now in a position to take the next step of seeking D&aacute;il approval.</p><p> We are now six months into 2016 and, therefore, a significant portion of the Department's budget is already spent - I believe it is just over half.  I have not yet effected any changes to this year's budget to take account of new commitments made in the programme for Government.  At this point, I am not proposing to make any changes to the Revised Estimate as published for 2016.</p><p> Many of the commitments contained in the programme for Government for transport, tourism and sport are medium to long term.  I will, therefore, come back to the committee later in the year to discuss how those can be addressed in the context of the 2017 Estimate and beyond.</p><p> As members will be well aware, the tourism and transport sectors have proven track records in creating employment and driving growth in the economy.  Sport also has a vital economic role to play but its societal and health benefits are key.  The 2016 budget allocation has been developed to support and underpin policies designed to maximise the economic, employment and societal benefits of these diverse sectors.</p><p> As regards the implications of last week's Brexit vote in the UK on the 2016 funding allocation, I do not foresee any immediate issues arising.  However, there are clearly impacts further down the road which we will have to take into account, particularly with regard to the tourism sector where Britain remains our single most important market in terms of overseas visitor numbers to Ireland.  My Department has been participating in the contingency planning led by the Taoiseach's Department and I am happy that we are in the good position to address the key challenges this decision presents to sectors under my remit.</p><p> With an overall budget allocation of &euro;1.74 billion this year and a multi-annual capital commitment of &euro;10 billion over seven years in the context of the capital plan, resources are being allocated to target investment in our transport network, support our tourism sector and promote sport to drive our country forward.</p><p> The 2016 allocation provides for an additional &euro;125 million on last year, representing an 8% increase on the &euro;1.6 billion available last year.  This is the first year since 2011 that this Department's initial Estimate allocation for capital investment has exceeded the &euro;1 billion mark.  The Vote comprises five spending programmes - aviation, land transport, maritime, sport and tourism.  The Department's administrative programme, its pay and operating costs, represents less than 2% of the overall Vote and these costs are distributed proportionally across all the programmes as members see them in the Revised Estimate.</p></speech>

The largest element of the programme is the regional airports programme at &euro;12.6 million.  Funding is also earmarked to cover costs associated with our membership of Eurocontrol, costs incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority for exempt services and subscriptions to international organisations.</p> <p>  The key priority for investment in the aviation programme over the short to medium term is to support the four regional airports - Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford - for safety and security related projects and activities under the Regional Airports Programme 2015-2019.  This is also a key priority in the programme for Government.  This year's allocation for the regional airports programme represents an increase of 5% or &euro;600,000 on last year.</p><p>At this point of the year we would expect to see this allocation fully spent, given the level of demands on the programme.</p></speech>

Will the Minister comment on reports that &euro;25 million is to be invested in Waterford Airport, the basis on which that figure was arrived at, the timeframe of this investment and whether an analysis of the value for money of the investment was conducted.  I would imagine that investment in regional airports would be subject to compliance with the EU guidelines on State aids to airports.  In the context of my comments on Waterford Airport, what effect will this have on the level of investment envisaged in the three other regional airports?</p></speech>

The &euro;10 million which he refers to the in programme for Government has not been allocated at this stage.  That is misleading.  Let me read out something that will make clear the situation about Waterford Airport.  Waterford Airport receives substantial Exchequer support under the regional airports programme that is administered by my Department.  This programme supports necessary safety and security related projects and activities at the four regional airports.  During the past five years, Waterford Airport has received &euro;9.6 million in operational investment support from my Department.  In April this year, a further &euro;157,500 in grant aid was approved for a number of security related projects, including new X-ray equipment at the airport.  The &euro;10 million has not been allocated to Waterford Airport and the total capital allocation for regional airports was &euro;28 million.</p></speech>

I spoke to the European Commissioner when I was in Luxemburg recently.  She was not happy either with the progress being made and the fact that this is being obstructed by various parties in the United States.  As the Deputy knows, it is causing a great deal of difficulties in Cork.  Such a service could give a high level of employment.  There is a blockage in the United States which we are hoping to get lifted.  I know the Taoiseach mentioned the matter to President Obama.  I do not know whether he mentioned it Vice President Biden during his visit last week.  As far as I am concerned, it is not acceptable that this is being obstructed by parties in the United States.  We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that access is given as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I will be meeting representatives from the Dublin Airport Authority to discuss this issue next week.  One of my concerns is that the original cost has risen from &euro;250 million to &euro;320 million.  There are obvious concerns about noise, which is an issue for residents in the area.  The Dublin Airport Authority is in discussions with a large number of residents and is meeting them at regular intervals.</p></speech>

As somebody who lives close to Weston Airport, a small facility with a high level of traffic, I have an appreciation of the level of disruption that a large airport would place on people's quality of life.  Obviously, the location of the approach and take-off area of the runway matters.  Weather also plays a part in that.  Is the Minister in a position to outline the level and extent of engagement of the DAA with residents?  Consultation can be a one-way or a two-way street.  To what extent are the views of residents being taken on board?  Dublin Airport is an extremely important element of infrastructure from the point of view of trading and in the context of its location in the capital.</p><p>Finding a balance between both of those will be extremely difficult.  Obviously, the Minister has to do that in the context of trying to minimise as much as possible the kind of impact it would have.</p></speech>

I cannot answer the Deputy's question on how genuine it is.  I have asked it to meet the residents on a regular basis, which it agreed to do, and they have had meetings.  I will try to ensure that a State monopoly of this sort does not abuse its position.  I take the matter quite seriously.  Although the runway cannot, and should not, be stopped and stalling the project cannot for one moment be considered, it is very unfair that people should be victimised in their homes by this sort of development without being considered in a very meaningful way.  By that, I mean that measures will be taken to contain the noise, improve the environment and rehouse people.  I understand all of that will be on the cards.</p> <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will be keeping a very close eye on the project.  I and my colleagues feel very strongly that local communities should not have their wishes, sensitivities and houses overridden in an inhumane way when this sort of activity has to happen.  The second runway is essential for the progress of tourism and transport in this country.  Local communities also have to be considered, which involves rehousing, insulation and other measures of that sort.</p> <p>  I do not know the answer to the Deputy's question, namely, how genuine the daa is in its consideration of the issue or whether it is going through the motions but I hope to ensure that it is genuine.</p></speech>

This is an issue on which we can have a more in-depth discussion via the work programme.  We will move on to the second item, land transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016062900002#G00400"><p>Programme B, land transport, is the largest programme by far in the Department's Vote, representing 80% of my overall budget.  A large portion of this is capital investment.  The main components of the programme are roads improvement and maintenance funding with an overall budget of &euro;720 million, the public transport investment programme at &euro;347 million and public service provision payments at &euro;250 million.  The programme also includes provision of &euro;40 million towards the smarter travel carbon reduction programme and &euro;50 million for the operating costs of the National Driver Licence Service.</p> <p>  As the economy recovers, the demand and associated costs for increased service levels and quality grows.  Fiscal constraints over the past number of years have meant that the funding available for the land transport programme has fallen short of where it needs to be.  Addressing the projected growth in transport demand needs careful planning, analysis and investment.  While transport policy may be shifting towards dealing with growth rather than decline, the prudent fiscal regime in which we must operate dictates that funding for transport, like other capital hungry sectors, is likely to be more constrained than we would wish for the years to come. </p> <p>  The existing capital plan provides for a substantial increase in land transport over the six years of the plan, increasing from &euro;1 billion this year to almost &euro;2 billion in 2021.  The plan provides for additional funding for roads, rail infrastructure and public transport investment, ensuring that we increase State levels to maintain existing infrastructure and rolling stock and begin delivering what are modest, but important, improvements to passenger transport users, the freight sector and private car users.</p> <p>  Funds are being allocated in 2016 to facilitate the ongoing construction of the new Luas cross city line.  This major public transport project has been delivered within budget and is on schedule for completion in 2017.</p> <p>  Given competing demands across the system and the continuing need for restraint, the challenge is to maintain the existing levels of funding for key programmes and seek modest increases where they are justified and represent value for money.  A key priority will be to ensure funding for public service obligations, including the rural transport programme, is at a level that ensures the increased level of demand being placed on public transport system can be met.</p><p> I am happy that this year's Estimate provides a 14%, or &euro;28 million, increase in support to public transport services.  The priorities for this funding are to respond to passenger demand by intensifying key routes on Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann services, the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel for commuter services and DART service improvements.  I expect all of this funding to be fully spent by the end of the year.</p><p> In addition, the previous Government decided in January, after the Revised Estimates were published, to allocate &euro;106 million to assist in the repair of storm and flood damage to transport infrastructure.  This represents an additional &euro;96 million over and above the provision included in the Revised Estimate for land transport.  Following this decision, funding for the repair of regional and local roads has been allocated to local authorities in two tranches.  The first tranche of &euro;85 million was allocated in February to help local authorities start repairs as quickly as possible and the balance was held back and allocated in May to allow more time for further investigation and evaluation of certain proposed works, including that relating to bridges.  To date, &euro;15.7 million has been drawn down in respect of repair works on regional and local roads.  Separately, &euro;8 million has been allocated to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for repair works to national roads and a further &euro;8 million to Irish Rail for repairs to the rail network.  The formal allocation of this funding to the Vote will be done by way of a Supplementary Estimate later this year.</p></speech>

I wish to express my disappointment about the &euro;29 million reduction in the overall budget and the &euro;43 million reduction in the road improvement budget.  It is very important that road improvement and maintenance continues, even in difficult times when our public finances are under severe pressure.  I appeal to the Minister to carefully monitor expenditure and ensure any savings made are transferred to road improvement and maintenance.  I do not want to concentrate on local areas, but I refer to the N52 bypass.  Could the Minister examine the position regarding that project?</p> <p>  I urge the Minister to direct that local authorities fully utilise local and community investment schemes.  I have received many complaints from constituents and groups which were willing to contribute to the schemes, but find that local authorities are not working with them.  This is an urgent matter and I ask the Minister to outline the powers we have to direct local authorities to fully utilise these schemes.  There are many 80-20 schemes, and for the past number of years they have been totally neglected.  Local authorities are not working closely with group schemes.</p> <p>  I refer to cycle greenways, which are the way forward.  It is very important that we try to give everybody something.  Those of us in Louth have pushed very hard for a Dundalk-Blackrock-Carlingford cycle route.  I would appreciate if the Minister could examine that.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister for clarity on all road projects funded on a joint North-South basis in light of the UK leaving the EU.  I refer, in particular, to the A5 in this regard.  The Government has committed &euro;75 million towards funding the latter.  In light of the UK decision to leave the EU, can the Minister re-evaluate all such projects?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016062900002#H00400"><p>I understand 22% of the overall budget is derived from motor tax receipts.  The Minister may not be able to do so today, but I ask him to indicate the total amount generated in motor tax receipts on an annual basis.  If only 22% is spent on the overall transport budget, 78% is diverted elsewhere, be it to Irish Water, health or education.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify the situation.</p><p>Of the capital funding for this area for 2015, some &euro;16 million was carried forward to 2016.  Why was that at a time when there was a significant underinvestment in capital projects over the length and breadth of the country?  The road maintenance figures show a decrease in the money allocated.  When the Minister took office, it was widely reported in the national media that we needed some &euro;500 million per annum just to maintain our road infrastructure, but the Department is allocating only 50% of what is needed.  I am not talking about improving or enhancing the road infrastructure but maintaining it.  Why are we reducing the money being invested in our roads, given these warnings?  It is prudent to invest and not to let our roads deteriorate into such a condition that, in the long run, it will cost more money to bring them up to a safe and appropriate standard.  I met a delegation of councillors from Monaghan recently.  The road infrastructure is disintegrating, particularly our regional and local roads, and local authorities do not have the money even to repair potholes.  It is quite worrying that we are reducing the amount of money we are allocating under this heading.</p><p> On public transport, we are all aware that there were Luas strikes recently.  The Luas is operated by Transdev, a private operator, and the Department has no role in it, but in light of the fact that agreement has been reached for an incremental increase over coming years, is the Minister concerned that other unions in companies under the control of the Department, such as CIE, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, will submit requests for similar wage increases?  Is the Minister confident that we have the capacity to deal with such an issue?  If we do not have that capacity, we could be facing strikes in Dublin Bus and CIE in the autumn and winter.  That would lead to significant inconveniencing of commuters who rely on those services on a daily basis.</p><p> Regarding road safety, we can see that the number of road deaths are on an upward trajectory.  This is worrying and it is part of the Department's responsibility to ensure that the necessary legislation is put in place to enhance and improve road safety.  One such piece of legislation is the Road Traffic Bill which would give garda&iacute;, if we had enough of them in the traffic corps, the power to carry out random drug testing on the roadside.  We had that on the Order Paper approximately three weeks ago and my understanding was that this necessary legislation would come before the D&aacute;il before the summer recess.  Is that still the case?  If not, why not?  </p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister could deal with those first and then we will go to Deputies Imelda Munster, Catherine Murphy and Kevin O'Keeffe.</p></speech>

The figure for motor tax receipts is &euro;1.1 billion.</p><p>The &euro;16 million capital was carried forward because certain projects have been delayed a bit.  The money is not lost and will be spent.  I take the Deputy's point about the &euro;500 million for the maintenance of roads and a very large amount of the capital budget goes towards the steady state, whereby we simply keep the roads and railways up to par.  It is disappointing that such a large proportion goes towards this but it has to be the case.  We should look for more money and it should not be reduced.  There was a Supplementary Estimate last year which added to the amount quoted by the Deputy for regional and local road grants.  We expect another Supplementary Estimate this year to add to the figure again.</p><p> I did not get involved in the Luas dispute as a Minister as I thought it would not have been wise and would have been unhelpful.  Another reason was that it was in a private company and it would not have been appropriate.  Many people would have expected a Minister to intervene but there is no State funding involved in the settlement.  I am watching what is happening with the transport unions very carefully and trying to see if there might be any knock-on effects from that dispute.  Various negotiations are taking place, which are at different stages, and the unions are obviously looking at that settlement with an eye to gains themselves.  We will monitor the position very closely and it would be unfortunate if the precarious state of the bodies involved was in any way disturbed or agitated even further by massive items of expenditure.  Fragile companies of that sort are not under siege but there are difficult industrial relations problems to be resolved over the next few weeks and months.  It is of concern to me but there is no immediate crisis in that area.</p></speech>

It is quite worrying when the Minister describes some of our State companies as being fragile and in a precarious state.  Given that wage increase requests have been submitted, how will the Department deal with it if the companies in question are not in a position to meet those claims?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016062900002#K00300"><p>In the first place, we will have to see how they deal with it because they are negotiating and we are hands off at the moment.  I do not, however, want to see industrial relations problems in semi-State companies.  Nor do I want to see something similar breaking out to what happened with Luas.  I acknowledge the fact that the unions will be eyeing the settlements made in the Luas case.  It may well be that the companies, in their fragile state, will find it difficult to meet those demands.  The Department will talk to the NTA and CIE about these issues but not in a hands-on way.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the Road Traffic Bill.</p><p>We are still hoping to get it to at least Second Stage in the D&aacute;il before the summer recess.  An amendment has been sent to the Attorney General on the issue of written-off cars.  This goes back to the "Prime Time" programme and so on.  It is hoped the amendment will be cleared in the next week or two and then we can put it to Committee Stage as well.</p><p> I am concerned about the number of road deaths.  For many years the number of road deaths was reducing.  The number is up by about 20% year-on-year this year.  This is a matter of considerable concern and it may be that the trend has turned the other way.  I launched a report and an RSA awareness campaign on the June bank holiday weekend to try to make people more careful.  A notable aspect is that young people are beginning to drink and drive again, which is a serious development and one which people were not aware of.  On top of that, the number of fatal accidents in which alcohol is an ingredient or a factor is beginning to rise to a high level again.  There is a detection rate of alcohol in approximately 38% of fatal accident cases, which is high, and this is worrying.</p><p> We do not have comparative European figures.  Neither do we have up-to-date figures.  The report commissioned by the RSA covers up to the end of 2012.  Anecdotal evidence is that the incidence of drink in fatal accidents is increasing.  We have a problem on our hands which we must acknowledge.  I had a meeting with representatives of the RSA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others on Monday.  They will have to act on this issue because it may be, as the Deputy stated, a result of fewer Garda resources and checkpoints.  The Garda is getting together with the RSA to try to resolve the problem.  I am not happy with the situation, we should be worried about it and we should take action as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Local roads have gone into disrepair and there has been a lack of funding for the repairs.  This is a matter of great disappointment to many Deputies.  As the committee is probably aware, it is now being given support in the programme for Government.  While allocations may not and will not be ring-fenced, as they used to be, the local authorities can give local improvement scheme grants if they wish.  Applications can be made and are being considered.  The scheme is back.</p> <p>  I will leave the detail on the North-South road projects to my colleague, but the Narrow Water Bridge, which is an important project for Deputy Fitzpatrick and his constituency, is a matter of some disappointment as well.</p><p>It was meant to be launched in 2003.  The Deputy may be familiar with the situation but when the the invitation for tenders was issued the amount of allocated funding was approximately &euro;15 million but the tenders came in at approximately &euro;40 million, so there was a huge funding gap that has never been met.  As a result, the project has been in abeyance.  There will be a North-South Ministerial Council meeting in Dublin Castle on Monday at which I will raise the issue.  It is an important issue, particularly in light of Brexit.  We cannot allow these projects to fall to one side, but this will be complicated by the possibility of some sort of Border controls.  This particular project is important to the people of Louth and those across the Border and we will push for it to go ahead.  There is a funding problem, but that does not mean we will not pursue it. </p><p> Deputy Fitzpatrick also asked about the greenways and mentioned Blackrock and Carlingford specifically.

There is additional funding promised in the programme for Government for green ways.  This is a project and a concept that is reasonably new to me but I find it extremely attractive.  They are not just environmentally attractive.  They can also bring in tourists as well as be attractive from a sport and clean living perspective.  We should embrace and encourage them and it is my intention to increase their funding during my tenure, however long that may be.  They provide value for money and give a great deal of enjoyment.  They take people off the roads, improve tourism and their use is a healthy occupation.  I will visit the one in Deputy Fitzpatrick's constituency.   I will look at green ways projects seriously because funding will be available in the programme for Government.  There should be a nationwide network of green ways.  The number of them should certainly be increased.</p> <p>  I will leave the specifics on the roads to my colleague as I am not familiar with them.</p></speech>

There has been no change in that regard.  On the figures for regional and local roads, as the Minister stated, the initial figure for 2016 is identical to the initial figure for 2015.  In 2015 there was a supplementary amount of approximately &euro;25 million during the year.  As a result of the severe weather, this year's figure has since been supplemented by &euro;80 million.  The outturn figures will therefore be higher for 2016.  It is correct to say that overall the full amounts needed are not going in.  Approximately &euro;100 million comes from the local authority sector itself.  When it comes to regional and local roads, our funding is supplementary.</p> <p>  As a final point, under the capital plan the amounts for what is called steady state do increase.  They stay flat for the first two years, namely, 2016 and 2017, but they do increase thereafter.  In 2020 they will have reached a much higher level.</p></speech>

In this day and age, it is fantastic to see constituents and groups willing to put their hands in their own pockets to help improve the road facilities.</p><p>There has been a failure on the part of local authorities to help out and these roads have been neglected for the past number of years due to the state of the economy.  It would be a great scheme to get back up and running.  Money has been given to local authorities in recent years and it has been spent in other areas but the neglect of the roads and the potholes are such that when citizens and group schemes are willing to put their hands in their pockets to contribute, we should look into it.</p><p> I mentioned the Ardee N52 bypass and I think bypasses will be very important going forward as they could help develop town centres.  We should contribute towards the A5 but with the UK leaving the EU, we should look into other joint ventures we have with the North.  Some &euro;75 million is an awful lot to contribute to roads when we do not know what is going to happen in the future.  It is important that we re-evaluate the money we propose to invest, North and South.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016062900002#N00200"><p>The Minister has answered some of my questions in part.  The Minister spoke about road improvements and maintenance and mentioned the difference of &euro;43 million.  The gentleman beside him said the spend for 2015 may be matched for this year but can the Minister clarify if this is the case?  If it is not the case, is it sustainable to decrease funding for local road improvements and maintenance?  Only six months ago, the CEO of Louth County Council told us the situation with regard to local roads funding was so dire that the council needed to prioritise which potholes to fill in.  The world and his brother know there is a serious lack of funding for local roads and their maintenance not just in Louth, but right across the State.  I am not just talking about potholes but road safety measures at junctions and all the other necessary works that need to be carried out, whether they relate to road safety issues in rural areas or built-up and urban areas.</p> <p>  In the capital plan for public transport, there is a note about measures to improve public transport accessibility.  Can the Minister direct me to where it shows the funding identified for accessibility to public transport for people with disabilities?  In a priority question recently I raised with the Minister the difficulties encountered by people with disabilities.  He replied that he had not realised how bad it was until he started researching.  It is obvious that this has not been prioritised.  Yesterday, I received a response from the NTA to a question which the Minister had referred to that body about a particular route, though this applies right across the State.  On this particular route, the 190 from Laytown to Drogheda, wheelchair users are very often left at the side of the road, watching the public bus drive on without them.  The NTA's response was disappointing, to say the least, and shameful at worst.  It stated that double-decker buses may be assigned to the route.  That does not take this matter seriously or treat it as a priority.  Will the Minister go back to wheelchair users in Louth and east Meath and ask them if they mind sitting at the side of the road for another six months or 12 months until the NTA takes this matter seriously?</p><p>If there are double-decker buses that are wheelchair-accessible, which there clearly are, as the NTA has suggested, it could switch a double-decker bus back onto this route.  Can the Minister intervene to see to it that this is done in Louth and east Meath and in other areas across the State where there are similar problems with wheelchair accessibility?<br/><br/>Other Deputies raised the question of the Ardee N52 bypass.  Some &euro;5.3 million has already been spent on this for land acquisition and surveying but the funding has not been included in the capital plan.  The initial stages are complete and ready to go.  Can the Minister say whether it will be included in the capital programme?  People in Ardee say that Ardee is a bypass, as it is bypassed for everything, but they have been fighting for this for years.<br/><br/>The other issue is the R150 spine road from Laytown to Bettystown.  The Minister said this was included in the capital funding plan, but Meath County Council seems not to be 100% sure.  Can he confirm whether the funding has been allocated and is ready to be given out, and that there is no delay?<br/><br/>There was an article in <i>The Irish Independent</i>this morning about the number of used cars imported from the UK.  There was an increase of 1,000 in the first five months of this year, bringing the figure up to 3,442.  This flags up problems in regard to road safety, particularly in view of the slack regulations.  I understand there was to be legislation to deal with this.  Where is that legislation?  Does the Minister intend to speed it up?  This is a huge increase in imported cars.  Many of these cars are not roadworthy and many are death traps so we need to take it seriously and prioritise legislation to deal with it.</p></speech>

The new D&aacute;il arrangements aimed to ensure we did not end up trying to be in two places at once.  I am, unfortunately and fortunately, on the Business Committee, which meets at 10.30 a.m.  I may get back but, as roads and public transport are the major component of the budget, I wanted to focus on these areas.  Does the Minister see the balance between the spend on roads and public transport changing substantially in the future?  We need good roads to provide bus services and to move goods and people, but our climate obligations will have a dramatic impact on our approach to this sector.  They will have an impact on agriculture and the built environment, too, but transport will have to carry a heavier load by virtue of its conflicts with agriculture.</p> <p>  I wish to drill down into some of the items in the documentation.  My first question relates to public transport.  One of the reasons there was investment in the link between Heuston Station and the Phoenix Park was that the railway order in respect of the DART underground was not proceeded with.</p><p>That is the real game-changer in terms of public transport in the greater Dublin area.  It is estimated to grow public transport usage to 100 million passenger journeys a year.  It is an expensive project but when one starts factoring in the resultant savings over the decades, for example, congestion, accident rates, insurance costs and productivity, is it really possible to avoid undertaking that project?  What efforts are being made to see if funding can be obtained for that project, even from sources such as the European Investment Bank?  There is a need to square the circle of trying to keep the deficit to the permitted levels and the debt in compliance with euro rules that are substantially imposed on Ireland.  We also have obligations, such as climate change obligations, that we cannot fulfil unless we have the money to invest in fairly large initiatives in major urban centres.  The DART underground would be the critical project in the greater Dublin area but if we are to grow cities at a regional level, like Galway and Cork, there will have to be a greater focus on public transport and much of that will involve capital investment.  Where will such capital investment come from?  Is that being factored in?  Where will that be positioned in regard to the sectoral plans, one of which will come from the Department?  There is a conflict between the obligations we have signed up to as a member state of the European Union and fulfilling those obligations through having the wherewithal to provide the alternatives.  Obviously, that is something we must see in budgeting in future years to a much greater degree.</p><p> On investment in public transport fleet replacement, one of the issues that came to light locally - I am sure the same is happening elsewhere - was the inadequacy in the rail rolling stock where there are peak-time deficiencies.  In fact, it is putting passengers off using rail services where that is obviously the most efficient way of transporting them.  I presume there has been some modelling of the needs, even with the existing services for DART, Arrow and the other suburban services.</p><p> On the subvention to CIE, when one considers the need to grow the numbers using public transport, the cost of transport is cropping up as an issue and adds to the issue of the cost of living.  It is difficult to see how the Minister will live within those budgets if there are continued wage demands.  I wonder what the attitude will be to further subventions, as would be the case in other European countries, such as Italy, France and Spain, which invest heavily in public transport.  The public transport in such countries is well used but it receives subventions.  We are certainly not one of the countries that invests out of line.  In fact, we are one of the countries with a low subvention in public transport, which is picked up in the cost of living for passengers.</p><p> It is not the case that there is a reduction in the amount for road maintenance.  There was a dramatic reduction in the early stages following the economic crash and I recall some of the local authority officials talking about sweating an asset.  There is a point beyond which that is advisable.  Has the Minister information on the point where it becomes even more expensive to carry out repairs, where one allows the asset to become a significant liability?  The former Minister, Mr. P&aacute;draig Flynn, when roads were the responsibility of the then Department of the Environment, famously declared war on potholes.  So bad had the under-investment been, it became a dominate issue.  What analysis has been done on the condition of primary, secondary and regional roads?</p><p> On road fatalities, a decade and a half ago a mechanism was put in place to undertake a cost-benefit analysis.  That was the mechanism that was used when, for example, road deficiencies were deemed to be a contributory factor in road fatalities.  Is that cost-benefit analysis model still as robust as it was in the past?  It seems horrible to say, but I am aware that the cost of a life formed part of the analysis.  There may well have been changes.  Has that changed in recent years?  Such fatalities are mapped and one can see, for example, the kind of collisions that happen and the contributory factors in those road fatalities.  Sometimes fatalities are due to road conditions, while on other occasions they obviously occur as a result of driver behaviour or other factors.  That matter is one which is specific to the Department.  I would be interested to hear whether that is being examined or whether it needs to be examined.</p><p> The number of passengers using Leap cards is growing and that goes back into the cost of transport.  Is it intended to do further work there or is the Minister satisfied with the good progress?  Consumers are looking to their pockets and the Leap card is obviously a positive for regular transport users.</p></speech>

The 2016 breakdown shows a 43% spend on roads and a 35% spend on public transport.  The answer to the Deputy's question, of course, is that both of them need a great deal more funding.  I certainly would be open to ideas on that but the Deputy is really saying public transport needs more funding and that the roads are getting a great deal.  I would agree with her.  We are very short of funding in the Department because infrastructure is so incredibly important in the long term.  It was Deputy Munster who mentioned that and who stated that we must take long-term decisions because short-term decisions are not any good.  The Deputy correctly stated that short-term decisions are more expensive.</p><p>In both these cases, long-term funding is needed.  If you give to one, you take from the other.  It is a difficult decision.  I do not know.  I would certainly consider that but my main thrust will be to go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ask for larger sums for capital investment overall.  I think he is fairly sympathetic to that ambition.  He seems to have singled out transport when he spoke about the additional money and the extra fiscal space.  He has always specifically mentioned the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as one of his top three priorities.  He appreciates that having previously served as Minister in the Department.</p><p> I would be loath to say I want to change the relationship between those two figures because I know that the roads and infrastructure elsewhere would suffer if I did.  However, I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about public transport.  I know she is committed to public transport and that it will be necessary - particularly in Dublin, where there is terrible congestion - to improve the capital investment in it.  The proposal for the DART underground was put in the deep freeze in 2010.  It is now in the fridge.  There is every intention of its being a project.  It is being designed and kept alive and will certainly be eligible for EU funding.  We must not lose sight of that project along with metro north and others.  If funds became available, the timetable for that and the DART underground should be looked at anew because they are so important.  I do not know whether we have an analysis of the economics of the side benefits the Deputy mentioned.  I will ask the Department about that afterwards.  It is certainly long term.</p><p> The Department examines the big-ticket items regularly.  It changed and updated its capital appraisal rules this year for that very reason to examine the relationships between these spending items and I hope we may come up with changes.  We should be coming up with them all the time in any event.  It is not something that should be set in stone because of the changing demands in the areas of transport and roads.  It would be wrong for me to say we are going to change it and spend more on public transport and less on roads because that would have detrimental effects elsewhere but I will keep it under constant review.  The interesting point here is whether we should be making big decisions of that nature.  Perhaps we should but I do not want to make any promises about that now.</p><p> We do have serious climate change obligations and the amount given to sustainable transport initiatives, &euro;14 million, is too small.  We will certainly have to give serious consideration to that.  We will be under pressure from overseas to do so.  Our commitment to our emissions targets needs to be stepped up.  I will review all of these matters over the summer.  I do not want to do anything too dramatic in the first three to five months because it would probably be premature and I do not know enough about the subject.  I will review this relationship and other similar matters, perhaps in the autumn, because they certainly should be reviewed.  </p><p> They may go against many of my instincts but subventions are here to stay.</p><p>They increased by 13% this year.  They are absolutely essential for those who are left out by the system.  Public transport should not be completely dictated by the market.  If we are looking for changes in the semi-State organisations, particularly in the subventions to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, CIE and the subsidiaries, we should look for more efficiencies.  There are areas where there is still scope for efficiencies.  It would be totally unrealistic to say that subventions are going to be cut much further, they have been cut very far already.  If we have a commitment to public transport, which we do, the subventions are part of that.  Unless we intend to privatise these particular semi-State bodies, which I do not, we have to accept that subventions are part of that landscape.  The size may vary from time to time but certainly they are here to stay for the near future.  </p><p> I will ask Mr. Mullaney to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the under-investment in road repairs.  </p></speech>

In 2007 national roads got &euro;1.75 billion and that was down to approximately &euro;420 million in 2015.  Regional and local roads were getting over &euro;600 million and the initial figure for this year was just around &euro;300 million.  There have been substantial drops.  The capital programme does envisage an increase again but that will not happen until 2018.  There has been analysis of the effects of deferring works on a road.  If a road needs repairs and they are deferred five years the cost can increase 18 times.  There is international research on all of those matters.</p> <p>  In respect of speed limits there is a lower accident rate on motorways, which has contributed to a fall in deaths, but sometimes speeds go up on the bypassed roads.  There is an exercise going on with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to better match the speed limits on national roads.  That is being done in conjunction with the councils.</p></speech>

The relationship should be changed by 2022.  It will be moving in the direction the Deputy suggests.</p> <p>  The Leap card is spectacularly successful.  It is a fantastic achievement.  I do not have the figures in front of me but there has been a massive increase in the past year.  We should congratulate Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on that.  It gets a lot of stick for many things, probably quite rightly but the Leap card is extremely successful and consumers are very happy with it.</p></speech>

I will provide Deputy Mullaney with more specific figures after the meeting.  The overall figure for accessibility for bus stops, rail improvements and an accessible bus fleet has improved quite a lot.  It is within the public transport safety and development infrastructure figure.  It has increased substantially, from &euro;135 million to &euro;207 million.</p> <p>  I cannot provide the Deputy with specific figures on the Laytown to Drogheda route.  There is no delay in the project.</p></speech>

It requires a CPO.  Some funding has been provided in the current year.  Before the project can begin, the CPO needs to be achieved.  It is not being delayed because of a lack of funding.  Once the CPO process has been completed and if and when the project gets approval from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it can go ahead.  There is a small scoping exercise going on because the initial figure was lower than what is currently estimated.  That is not delaying the project.</p> <p>  The Ardee bypass is not in the capital plan but I imagine it is one that Transport Infrastructure Ireland will put forward as part of any review in 2017.  The latter is buying land and has probably procured a lot of it at this stage.</p></speech>

I have the reply here.  I will revert to him.  I have only just read it.  I am quite happy to contact the NTA on his behalf if he wants me to do so and if it is appropriate.  I have not had time to read the reply.</p> <p>  On a general level, we had an exchange about this in the D&aacute;il.  I do not want to refer to specifics because I do not have the facts at my fingertips, but there are areas of accessibility which need to be accelerated countrywide.  There are gaps in accessibility and public transport which need to be filled.  I will examine the issue in a meaningful and serious way.  It seems that in some areas some buses are fully equipped but others are not.  I understand that only 5% of taxis are wheelchair accessible. The Deputy is correct in saying there are gaps.  I will revert to him on the specifics.</p><p> The Deputy asked about legislation on write-offs.  I answered a question on this earlier.  The intention is to introduce a Bill before the D&aacute;il recess if the Attorney General clears the amendments.  Some of the comments in newspapers today were not completely accurate, but I take the point.  Write-offs are a problem and it is unacceptable that they can be back on roads, especially as they may cause accidents.  It is a problem we have acknowledged and are addressing.  It is to be hoped it will be dealt with in legislation before the summer recess, but if not, then very soon afterwards.</p></speech>

I understood from what I read in the newspapers that he would be more progressive.</p> <p>  I do not want to be too parochial.  When I came into public life, one of the major issues was the trans-European road network, which was a motorway from Belfast to Rosslare and Cork to Rosslare.  It was a priority project in the late 1990s.  Does the Minister have a timeframe for the project?  It is fine to have lovely motorways between Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Dublin, but there is no connectivity in the western seaboard.  The road network from Cork to Limerick and Limerick to Galway has not been completed.  It is having a serious effect on local economies in terms of economic growth.</p> <p>  In recent weeks, the Minister said in the Seanad that he has no timeframe for the M20 from Cork to Limerick.  It is an issue in Munster.  It may appear to be a local issue, but it has an impact on the national economy and the western seaboard.  Can we implement some town bypasses?  Perhaps a Lego job could be done, and the motorway could be completed at a later stage.  I know money is a major issue, and I am sure we will go down the PPP route, but I am concerned about the western economy and that its growth is being hindered by not having infrastructure to enable people to travel from Cork to Mayo and Donegal.</p> <p>  I am taken aback by the Minister's statement that there has been an increase in young people drink driving.  I am shocked.  I understood the problem with young drivers is that they are on the roads at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. doing doughnuts at the crossroads or even motorways - when I drive to Dublin I can see circles on the roads.  I would like a breakdown of the data on fatal crashes.  Rural Ireland is suffering.  In terms of crime scenes in rural Ireland, if there are more garda&iacute; present does that mean more people have been caught or that there are fewer robberies? </p></speech>

I have felt very strongly about the issue for a long time.  We are trying to get a number of projects over the line in Kerry.  When the Government is finished in Louth, the Minister is welcome to come to south Kerry when, it is to be hoped, the south Kerry greenway will be up and running</p><p>Would the Department consider a programme for greenways?  Greenways are expensive from the initial planning stage to delivery, as there are access issues, purchase orders and bureaucratic red tape.  I have spotted another option.  We have a major network of tertiary and local roads, and the maintenance of these roads is seen as a burden on the State.  May I suggest that local authorities be invited to put together an engineering proposal to identify how one would get from A to B using these roads and thereby create priority cycle routes using existing quiet country roads that are rarely used?  One might need funding to take away some sharp bend or junction where sight distance needs to be improved, improve road surfaces and reduce speed limits to 50 km/h<b>. </b>This would be a way of delivering an amenity at a much lower cost than greenways and would turn what is traditionally seen as a negative into an opportunity.<br/><br/>In respect of the capital plan, I concur with Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks about the M20, connecting the two main cities of the south, Cork and Limerick.  I would like to see the capital plan reviewed earlier, if possible.  The upgrading of the N22 Ballyvourney-Macroom road has been announced in the capital plan.  Is this seen as a priority project, given how far the proposal has come in terms of being almost shovel-ready?<br/><br/>In the early 1970s there were more than 600 road fatalities per annum, a shocking figure.  At the time, certain safety measures would have been viewed as culturally unacceptable, but today it is seems incredible that these measures were not in place at that time.  Similarly, I do not think we can be too draconian when it comes to road safety.  Are we working with our European colleagues to push new technology such as alco-locks and GPS speed monitoring technology?  The use of this technology might be viewed as a bit over the top at present, but could be seen as the norm in 15 to 20 years.  Are we keeping the use of this technology on the agenda?<br/><br/>I know the Minister cannot intervene in the insurance market, but the cost of insurance is crippling so many motorists.  There are shocking examples of the cost of insuring vehicles that are ten years or older.  It has come to my attention that returning emigrants get no credit for their driving experience abroad, and their insurance cover is very expensive as they cannot avail of a no-claims bonus.  It is no way to treat returning emigrants, particularly those who were forced to leave because of the economic catastrophe.  They are now being punished on the double.  Could the Minister, together with the Minister for Finance, engage with the insurance industry to try to achieve progress in reducing costs?<br/><br/>Farmers may have to cross roads to get their animals from one part to another part of the farm.  The cost of constructing an underpass on regional and national secondary roads is significant.  I wonder whether the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Environment, Community and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and the Marine could co-fund, with each Department putting up 25% and the farmer putting up 25%, so that what is an unaffordable &euro;40,000 project would become an affordable &euro;10,000 project.  It is a pro-road-safety measure.  It makes it easier for the farmer to put the infrastructure in place, and everybody benefits.  It would be a stimulus to construction.  Would the Minister consider such a proposal?<br/><br/>The number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, particularly taxis, is very low.  I know the NTA has set long-term targets for 100% compliance by 2040.  At present there needs to be greater incentives for taxis to retrofit their vehicles.  In Killorglin, County Kerry, a wheelchair user cannot get a taxi, and I know a man who is housebound during the winter months.  Even in a town the size of Killarney I know of a person who finds it incredibly difficult just to get out of his house because of the lack of availability of suitable transport.<br/><br/>&quot;Prime Time&quot; raised the issue of devices to regulate diesel emissions.  Members may have come across it.  Will efforts be made to tackle this in forthcoming legislation?</p></speech>

The Minister is correct that it is extremely important that both are funded.  Given our geography, we have major road infrastructure that needs to be maintained and requires a high level of funding.  We also need to increase funding for public transport because of the serious capacity issues.  Thankfully, more people are back at work but we now have an issue with the capacity of public transport.  One can see in the capital programme that large scale investment in public transport will not happen for a minimum of three to four years.  Is there an opportunity to borrow from Europe to invest in public transport when interest rates are at an incredibly low rate?  By doing so, we would increase our capacity and ensure we have a public transport system in the capital city that is fit for purpose and that will encourage people to leave their cars at home and use public transport instead.  When we increase our capacity, we increase the number of people who pay fares and generate greater revenue and we ensure that we can fund public transport in the future.  We talk about congestion but how will we get people out of their cars?  The only way to get people out of their cars is by providing an alternative.  Nobody will chose an alternative that is not fit for purpose, if it runs late or is over subscribed, resulting in people standing, waiting or queueing.  That is something that should be looked at.  How can we get the necessary funding to increase investment in public transport and increase our capacity in the capital city of Dublin?</p></speech>

The Cork to Limerick motorway, the M20, is not off the agenda, as I suspect the Deputy knows but it is hugely expensive project.  I think it is in the region of &euro;860 million, which would take up a pretty good whack of the capital budget.  I know it is necessary and it will almost certainly be included in the mid-term review next year.  I do not think the Deputy should give up hope but I do not want to give him any false hope that it will be completed immediately because of its massive size.  I am aware that it is an imperative in the area.  The message is coming through from all of his colleagues as well.  We will keep it in mind.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the Cork to Rosslare road.  I am not familiar with that but I will ask my colleague to respond.</p></speech>

Obviously, TII is doing the Gort to Tuam scheme, which is part of the Atlantic corridor, and that is progressing well.  In fact, it is due to be completed by the end of 2017.</p> <p>  As the Minister said, it was not possible to include the M20.  There was an allocation of &euro;860 million for capital plan projects and the M20 alone would have cost &euro;800 million.  It would have meant there would be no money for anything else.  What was included was a possible Mallow bypass in terms of an east-west link, which could be part of the longer term M20 project.  That is being looked at by TII.  That would bring relief to the N72, where many trucks have to go through the town.</p></speech>

We would hope it will have it later this year.  We would then be able to get a fix on whether that element could be brought forward.</p><p>However, there is provision for it in the capital plan.  If it is feasible, TII would have to start working on the acquisition of land and so forth.</p><p> With regard to the N22, the Dunkettle project is likely to go ahead of it.  TII would see that as the highest priority and it would be followed by the N22 in the Cork schemes.  Unfortunately, I cannot provide an exact timescale but I suspect it will be 2018 or 2019 before Dunkettle gets going and the N22 would follow it.</p></speech>

There was an intention at one time to bundle them as a PPP but that is not happening.  In fact, Dunkettle is proving to be a very complicated project.

I can get the Deputy a copy as it gives a good breakdown.  The only problem is that it is not up-to-date as it is for 2012.  However, we will provide the Deputy with more information and breakdown if he wishes.  It is a pretty staggering discovery that drink driving is creeping back in.  We thought there had been a culture change on it.  There is also anecdotal evidence that the number of Garda checkpoints is down, which means the numbers of convictions and discoveries of drink driving are lower than perhaps they ought to be.</p> <p>  On the question about the greenways, Chairman, where they are shovel ready, we are happy to consider them in a serious way.  There is money available to progress with them.  That is a good news story.  I will be delighted to visit.

Obviously, engineering works would be required for shared roads if one is trying to promote them as cycle routes, such as ensuring ditches are lowered for increased visibility.  These are really quiet roads that might be travelled by one tractor and two cars in a day.  Obviously, one would have to market them responsibly as priority cycle routes.  One could not let children out on roads that are too busy but there are so many of these roads around the country that any rural Deputy could identify a network of links to get from A to B through towns along these roads and do it in a much cheaper manner.  This would be where one does not have a greenway option or an old railway route or canal bank.  Council engineers around the country would have local knowledge of where this could be done very cheaply.  It should be explored, or at least the local authorities could be invited to come forward with such routes.  They could be brought forward very quickly and relatively cheaply.  It might be something worth exploring.</p></speech>

It is not my Department's responsibility, but we should take a more active interest in it.  I had a meeting with all the stakeholders in the road safety and roads areas earlier this week and we agreed that we would engage with Insurance Ireland as this requires further investigation.  We will engage with Insurance Ireland at a senior level.  I will meet its representatives and perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality as well.  It is inexplicable.  We have not received proper explanations for why premia have gone up so much in such a short time.  I do not wish to cop out of it from our Department and just hand it over to the companies.  It is primarily their responsibility, as was clear from the recent debate in the D&aacute;il.  We would have liked to have had the lead part in that but it was the Department of Finance's responsibility.  However, we will meet with the industry and challenge it on various areas because we are not happy with the situation.</p> <p>  On taxis, the low accessibility is a little staggering.  We might look at that and see if we can increase it.  It is at 5% and the target has been 30% or 35% for quite a long time.  Deputy Munster will probably be quite interested in that.  It is too slow.  It is expensive for them, so it is difficult, but we should reach to a much higher standard than this.</p></speech>

There is a demand for this as I regularly encounter farmers who want to take cattle off the road, in everybody's interest.  It is in their interest too, in terms of the labour intensity of being obliged to have two or three people out on the road rather than just one farmer bringing the cows in at mornings or evenings.  This would mainly be their concern.  From a practical point of view, if the Departments with responsibility for agriculture and transport could come together and meet the farmer part of the way, it would be a positive for everybody.  Perhaps it is something that could be considered.</p> <p>  The other matter was road safety technology such as alcolocks, GPS monitoring and the diesel emissions devices.</p></speech>

Perhaps they could identify the need to the local council first.  Obviously, this is a new idea; it is a good idea.  I am not qualified to say whether it would work, what it would cost or the like, but it appears to be fresh idea.  We will consider it without hesitation.</p> <p>  On the road safety issues, apparently the Department, through the RSA, is working at EU level to develop and study how information technology can assist safety.  The Department is working in parallel with its counterparts in the EU, so that is already happening.  The answer on alcolocks is "Yes".  Diesel filters and emissions are primarily a consumer protection and environmental matter rather than a road safety issue, but we can pass it on to the bodies concerned from the transport committee.</p></speech>

The Department is quite aggressive and quite happy to do that.</p><p>It is also looking to the European Investment Bank, EIB, in respect of the DART underground project.  I do not think we are lacking in that area.  One has to be careful when borrowing money for companies which are not in a very good state.

The allocation also part funds the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the building and renovation programme for Irish Coast Guard stations.  The Irish Coast Guard requires a strong resource commitment on the part of the Exchequer.  The SAR helicopter has seen a step change in the quality of service on offer and that will remain a priority.  Future developments in IT will also ensure that the Irish Coast Guard will remain best in class internationally.  At this point in the year, I expect to see this programme allocation fully expended.</p></speech>

The current expenditure allocation for the recently established Sport Ireland for 2016 is &euro;47 million.  This is an increase of &euro;3 million on the total current funding provided to the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority last year.  This funding will assist the national governing bodies of sports and our high-performance athletes in their preparation for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio in August and September.</p> <p>  Further funding of &euro;4.5 million is being made available for sports measures through dormant accounts funding.  The focus of this funding will be to support the implementation of the national physical activity plan in disadvantaged communities.  Sport Ireland will continue to support the community sport hubs which were piloted last year through the local sports partnerships under dormant accounts funding.  In recent years there has been an increase in the popularity of activities like walking, running, cycling and swimming.  I propose to allocate dormant accounts funding through Sport Ireland and the national governing bodies of sport for the further development of the get Ireland walking programme and the development of new get Ireland cycling, running and swimming programmes.  Investment will also be made in programmes to address the high dropout rates from sport among specific groups.</p> <p>  Almost &euro;25 million is being provided for the development of the national sports campus, including completion of phase one of the national indoor arena.  Other major components of the sports programme include the sports capital programme and the local authority swimming pools programme.  Provision has been made for the P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh redevelopment and for the Kerry sports academy in Tralee.  It is possible that spending originally envisaged for both these projects in 2016 may not happen until 2017 but it is still too early in the year to be definitive.</p></speech>

I also welcome the increase of &euro;17 million in the sports capital programme.  I note that a target of 1,200 applications was set for 2016 but, to the end of May, only 471 were approved.  Can the Minister elaborate on that?</p> <p>  Can the Minister confirm when applications for the sports capital grants will be open?  I would like a pre-validated scheme to operate as too many sporting clubs are losing out on grants due to simple errors in their initial applications.  This is a vital source of funding for many sporting organisations and it has been a great success in the past.  When one fills in an application online, one does not know if it is valid or invalid.  In County Louth, there are a large number of sporting clubs that depend solely on grants and they are all looking for some funding at the moment.  Is there some way we can find out if there is a problem with an application before the closing date?  This would give clubs another opportunity to submit their applications.</p></speech>

I do not know whether that is a memory or wishful thinking on my behalf, but I thought I read it somewhere.  Is that part of an increased allocation that will come under the new sports capital programme?  The Minister indicated that it will be the new year before the sports capital programme is rolled out.  That could be part of 2017's figure.</p> <p>  I am straying off the Estimates, but in the light of a number of our world-class golfers deciding to opt out of going to Rio to represent Ireland at the Olympics, has the Minister a concern relating to the Zika virus in Brazil?  We could have a situation where other athletes opt out, not just from the golfing fraternity, although certainly Katie Taylor is not going to opt out, judging by her tweet.  On a serious note, is there a real and genuine concern on the part of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that other athletes will be forced out?  Has the Department had any contact or consultation with the authorities in Brazil or the authorities running the Olympics to ensure that the safety of our athletes travelling there is of paramount concern?  Of course, it is not only athletes travelling, but also spectators and supporters.  What level of engagement has the Department embarked on?</p></speech>

My Minister of State will consult with the Chief Medical Officer to see what the health dangers are.  The World Health Organization has made some very reassuring noises about this.

The sports application grants are not happening this year.  Why is that the case?  I know that many clubs across the State have been watching anxiously for the announcement in order that they might make applications.  In reading the programme this morning, I ask: was that a deliberate decision by the Department?  Was the focus then put on the national physical activity plan, rather than the availability of grants through sports clubs?  Why is it not available this year?  What was the amount due to be available?  Will that be added on next year?</p></speech>

It has gone up from &euro;25,500 to &euro;42,200, so it has increased by &euro;16,700.</p><p>I am sorry I should have said it has gone up from &euro;25.5 million to &euro;42.2 million, so it has gone up by &euro;16.7 million, which is an increase of 65%.  That is a pretty good increase. </p><p> I do not think any decision has been made about the date of the sports allocation grants at this stage, but it is likely to be early in the new year.  I would not be certain of it.</p></speech>

Clubs make grant applications, some of which are successful.  It can then take quite a period of time to draw down the funding because they have to make local arrangements in order to be eligible to draw down the funding and put contracts in place to have the work done.  As the Minister said, the money to be handed out to local clubs has been increased this year in light of the previous calls that have been made.  The intention this year is to focus on helping clubs to use up the allocations that they have received and then to reopen the scheme, as the Minister said, in the new year.  The Department is anxious that the issue with absorption of funds is addressed.  As the other Deputy said these are small clubs and they have to put a great deal of voluntary effort into ensuring they draw down the funding.</p> <p>  The work on the national physical activity plan would have been quite distinct from the work on the sports capital grants.   </p></speech>

Are the sports grants made available every year?  Do clubs apply for them every year or every second year?  Is this the first year that the grants have not been-----</p></speech>

There was a lengthy period during the challenging years when no allocations were made.  There is no fixed period.  There have been a couple of rounds in the past two years as some funding became available.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan is proposing to the Minister, Deputy Ross that they work on putting in place a fixed period, which would make it more predictable.  It is a question of looking at how much money we have allocated and how much has been drawn down at this point in time to get a measurement of the likely absorption capacity.</p></speech>

First, I must congratulate the Irish soccer teams on the fantastic job they did in France.  Both teams, and their supporters from the Republic and Northern Ireland did their countries proud.  I was at the Euros in Poland four years ago, but I did not have the chance to go this time and I missed it.  We can all be proud of the great ambassadorial job our supporters in France did for our country.  That needs to be mentioned.  We can be very proud of what happened on and off the pitch.</p> <p>  In regard to the sports capital programme, a scheme which has one third invalidation indicates there is a problem.  I think we need to look at the process.  Deputy Fitzpatrick alluded to it earlier.  I think we should look at an early bird option, so that if a club or organisation has made its application a month or six weeks before the deadline, there could be an early deadline for those who want to get feedback to be told whether the application is valid or invalid.  At least this would give the organisation time to rectify the issue.  Alternatively a number of days could be allocated for over the counter validations to try to reduce the number of invalid applications.  One in three invalid applications is far too high.  From my meetings with those involved in the clubs, the clubs that are most annoyed are the clubs which submitted an invalid application.  Clubs can accept not get funding, as the reason could be that there was not enough to go round because the scheme had been heavily over subscribed.  Those clubs which made invalid applications feel very frustrated.  It causes a high degree of internal hassle in the club, because club secretaries and other volunteers acting in good faith have gone through the process, but for whatever reason, be it a box that was not ticked, or other reason, the application has been invalidated.</p><p>It is a difficult process to get right.  We should try to make it easier for the applicants.  That would be progress.  I think it would be better to make it an annual programme, even if one reduced the overall budget, as that would provide certainty.  There would be less rush.  Clubs that have not got their application quite ready, try to get in because they do not know if the scheme will operate for a few years.  As members know it was scrapped in the 30th D&aacute;il.  It was reintroduced in 2012, there was a programme in 2014 and 2015, but possibly not in 2016.  I think we should try to have an annual scheme, as distinct from an irregular scheme with a larger budget.</p><p> Another issue is that a large draw down has not been taken up at this stage.  There are various reasons this has not happened.  There are some clubs that will never draw down what has been allocated to them.  Could we look at incentivising clubs to write off that money if we could reassure them it will not be held against them if they waive it and return the money to the Department?  There is money tied up that could be spent on the ground.  As we all know there are clubs that badly need funding now.  I think it would be a step forward were the Department to take a proactive approach to try to claw back some of the draw down that will never be spent.</p><p> I know the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is heavily inundated.  Could the Minister liaise with his Cabinet colleagues to try to ensure that the office could be assisted because sports capital grants depend on everything being processed by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  Many of the applications are slowed down at that point in the process.  It is making it difficult for works to start on the ground.  Will the Minister consider this suggestion and raise it with his colleagues?</p></speech>

Another option is a biennial scheme that would allow time to move things forward.  I think predictability is the point more than anything else.</p> <p>  On the issue of validation, the challenge is to ensure that everybody is on the same playing field.  If one club comes in early and the invalid element is spotted whereas another club is late for no bad reason and there is no time to spot the invalidation, are they being treated equally?  At present they are opened together and compared equally.  The challenge of giving feedback is whether it will give somebody an advantage.  I know one of the focuses of moving to the online system was to have the information required for a valid application much more in people's face when they make the application.  We can bring these points to the Department.  The challenge will be how to give people feedback without giving somebody an accidental advantage to have a second bite of the cherry.</p></speech>

I have used the helpline since becoming a Deputy and find it fantastic.  The most frustrating part is that after completing one's application online, one presses a button and it is accepted.  Automatically, one thinks one is validated and that everything is fine.  However, when the sports capital grants are announced there is a list showing those who received it.  That is great for the people who get it.  There is also list showing the people whose applications were invalid and then it is too late.  As the Chairman said it causes a lot of friction within the club.  When one presses a button in the bank having completed a form and it is accepted, one thinks everything is fine.  Suddenly, one discovers that something about it is not fine.   Most of these things are very simple.  The application form is simple to fill in.  However, there are a few technical hitches that need to be sorted.  To be fair, I acknowledge that the helpline is absolutely fantastic.  Last year I had to get on the helpline almost 20 times for different applications.  </p> <p>  I agree that many applications have been submitted.  Ireland is a sporting country.  We have rugby, soccer, Gaelic, golf, everything, and that is fantastic.  All of these sporting organisations are seeking a small amount of help.  It is probably the only type of funding they can get because there are too many people seeking sponsorship.  I agree that &euro;42 million, which is a 65% increase, is a fantastic amount of money.  Being a spokesperson, I am kept informed.  People automatically think in 2016 that there will be sports capital grants.  In fairness, after this meeting there will be many disappointed clubs and societies.  If the Minister has anything in his budget, even in October, November or December, will he please make it available in 2016?  He could perhaps clarify that he will have a sports capital grant in 2016 but that the next one will be in 2018.  I think it is unfair because I am sure everybody in this room has been approached.  It is very disappointing news for many sporting organisations who discover today that there will be no sports capital grants for 2016.</p></speech>

While they are constituents of mine they are fantastic staff and have a heavy administrative burden.

It was only when I asked if it was not going to happen this year and if there was a gap year, that it was confirmed and it was not definitive.  Has that decision been taken on the sports capital grant?  Given that this is the end of June we need to know if that decision has already been taken why people were not informed.  Will the Minister look at the issue given the number of clubs that would have made application in the past and were not disappointed on just one but on several occasions?  Given the huge level of interest and dependency on the part of many clubs the length and breadth of the state, perhaps we could have some clarification on the issue.</p></speech>

There is an additional investment in 2016 of &euro;2 million in key elements of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's and Tourism Ireland's programmes along with continued capital investment next year and beyond to 2022.  This funding will enhance supports to the new experience brands of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin: A Breath of Fresh Air, provide funding needed for the Rugby World Cup 2023 and increase overseas marketing activities in key destination markets.  Within the overall additional investment of &euro;2 million, half will be used in the allocation for overseas tourism marketing activity.  This is the first increase in the funding since 2008, and will enable our strong overseas marketing campaigns to continue in our key target markets and help ensure that our ambitious targets for further growth are met.</p> <p>  On the impact of the Brexit vote, I would like to make a few quick comments.  The vote has clear implications for the tourism sector, given the relative importance of the British market.  It should also be noted that, while the British market accounts for 40% of overseas visit numbers, it accounts for around 25% of the total associated revenue from overseas visits.  This is due to the fact that visitors from further afield generally tend to stay longer when on holidays here.  Even prior to the referendum result, there was a commitment in the tourism policy statement to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.</p> <p>  Tourism Ireland is monitoring the situation in Britain and has been in contact with relevant players, including members of the central marketing partnership group.  Tourism Ireland's chief executive officer is travelling to London this week to meet key industry figures there and has been in contact with organisations such as VisitBritain, the European Tour Operators' Association and UK Inbound as well as long haul tour operators to the UK.  On the back of these consultations, Tourism Ireland will decide on what further actions, if any, are required in the short term.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that at the moment there are no planned changes to how people can travel between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.  In his response to the referendum result, the Taoiseach committed the Government to doing its utmost in upcoming discussions to maintain the common travel area and minimise any possible disruptions to the flow of people between the islands.</p> <p>  It is also important to state here that there are no changes to how North-South bodies, including Tourism Ireland, operate.  Again, the Taoiseach's statement made it clear that the maintenance of the strong spirit of partnership that has developed since the Good Friday Agreement will be a priority for the Government.</p></speech>

It is important that we clarify the budget in light of the recent referendum in the United Kingdom.  I am disappointed that there was no increase in the overall budget.  I urge the Minister to increase the budget for marketing to attract more visitors from overseas.  It should be noted that we will be facing stiff competition from the United Kingdom and in particular from Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I am also disappointed that north Louth, including the Cooley peninsula, Carlingford and Dundalk, was not fully included in Ireland's Ancient East initiative.  I would appreciate if the Minister could look into the reason that happened.</p> <p>  I note the success of the Great Western Greenway.  We spoke earlier about a proposal for an eastern greenway that would incorporate Blackrock, Dundalk and Carlingford in County Louth.  I appeal to the Minister to try to invest as much as we can into cycle greenways.</p></speech>

I welcome the discussion on Programme E as it is an important section of the overall budget.  It generates significant revenue for the Exchequer because tourists spend money in Ireland.</p> <p>  The Minister rightly identified Brexit as an area of concern.  I think it is more than a concern.  The vast majority of tourists to Ireland are from the United Kingdom.</p><p>In the past number of years, the reason more and more people came from the United Kingdom - this is not to diminish the good work done by F&aacute;ilte Ireland on promotional campaigns and the Wild Atlantic Way - was the favourable exchange rate.  It was cheaper to holiday in Ireland than it was to holiday in parts of the United Kingdom.  I have statistics that show that a significant percentage of the tourists from the United Kingdom in 2014 and 2015 were first-time tourists who came because of the favourable exchange rate.  With the fall in sterling, visiting Ireland will not be as financially advantageous for UK tourists.  In addition, there is political and economic instability in the United Kingdom and this will obviously lead to fewer people coming here.  </p><p> Tourism Ireland has &euro;34 million to promote 23 key markets.  The priority markets are USA and the United Kingdom.  Do we need to consider promoting our tourism offering in other markets to try to compensate for the obvious drop in tourist numbers from the United Kingdom?  I would welcome the Minister's opinion on that.</p><p> The Wild Atlantic Way was a good initiative, and now there is Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin: A Breath of Fresh Air.  Where do we stand in regard to marketing the midlands?  The area between the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East is right up along the middle of Ireland.  There does not seem to be a strategy, a policy or a marketing programme in terms of marketing the lakes district.  There is so much to offer, including the waterways of counties Longford, Westmeath, Cavan and Fermanagh.  Is there a programme in place?  What happens is that when a community group or local authority is not in a particular targeted area, be it the Wild Atlantic Way or Ireland's Ancient East, they cannot avail of funding because they are not deemed to be in the priority areas.  Could the Minister indicate the intention in this regard?</p><p> Five or six years ago every county had a tourist officer working in collaboration with the local authority to promote the notable places of interest that would attract tourists to that county.  That has been gradually eroded.  Is it the intention to re-establish the collaboration between Tourism Ireland and the local authorities and to fund a tourist officer in each local authority?</p></speech>

Our landmarks and heritage sites are not very prominent.  I asked about St. Laurence's Gate as the gateway to Ireland's Ancient East and the Minister referred my question to Bord F&aacute;ilte.</p> <p>  In regard to the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin: A Breath of Fresh Air, what level of funding was allocated to each of those projects and how was it allocated?</p><p>We talk about North-South tourism.  There was an initiative, which was progressing very well, in regard to a geopark or geotourism for Slieve Gullion and the Cooley Peninsula.</p></speech>

It was an initiative for a geopark and geotourism in what is a hugely significant scenic area from Slieve Gullion down to the Cooley Peninsula.  Progress had been made through the North-South bodies and cross-Border groups and while everything had been bedded down and was ready to go in the Slieve Gullion area, it appears that Louth County Council pulled the project from this end of the county.  No significant reason was given for that other than that the consultation with the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, was problematic but there did not appear to be any evidence of consultation.  There was certainly no evidence that it was problematic.  Much to its shock, the cross-Border committee was informed only recently that it was not going ahead because this is an area of majestic beauty and it is hugely significant if we are talking about all-Ireland and cross-Border tourism.  Will the Minister ask the questions about this because the group is not getting too many answers?  Everything was in place from the Slieve Gullion and south Armagh end but the plug was pulled from the Louth end.  What happened is unacceptable.  It would generate tourism and revenue in that area at a time when we are trying to encourage walking and similar aspects of tourism.  We only have to see the number of tourists who travel to Ireland now for walking holidays.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-29a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016062900002#JJ00400"><p>The value of sterling was part of the reason many people found Ireland to be a cost-effective holiday.  It certainly would have been a factor in people deciding to come here but we should not see as the sole reason.  It was useful to us that a cohort of people living in Britain came here for their holidays, possibly for the first time.  We need to deepen that relationship not only from the point of view of them looking at the cost of the holiday but also in terms of what the visit offers them.</p> <p>  With regard to cultural tourism, I was surprised by the extent of the feedback on the investment in the areas of arts, heritage and culture, which was a factor in people coming here.  I am sure analysis has been done on the return on that investment, so even though we are discussing the budget, we should not assume that people will only make a decision to come here based on economic grounds.  We should start looking beyond that to areas that will encourage them to come here.  We will always be prone to swings in that regard, which will probably occur at the wrong time, unless we look beyond that.  Arts and culture are a very big factor and we should see them as more than just an after-thought but rather as areas that are central to this particular sector.</p> <p>  In terms of the film industry, when President Michael D. Higgins was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, great benefit flowed from the effort that was put into the film industry because people saw the images.  It was a marketing tool in its own right and demonstrates what I am trying to say.</p> <p>  One of the other issues is the preferential 9% VAT rate, which I do not believe was entirely necessary.  I do not believe there is a way of doing it other than universally applying it.</p><p>It would be nice to have that as a benefit now to act as a counterbalance but we do not have it.  I am not sure the 9% is a very clever idea in terms of some sectors.  For example, the fast food sector benefits from the 9% VAT rate, whereas we would be far better to collect the full VAT from it and reinvest it into the arts and culture sector, which would give a return.  Is that something the Minister would consider?</p><p> Not all of the country could be said to be in the same position.  I take the point that was made about areas outside major urban centres.  A different approach is probably needed in different parts of the country.  I am not sure a very localised approach works, having experienced it at local government level, because one has a very small budget and I am not sure the impact is that beneficial.  A more regional approach is likely to give a better return.  We must stop thinking small in terms of appealing to people and having borders that are almost irrelevant.  People who come from other countries do not notice when they move from Dublin into Kildare or from Meath into Louth.  We must start to think the way tourists think.  We must think bigger in terms of the return on marketing.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thinking in that regard.</p><p> I will be slightly cheeky given that I was at another meeting but could I ask the Minister about the swimming pool programme, which was commenced earlier this year?  Only two pool applications were deemed to be valid.  The one that was considered an outlier, that was expected to qualify, was a pool in north Kildare but the county council did not cover itself in glory in the application process.  Is the grant still available if an application meets the criteria?</p></speech>

Now, one of our main pillars is tourism and economic development.  We have changed our focus and work for the benefit of communities in County Cork.</p> <p>  Overall, I compliment the tourism organisations on the Wild Atlantic Way initiative.  Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East is also a great idea.  I am pleased the previous Government acknowledged the importance of extending the area further west into Cork, Limerick and parts of Tipperary.  The change was welcome.  As Deputy Troy stated, there is a perception that parts of the country are not being marketed, for example, the lake district, and I support him in his request in that regard.</p> <p>  Brexit is a big talking point.  It is impacting already because the currency exchange rate is sliding the wrong way in terms of attracting investment inwards in terms of tourists.  I am concerned in that regard.  It is fine to say that people are being sent to market us abroad but does that mean we will have to bring down our costs in this country to attract more people to come here because of the exchange rate?</p> <p>  When is the announcement expected on whether this country has been successful in its bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023?</p></speech>

Before I wrap up, I wish to raise a few issues.  I know we say it every year but this year, in particular, with the fall in sterling, holidaying at home is something we must really push in order to make up for any shortfall that might result from a drop in the number of UK visitors.</p> <p>  The 9% VAT rate was probably the most pro-rural policy of any Government in a long time and its benefit extended to every single community.  I agree that it is a crude instrument in that one cannot pick and choose where one applies it but in the aftermath of the Brexit vote and the reduced strength of sterling, it is more crucial than ever that we would hold onto it.  I accept it is more effective in some areas than others but it is something that benefits every community in the country.</p><p>On the UK market, we need to build on the wonderful exposure that we got on Sunday from "Top Gear" on the BBC.  I remember that when I wrote to the BBC two years ago, inviting them to film "Top Gear" on the Wild Atlantic Way in Kerry, people laughed at me.  It happened.  It is the most watched TV programme in the world.  We really need to follow up that screening with an intensive marketing campaign in the UK to remind people where "Top Gear" was, that they have seen it before and that it is only a ferry away.  Chris Evans has done the country a massive service through his radio show, which has millions of listeners, by highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way and what he saw when he came here to film "Top Gear".  The agencies need to follow up and remind consumers in the UK and around the world about "Top Gear" and maybe liaise with the BBC about using for marketing purposes the footage it broadcast, because it was beautifully shot.  It was a wonderful opportunity for Ireland, particularly for the Wild Atlantic Way.  There is a massive opportunity to build on this and market the Wild Atlantic Way as an all-year-round destination, as something to do in the winter as much as in the summer, to try to fill up some of the ceiling space in the shoulder months.  I have always felt that the Wild Atlantic Way is more spectacular and invigorating in January than in July.  We need to push this slogan, "The wilder the better," to try to gain full-year, 12-month employment along it.  There is massive potential for us to do that and to market it on a global basis.</p><p> The Department also needs strongly to consider an urgent follow-up to the Gathering.  It was a great success and a catalyst for increased tourism activity in 2013.  It is timely that we follow it up with something similar to get things moving again.  Word of mouth is probably the strongest marketing tool there is, but we need to keep that going.  We can now build on the success of recent years with follow-ups like that.</p><p> Finally, the travel tax was a positive initiative.  It needs to be maintained from a budgetary point of view.  It has certainly paid for itself many times over.  It is important for us to keep that.</p></speech>

A lot of them were comments, which are equally useful, to be honest, to hear what members' views are.  Let me deal with Deputy Fitzpatrick's first.  He talked about some of the cutbacks and the lack of funding in various areas.  The tourism marketing fund went up by &euro;1 million this year.  On 8 June the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy O'Donovan, launched the new F&aacute;ilte Ireland capital investment support for large tourism projects, which will provide a pool of &euro;65 million in investment to develop new, or boost existing, tourist experiences or attractions across Ireland.  That scheme will run from 2016 to 2020.  The Government's capital programme provides for &euro;125 million in expenditure.  We are not starving the funding , but Deputy Fitzpatrick is right that it is and probably will remain tight.  This is a good news story.  We have done incredibly well, despite the cutbacks.  Yesterday's tourism figures, which were published in the newspapers today, were better again and very encouraging.  I hope we can continue it, despite what Deputy Troy quite rightly points out as the Brexit intervention.  It is extremely serious if it continues, because of the exchange rate, which he identified.  Nobody can tell how long the exchange rate will be low for.  The initial response is yes, the collapse of sterling in the last few days will damage the fact that 40% of our tourists come from the UK, although they spend only 25% of the money spent here.  That is a serious prospect for us and something we must recognise.</p><p>Exchange rates are difficult to predict.  There is no reason to believe that they may not recover.  In fact, I heard this morning that we need to be careful about assuming it will remain that way.  Markets are very unpredictable.  I heard one of the so-called market experts this morning say exchange rates will bounce back.  We want to watch them carefully, but of course it is a serious situation.  They may go down further.</p><p> I presume that the answer to this is along the lines of the sensible suggestions Deputy Murphy offered about cultural tourism and other such areas that would not directly relate to people's pockets.  The fact that it will be cheaper for them is not necessarily the only reason people come here.  They may come because we offer products that appeal to a certain sector or group of people in the UK who have not visited before.  It is imperative that we and the agencies immediately recognise that we might need to go in search of other markets.  I suspect that we ought to go to areas where the currency is stronger.  We should look at that as well.  Once sterling falls, presumably the dollar will go up and other currencies will rise against the euro.  We can certainly look that way.  I am not an expert on this, but we have to do some very hard thinking about it.  The success story will end if Brexit has the worst effects on tourism that we fear.  Let us hope it does not, but I am sure it is something the agencies already recognise.  I was with one of them in Paris on Friday and what they said was really encouraging.  The Chairman touched on it just now.  They said that it is staggeringly difficult, but look at the soccer players.  They are sending out a fantastic message already to the world that Irish people are friendly and dynamic.  That is hugely positive, even in the midst of this crisis.  I would not regard it as doomsday, but it is serious.  The agencies have to react, but I think they are and taking advantage of something that has already appeared, totally coincidentally.</p><p> On Deputy Troy's point, I suppose the midlands do not necessarily feel part of the great success of the Wild Atlantic Way and some of the other projects such as Ireland's Ancient East, but the midlands certainly have a great deal to offer.  The lakeland district was particularly identified as a target area in the programme for Government.  We have already mentioned greenways, which will be very big and attractive selling points for the midlands.  The greenway opened between Mullingar and Athlone last year.  There have been developments in other areas.  I do not think that there is any reason for despair.  Maybe the fact that the Wild Atlantic Way has been the flagship project means that other areas of the country feel left out, but I do not think there is any intention to neglect the midlands.  People realise that Athlone and other areas throughout the midlands have an enormous amount to offer.  They will be and have to be promoted.</p></speech>

A whole section of amenities and tourist attractions right from the north to the south along the middle of our country, which we happen to fall into, feel neglected by the lack of a national policy.  As the Minister said, we are quite fortunate because we have a greenway that will link up with the Wild Atlantic Way, so it is not a major concern locally, but there are counties along the middle of the country that feel excluded.  Dublin has been identified on its own with A Breath of Fresh Air, there is Ancient East on the east coast and there is the west coast.  A whole section of the middle of Ireland feels that it is not part of a marketing strategy.</p><p>Deputy Murphy was correct when she said we cannot have counties competing against each other.  They need to work in collaboration.  An overall policy is needed for a section of our country.</p></speech>

Maybe we could suggest one or persuade the agencies that there could be a common theme in those counties which the Deputy has suggested might be neglected, although I do not think they are that neglected.  It might be a way to market those counties, such as using greenways or something else.  I am just thinking about this in my head.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is something we could work on as a committee as part of our work programme and identify it as a particular aim of ours to try to fill that vacuum.</p></speech>

It is a matter of selling it.  There may be too many themes at the moment and we do not want to confuse people but it certainly has a specific and particular attraction which I am sure would appeal to people.  Ireland's lakes have a huge range of activities to offer, such as fishing, and it could work.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Munster's reference to Slieve Gullion and the Cooley Peninsula, I believe that is a local authority decision.  The Deputy can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe it is a situation where we cannot prejudge what the local authority will say or do.  However, I am trying to think of a way through that.  It is a very specific problem which we could probably address.  Perhaps the Deputy could forward a summary of the problem and I could deal with it.  It is probably a particular position on one incidence in the detail with which I can certainly help the Deputy, but I am unsure if it is being repeated elsewhere.  That would be my only concern.  If the Deputy wishes me to act upon it, I will make an approach to the local authority if that is acceptable to her.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Murphy's point, her approach is great because one cannot just lie down and say, "fine, it is the currency", and forget it.  It is not and there are lots of other messages that go out and which could appeal to people.  We do not have to restrict ourselves just because the UK is the biggest customer here and naturally probably always will be, or think that just because the currency has collapsed, it will stop people coming here.  It will not because if there is cultural tourism and the film industry and all sorts of things, then we can attract people in other ways and I think that is absolutely true.  In some ways perhaps we have had it too easy and the recent currency fluctuations have worked to our advantage for a very long time.  We will need some new thinking.</p></speech>

The applicant phase is from May 2016 until September 2016.  The candidate phase is from November 2016 to June 2017, the evaluation phase is from June 2017 to November 2017 and the World Rugby class decision is November 2017.  This is a very exciting project and it is a real runner.  It will be wonderful for Ireland, tourism and the economy.  Having spoken to some of the people involved in the committee, which is headed up by some really prominent sportsmen here and the Department, there is a real enthusiasm behind this bid.  It is a realistic bid and the people involved are taking it very seriously.  It will cost a little but it will bring back much more if it works.</p><p>This is a serious bid by Ireland.  The Department considers that Ireland is really in the running for this and it would be a fantastic lift for the nation if we could pull it off, particularly after the ambassadorial role played by our footballers.  It would be a wonderful message to go across the world.  We are putting a lot of effort into the bid on which I hope to be able to report some progress fairly shortly.</p><p> With regard to VAT I was struck by the point raised by the Chairman, Deputy Griffin.  This realisation is sinking in for people, and I do not know whether the Chairman was right or wrong, but I was thinking the same way as him.  The Chairman is correct in that it looks as though it might have different kinds of regional benefits. We are seeing a situation where some of the larger hotels in Dublin are benefiting from this and are making very large sums of money.  They benefit from the lower VAT rate situation.  Despite that I am not saying it should be removed from them but maybe they do not need it as much.  Disproportionately there are people outside that group who are very dependent on the VAT rate and have rightly benefited from it.  It has given a boost to the economy, to the economy in those areas, in the smaller hospitality areas and for the smaller businesses.  There may be a case for looking at the situation in a more weighted way.  I do not know and I am not trying to say anything which is sensational.  However, it is obviously very important to people outside Dublin and it should be retained there.  Given that hotel pricing is so high in Dublin they are inviting examination on whether they should be the beneficiaries of that lower VAT rate for too long.  There is a great case to be made for holidaying at home and those points were well made.</p><p> I was impressed with the comments about "Top Gear".  Winter tourism is something we should be looking at for the future.  I hope I have covered all the points that Deputies have raised.</p></speech>

Some 30,000 travellers had their flights cancelled in one day in Ireland and 100,000 travellers the following day had their flights delayed.  Many Irish people plan to holiday over the next couple of months and this will also affect tourism into Ireland.  People travelling from all parts of Europe coming to Ireland will depend on French airspace.  Perhaps the Minister will outline what is the Government stance on the situation?  Last Saturday we watched the Ireland team playing in France; did the Minister have an opportunity to speak to somebody there about the strikes?  If it is going to continue it would be a problem for the whole summer.</p></speech>

We could be looking for an awful lot of trouble, as the Deputy can imagine.  However, he has voiced, very eloquently, the frustrations of people coming and going.  It has driven people mad.  Some people were left out of the European Cup because, having paid for flights, they were grounded on the day they had to go out which is absolutely infuriating.  However, I do not think it would be correct for me to pick up a megaphone and say anything to the French trade unions.  I am not going to do it but the situation is very annoying, frustrating and deeply regrettable for people from both countries.</p></speech>

I can give whatever information I have, which is limited, but I will probably have more next time I come or at least I will be more familiar with it.
